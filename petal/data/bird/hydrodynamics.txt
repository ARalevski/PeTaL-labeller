Gastrointestinal and renal responses to variable water intake in whitebellied sunbirds and New Holland honeyeaters
<p>Nectarivores face a constant challenge in terms of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> balance, experiencing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> loading or dehydration when switching between food plants or between feeding and fasting. To understand how whitebellied sunbirds and New Holland honeyeaters meet the challenges of varying preformed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> load, we used the elimination of intramuscular-injected [<sup>14</sup>C]-<sc>l</sc>-glucose and <sup>3</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O to quantify intestinal and renal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> handling on diets varying in sugar concentration. Both sunbirds and honeyeaters showed significant modulation of intestinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> absorption, allowing excess <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> to be shunted through the intestine when on dilute diets. Despite reducing their fractional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> absorption, both species showed linear increases in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> flux and fractional body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> turnover as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> intake increased (both afternoon and morning), suggesting that the modulation of fractional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> absorption was not sufficient to completely offset dietary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> loads. In both species, glomerular filtration rate was independent of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> gain (but was higher for the afternoon), as was renal fractional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> reabsorption (measured in the afternoon). During the natural overnight fast, both sunbirds and honeyeaters arrested whole kidney function. Evaporative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> loss in sunbirds was variable but correlated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> gain. Both sunbirds and honeyeaters appear to modulate intestinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> absorption as an important component of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> regulation to help deal with massive preformed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> loads. Shutting down glomerular filtration rate during the overnight fast is another way of saving energy for osmoregulatory function. Birds maintain osmotic balance on diets varying markedly in preformed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> load by varying both intestinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> absorption and excretion through the intestine and kidneys.</p>

p53 dynamics in response to DNA damage vary across cell lines and are shaped by efficiency of DNA repair and activity of the kinase ATM
<p>Cellular systems show a wide range of signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics. Many of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics are highly stereotyped, such as oscillations at a fixed frequency. However, most studies looking at the role of signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics focus on one or a few cell lines, leaving the diversity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics across tissues or cell lines a largely unexplored question. We focused on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of the tumor suppressor protein p53, which regulates cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to DNA damage. We established live-cell reporters for 12 cancer cell lines expressing wild-type p53 and quantified p53 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics in response to double-strand break–inducing DNA damage. In many of the tested cell lines, we found that p53 abundance oscillated in response to ionizing radiation or the DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic neocarzinostatin and that the periodicity of the oscillations was fixed. In other cell lines, p53 abundance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ically changed in different ways, such as a single broad pulse or a continuous induction. By combining single-cell assays of p53 signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics, small-molecule screening in live cells, and mathematical modeling, we identified molecules that perturbed p53 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics and determined that cell-specific variation in the efficiency of DNA repair and the activity of the kinase ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) controlled the signaling landscape of p53 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics. Because the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of wild-type p53 varied substantially between cell lines, our study highlights the limitation of using one line as a model system and emphasizes the importance of studying the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of other signaling pathways across different cell lines and genetic backgrounds.</p>

Going with the Flow: Multiscale Insights into the Composite Nature of Water Transport in Roots
<p>As <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> often limits crop production, a more complete understanding of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> capture and transport is necessary. Here, we developed MECHA, a mathematical model that computes the flow of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> across the root at the scale of walls, membranes, and plasmodesmata of individual cells, and used it to test hypotheses related to root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> transport in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). The model uses detailed root anatomical descriptions and a minimal set of experimental cell properties, including the conductivity of plasma membranes, cell walls, and plasmodesmata, which yield quantitative and scale-consistent estimations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> pathways and root radial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductivity (<i>k</i><sub>r</sub>). MECHA revealed that the mainstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic theories derived independently at the cell and root segment scales are compatible only if osmotic potentials within the apoplastic domains are uniform. The results suggested that the convection-diffusion of apoplastic solutes explained most of the offset between estimated <i>k</i><sub>r</sub> in pressure clamp and osmotic experiments, while the contribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-filled intercellular spaces was limited. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses quantified the relative impact of cortex and endodermis cell conductivity of plasma membranes on root <i>k</i><sub>r</sub> and suggested that only the latter contributed substantially to <i>k</i><sub>r</sub> due to the composite nature of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> flow across roots. The explicit root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic anatomy framework brings insights into contradictory interpretations of experiments from the literature and suggests experiments to efficiently address questions pertaining to root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> relations. Its scale consistency opens avenues for cross-scale communication in the world of root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ics.</p>

Spatiotemporal Coupling of Vessel Cavitation and Discharge of Stored Xylem Water in a Tree Sapling
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> discharge from stem internal storage compartments is thought to minimize the risk of vessel cavitation. Based on this concept, one would expect that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> storage compartments involved in the buffering of xylem tensions empty before the onset of vessel cavitation under drought stress, and potentially refill after soil saturation. However, scant in vivo data exist that elucidate this localized spatiotemporal coupling. In this study on intact saplings of American chestnut (<i>Castanea dentata</i>), x-ray computed microtomography (microCT) showed that the xylem matrix surrounding vessels releases stored <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> and becomes air-filled either concurrent to or after vessel cavitation under progressive drought stress. Among annual growth rings, the xylem matrix of the current year remained largely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-filled even under severe drought stress. In comparison, microtomography images collected on excised stems showed that applied pressures of much greater than 0 MPa were required to induce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> release from the xylem matrix. Viability staining highlighted that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> release from the xylem matrix was associated primarily with emptying of dead fibers. Refilling of the xylem matrix and vessels was detected in intact saplings when the canopy was bagged and stem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> potential was close to 0 MPa, and in leafless saplings over the winter period. In conclusion, this study indicates that the bulk of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> stored in the xylem matrix is released after the onset of vessel cavitation, and suggests that capillary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> contributes to overall stem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> storage under drought but is not used primarily for the prevention of drought-induced vessel cavitation in this species.</p>

Components of Water Use Efficiency Have Unique Genetic Signatures in the Model C<sub>4</sub> Grass <i>Setaria</i>
<p>Plant growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use are interrelated processes influenced by genetically controlled morphological and biochemical characteristics. Improving plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use efficiency (WUE) to sustain growth in different environments is an important breeding objective that can improve crop yields and enhance agricultural sustainability. However, genetic improvement of WUE using traditional methods has proven difficult due to the low throughput and environmental heterogeneity of field settings. To overcome these limitations, this study utilizes a high-throughput phenotyping platform to quantify plant size and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use of an interspecific <i>Setaria italica</i> × <i>Setaria viridis</i> recombinant inbred line population at daily intervals in both well-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>ed and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-limited conditions. Our findings indicate that measurements of plant size and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use are correlated strongly in this system; therefore, a linear modeling approach was used to partition this relationship into predicted values of plant size given <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use and deviations from this relationship at the genotype level. The resulting traits describing plant size, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use, and WUE all were heritable and responsive to soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> availability, allowing for a genetic dissection of the components of plant WUE under different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>ing treatments. Linkage mapping identified major loci underlying two different pleiotropic components of WUE. This study indicates that alleles controlling WUE derived from both wild and domesticated accessions can be utilized to predictably modulate trait values given a specified precipitation regime in the model C<sub>4</sub> genus <i>Setaria</i>.</p>

Storage Compartments for Capillary Water Rarely Refill in an Intact Woody Plant
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> storage is thought to play an integral role in the maintenance of whole-plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> balance. The contribution of both living and dead cells to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> storage can be derived from rehydration and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-release curves on excised plant material, but the underlying tissue-specific emptying/refilling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics remain unclear. Here, we used x-ray computed microtomography to characterize the refilling of xylem fibers, pith cells, and vessels under both excised and in vivo conditions in <i>Laurus nobilis</i>. In excised stems supplied with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> uptake exhibited a biphasic response curve, and x-ray computed microtomography images showed that high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> storage capacitance was associated with fiber and pith refilling as driven by capillary forces: fibers refilled more rapidly than pith cells, while vessel refilling was minimal. In excised stems that were sealed, fiber and pith refilling was associated with vessel emptying, indicating a link between tissue connectivity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> storage. In contrast, refilling of fibers, pith cells, and vessels was negligible in intact saplings over two time scales, 24 h and 3 weeks. However, those compartments did refill slowly when the shoot was covered to prevent transpiration. Collectively, our data (1) provide direct evidence that storage compartments for capillary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> refill in excised stems but rarely under in vivo conditions, (2) highlight that estimates of capacitance from excised samples should be interpreted with caution, as certain storage compartments may not be utilized in the intact plant, and (3) question the paradigm that fibers play a substantial role in daily discharge/recharge of stem capacitance in an intact tree.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Xylem Sap Surface Tension May Be Crucial for Hydraulic Safety
<p>The surface tension (γ) of xylem sap plays a key role in stabilizing air-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> interfaces at the pits between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>- and gas-filled conduits to avoid air seeding at low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> potentials. We studied seasonal changes in xylem sap γ in <i>Picea abies</i> and <i>Pinus mugo</i> growing at the alpine timberline. We analyzed their vulnerability to drought-induced embolism using solutions of different γ and estimated the potential effect of seasonal changes in γ on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic vulnerability. In both species, xylem sap γ showed distinct seasonal courses between about 50 and 68 m<sc>n</sc> m<sup>−1</sup>. Solutions with low γ caused higher vulnerability to drought-induced xylem embolism. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> potential at 50% loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductivity in <i>P. abies</i> and <i>P. mugo</i> was −3.35 and −3.86 MPa at γ of 74 m<sc>n</sc> m<sup>−1</sup> but −2.11 and −2.09 MPa at 45 m<sc>n</sc> m<sup>−1</sup>. This indicates up to about 1 MPa seasonal variation in 50% loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductivity. The results revealed pronounced effects of changes in xylem sap γ on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic safety of trees in situ. These effects also are relevant in vulnerability analyses, where the use of standard solutions with high γ overestimates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic safety. Thus, γ should be considered carefully in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic studies.</p>

A Dynamic Hydro-Mechanical and Biochemical Model of Stomatal Conductance for C<sub>4</sub> Photosynthesis
<p>C<sub>4</sub> plants are major grain (maize [<i>Zea mays</i>] and sorghum [<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>]), sugar (sugarcane [<i>Saccharum officinarum</i>]), and biofuel (<i>Miscanthus</i> spp.) producers and contribute ∼20% to global productivity. Plants lose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> through stomatal pores in order to acquire CO<sub>2</sub> (assimilation [<i>A</i>]) and control their carbon-for-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> balance by regulating stomatal conductance (<i>g</i><sub>S</sub>). The ability to mechanistically predict <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> and <i>A</i> in response to atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> availability, and time is critical for simulating stomatal control of plant-atmospheric carbon and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> exchange under current, past, or future environmental conditions. Yet, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic mechanistic models for <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> are lacking, especially for C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. We developed and coupled a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydromechan</span></strong>ical model of stomatal behavior with a biochemical model of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis, calibrated using gas-exchange measurements in maize, and extended the coupled model with time-explicit functions to predict <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic responses. We demonstrated the wider applicability of the model with three additional C<sub>4</sub> grass species in which interspecific differences in stomatal behavior could be accounted for by fitting a single parameter. The model accurately predicted steady-state responses of <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> to light, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and oxygen, soil drying, and evaporative demand as well as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic responses to light intensity. Further analyses suggest that the effect of variable leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductance is negligible. Based on the model, we derived a set of equations suitable for incorporation in land surface models. Our model illuminates the processes underpinning stomatal control in C<sub>4</sub> plants and suggests that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic benefits associated with fast stomatal responses of C<sub>4</sub> grasses may have supported the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis.</p>

Outside-Xylem Vulnerability, Not Xylem Embolism, Controls Leaf Hydraulic Decline during Dehydration<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[CC-BY]</sup></xref>
<p>Leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic supply is crucial to maintaining open stomata for CO<sub>2</sub> capture and plant growth. During drought-induced dehydration, the leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductance (<i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub>) declines, which contributes to stomatal closure and, eventually, to leaf death. Previous studies have tended to attribute the decline of <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> to embolism in the leaf vein xylem. We visualized at high resolution and quantified experimentally the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic vulnerability of xylem and outside-xylem pathways and modeled their respective influences on plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> transport. Evidence from all approaches indicated that the decline of <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> during dehydration arose first and foremost due to the vulnerability of outside-xylem tissues. In vivo x-ray microcomputed tomography of dehydrating leaves of four diverse angiosperm species showed that, at the turgor loss point, only small fractions of leaf vein xylem conduits were embolized, and substantial xylem embolism arose only under severe dehydration. Experiments on an expanded set of eight angiosperm species showed that outside-xylem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic vulnerability explained 75% to 100% of <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> decline across the range of dehydration from mild <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> stress to beyond turgor loss point. Spatially explicit modeling of leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> transport pointed to a role for reduced membrane conductivity consistent with published data for cells and tissues. Plant-scale modeling suggested that outside-xylem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic vulnerability can protect the xylem from tensions that would induce embolism and disruption of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> transport under mild to moderate soil and atmospheric droughts. These findings pinpoint outside-xylem tissues as a central locus for the control of leaf and plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> transport during progressive drought.</p>

Tree Physiology
Temperate tree species show identical response in tree water deficit but different sensitivities in sap flow to summer soil drying
<p>Temperate forests are expected to be particularly vulnerable to drought and soil drying because they are not adapted to such conditions and perform best in mesic environments. Here we ask (i) how sensitively four common temperate tree species (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i>, <i>Picea abies</i>, <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> and <i>Fraxinus excelsior</i>) respond in their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> relations to summer soil drying and seek to determine (ii) if species-specific responses to summer soil drying are related to the onset of declining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> status across the four species. Throughout 2012 and 2013 we determined tree <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit (TWD) as a proxy for tree <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> status from recorded stem radius changes and monitored sap flow rates with sensors on 16 mature trees studied in the field at Lageren, Switzerland. All tree species responded equally in their relative maximum TWD to the onset of declining soil moisture. This implies that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> supply of all tree species was affected by declining soil moisture and that none of the four species was able to fully maintain its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> status, e.g., by access to alternative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> sources in the soil. In contrast we found strong and highly species-specific responses of sap flow to declining soil moisture with the strongest decline in <i>P. abies</i> (92%), followed by <i>F. sylvatica</i> (53%) and <i>A. pseudoplatanus</i> (48%). <i>F. excelsior</i> did not significantly reduce sap flow. We hypothesize the species-specific responses in sap flow to declining soil moisture that occur despite a simultaneous increase in relative TWD in all species reflect how fast these species approach critical levels of their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> status, which is most likely influenced by species-specific traits determining the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic properties of the species tree.</p>

The Causes of Leaf Hydraulic Vulnerability and Its Influence on Gas Exchange in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>

Using the model species Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> ecotype Columbia-0), we applied a multitiered approach including physiological measurements, high-resolution x-ray microcomputed tomography, and modeling at a range of scales to characterize (1) <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> decline during dehydration; (2) its basis in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductances of leaf xylem and outside-xylem pathways (<i>K</i><sub>ox</sub>); (3) the dependence of its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics on irradiance; (4) its impact on diurnal patterns of stomatal conductance and photosynthetic rate; and (5) its influence on gas exchange and survival under simulated drought regimes. Arabidopsis leaves showed strong vulnerability to dehydration diurnally in both gas exchange and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductance, despite lack of xylem embolism or conduit collapse above the turgor loss point, indicating a pronounced sensitivity of <i>K</i><sub>ox</sub> to dehydration. <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> increased under higher irradiance in well-hydrated leaves across the full range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> potential, but no shift in <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> vulnerability was observed. Modeling indicated that responses to dehydration and irradiance are likely attributable to changes in membrane permeability and that a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic <i>K</i><sub>ox</sub> would contribute strongly to stomatal closure, improving performance, survival, and efficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use during drought. These findings for Columbia-0 provide a baseline for assessing variation across genotypes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic traits and their influence on gas exchange during dehydration.</p>

Organ-coordinated response of early post-germination mahogany seedlings to drought
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit tolerance during post-germination stages is critical for seedling recruitment. In this work, we studied the effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit on morphological and biochemical responses in different organs of newly germinated mahogany (<i>Swietenia macrophylla</i> King) seedlings, a woody species that occurs in the Amazon rainforest. The root : shoot ratio increased under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit. The leaf number and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> potential were not altered, although reductions in leaf area and stomatal conductance were observed. Osmotic potential became more negative in leaves of seedlings under severe stress. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit increased fructose, glucose, sucrose and myo-inositol levels in leaves. Stems accumulated fructose, glucose and <sc>l</sc>-proline. Nitric oxide (NO) levels increased in the vascular cylinder of roots under severe stress while superoxide anion levels decreased due to augmented superoxide dismutase activity in this organ. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit induced glutathione reductase activity in both roots and stems. Upon moderate or severe stress, catalase activity decreased in leaves and remained unaffected in the other seedling organs, allowing for an increase of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) levels in leaves. Overall, the increase of signaling molecules in distinct organs—NO in roots, <sc>l</sc>-proline in stems and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and myo-inositol in leaves—contributed to the response of mahogany seedlings to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit by triggering biochemical processes that resulted in the attenuation of oxidative stress and the establishment of osmotic adjustment. Therefore, this body of evidence reveals that the development of newly germinated mahogany seedlings may occur in both natural habitats and crop fields even when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> availability is greatly limited.</p>

Recovery performance in xylem hydraulic conductivity is correlated with cavitation resistance for temperate deciduous tree species
<p>Woody species <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ically vulnerable to xylem cavitation may experience daily xylem embolism. How such species cope with the possibility of accumulated embolism is unclear. In this study, we examined seven temperate woody species to assess the hypothesis that low cavitation resistance (high vulnerability to cavitation) is compensated by high recovery performance via vessel refilling. We also evaluated leaf functional and xylem structural traits. The xylem recovery index (XRI), defined as the ratio of xylem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductivity in plants re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>ed after soil drought to that in plants under moist conditions, varied among species. The xylem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> potential causing 50% loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductivity (Ψ<sub>50</sub>) varied among the species studied, whereas only a slight difference was detected with respect to midday xylem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> potential (Ψ<sub>min</sub>), indicating smaller <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic safety margins (Ψ<sub>min</sub> − Ψ<sub>50</sub>) for species more vulnerable to cavitation. Cavitation resistance (|Ψ<sub>50</sub>|) was negatively correlated with XRI across species, with cavitation-vulnerable species showing a higher performance in xylem recovery. Wood density was positively correlated with cavitation resistance and was negatively correlated with XRI. These novel results reveal that coordination exists between cavitation resistance and xylem recovery performance, in association with wood functional traits such as denser wood for cavitation-resistant xylem and less-dense but <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-storable wood for refillable xylem. These findings provide insights into long-term maintenance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> transport in tree species growing under variable environmental conditions.</p>

Potted seedlings were subjected to moderate soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit for four consecutive months during their second growing season. Individuals under soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit showed a 40% decrease in biomass accumulation but no change in the relative allocation of biomass to the different plant compartments. Net CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rates at leaf level decreased under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit (~15%) but could not alone explain the total reduction in growth, excluding the carbon starvation hypothesis. The observed reduction in net CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rates was related to a decrease in stomatal conductance and chlorophyll content. <i>STAR</i><sub>zen</sub> (in situ silhouette to total leaf area ratio; a proxy for light interception efficiency) decreased under soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit due to shifts in biomass allocation within the branch compartment from long upper axes to short bottom axes. Despite the fact that the understanding of the processes involved in growth reduction and branching pattern alteration will need more attention in future research, we conclude that under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit yellow birch at young stages will: (i) experience a substantial loss of growth and biomass; and (ii) acclimate through architectural plasticity rather than through changes in the relative allocation of root biomass to enhance its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> management.</p>

Combined effects of defoliation and water stress on pine growth and non-structural carbohydrates
<p>Climate change is expected to increase both pest insect damage and the occurrence of severe drought. There is therefore a need to better understand the combined effects of biotic and abiotic damage on tree growth in order to predict the multi-factorial effect of climate change on forest ecosystem productivity. Indeed, the effect of stress interactions on tree growth is an increasingly important topic that greatly lacks experiments and data, and it is unlikely that the impact of combined stresses can be extrapolated from the outcomes of studies that focused on a single stress. We developed an original manipulative study under real field conditions where we applied artificial defoliation and induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> stress on 10-year-old (∼10 m high) maritime pine trees (<i>Pinus pinaster</i> Ait.). Tree response to combined stresses was quantitatively assessed following tree secondary growth and carbohydrate pools. Such a design allowed us to address the crucial question of combined stresses on trees under stand conditions, sharing soil supplies with neighboring trees. Our initial hypotheses were that (i) moderate defoliation can limit the impact of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> stress on tree growth through reduced transpiration demand by a tree canopy partly defoliated and that (ii) defoliation results in reduced non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) pools, affecting tree tolerance to drought. Our results showed additive effects of defoliation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> stress on tree growth and contradict our initial hypothesis. Indeed, under stand conditions, we found that partial defoliation does not limit the impact of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> stress through reduced transpiration. Our study also highlighted that, even if NSC in all organs were affected by defoliation, tree response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> stress was not triggered. We found that stem NSC were maintained or increased during the entire growing season, supporting literature-based hypotheses such as an active maintenance of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic system or another limiting resource for tree growth under defoliation. We also observed a significant decrease in root carbohydrates, which suggests a shift in the root carbon balance under defoliation. The decrease in carbohydrate supply under defoliation may not counterbalance the carbon use for mineral and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> uptakes or a translocation to other tissues.</p>

A liquid-liquid transition in supercooled aqueous solution related to the HDA-LDA transition
<p>Simulations and theory suggest that the thermo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic anomalies of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> may be related to a phase transition between two supercooled liquid states, but so far this phase transition has not been observed experimentally because of preemptive ice crystallization. We used calorimetry, infrared spectroscopy, and molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics simulations to investigate a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-rich hydrazinium trifluoroacetate solution in which the local hydrogen bond structure surrounding a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> molecule resembles that in neat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> at elevated pressure, but which does not crystallize upon cooling. Instead, this solution underwent a sharp, reversible phase transition between two homogeneous liquid states. The hydrogen-bond structures of these two states are similar to those established for high- and low-density amorphous (HDA and LDA) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>. Such structural similarity supports theories that predict a similar sharp transition in pure <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> under pressure if ice crystallization could be suppressed.</p>

Hydraulics Regulate Stomatal Responses to Changes in Leaf Water Status in the Fern <i>Athyrium filix</i>-<i>femina</i>
<p>Stomatal responses to changes in leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> status are important for the diurnal regulation of gas exchange and the survival of plants during drought. These stomatal responses in angiosperm species are well characterized, yet in species of nonseed plants, an ongoing debate surrounds the role of metabolism, particularly the role of the hormone abscisic acid (ABA), in functionally regulating stomatal responses to changes in leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> status. Here, we measured the stomatal response to changes in vapor pressure difference (VPD) in two natural forms of the fern species <i>Athyrium filix</i>-<i>femina</i>, recently suggested to have stomata that are regulated by ABA. The two forms measured had considerable differences in key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic traits, including leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductance and capacitance, as well as the kinetics of stomatal response to changes in VPD. In both forms, the stomatal responses to VPD could be accurately predicted by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic, mechanistic model that assumes guard cell turgor changes in concert with leaf turgor in the light, and not via metabolic processes including the level of ABA. During drought, endogenous ABA did not play a role in stomatal closure, and exogenous ABA applied to live, intact leaves did not induce stomatal closure. Our results indicate that functional stomatal responses to changes in leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> status in ferns are regulated by leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ics and not metabolism. With ferns being sister to seed plants, this result has implications for the evolutionary reconstruction of functional stomatal responses across vascular land plant lineages.</p>

The Sites of Evaporation within Leaves
<p>The sites of evaporation within leaves are unknown, but they have drawn attention for decades due to their perceived implications for many factors, including patterns of leaf isotopic enrichment, the maintenance of mesophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> status, stomatal regulation, and the interpretation of measured stomatal and leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductances. We used a spatially explicit model of coupled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> and heat transport outside the xylem, MOFLO 2.0, to map the distribution of net evaporation across leaf tissues in relation to anatomy and environmental parameters. Our results corroborate earlier predictions that most evaporation occurs from the epidermis at low light and moderate humidity but that the mesophyll contributes substantially when the leaf center is warmed by light absorption, and more so under high humidity. We also found that the bundle sheath provides a significant minority of evaporation (15% in darkness and 18% in high light), that the vertical center of amphistomatous leaves supports net condensation, and that vertical temperature gradients caused by light absorption vary over 10-fold across species, reaching 0.3°C. We show that several hypotheses that depend on the evaporating sites require revision in light of our findings, including that experimental measurements of stomatal and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductances should be affected directly by changes in the location of the evaporating sites. We propose a new conceptual model that accounts for mixed-phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> transport outside the xylem. These conclusions have far-reaching implications for inferences in leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ics, gas exchange, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use, and isotope physiology.</p>

Evidence for Hydraulic Vulnerability Segmentation and Lack of Xylem Refilling under Tension
<p>The vascular system of grapevine (<i>Vitis</i> spp.) has been reported as being highly vulnerable, even though grapevine regularly experiences seasonal drought. Consequently, stomata would remain open below <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> potentials that would generate a high loss of stem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductivity via xylem embolism. This situation would necessitate daily cycles of embolism repair to restore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic function. However, a more parsimonious explanation is that some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic techniques are prone to artifacts in species with long vessels, leading to the overestimation of vulnerability. The aim of this study was to provide an unbiased assessment of (1) the vulnerability to drought-induced embolism in perennial and annual organs and (2) the ability to refill embolized vessels in two <i>Vitis</i> species X-ray micro-computed tomography observations of intact plants indicated that both <i>Vitis</i> <i>vinifera</i> and <i>Vitis</i> <i>riparia</i> were relatively vulnerable, with the pressure inducing 50% loss of stem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductivity = −1.7 and −1.3 MPa, respectively. In <i>V. vinifera</i>, both the stem and petiole had similar sigmoidal vulnerability curves but differed in pressure inducing 50% loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductivity (−1.7 and −1 MPa for stem and petiole, respectively). Refilling was not observed as long as bulk xylem pressure remained negative (e.g. at the apical part of the plants; −0.11 ± 0.02 MPa) and change in percentage loss of conductivity was 0.02% ± 0.01%. However, positive xylem pressure was observed at the basal part of the plant (0.04 ± 0.01 MPa), leading to a recovery of conductance (change in percentage loss of conductivity = −0.24% ± 0.12%). Our findings provide evidence that grapevine is unable to repair embolized xylem vessels under negative pressure, but its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic vulnerability segmentation provides significant protection of the perennial stem.</p>

From oncogenic mutation to dynamic code
<p>Signal transduction pathways (STPs) convert biochemical reactions into precise and reproducible biological outcomes. These functions are performed reliably and reproducibly against a background of noise (variation) arising from the stochastic nature of biochemical reactions (<i>1</i>). Indeed, information theory analysis of STPs indicates that they have a limited capacity to discriminate information, including different ligands or different activation states of components (<i>2</i>). However, this discrimination is dramatically enhanced by adding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic information, such as signal rise time, signal duration, amplitude, and decay rate (<i>3</i>). The observation that differential activation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway can determine whether rat pheochromocytoma cells proliferate or differentiate was reported more than 20 years ago (<i>4</i>), and evidence has since accumulated that STP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics control cell fate decisions. However, we are still struggling to understand how signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics is encoded and decoded and how pathological changes, such as the expression of mutant proteins, affect the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic STP code. On page 892 of this issue, Bugaj <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) make use of new tools with which to decipher this code and reveal how certain cancer-associated BRAF mutations can corrupt the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic STP code and trick cells into unlicensed proliferation.</p>

Anomalously low dielectric constant of confined water

Thirst-associated preoptic neurons encode an aversive motivational drive
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deprivation produces a drive to seek and consume <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>. How neural activity creates this motivation remains poorly understood. We used activity-dependent genetic labeling to characterize neurons activated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deprivation in the hypothalamic median preoptic nucleus (MnPO). Single-cell transcriptional profiling revealed that dehydration-activated MnPO neurons consist of a single excitatory cell type. After optogenetic activation of these neurons, mice drank <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> and performed an operant lever-pressing task for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> reward with rates that scaled with stimulation frequency. This stimulation was aversive, and instrumentally pausing stimulation could reinforce lever-pressing. Activity of these neurons gradually decreased over the course of an operant session. Thus, the activity of dehydration-activated MnPO neurons establishes a scalable, persistent, and aversive internal state that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ically controls thirst-motivated behavior.</p>

Enhanced water permeability and tunable ion selectivity in subnanometer carbon nanotube porins

Abscisic Acid Down-Regulates Hydraulic Conductance of Grapevine Leaves in Isohydric Genotypes Only<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plants evolved different strategies to cope with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> stress. While isohydric species maintain their midday leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> potential (Ψ<sub>M</sub>) under soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit by closing their stomata, anisohydric species maintain higher stomatal aperture and exhibit substantial reductions in Ψ<sub>M</sub>. It was hypothesized that isohydry is related to a locally higher sensitivity of stomata to the drought-hormone abscisic acid (ABA). Interestingly, recent lines of evidence in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) suggested that stomatal responsiveness is also controlled by an ABA action on leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> supply upstream from stomata. Here, we tested the possibility in grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) that different genotypes ranging from near isohydric to more anisohydric may have different sensitivities in these ABA responses. Measurements on whole plants in drought conditions were combined with assays on detached leaves fed with ABA. Two different methods consistently showed that leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductance (K<sub>leaf</sub>) was down-regulated by exogenous ABA, with strong variations depending on the genotype. Importantly, variation between isohydry and anisohydry correlated with K<sub>leaf</sub> sensitivity to ABA, with K<sub>leaf</sub> in the most anisohydric genotypes being unresponsive to the hormone. We propose that the observed response of K<sub>leaf</sub> to ABA may be part of the overall ABA regulation of leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> status.</p>

Genetic Control of Plasticity in Root Morphology and Anatomy of Rice in Response to Water Deficit
<p>Elucidating the genetic control of rooting behavior under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-deficit stress is essential to breed climate-robust rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) cultivars. Using a diverse panel of 274 <i>indica</i> genotypes grown under control and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-deficit conditions during vegetative growth, we phenotyped 35 traits, mostly related to root morphology and anatomy, involving 45,000 root-scanning images and nearly 25,000 cross sections from the root-shoot junction. The phenotypic plasticity of these traits was quantified as the relative change in trait value under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-deficit compared with control conditions. We then carried out a genome-wide association analysis on these traits and their plasticity, using 45,608 high-quality single-nucleotide polymorphisms. One hundred four significant loci were detected for these traits under control conditions, 106 were detected under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-deficit stress, and 76 were detected for trait plasticity. We predicted 296 (control), 284 (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-deficit stress), and 233 (plasticity) a priori candidate genes within linkage disequilibrium blocks for these loci. We identified key a priori candidate genes regulating root growth and development and relevant alleles that, upon validation, can help improve rice adaptation to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-deficit stress.</p>

Apparent Overinvestment in Leaf Venation Relaxes Leaf Morphological Constraints on Photosynthesis in Arid Habitats
<p>Leaf veins supply the mesophyll with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> that evaporates when stomata are open to allow CO<sub>2</sub> uptake for photosynthesis. Theoretical analyses suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> is optimally distributed in the mesophyll when the lateral distance between veins (<i>d</i><sub>x</sub>) is equal to the distance from these veins to the epidermis (<i>d</i><sub>y</sub>), expressed as <i>d</i><sub>x</sub>:<i>d</i><sub>y</sub> ≈ 1. Although this theory is supported by observations of many derived angiosperms, we hypothesize that plants in arid environments may reduce <i>d</i><sub>x</sub>:<i>d</i><sub>y</sub> below unity owing to climate-specific functional adaptations of increased leaf thickness and increased vein density. To test our hypothesis, we assembled leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic, morphological, and photosynthetic traits of 68 species from the <i>Eucalyptus</i> and <i>Corymbia</i> genera (termed eucalypts) along an aridity gradient in southwestern Australia. We inferred the potential gas-exchange advantage of reducing <i>d</i><sub>x</sub> beyond <i>d</i><sub>y</sub> using a model that links leaf morphology and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ics to photosynthesis. Our observations reveal that eucalypts in arid environments have thick amphistomatous leaves with high vein densities, resulting in <i>d</i><sub>x</sub>:<i>d</i><sub>y</sub> ratios that range from 1.6 to 0.15 along the aridity gradient. Our model suggests that, as leaves become thicker, the effect of reducing <i>d</i><sub>x</sub> beyond <i>d</i><sub>y</sub> is to offset the reduction in leaf gas exchange that would result from maintaining <i>d</i><sub>x</sub>:<i>d</i><sub>y</sub> at unity. This apparent overinvestment in leaf venation may be explained from the selective pressure of aridity, under which traits associated with long leaf life span, high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic and thermal capacitances, and high potential rates of leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> transport confer a competitive advantage.</p>

Limited acclimation in leaf anatomy to experimental drought in tropical rainforest trees
<p>Dry periods are predicted to become more frequent and severe in the future in some parts of the tropics, including Amazonia, potentially causing reduced productivity, higher tree mortality and increased emissions of stored carbon. Using a long-term (12 year) through-fall exclusion (TFE) experiment in the tropics, we test the hypothesis that trees produce leaves adapted to cope with higher levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> stress, by examining the following leaf characteristics: area, thickness, leaf mass per area, vein density, stomatal density, the thickness of palisade mesophyll, spongy mesophyll and both of the epidermal layers, internal cavity volume and the average cell sizes of the palisade and spongy mesophyll. We also test whether differences in leaf anatomy are consistent with observed differential drought-induced mortality responses among taxa, and look for relationships between leaf anatomy, and leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> relations and gas exchange parameters. Our data show that trees do not produce leaves that are more xeromorphic in response to 12 years of soil moisture deficit. However, the drought treatment did result in increases in the thickness of the adaxial epidermis (TFE: 20.5 ± 1.5 µm, control: 16.7 ± 1.0 µm) and the internal cavity volume (TFE: 2.43 ± 0.50 mm<sup>3</sup> cm<sup>−2</sup>, control: 1.77 ± 0.30 mm<sup>3 </sup>cm<sup>−2</sup>). No consistent differences were detected between drought-resistant and drought-sensitive taxa, although interactions occurred between drought-sensitivity status and drought treatment for the palisade mesophyll thickness (<i>P</i> = 0.034) and the cavity volume of the leaves (<i>P</i> = 0.025). The limited response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit probably reflects a tight co-ordination between leaf morphology, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> relations and photosynthetic properties. This suggests that there is little plasticity in these aspects of plant anatomy in these taxa, and that phenotypic plasticity in leaf traits may not facilitate the acclimation of Amazonian trees to the predicted future reductions in dry season <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> availability.</p>

Osmotic and hydraulic adjustment of mangrove saplings to extreme salinity
<p>Salinity tolerance in plant species varies widely due to adaptation and acclimation processes at the cellular and whole-plant scales. In mangroves, extreme substrate salinity induces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic failure and ion excess toxicity and reduces growth and survival, thus suggesting a potentially critical role for physiological acclimation to salinity. We tested the hypothesis that osmotic adjustment, a key type of plasticity that mitigates salinity shock, would take place in coordination with declines in whole-plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductance in a common garden experiment using saplings of three mangrove species with different salinity tolerances (<i>Avicennia germinans</i> L., <i>Rhizophora mangle</i> L. and <i>Laguncularia racemosa</i> (L.) C.F. Gaertn., ordered from higher to lower salinity tolerance). For each mangrove species, four salinity treatments (1, 10, 30 and 50 practical salinity units) were established and the time trajectories were determined for leaf osmotic potential (Ψ<sub>s</sub>), stomatal conductance (<i>g</i><sub>s</sub>), whole-plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductance (<i>K</i><sub>plant</sub>) and predawn disequilibrium between xylem and substrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> potentials (Ψ<sub>pdd</sub>). We expected that, for all three species, salinity increments would result in coordinated declines in Ψ<sub>s</sub>, <i>g</i><sub>s</sub> and <i>K</i><sub>plant</sub>, and that the Ψ<sub>pdd</sub> would increase with substrate salinity and time of exposure. In concordance with our predictions, reductions in substrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> potential promoted a coordinated decline in Ψ<sub>s</sub>, <i>g</i><sub>s</sub> and <i>K</i><sub>plant</sub>, whereas the Ψ<sub>pdd</sub> increased substantially during the first 4 days but dissipated after 7 days, indicating a time lag for equilibration after a change in substratum salinity. Our results show that mangroves confront and partially ameliorate acute salinity stress via simultaneous reductions in Ψ<sub>s</sub>, <i>g</i><sub>s</sub> and <i>K</i><sub>plant</sub>, thus developing synergistic physiological responses at the cell and whole-plant scales.</p>

Interplay of growth rate and xylem plasticity for optimal coordination of carbon and hydraulic economies in <i>Fraxinus ornus</i> trees
<p>Efficient leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> supply is fundamental for assimilation processes and tree growth. Renovating the architecture of the xylem transport system requires an increasing carbon investment while growing taller, and any deficiency of carbon availability may result in increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic constraints to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> flow. Therefore, plants need to coordinate carbon assimilation and biomass allocation to guarantee an efficient and safe long-distance transport system. We tested the hypothesis that reduced branch elongation rates together with carbon-saving adjustments of xylem anatomy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ically compensate for the reduction in biomass allocation to xylem. We measured leaf biomass, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic and anatomical properties of wood segments along the main axis of branches in 10 slow growing (SG) and 10 fast growing (FG) <i>Fraxinus ornus</i> L. trees. Branches of SG trees had five times slower branch elongation rate (7 vs 35  cm year<sup>–1</sup>), and produced a higher leaf biomass (<i>P</i> < 0.0001) and thinner xylem rings with fewer but larger vessels (<i>P</i> < 0.0001). On the contrary, we found no differences between SG and FG trees in terms of leaf-specific conductivity (<i>P</i> > 0.05) and xylem safety (Ψ<sub>50</sub> ≈ −3.2  MPa). Slower elongation rate coupled with thinner annual rings and larger vessels allows the reduction of carbon costs associated with growth, while maintaining similar leaf-specific conductivity and xylem safety.</p>

Size-dependent enhancement of water relations during post-fire resprouting
<p>In resprouting species, fire-induced topkill causes a reduction in height and leaf area without a comparable reduction in the size of the root system, which should lead to an increase in the efficiency of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> transport after fire. However, large plants undergo a greater relative reduction in size, compared with small plants, so we hypothesized that this enhancement in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic efficiency would be greatest among large growth forms. In the ecotone between long-leaf pine (<i>Pinus palustris</i> Mill.) savannas and wetlands, we measured stomatal conductance (<i>g</i><sub>s</sub>), mid-day leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> potential (<i>Ψ</i><sub>leaf</sub>), leaf-specific whole-plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductance (<i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub>), leaf area and height of 10 species covering a range of growth forms in burned and unburned sites. As predicted, <i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub> was higher in post-fire resprouts than in unburned plants, and the post-fire increase in <i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub> was positively related to plant size. Specifically, large-statured species tended to undergo the greatest relative reductions in leaf area and height, and correspondingly experienced the greatest increases in <i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub>. The post-fire increase in <i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub> was smaller than expected, however, due to a decrease in absolute root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductance (i.e., not scaled to leaf area). The higher <i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub> in burned sites was manifested as an increase in <i>g</i><sub>s</sub> rather than an increase in <i>Ψ</i><sub>leaf</sub>. Post-fire increases in <i>g</i><sub>s</sub> should promote high rates of photosynthesis for recovery of carbohydrate reserves and aboveground biomass, which is particularly important for large-statured species that require more time to recover their pre-fire size.</p>

Optical imaging of surface chemistry and dynamics in confinement

The second harmonic images reported on the orientational order of interfacial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>, induced by charge-dipole interactions between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> molecules and surface charges. The images were converted into surface potential maps. Spatially resolved surface acid dissociation constant (p<i>K</i><sub>a,s</sub>) values were determined for the silica deprotonation reaction by following pH-induced chemical changes on the curved and confined surfaces of a glass microcapillary immersed in aqueous solutions. These values ranged from 2.3 to 10.7 along the wall of a single capillary because of surface heterogeneities. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> molecules that rotate along an oscillating external electric field were also imaged.</p>

The role of dimer asymmetry and protomer dynamics in enzyme catalysis
<p>Freeze-trapping x-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance, and computational techniques reveal the distribution of states and their interconversion rates along the reaction pathway of a bacterial homodimeric enzyme, fluoroacetate dehalogenase (FAcD). The crystal structure of apo-FAcD exhibits asymmetry around the dimer interface and cap domain, priming one protomer for substrate binding. This asymmetry is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ically averaged through conformational exchange on a millisecond time scale. During catalysis, the protomer conformational exchange rate becomes enhanced, the empty protomer exhibits increased local disorder, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> egresses. Computational studies identify allosteric pathways between protomers. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> release and enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics associated with catalysis compensate for entropic losses from substrate binding while facilitating sampling of the transition state. The studies provide insights into how substrate-coupled allosteric modulation of structure and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics facilitates catalysis in a homodimeric enzyme.</p>

A SWELL Channel Indeed

The Hydrogen Isotope Composition δ<sup>2</sup>H Reflects Plant Performance
<p>The stable carbon (δ<sup>13</sup>C) and oxygen (δ<sup>18</sup>O) isotope compositions in plant matter reflect photosynthetic and transpirative conditions in plants, respectively. However, the nature of hydrogen isotope composition (δ<sup>2</sup>H) and what it reflects of plant performance is poorly understood. Using durum wheat (<i>Triticum turgidum</i> var <i>durum</i>), this study evaluated the effect of different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> and nitrogen growing field conditions on transpiration and how this effect influenced the performance of δ<sup>2</sup>H in autotrophic (flag leaf), mixotrophic (ears), and heterotrophic (grains and roots) organs. Moreover, δ<sup>2</sup>H was compared with the δ<sup>13</sup>C and δ<sup>18</sup>O in the same organs. Isotope compositions were analyzed in dry matter, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-soluble fraction, and in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> from different tissues of a set of genotypes. Similar to δ<sup>13</sup>C, the δ<sup>2</sup>H correlated negatively with stomatal conductance, whereas no correlation was observed for δ<sup>18</sup>O. Moreover, δ<sup>2</sup>H was not only affected by changes in transpiration but also by photosynthetic reactions, probably as a consequence of NADPH formation in autotrophic organs. Compared with the δ<sup>2</sup>H of stem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>, plant δ<sup>2</sup>H was strongly diminished in photosynthetic organs such as the flag leaves, whereas it strongly increased in heterotrophic organs such as grains and roots. In heterotrophic organs, δ<sup>2</sup>H was associated with postphotosynthetic effects because there are several processes that lead to <sup>2</sup>H-enrichment of carbohydrates. In summary, δ<sup>2</sup>H exhibited specific features that inform about the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> conditions of the wheat crop, together with the photosynthetic characteristics of the plant part considered. Moreover, correlations of δ<sup>2</sup>H with grain yield illustrate that this isotope can be used to assess plant performance under different growing conditions.</p>

Low Water Potential and At14a-Like1 (AFL1) Effects on Endocytosis and Actin Filament Organization
<p>At14a-Like1 (AFL1) is a stress-induced protein of unknown function that promotes growth during low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> potential stress and drought. Previous analysis indicated that AFL1 may have functions related to endocytosis and regulation of actin filament organization, processes for which the effects of low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> potential are little known. We found that low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> potential led to a decrease in endocytosis, as measured by uptake of the membrane-impermeable dye FM4-64. Ectopic expression of AFL1 reversed the decrease in FM4-64 uptake seen in wild type, while reduced AFL1 expression led to further inhibition of FM4-64 uptake. Increased AFL1 also made FM4-64 uptake less sensitive to the actin filament disruptor Latrunculin B (LatB). LatB decreased AFL1-Clathrin Light Chain colocalization, further indicating that effects of AFL1 on endocytosis may be related to actin filament organization or stability. Consistent with this hypothesis, ectopic AFL1 expression made actin filaments less sensitive to disruption by LatB or Cytochalasin D and led to increased actin filament skewness and decreased occupancy, indicative of more bundled actin filaments. This latter effect could be partially mimicked by the actin filament stabilizer Jasplakinolide (JASP). However, AFL1 did not substantially inhibit actin filament <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics, indicating that AFL1 acts via a different mechanism than JASP-induced stabilization. AFL1 partially colocalized with actin filaments but not with microtubules, further indicating actin-filament–related function of AFL1. These data provide insight into endocytosis and actin filament responses to low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> potential stress and demonstrate an involvement of AFL1 in these key cellular processes.</p>

The Microtubule-Associated Protein IQ67 DOMAIN5 Modulates Microtubule Dynamics and Pavement Cell Shape
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic arrangement of cortical microtubules (MTs) plays a pivotal role in controlling cell growth and shape formation in plants, but the mechanisms by which cortical MTs are organized to regulate these processes are not well characterized. In particular, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic behavior of cortical MTs is critical for their spatial organization, yet the molecular mechanisms controlling MT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics remain poorly understood. In this study, we used the puzzle piece-shaped pavement cells of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves as a model system in which to study cortical MT organization. We isolated an ethyl methanesulfonate mutant with reduced interdigitation of pavement cells in cotyledons. This line carried a mutation in <i>IQ67 DOMAIN5</i> (<i>IQD5</i>), which encodes a member of the plant-specific IQ motif protein family. Live-cell imaging and biochemical analyses demonstrated that IQD5 binds to MTs and promotes MT assembly. MT-depolymerizing drug treatment and in vivo MT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics assays suggested that IQD5 functions to stabilize MTs. Hence, our findings provide genetic, cell biological, and biochemical evidence that IQD5 regulates MT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics that affect MT organization and subsequent cell shape formation.</p>

Acclimation to Fluctuating Light Impacts the Rapidity of Response and Diurnal Rhythm of Stomatal Conductance<sup><xref>1</xref></sup>
<p>Plant acclimation to growth light environment has been studied extensively; however, the majority of these studies have focused on light intensity and photo-acclimation, with few studies exploring the impact of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic growth light on stomatal acclimation and behavior. To assess the impact of growth light regime on stomatal acclimation, we grew Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants in three different lighting regimes (with the same average daily intensity), fluctuating with a fixed pattern of light, fluctuating with a randomized pattern of light (sinusoidal), and nonfluctuating (square wave), to assess the effect of light regime <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics on gas exchange. We demonstrated that <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> (stomatal conductance to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> vapor) acclimation is influenced by both intensity and light pattern, modifying the stomatal kinetics at different times of the day and resulting in differences in the rapidity and magnitude of the <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> response. We also describe and quantify the response to an internal signal that uncouples variation in <i>A</i> and <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> over the majority of the diurnal period and represents 25% of the total diurnal <i>g<sub>s</sub></i>. This <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> response can be characterized by a Gaussian element and when incorporated into the widely used Ball-Berry model greatly improved the prediction of <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic environment. From these findings, we conclude that acclimation of <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> to growth light could be an important strategy for maintaining carbon fixation and overall plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> status and should be considered when inferring responses in the field from laboratory-based experiments.</p>

A Model of Leaf Coordination to Scale-Up Leaf Expansion from the Organ to the Canopy
<p>Process-based crop growth models are popular tools with which to analyze and understand the impact of crop management, genotype-by-environment interactions, or climate change. The ability to predict leaf area development is critical to predict crop growth, particularly under conditions of limited resources. Here, we aimed at deciphering growth coordination rules between wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) plant organs (i.e. between leaves within a stem, between laminae and sheaths, and between the mainstem and axillary tillers) to model the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of canopy development. We found a unique relationship between laminae area and leaf rank for the mainstem and its tillers, which was robust across a range of sowing dates and plant densities. Robust relationships between laminae and sheath areas also were found, highlighting the tight control of organ growth within and between phytomers. These relationships identified at the phytomer scale were used to develop a simulation model of leaf area <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics at the canopy level that was integrated in the wheat model SiriusQuality. The model was then evaluated using several independent experiments. The model accurately predicts leaf area <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics under different scenarios of nitrogen and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> limitations. It accounted for 85%, 64%, and 73% of the variability of the surface area of leaf cohorts, total leaf area index, and total green area index, respectively. The process-based model of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of leaf area described here is a key element to quantify the value of candidate traits for use in plant breeding and to project the impact of climate change on wheat growth.</p>

Stress-Related Gene Expression Reflects Morphophysiological Responses to Water Deficit
<p>Acclimation to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit (WD) enables plants to maintain growth under unfavorable environmental conditions, although the mechanisms are not completely understood. In this study, the natural variation of long-term acclimation to moderate and severe soil WD was investigated in 18 Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) accessions using PHENOPSIS, an automated phenotyping platform. Soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> content was adjusted at an early stage of plant development and maintained at a constant level until reproductive age was achieved. The accessions were selected based on the expression levels of <i>ANNEXIN1</i>, a drought-related marker. Severe WD conditions had a greater effect on most of the measured morphophysiological traits than moderate WD conditions. Multivariate analyses indicated that trait responses associated with plant size and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> management drove most of the variation. Accessions with similar responses at these two levels were grouped in clusters that displayed different response strategies to WD. The expression levels of selected stress-response genes revealed large natural variation under WD conditions. Responses of morphophysiological traits, such as projected rosette area, transpiration rate, and rosette <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> content, were correlated with changes in the expression of stress-related genes, such as <i>NINE-CIS-EPOXYCAROTENOID DIOXYGENASE3</i> and <i>N-MYC DOWNREGULATED-LIKE1</i> (<i>NDL1</i>), in response to WD. Interestingly, the morphophysiological acclimation response to WD also was reflected in the gene expression levels (most notably those of <i>NDL1</i>, <i>CHALCONE SYNTHASE</i>, and <i>MYB DOMAIN PROTEIN44</i>) in plants cultivated under well-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>ed conditions. Our results may lead to the development of biomarkers and predictors of plant morphophysiological responses based on gene expression patterns.</p>

Diurnal Variation in Gas Exchange: The Balance between Carbon Fixation and Water Loss
<p>Stomatal control of transpiration is critical for maintaining important processes, such as plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> status, leaf temperature, as well as permitting sufficient CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion into the leaf to maintain photosynthetic rates (<i>A</i>). Stomatal conductance often closely correlates with <i>A</i> and is thought to control the balance between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> loss and carbon gain. It has been suggested that a mesophyll-driven signal coordinates <i>A</i> and stomatal conductance responses to maintain this relationship; however, the signal has yet to be fully elucidated. Despite this correlation under stable environmental conditions, the responses of both parameters vary spatially and temporally and are dependent on species, environment, and plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> status. Most current models neglect these aspects of gas exchange, although it is clear that they play a vital role in the balance of carbon fixation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> loss. Future efforts should consider the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic nature of whole-plant gas exchange and how it represents much more than the sum of its individual leaf-level components, and they should take into consideration the long-term effect on gas exchange over time.</p>

Variable Mesophyll Conductance among Soybean Cultivars Sets a Tradeoff between Photosynthesis and Water-Use-Efficiency
<p>Photosynthetic efficiency is a critical determinant of crop yield potential, although it remains below the theoretical optimum in modern crop varieties. Enhancing mesophyll conductance (i.e. the rate of carbon dioxide diffusion from substomatal cavities to the sites of carboxylation) may increase photosynthetic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use efficiencies. To improve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use efficiency, mesophyll conductance should be increased without concomitantly increasing stomatal conductance. Here, we partition the variance in mesophyll conductance to within- and among-cultivar components across soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) grown under both controlled and field conditions and examine the covariation of mesophyll conductance with photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use efficiency, and leaf mass per area. We demonstrate that mesophyll conductance varies more than 2-fold and that 38% of this variation is due to cultivar identity. As expected, mesophyll conductance is positively correlated with photosynthetic rates. However, a strong positive correlation between mesophyll and stomatal conductance among cultivars apparently impedes positive scaling between mesophyll conductance and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use efficiency in soybean. Contrary to expectations, photosynthetic rates and mesophyll conductance both increased with increasing leaf mass per area. The presence of genetic variation for mesophyll conductance suggests that there is potential to increase photosynthesis and mesophyll conductance by selecting for greater leaf mass per area. Increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use efficiency, though, is unlikely unless there is simultaneous stabilizing selection on stomatal conductance.</p>

Stability of Single-Parent Gene Expression Complementation in Maize Hybrids upon Water Deficit Stress
<p>Heterosis is the superior performance of F1 hybrids compared with their homozygous, genetically distinct parents. In this study, we monitored the transcriptomic divergence of the maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) inbred lines B73 and Mo17 and their reciprocal F1 hybrid progeny in primary roots under control and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit conditions simulated by polyethylene glycol treatment. Single-parent expression (SPE) of genes is an extreme instance of gene expression complementation, in which genes are active in only one of two parents but are expressed in both reciprocal hybrids. In this study, 1,997 genes only expressed in B73 and 2,024 genes only expressed in Mo17 displayed SPE complementation under control and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit conditions. As a consequence, the number of active genes in hybrids exceeded the number of active genes in the parental inbred lines significantly independent of treatment. SPE patterns were substantially more stable to expression changes by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit treatment than other genotype-specific expression profiles. While, on average, 75% of all SPE patterns were not altered in response to polyethylene glycol treatment, only 17% of the remaining genotype-specific expression patterns were not changed by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit. Nonsyntenic genes that lack syntenic orthologs in other grass species, and thus evolved late in the grass lineage, were significantly overrepresented among SPE genes. Hence, the significant overrepresentation of nonsyntenic genes among SPE patterns and their stability under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> limitation might suggest a function of these genes during the early developmental manifestation of heterosis under fluctuating environmental conditions in hybrid progeny of the inbred lines B73 and Mo17.</p>

Xylem Surfactants Introduce a New Element to the Cohesion-Tension Theory
<p>Vascular plants transport <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> under negative pressure without constantly creating gas bubbles that would disable their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic systems. Attempts to replicate this feat in artificial systems almost invariably result in bubble formation, except under highly controlled conditions with pure <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> and only hydrophilic surfaces present. In theory, conditions in the xylem should favor bubble nucleation even more: there are millions of conduits with at least some hydrophobic surfaces, and xylem sap is saturated or sometimes supersaturated with atmospheric gas and may contain surface-active molecules that can lower surface tension. So how do plants transport <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> under negative pressure? Here, we show that angiosperm xylem contains abundant hydrophobic surfaces as well as insoluble lipid surfactants, including phospholipids, and proteins, a composition similar to pulmonary surfactants. Lipid surfactants were found in xylem sap and as nanoparticles under transmission electron microscopy in pores of intervessel pit membranes and deposited on vessel wall surfaces. Nanoparticles observed in xylem sap via nanoparticle-tracking analysis included surfactant-coated nanobubbles when examined by freeze-fracture electron microscopy. Based on their fracture behavior, this technique is able to distinguish between dense-core particles, liquid-filled, bilayer-coated vesicles/liposomes, and gas-filled bubbles. Xylem surfactants showed strong surface activity that reduces surface tension to low values when concentrated as they are in pit membrane pores. We hypothesize that xylem surfactants support <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> transport under negative pressure as explained by the cohesion-tension theory by coating hydrophobic surfaces and nanobubbles, thereby keeping the latter below the critical size at which bubbles would expand to form embolisms.</p>

Mechanical Failure of Fine Root Cortical Cells Initiates Plant Hydraulic Decline during Drought
<p>Root systems perform the crucial task of absorbing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> from the soil to meet the demands of a transpiring canopy. Roots are thought to operate like electrical fuses, which break when carrying an excessive load under conditions of drought stress. Yet the exact site and sequence of this dysfunction in roots remain elusive. Using in vivo x-ray computed microtomography, we found that drought-induced mechanical failure (i.e. lacunae formation) in fine root cortical cells is the initial and primary driver of reduced fine root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductivity (Lp<sub>r</sub>) under mild to moderate drought stress. Cortical lacunae started forming under mild drought stress (−0.6 MPa Ψ<sub>stem</sub>), coincided with a dramatic reduction in Lp<sub>r</sub>, and preceded root shrinkage or significant xylem embolism. Only under increased drought stress was embolism formation observed in the root xylem, and it appeared first in the fine roots (50% loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductivity [P<sub>50</sub>] reached at −1.8 MPa) and then in older, coarse roots (P<sub>50</sub> = −3.5 MPa). These results suggest that cortical cells in fine roots function like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic fuses that decouple plants from drying soil, thus preserving the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic integrity of the plant’s vascular system under early stages of drought stress. Cortical lacunae formation led to permanent structural damage of the root cortex and nonrecoverable Lp<sub>r</sub>, pointing to a role in fine root mortality and turnover under drought stress.</p>

Cardiac function and infarct size were evaluated by MRI, arrhythmia incidence by implanted loop recorders, and the engraftment rate by calculation of quantitative polymerase chain reaction measurements of expression of the human Y chromosome. Additional studies examined the myocardial protein expression profile changes and potential mechanisms of action that related to exosomes from the cell patch.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The hCMPs began to beat synchronously within 1 day of fabrication, and after 7 days of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic culture stimulation, in vitro assessments indicated the mechanisms related to the improvements in electronic mechanical coupling, calcium-handling, and force generation, suggesting a maturation process during the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic culture.

Exercise Dynamics in Secondary Mitral Regurgitation
<p>Secondary mitral valve regurgitation (MR) remains a challenging problem in the diagnostic workup and treatment of patients with heart failure. Although secondary MR is characteristically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic in nature and sensitive to changes in ventricular geometry and loading, current therapy is mainly focused on resting conditions. An exercise-induced increase in secondary MR, however, is associated with impaired exercise capacity and increased mortality. In an era where a multitude of percutaneous solutions are emerging for the treatment of patients with heart failure, it becomes important to address the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic component of secondary MR during exercise as well. A critical reappraisal of the underlying disease mechanisms, in particular the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic component during exercise, is of timely importance. This review summarizes the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic deterioration of secondary MR during exercise, its functional and prognostic impact, and the way current treatment options affect the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic lesion and exercise hemo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics in general.</p>

Breakup of last glacial deep stratification in the South Pacific
<p>Stratification of the deep Southern Ocean during the Last Glacial Maximum is thought to have facilitated carbon storage and subsequent release during the deglaciation as stratification broke down, contributing to atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> rise. Here, we present neodymium isotope evidence from deep to abyssal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>s in the South Pacific that confirms stratification of the deep<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> column during the Last Glacial Maximum. The results indicate a glacial northward expansion of Ross Sea Bottom <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> and a Southern Hemisphere climate trigger for the deglacial breakup of deep stratification. It highlights the important role of abyssal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>s in sustaining a deep glacial carbon reservoir and Southern Hemisphere climate change as a prerequisite for the destabilization of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> column and hence the deglacial release of sequestered CO<sub>2</sub> through upwelling.</p>

Wrapping with a splash: High-speed encapsulation with ultrathin sheets
<p>Many complex fluids rely on surfactants to contain, protect, or isolate liquid drops in an immiscible continuous phase. Thin elastic sheets can wrap liquid drops in a spontaneous process driven by capillary forces. For encapsulation by sheets to be practically viable, a rapid, continuous, and scalable process is essential. We exploit the fast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of droplet impact to achieve wrapping of oil droplets by ultrathin polymer films in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> phase. Despite the violence of splashing events, the process robustly yields wrappings that are optimally shaped to maximize the enclosed fluid volume and have near-perfect seams. We achieve wrappings of targeted three-dimensional (3D) shapes by tailoring the 2D boundary of the films and show the generality of the technique by producing both oil-in-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-in-oil wrappings.</p>

Enzyme-free nucleic acid dynamical systems
<p>Chemistries exhibiting complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics—from inorganic oscillators to gene regulatory networks—have been long known but either cannot be reprogrammed at will or rely on the sophisticated enzyme chemistry underlying the central dogma. Can simpler molecular mechanisms, designed from scratch, exhibit the same range of behaviors? Abstract chemical reaction networks have been proposed as a programming language for complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics, along with their systematic implementation using short synthetic DNA molecules. We developed this technology for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ical systems by identifying critical design principles and codifying them into a compiler automating the design process. Using this approach, we built an oscillator containing only DNA components, establishing that Watson-Crick base-pairing interactions alone suffice for complex chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics and that autonomous molecular systems can be designed via molecular programming languages.</p>

The glycosylation pathway is required for the secretion of Slit and for the maintenance of the Slit receptor Robo on axons
<p>Slit proteins act as repulsive axon guidance cues by activating receptors of the Roundabout (Robo) family. During early neurogenesis in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, Slit pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vent</span></strong>s the growth cones of longitudinal tract neurons from inappropriately crossing the midline, thus restricting these cells to trajectories parallel to the midline. Slit is expressed in midline glial cells, and Robo is present in longitudinal axon tracts and growth cones. We showed that the enzyme Mummy (Mmy) controlled Slit-Robo signaling through mechanisms that affected both the ligand and the receptor. Mmy was required for the glycosylation of Slit, which was essential for Slit secretion. Mmy was also required for maintaining the abundance and spatial distribution of Robo through an indirect mechanism that was independent of Slit secretion. Moreover, secretion of Slit was required to maintain the fasciculation and position of longitudinal axon tracts, thus maintaining the hardwiring of the nervous system. Thus, Mmy is required for Slit secretion and for maintaining Robo abundance and distribution in the developing nervous system in <i>Drosophila</i>.</p>

Increased Cardiac Arrhythmogenesis Associated With Gap Junction Remodeling With Upregulation of RNA-Binding Protein FXR1
<sec><title>Background:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong> junction remodeling is well established as a consistent feature of human heart disease involving spontaneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vent</span></strong>ricular arrhythmia. The mechanisms responsible for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong> junction remodeling that include alterations in the distribution of, and protein expression within, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong> junctions are still debated. Studies reveal that multiple transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulatory pathways are triggered in response to cardiac disease, such as those involving RNA-binding proteins. The expression levels of FXR1 (fragile X mental retardation autosomal homolog 1), an RNA-binding protein, are critical to maintain proper cardiac muscle function; however, the connection between FXR1 and disease is not clear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To identify the mechanisms regulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong> junction remodeling in cardiac disease, we sought to identify the functional properties of FXR1 expression, direct targets of FXR1 in human left <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vent</span></strong>ricle dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) biopsy samples and mouse models of DCM through BioID proximity assay and RNA immunoprecipitation, how FXR1 regulates its targets through RNA stability and luciferase assays, and functional consequences of altering the levels of this important RNA-binding protein through the analysis of cardiac-specific FXR1 knockout mice and mice injected with 3xMyc-FXR1 adeno-associated virus.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>FXR1 expression is significantly increased in tissue samples from human and mouse models of DCM via Western blot analysis.

Our findings show that FXR1 is a multifunctional protein involved in translational regulation and stabilization of its mRNA targets in heart muscle. In addition, intro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>ion of 3xMyc-FXR1 via adeno-associated virus into mice leads to the redistribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong> junctions and promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vent</span></strong>ricular tachycardia, showing the functional significance of FXR1 upregulation observed in DCM.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In DCM, increased FXR1 expression appears to play an important role in disease progression by regulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong> junction remodeling.

Elimination of the male reproductive tract in the female embryo is promoted by COUP-TFII in mice
<p>The sexual differentiation paradigm contends that the female pattern of the repro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>ive system is established by default because the male repro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>ive tracts (Wolffian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>s) in the female degenerate owing to a lack of androgen. Here, we discovered that female mouse embryos lacking <i>Coup-tfII</i> (chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor II) in the Wolffian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong> mesenchyme became intersex—possessing both female and male repro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>ive tracts. Retention of Wolffian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>s was not caused by ectopic androgen pro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>ion or action. Instead, enhanced phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling in Wolffian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong> epithelium was responsible for the retention of male structures in an androgen-independent manner. We thus suggest that elimination of Wolffian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>s in female embryos is actively promoted by COUP-TFII, which suppresses a mesenchyme-epithelium cross-talk responsible for Wolffian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong> maintenance.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
An atrial-fibrillation-linked connexin40 mutant is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and impairs the function of atrial gap-junction channels
<p>Connexin40 (Cx40)-containing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong>-junction channels are expressed in the atrial myocardium and provide a low-resistance passage for rapid impulse propagation. A germline mutation in the <i>GJA5</i> gene, which encodes Cx40, resulting in a truncated Cx40 (Q49X) was identified in a large Chinese family with lone (idiopathic) atrial fibrillation (AF). This mutation co-segregated with seven AF probands in an autosomal-dominant way over generations. To test the hypothesis that this Cx40 mutant affects the distribution and function of atrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong> junctions, we studied the Q49X mutant in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong>-junction-deficient HeLa and N2A cells. The Q49X mutant, unlike wild-type Cx40, was typically localized in the cytoplasm and failed to form <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong>-junction plaques at cell-cell interfaces. When the Q49X mutant was co-expressed with Cx40 or Cx43, the mutant substantially reduced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong>-junction plaque formation of Cx40 and Cx43. Electrophysiological studies revealed no electrical coupling of cell pairs expressing the mutant alone and a significant decrease in the coupling con<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>ance when the mutant was co-expressed with Cx40 or Cx43. Further colocalization experiments with the organelle residential proteins indicate that Q49X was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. These findings provide evidence that the Q49X mutant is capable of impairing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong>-junction distribution and function of key atrial connexins, which might play a role in the predisposition to and onset of AF.</p>

Bismuthene on a SiC substrate: A candidate for a high-temperature quantum spin Hall material
<p>Quantum spin Hall materials hold the promise of revolutionary devices with dissipationless spin currents but have required cryogenic temperatures owing to small energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong>s. Here we show theoretically that a room-temperature regime with a large energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong> may be achievable within a paradigm that exploits the atomic spin-orbit coupling. The concept is based on a substrate-supported monolayer of a high–atomic number element and is experimentally realized as a bismuth honeycomb lattice on top of the insulating silicon carbide substrate SiC(0001). Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we detect a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong> of ~0.8 electron volt and con<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>ive edge states consistent with theory. Our combined theoretical and experimental results demonstrate a concept for a quantum spin Hall wide-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong> scenario, where the chemical potential resides in the global system <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong>, ensuring robust edge con<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>ance.</p>

Discovery of orbital-selective Cooper pairing in FeSe
<p>The supercon<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>or iron selenide (FeSe) is of intense interest owing to its unusual nonmagnetic nematic state and potential for high-temperature supercon<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>ivity. But its Cooper pairing mechanism has not been determined. We used Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference imaging to determine the Fermi surface geometry of the electronic bands surrounding the Γ = (0, 0) and <i>X</i> = (π/<i>a</i><sub>Fe</sub>, 0) points of FeSe and to measure the corresponding supercon<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>ing energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong>s.

Moreover, by implementing a novel technique, we demonstrate that these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong>s have opposite sign with respect to each other. This complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong> configuration reveals the existence of orbital-selective Cooper pairing that, in FeSe, is based preferentially on electrons from the d<i><sub>yz</sub></i> orbitals of the iron atoms.</p>

Mind the gap: Neural coding of species identity in birdsong prosody
<p>Juvenile songbirds learn vocal communication from adult tutors of the same species but not from adults of other species. How species-specific learning emerges from the basic features of song prosody remains unknown. In the zebra finch auditory cortex, we discovered a class of neurons that register the silent temporal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong>s between song syllables and are distinct from neurons encoding syllable morphology. Behavioral learning and neuronal coding of temporal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong> structure resisted song tutoring from other species: Zebra finches fostered by Bengalese finch parents learned Bengalese finch song morphology transposed onto zebra finch temporal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong>s. During the vocal learning period, temporal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong> neurons fired selectively to zebra finch song. The innate temporal coding of intersyllable silent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong>s suggests a neuronal barcode for conspecific vocal learning and social communication in acoustically diverse environments.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
<i>CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1</i> (<i>CCA1</i>) and the Circadian Control of Stomatal Aperture
<p>The endogenous circadian (∼24 h) system allows plants to anticipate and adapt to daily environmental changes. Stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apertur</span></strong>e is one of the many processes under circadian control; stomatal opening and closing occurs under constant conditions, even in the absence of environmental cues. To understand the significance of circadian-mediated anticipation in stomatal opening, we have generated <i>SGC</i> (specifically guard cell) Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants in which the oscillator gene <i>CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1</i> (<i>CCA1</i>) was overexpressed under the control of the guard-cell-specific promoter, <i>GC1.</i> The <i>SGC</i> plants showed a loss of ability to open stomata in anticipation of daily dark-to-light changes and of circadian-mediated stomatal opening in constant light. We observed that under fully watered and mild drought conditions, <i>SGC</i> plants outperform wild type with larger leaf area and biomass. To investigate the molecular basis for circadian control of guard cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apertur</span></strong>e, we used large-scale qRT-PCR to compare circadian oscillator gene expression in guard cells compared with the “average” whole-leaf oscillator and examined gene expression and stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apertur</span></strong>e in several lines of plants with misexpressed <i>CCA1</i>. Our results show that the guard cell oscillator is different from the average plant oscillator. Moreover, the differences in guard cell oscillator function may be important for the correct regulation of photoperiod pathway genes that have previously been reported to control stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apertur</span></strong>e. We conclude by showing that CONSTANS and FLOWERING LOCUS T, components of the photoperiod pathway that regulate flowering time, also control stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apertur</span></strong>e in a daylength-dependent manner.</p>

Aperture effects in squid jet propulsion
<p>Squid are the largest jet propellers in nature as adults, but as paralarvae they are some of the smallest, faced with the inherent inefficiency of jet propulsion at a low Reynolds number. In this study we describe the behavior and kinematics of locomotion in 1 mm paralarvae of <i>Dosidicus gigas</i>, the smallest squid yet studied. They swim with hop-and-sink behavior and can engage in fast jets by reducing the size of the mantle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apertur</span></strong>e during the contraction phase of a jetting cycle. We go on to explore the general effects of a variable mantle and funnel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apertur</span></strong>e in a theoretical model of jet propulsion scaled from the smallest (1 mm mantle length) to the largest (3 m) squid. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apertur</span></strong>e re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>ion during mantle contraction increases propulsive efficiency at all squid sizes, although 1 mm squid still suffer from low efficiency (20%) because of a limited speed of contraction. Efficiency increases to a peak of 40% for 1 cm squid, then slowly declines. Squid larger than 6 cm must either reduce contraction speed or increase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apertur</span></strong>e size to maintain stress within maximal muscle tolerance. Ecological pressure to maintain maximum velocity may lead them to increase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apertur</span></strong>e size, which reduces efficiency. This effect might be ameliorated by nonaxial flow during the refill phase of the cycle. Our model's predictions highlight areas for future empirical work, and emphasize the existence of complex behavioral options for maximizing efficiency at both very small and large sizes.</p>

Rac signal adaptation controls neutrophil mobilization from the bone marrow
<p>Mobilization of neutrophils from the bone marrow determines neutrophil blood counts and thus is medically important. Balanced neutrophil mobilization from the bone marrow depends on the retention-promoting chemokine CXCL12 and its receptor CXCR4 and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">egress</span></strong>ion-promoting chemokine CXCL2 and its receptor CXCR2. Both pathways activate the small guanosine triphosphatase Rac, leaving the role of this signaling e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vent</span></strong> in neutrophil retention and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">egress</span></strong>ion ambiguous. On the assumption that active Rac determines persistent directional cell migration, we generated a mathematical model to link chemokine-mediated Rac modulation to neutrophil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">egress</span></strong>ion time. Our computer simulation indicated that, in the bone marrow, where the retention signal predominated, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">egress</span></strong>ion time strictly depended on the time it took Rac to return to its basal activity (namely, adaptation). This prediction was validated in mice lacking the Rac inhibitor ArhGAP15. Neutrophils in these mice showed prolonged Rac adaptation and cell-autonomous retention in the bone marrow. Our model thus demonstrates that mobilization in the presence of two spatially defined opposing chemotactic cues strictly depends on inhibitors shaping the time course of signal adaptation. Furthermore, our findings might help to find new modes of inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vent</span></strong>ion to treat conditions characterized by excessively low or high circulating neutrophils.</p>

Carrier lifetimes of >1 μs in Sn-Pb perovskites enable efficient all-perovskite tandem solar cells
<p>All-perovskite–based polycrystalline thin-film tandem solar cells have the potential to deliver efficiencies of >30%. However, the performance of all-perovskite–based tandem devices has been limited by the lack of high-efficiency, low–band <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong> tin-lead (Sn-Pb) mixed-perovskite solar cells (PSCs).

Coherent single-atom superradiance
<p>Superradiance is a quantum phenomenon emerging in macroscopic systems whereby correlated single atoms cooperatively emit photons. Demonstration of controlled collective atom-field interactions has resulted from the ability to directly imprint correlations with an atomic ensemble. Here we report cavity-mediated coherent single-atom superradiance: Single atoms with predefined correlation traverse a high–quality factor cavity one by one, emitting photons cooperatively with the <i>N</i> atoms that have already gone through the cavity (<i>N</i> represents the number of atoms). Enhanced collective photoemission of <i>N</i>-squared dependence was observed even when the intracavity atom number was less than unity. The correlation among single atoms was achieved by nanometer-precision position control and phase-aligned state manipulation of atoms by using a nanohole-array <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apertur</span></strong>e.

Limited acclimation in leaf anatomy to experimental drought in tropical rainforest trees
<p>Dry periods are predicted to become more frequent and severe in the future in some parts of the tropics, including Amazonia, potentially causing reduced pro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>ivity, higher tree mortality and increased emissions of stored carbon. Using a long-term (12 year) through-fall exclusion (TFE) experiment in the tropics, we test the hypothesis that trees produce leaves adapted to cope with higher levels of water stress, by examining the following leaf characteristics: area, thickness, leaf mass per area, vein density, stomatal density, the thickness of palisade mesophyll, spongy mesophyll and both of the epidermal layers, internal cavity volume and the average cell sizes of the palisade and spongy mesophyll. We also test whether differences in leaf anatomy are consistent with observed differential drought-induced mortality responses among taxa, and look for relationships between leaf anatomy, and leaf water relations and gas exchange parameters. Our data show that trees do not produce leaves that are more xeromorphic in response to 12 years of soil moisture deficit. However, the drought treatment did result in increases in the thickness of the adaxial epidermis (TFE: 20.5 ± 1.5 µm, control: 16.7 ± 1.0 µm) and the internal cavity volume (TFE: 2.43 ± 0.50 mm<sup>3</sup> cm<sup>−2</sup>, control: 1.77 ± 0.30 mm<sup>3 </sup>cm<sup>−2</sup>). No consistent differences were detected between drought-resistant and drought-sensitive taxa, although interactions occurred between drought-sensitivity status and drought treatment for the palisade mesophyll thickness (<i>P</i> = 0.034) and the cavity volume of the leaves (<i>P</i> = 0.025). The limited response to water deficit probably reflects a tight co-ordination between leaf morphology, water relations and photosynthetic properties. This suggests that there is little plasticity in these aspects of plant anatomy in these taxa, and that phenotypic plasticity in leaf traits may not facilitate the acclimation of Amazonian trees to the predicted future re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>ions in dry season water availability.</p>

Photon-mediated interactions between quantum emitters in a diamond nanocavity
<p>Photon-mediated interactions between quantum systems are essential for realizing quantum networks and scalable quantum information processing. We demonstrate such interactions between pairs of silicon-vacancy (SiV) color centers coupled to a diamond nanophotonic cavity. When the optical transitions of the two color centers are tuned into resonance, the coupling to the common cavity mode results in a coherent interaction between them, leading to spectrally resolved superradiant and subradiant states. We use the electronic spin degrees of freedom of the SiV centers to control these optically mediated interactions. Such controlled interactions will be crucial in developing cavity-mediated quantum gates between spin qubits and for realizing scalable quantum network nodes.</p>

Rapid change of superconductivity and electron-phonon coupling through critical doping in Bi-2212
<p>Electron-boson coupling plays a key role in supercon<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>ivity for many systems. However, in copper-based high–critical temperature (<i>T</i><sub>c</sub>) supercon<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>ors, its relation to supercon<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>ivity remains controversial despite strong spectroscopic fingerprints. In this study, we used angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to find a pronounced correlation between the supercon<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>ing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong> and the bosonic coupling strength near the Brillouin zone boundary in Bi<sub>2</sub>Sr<sub>2</sub>CaCu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8+δ</sub>. The bosonic coupling strength rapidly increases from the overdoped Fermi liquid regime to the optimally doped strange metal, concomitant with the quadrupled supercon<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>ing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong> and the doubled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong>-to-<i>T</i><sub>c</sub> ratio across the pseudo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong> boundary. This synchronized lattice and electronic response suggests that the effects of electronic interaction and the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) reinforce each other in a positive-feedback loop upon entering the strange-metal regime, which in turn drives a stronger supercon<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>ivity.</p>

Cavity-mediated collective spin-exchange interactions in a strontium superradiant laser

A key challenge toward these goals is to understand and control coherent interactions between the atoms. We observe long-range exchange interactions mediated by an optical cavity, which manifest as tunable spin-spin interactions on the pseudo spin-½ system composed of the millihertz linewidth clock transition in strontium. This leads to one-axis twisting dynamics, the emergence of a many-body energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong>, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong> protection of the optical coherence against certain sources of decoherence.

Structural insights into ion conduction by channelrhodopsin 2
<p>The light-gated ion channel channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2) from <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> is a major optogenetic tool. Photon absorption starts a well-characterized photocycle, but the structural basis for the regulation of channel opening remains unclear. We present high-resolution structures of ChR2 and the C128T mutant, which has a markedly increased open-state lifetime. The structure reveals two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caviti</span></strong>es on the intracellular side and two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caviti</span></strong>es on the extracellular side. They are connected by extended hydrogen-bonding networks involving water molecules and side-chain residues. Central is the retinal Schiff base that controls and synchronizes three gates that separate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caviti</span></strong>es. Separate from this network is the DC gate that comprises a water-mediated bond between C128 and D156 and interacts directly with the retinal Schiff base. Comparison with the C128T structure reveals a direct connection of the DC gate to the central gate and suggests how the gating mechanism is affected by subtle tuning of the Schiff base’s interactions.</p>

We report, at telecommunication wavelengths, geometry-independent and integrated nonreciprocal topological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caviti</span></strong>es that couple stimulated emission from one-way photonic edge states to a selected waveguide output with an isolation ratio in excess of 10 decibels. Nonreciprocity originates from unidirectional edge states at the boundary between photonic structures with distinct topological invariants. Our experimental demonstration of lasing from topological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caviti</span></strong>es provides the opportunity to develop complex topological circuitry of arbitrary geometries for the integrated and robust generation and transport of photons in classical and quantum regimes.</p>

Size effect in ion transport through angstrom-scale slits
<p>In the field of nanofluidics, it has been an ultimate but seemingly distant goal to controllably fabricate capillaries with dimensions approaching the size of small ions and water molecules. We report ion transport through ultimately narrow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">slit</span></strong>s that are fabricated by effectively removing a single atomic plane from a bulk crystal. The atomically flat angstrom-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">slit</span></strong>s exhibit little surface charge, allowing elucidation of the role of steric effects. We find that ions with hydrated diameters larger than the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">slit</span></strong> size can still permeate through, albeit with reduced mobility. The confinement also leads to a notable asymmetry between anions and cations of the same diameter. Our results provide a platform for studying the effects of angstrom-scale confinement, which is important for the development of nanofluidics, molecular separation, and other nanoscale technologies.</p>

Principles for designing proteins with cavities formed by curved β sheets
<p>Active sites and ligand-binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caviti</span></strong>es in native proteins are often formed by curved β sheets, and the ability to control β-sheet curvature would allow design of binding proteins with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caviti</span></strong>es customized to specific ligands. Toward this end, we investigated the mechanisms controlling β-sheet curvature by studying the geometry of β sheets in naturally occurring protein structures and folding simulations. The principles emerging from this analysis were used to design, de novo, a series of proteins with curved β sheets topped with α helices. Nuclear magnetic resonance and crystal structures of the designs closely match the computational models, showing that β-sheet curvature can be controlled with atomic-level accuracy. Our approach enables the design of proteins with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caviti</span></strong>es and provides a route to custom design ligand-binding and catalytic sites.</p>

Pollen Aperture Factor INP1 Acts Late in Aperture Formation by Excluding Specific Membrane Domains from Exine Deposition
<p>Accurate placement of extracellular materials is a critical part of cellular development. To study how cells achieve this accuracy, we use formation of pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apertur</span></strong>es as a model. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), three regions on the pollen surface lack deposition of pollen wall exine and develop into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apertur</span></strong>es. In developing pollen, Arabidopsis <i>IN<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apertur</span></strong>ATE POLLEN1</i> (INP1) protein acts as a marker for the pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apertur</span></strong>e domains, assembling there into three punctate lines. To understand the mechanism of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apertur</span></strong>e formation, we studied the dynamics of INP1 expression and localization and its relationship with the membrane domains at which it assembles. We found that INP1 assembly occurs after meiotic cytokinesis at the interface between the plasma membrane and the overlying callose wall, and requires the normal callose wall formation. Sites of INP1 localization coincide with positions of protruding membrane ridges in proximity to the callose wall. Our data suggest that INP1 is a late-acting factor involved in keeping specific membrane domains next to the callose wall to pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vent</span></strong> formation of exine at these sites.</p>

Duct Stenting Versus Modified Blalock-Taussig Shunt in Neonates With Duct-Dependent Pulmonary Blood Flow
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Infants born with cardiac abnormalities causing dependence on the arterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong> for pulmonary blood flow are often palliated with a shunt usually between the subclavian artery and either pulmonary artery. A so-called modified Blalock-Taussig shunt allows progress through early life to an age and weight at which repair or further more stable palliation can be safely achieved. Modified Blalock-Taussig shunts continue to present concern for postprocedural instability and early mortality such that other alternatives continue to be explored. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong> stenting (DS) is emerging as one such alternative with potential for greater early stability and improved survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The purpose of this study was to compare postprocedural outcomes and survival to next-stage palliative or reparative surgery between patients undergoing a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt or a DS in infants with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>-dependent pulmonary blood flow. All patients undergoing cardiac surgery and congenital inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vent</span></strong>ions in the United Kingdom are prospectively recruited to an externally validated national outcome audit.

VEGF–neuropilin-2 signaling promotes stem-like traits in breast cancer cells by TAZ-mediated repression of the Rac GAP β2-chimaerin
<p>The role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling in cancer is not only well known in the context of angiogenesis but also important in the functional regulation of tumor cells. Autocrine VEGF signaling mediated by its co-receptors called neuropilins (NRPs) appears to be essential for sustaining the proliferation and survival of cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are implicated in mediating tumor growth, progression, and drug resistance. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms involved in VEGF-mediated support of CSCs is critical to successfully treating cancer patients. The expression of the Hippo effector TAZ is associated with breast CSCs and confers stem cell–like properties. We found that VEGF-NRP2 signaling contributed to the activation of TAZ in various breast cancer cells, which mediated a positive feedback loop that promoted mammosphere formation. VEGF-NRP2 signaling activated the GTPase Rac1, which inhibited the Hippo kinase LATS, thus leading to TAZ activity. In a complex with the transcription factor TEAD, TAZ then bound and repressed the promoter of the gene encoding the Rac GTPase-activating protein (Rac GAP) β2-chimaerin. By activating GTP hydrolysis, Rac GAPs effectively turn off Rac signaling; hence, the TAZ-mediated repression of β2-chimaerin resulted in sustained Rac1 activity in CSCs. Depletion of β2-chimaerin in non-CSCs increased Rac1 activity, TAZ abundance, and mammosphere formation. Analysis of a breast cancer patient database revealed an inverse correlation between β2-chimaerin and TAZ expression in tumors. Our findings highlight an unexpected role for β2-chimaerin in a feed-forward loop of TAZ activation and the acquisition of CSC properties.</p>

Suppressing spatiotemporal lasing instabilities with wave-chaotic microcavities
<p>Spatiotemporal instabilities are widespread phenomena resulting from complexity and nonlinearity. In broad-area edge-emitting semicon<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>or lasers, the nonlinear interactions of multiple spatial modes with the active medium can result in filamentation and spatiotemporal chaos. These instabilities degrade the laser performance and are extremely challenging to control. We demonstrate a powerful approach to suppress spatiotemporal instabilities using wave-chaotic or disordered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caviti</span></strong>es. The interference of many propagating waves with random phases in such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caviti</span></strong>es disrupts the formation of self-organized structures such as filaments, resulting in stable lasing dynamics. Our method provides a general and robust scheme to pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vent</span></strong> the formation and growth of nonlinear instabilities for a large variety of high-power lasers.</p>

Single-cell transcriptomics of the mouse kidney reveals potential cellular targets of kidney disease
<p>Our understanding of kidney disease pathogenesis is limited by an incomplete molecular characterization of the cell types responsible for the organ’s multiple homeostatic functions. To help fill this knowledge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong>, we characterized 57,979 cells from healthy mouse kidneys by using unbiased single-cell RNA sequencing. On the basis of gene expression patterns, we infer that inherited kidney diseases that arise from distinct genetic mutations but share the same phenotypic manifestation originate from the same differentiated cell type. We also found that the collecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong> in kidneys of adult mice generates a spectrum of cell types through a newly identified transitional cell. Computational cell trajectory analysis and in vivo lineage tracing revealed that intercalated cells and principal cells undergo transitions mediated by the Notch signaling pathway. In mouse and human kidney disease, these transitions were shifted toward a principal cell fate and were associated with metabolic acidosis.</p>

Fatty acyl recognition and transfer by an integral membrane <i>S</i>-acyltransferase
<p>DHHC (Asp-His-His-Cys) palmitoyltransferases are eukaryotic integral membrane enzymes that catalyze protein palmitoylation, which is important in a range of physiological processes, including small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) signaling, cell adhesion, and neuronal receptor scaffolding. We present crystal structures of two DHHC palmitoyltransferases and a covalent intermediate mimic. The active site resides at the membrane-cytosol interface, which allows the enzyme to catalyze thioester-exchange chemistry by using fatty acyl–coenzyme A and explains why membrane-proximal cysteines are candidates for palmitoylation. The acyl chain binds in a cavity formed by the transmembrane domain. We propose a mechanism for acyl chain–length selectivity in DHHC enzymes on the basis of cavity mutants with preferences for shorter and longer acyl chains.</p>

Monitoring and manipulating Higgs and Goldstone modes in a supersolid quantum gas
<p>Higgs and Goldstone modes are collective excitations of the amplitude and phase of an order parameter that is related to the breaking of a continuous symmetry. We directly studied these modes in a supersolid quantum gas created by coupling a Bose-Einstein condensate to two optical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caviti</span></strong>es, whose field amplitudes form the real and imaginary parts of a U(1)-symmetric order parameter. Monitoring the cavity fields in real time allowed us to observe the dynamics of the associated Higgs and Goldstone modes and revealed their amplitude and phase nature. We used a spectroscopic method to measure their frequencies, and we gave a tunable mass to the Goldstone mode by exploring the crossover between continuous and discrete symmetry. Our experiments link spectroscopic measurements to the theoretical concept of Higgs and Goldstone modes.</p>

Giant nonlinear response at a plasmonic nanofocus drives efficient four-wave mixing
<p>Efficient optical frequency mixing typically must accumulate over large interaction lengths because nonlinear responses in natural materials are inherently weak. This limits the efficiency of mixing processes owing to the requirement of phase matching. Here, we report efficient four-wave mixing (FWM) over micrometer-scale interaction lengths at telecommunications wavelengths on silicon. We used an integrated plasmonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong> waveguide that strongly confines light within a nonlinear organic polymer. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong> waveguide intensifies light by nanofocusing it to a mode cross-section of a few tens of nanometers, thus generating a nonlinear response so strong that efficient FWM accumulates over wavelength-scale distances. This technique opens up nonlinear optics to a regime of relaxed phase matching, with the possibility of compact, broadband, and efficient frequency mixing integrated with silicon photonics.</p>

Real-time spectral interferometry probes the internal dynamics of femtosecond soliton molecules
<p>Solitons, particle-like excitations ubiquitous in many fields of physics, have been shown to exhibit bound states akin to molecules. The formation of such temporal soliton bound states and their internal dynamics have escaped direct experimental observation. By means of an emerging time-stretch technique, we resolve the evolution of femtosecond soliton molecules in the cavity of a few-cycle mode-locked laser. We track two- and three-soliton bound states over hundreds of thousands of consecutive cavity roundtrips, identifying fixed points and periodic and aperiodic molecular orbits. A class of trajectories acquires a path-dependent geometrical phase, implying that its dynamics may be topologically protected. These findings highlight the importance of real-time detection in resolving interactions in complex nonlinear systems, including the dynamics of soliton bound states, breathers, and rogue waves.</p>

Mobile MUTE specifies subsidiary cells to build physiologically improved grass stomata

The novel role of <i>BdMUTE</i> in specifying lateral SCs appears linked to its acquisition of cell-to-cell mobility in <i>Brachypodium</i>.

Active sites in heterogeneous ice nucleation—the example of K-rich feldspars
<p>Ice formation on aerosol particles is a process of crucial importance to Earth’s climate and the environmental sciences, but it is not understood at the molecular level.

Here we report direct electron-microscopic observations of deposition growth of aligned ice crystals on feldspar, an atmospherically important component of mineral dust. Our molecular-scale computer simulations indicate that this alignment arises from the preferential nucleation of prismatic crystal planes of ice on high-energy (100) surface planes of feldspar.

Localization and in-Vivo Characterization of <i>Thapsia garganica</i> CYP76AE2 Indicates a Role in Thapsigargin Biosynthesis
<p>The Mediterranean plant <i>Thapsia garganica</i> (dicot, Apiaceae), also known as deadly carrot, produces the highly toxic compound thapsigargin. This compound is a potent inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase calcium pump in mammals and is of industrial importance as the active moiety of the anticancer drug mipsagargin, currently in clinical trials. Knowledge of thapsigargin in planta storage and biosynthesis has been limited. Here, we present the putative second step in thapsigargin biosynthesis, by showing that the cytochrome P450 TgCYP76AE2, transiently expressed in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>, converts epikunzeaol into epidihydrocostunolide. Furthermore, we show that thapsigargin is likely to be stored in secretory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>s in the roots. Transcripts from TgTPS2 (epikunzeaol synthase) and TgCYP76AE2 in roots were found only in the epithelial cells lining these secretory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>s. This emphasizes the involvement of these cells in the biosynthesis of thapsigargin. This study paves the way for further studies of thapsigargin biosynthesis.</p>

Dirigent Protein Mode of Action Revealed by the Crystal Structure of AtDIR6

We present the crystal structure of the (−)-pinoresinol forming DIRIGENT PROTEIN6 (AtDIR6) from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) with data to 1.4 Å resolution. The structure shows AtDIR6 as an eight-stranded antiparallel β-barrel that forms a trimer with spatially well-separated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caviti</span></strong>es for substrate binding. The binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caviti</span></strong>es are two lobed, exhibiting two opposing pockets, each lined with a set of hydrophilic and potentially catalytic residues, including essential aspartic acids. These residues are conserved between (+) and (−)-pinoresinol-forming DIRs and required for activity. The structure supports a model in which two substrate radicals bind to each of the DIR monomers. With the aromatic rings fixed in the two pockets, the propionyl side chains face each other for radical-radical coupling, and stereoselectivity is determined by the exact positioning of the side chains. Extensive mutational analysis supports a previously unrecognized function for DIRs in catalyzing the cyclization of the bis-quinone methide reaction intermediate to yield (+)- or (−)-pinoresinol.</p>

The role of the olfactory recess in olfactory airflow
<p>The olfactory recess – a blind pocket at the back of the nasal airway – is thought to play an important role in mammalian olfaction by sequestering air outside of the main airstream, thus giving odorants time to re-circulate. Several studies have shown that species with large olfactory recesses tend to have a well-developed sense of smell. However, no study has investigated how the size of the olfactory recess relates to air circulation near the olfactory epithelium. Here we used a computer model of the nasal cavity from a bat (<i>Carollia perspicillata</i>) to test the hypothesis that a larger olfactory recess improves olfactory airflow. We predicted that during inhalation, models with an enlarged olfactory recess would have slower rates of flow through the olfactory region (i.e. the olfactory recess plus airspace around the olfactory epithelium), while during exhalation these models would have little to no flow through the olfactory recess. To test these predictions, we experimentally modified the size of the olfactory recess while holding the rest of the morphology constant. During inhalation, we found that an enlarged olfactory recess resulted in lower rates of flow in the olfactory region. Upon exhalation, air flowed through the olfactory recess at a lower rate in the model with an enlarged olfactory recess. Taken together, these results indicate that an enlarged olfactory recess improves olfactory airflow during both inhalation and exhalation. These findings add to our growing understanding of how the morphology of the nasal cavity may relate to function in this understudied region of the skull.</p>

The distribution of heat in bone during radiofrequency ablation of an <i>ex vivo</i> bovine model of osteoid osteoma
<p>Osteoid osteoma is treated primarily by radiofrequency   (RF) ablation. However, there is little information about the distribution   of heat in bone during the procedure and its safety. We constructed   a model of osteoid osteoma to assess the distribution of heat in   bone and to define the margins of safety for ablation. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caviti</span></strong>es   were drilled in cadaver bovine bones and filled with a liver homogenate   to simulate the tumour matrix. Temperature-sensing probes were placed   in the bone in a radial fashion away from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caviti</span></strong>es. RF ablation   was performed 107 times in tumours < 10 mm in diameter (72 of   which were in cortical bone, 35 in cancellous bone), and 41 times   in cortical bone with models > 10 mm in diameter. Significantly   higher temperatures were found in cancellous bone than in cortical   bone (p < 0.05). For lesions up to 10 mm in diameter, in both   bone types, the temperature varied directly with the size of the   tumour (p < 0.05), and inversely with the distance from it. Tumours   of > 10 mm in diameter showed a trend similar to those of smaller   lesions. No temperature rise was seen beyond 12 mm from the edge   of a cortical tumour of any size. Formulae were developed to predict   the expected temperature in the bone during ablation.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014; 96-B:677–83</p>

Dedifferentiation, Proliferation, and Redifferentiation of Adult Mammalian Cardiomyocytes After Ischemic Injury
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Adult mammalian hearts have a limited ability to generate new cardiomyocytes. Proliferation of existing adult cardiomyocytes (ACMs) is a potential source of new cardiomyocytes. Understanding the fundamental biology of ACM proliferation could be of great clinical significance for treating myocardial infarction (MI). We aim to understand the process and regulation of ACM proliferation and its role in new cardiomyocyte formation of post-MI mouse hearts.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>β-Actin-green fluorescent protein transgenic mice and fate-mapping Myh6-MerCreMer-tdTomato/lacZ mice were used to trace the fate of ACMs. In a coculture system with neonatal rat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vent</span></strong>ricular myocytes, ACM proliferation was documented with clear evidence of cytokinesis observed with time-lapse imaging. Cardiomyocyte proliferation in the adult mouse post-MI heart was detected by cell cycle markers and 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine incorporation analysis. Echocardiography was used to measure cardiac function, and histology was performed to determine infarction size.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In vitro, mononucleated and bi/multinucleated ACMs were able to proliferate at a similar rate (7.0%) in the coculture. Dedifferentiation proceeded ACM proliferation, which was followed by redifferentiation. Redifferentiation was essential to endow the daughter cells with cardiomyocyte contractile function. Intercellular propagation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from contracting neonatal rat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vent</span></strong>ricular myocytes into ACM daughter cells was required to activate the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent calcineurin-nuclear factor of activated T-cell signaling pathway to induce ACM redifferentiation. The properties of neonatal rat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vent</span></strong>ricular myocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients influenced the rate of ACM redifferentiation. Hypoxia impaired the function of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong> junctions by dephosphorylating its component protein connexin 43, the major mediator of intercellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> propagation between cardiomyocytes, thereby impairing ACM redifferentiation. In vivo, ACM proliferation was found primarily in the MI border zone. An ischemia-resistant connexin 43 mutant enhanced the redifferentiation of ACM-derived new cardiomyocytes after MI and improved cardiac function.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Mature ACMs can reenter the cell cycle and form new cardiomyocytes through a 3-step process: dedifferentiation, proliferation, and redifferentiation. Intercellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal from neighboring functioning cardiomyocytes through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gap</span></strong> junctions induces the redifferentiation process. This novel mechanism contributes to new cardiomyocyte formation in post-MI hearts in mammals.</p></sec>

Prevalence, Incidence, and Mortality of Stroke in China
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>China bears the biggest stroke burden in the world. However, little is known about the current prevalence, incidence, and mortality of stroke at the national level, and the trend in the past 30 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In 2013, a nationally representative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">door</span></strong>-to-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">door</span></strong> survey was con<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">duct</span></strong>ed in 155 urban and rural centers in 31 provinces in China, totaling 480 687 adults aged ≥20 years. All stroke survivors were considered as prevalent stroke cases at the prevalent time (August 31, 2013). First-ever strokes that occurred during 1 year preceding the survey point-prevalent time were considered as incident cases. According to computed tomography/MRI/autopsy findings, strokes were categorized into ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke of undetermined type.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 480 687 participants, 7672 were diagnosed with a prevalent stroke (1596.0/100 000 people) and 1643 with incident strokes (345.1/100 000 person-years). The age-standardized prevalence, incidence, and mortality rates were 1114.8/100 000 people, 246.8 and 114.8/100 000 person-years, respectively. Pathological type of stroke was documented by computed tomography/MRI brain scanning in 90% of prevalent and 83% of incident stroke cases. Among incident and prevalent strokes, ischemic stroke constituted 69.6% and 77.8%, intracerebral hemorrhage 23.8% and 15.8%, subarachnoid hemorrhage 4.4% and 4.4%, and undetermined type 2.1% and 2.0%, respectively. Age-specific stroke prevalence in men aged ≥40 years was significantly greater than the prevalence in women (<i>P</i><0.001). The most prevalent risk factors among stroke survivors were hypertension (88%), smoking (48%), and alcohol use (44%). Stroke prevalence estimates in 2013 were statistically greater than those reported in China 3 decades ago, especially among rural residents (<i>P</i>=0.017). The highest annual incidence and mortality of stroke was in Northeast (365 and 159/100 000 person-years), then Central areas (326 and 154/100 000 person-years), and the lowest incidence was in Southwest China (154/100 000 person-years), and the lowest mortality was in South China (65/100 000 person-years) (<i>P</i><0.002).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Stroke burden in China has increased over the past 30 years, and remains particularly high in rural areas. There is a north-to-south gradient in stroke in China, with the greatest stroke burden observed in the northern and central regions.</p></sec>

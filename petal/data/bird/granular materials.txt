Bragg coherent diffractive imaging of single-grain defect dynamics in polycrystalline films
<p>Polycrystalline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al properties depend on the distribution and interactions of their crystalline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong>s. In particular, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> boundaries and defects are crucial in determining their response to external stimuli. A long-standing challenge is thus to observe individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong>s, defects, and strain dynamics inside functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als. Here we report a technique capable of revealing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> heterogeneity, including strain fields and individual dislocations, that can be used under operando conditions in reactive environments: <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> Bragg coherent diffractive imaging (gBCDI). Using a polycrystalline gold thin film subjected to heating, we show how gBCDI resolves <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> boundary and dislocation dynamics in individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong>s in three-dimensional detail with 10-nanometer spatial and subangstrom displacement field resolution. These results pave the way for understanding polycrystalline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al response under external stimuli and, ideally, engineering particular functions.</p>

Selective increase in CO<sub>2</sub> electroreduction activity at grain-boundary surface terminations
<p>Altering a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al’s catalytic properties requires identifying structural features that give rise to active surfaces. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> boundaries create strained regions in polycrystalline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als by stabilizing dislocations and may provide a way to create high-energy surfaces for catalysis that are kinetically trapped. Although <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong>-boundary density has previously been correlated with catalytic activity for some reactions, direct evidence that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> boundaries create surfaces with enhanced activity is lacking. We used a combination of bulk electrochemical measurements and scanning electrochemical cell microscopy with submicrometer resolution to show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong>-boundary surface terminations in gold electrodes are more active than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> surfaces for electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) reduction to carbon monoxide (CO) but not for the competing hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) evolution reaction. The catalytic footprint of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> boundary is commensurate with its dislocation-induced strain field, providing a strategy for broader exploitation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong>-boundary effects in heterogeneous catalysis.</p>

Segregation-induced ordered superstructures at general grain boundaries in a nickel-bismuth alloy
<p>The properties of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als change, sometimes catastrophically, as alloying elements and impurities accumulate preferentially at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> boundaries. Studies of bicrystals show that regular atomic patterns often arise as a result of this solute segregation at high-symmetry boundaries, but it is not known whether superstructures exist at general <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> boundaries in polycrystals. In bismuth-doped polycrystalline nickel, we found that ordered, segregation-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> boundary superstructures occur at randomly selected general <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> boundaries, and that these reconstructions are driven by the orientation of the terminating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> surfaces rather than by lattice matching between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong>s. This discovery shows that adsorbate-induced superstructures are not limited to special <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> boundaries but may exist at a variety of general <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> boundaries, and hence they can affect the performance of polycrystalline engineering alloys.</p>

Enhanced thermal stability of nanograined metals below a critical grain size
<p>The limitation of nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong>ed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als is their strong tendency to coarsen at elevated temperatures. As <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> size decreases into the nanoscale, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> coarsening occurs at much lower temperatures, as low as ambient temperatures for some metals. We discovered that nanometer-sized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong>s in pure copper and nickel produced from plastic deformation at low temperatures exhibit notable thermal stability below a critical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> size. The instability temperature rises substantially at smaller <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> sizes, and the nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong>s remain stable even above the recrystallization temperatures of coarse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong>s. The inherent thermal stability of nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong>s originates from an autonomous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> boundary evolution to low-energy states due to activation of partial dislocations in plastic deformation.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Extreme Suppression of Lateral Floret Development by a Single Amino Acid Change in the VRS1 Transcription Factor
<p>Increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> yield is an endless challenge for cereal crop breeding. In barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> number is controlled mainly by <i>Six-rowed spike 1</i> (<i>Vrs1</i>), which encodes a homeodomain leucine zipper class I transcription factor. However, little is known about the genetic basis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> size. Here, we show that extreme suppression of lateral florets contributes to enlarged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong>s in <i>deficiens</i> barley. Through a combination of fine-mapping and resequencing of <i>deficiens</i> mutants, we have identified that a single amino acid substitution at a putative phosphorylation site in VRS1 is responsible for the <i>deficiens</i> phenotype. <i>deficiens</i> mutant alleles confer an increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> size, a reduction in plant height, and a significant increase in thousand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> weight in contemporary cultivated germplasm. Haplotype analysis revealed that barley carrying the <i>deficiens</i> allele (<i>Vrs1.t1</i>) originated from two-rowed types carrying the <i>Vrs1.b2</i> allele, predominantly found in germplasm from northern Africa. In situ hybridization of <i>histone H4</i>, a marker for cell cycle or proliferation, showed weaker expression in the lateral spikelets compared with central spikelets in <i>deficiens</i>. Transcriptome analysis revealed that a number of <i>histone</i> superfamily genes were up-regulated in the <i>deficiens</i> mutant, suggesting that enhanced cell proliferation in the central spikelet may contribute to larger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong>s. Our data suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> yield can be improved by suppressing the development of specific organs that are not positively involved in sink/source relationships.</p>

Ubiquitin Specific Protease 15 Has an Important Role in Regulating Grain Width and Size in Rice
<p>Ubiquitination and deubiquitination are reversible processes that play crucial roles in regulating organ size in plants. However, information linking deubiquitination and seed size in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) is limited. Here, we characterized a dominant large-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> mutant, <i>large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong>1-D</i> (<i>lg1-D</i>), with a 30.8% increase in seed width and a 34.5% increase in 1,000-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> weight relative to the wild type. The <i>lg1-D</i> mutant had more cells oriented in the lateral direction of the spikelet hull compared with the wild type. Map-based cloning showed that <i>LG1</i> encodes a constitutively expressed ubiquitin-specific protease15 (OsUBP15) that possesses deubiquitination activity in vitro. Loss-of-function and down-regulated expression of <i>OsUBP15</i> produced narrower and smaller <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong>s than the control. A set of in vivo experiments indicated that the mutant Osubp15 had enhanced protein stability relative to wild-type OsUBP15. Further experiments verified that OsDA1 directly interacted with OsUBP15. Genetic data indicated that <i>OsUBP15</i> and <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> WIDTH 2</i> (<i>GW2</i>) were not independent in regulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> width and size. In summary, we identified OsUBP15 as a positive regulator of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> width and size in rice and provide a promising strategy for improvement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> yield by pyramiding <i>OsUBP15</i> and <i>gw2</i>.</p>

Spin coating epitaxial films
<p>Spin-coated films, such as photoresists for lithography or perovskite films for solar cells, are either amorphous or polycrystalline. We show that epitaxial films of inorganic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als such as cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr<sub>3</sub>), lead(II) iodide (PbI<sub>2</sub>), zinc oxide (ZnO), and sodium chloride (NaCl) can be deposited onto a variety of single-crystal and single-crystal–like substrates by simply spin coating either solutions of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al or precursors to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al. The out-of-plane and in-plane orientations of the spin-coated films are determined by the substrate. The thin stagnant layer of supersaturated solution produced during spin coating promotes heterogeneous nucleation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al onto the single-crystal substrate over homogeneous nucleation in the bulk solution, and ordered anion adlayers may lower the activation energy for nucleation on the surface. The method can be used to produce functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als such as inorganic semiconductors or to deposit water-soluble <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als such as NaCl that can serve as growth templates.</p>

Entanglement between two spatially separated atomic modes
<p>Modern quantum technologies in the fields of quantum computing, quantum simulation, and quantum metrology require the creation and control of large ensembles of entangled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es. In ultracold ensembles of neutral atoms, nonclassical states have been generated with mutual entanglement among thousands of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es. The entanglement generation relies on the fundamental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e-exchange symmetry in ensembles of identical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es, which lacks the standard notion of entanglement between clearly definable subsystems. Here, we present the generation of entanglement between two spatially separated clouds by splitting an ensemble of ultracold identical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es prepared in a twin Fock state. Because the clouds can be addressed individually, our experiments open a path to exploit the available entangled states of indistinguishable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es for quantum information applications.</p>

Grain boundary stability governs hardening and softening in extremely fine nanograined metals
<p>Conventional metals become harder with decreasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> sizes, following the classical Hall-Petch relationship. However, this relationship fails and softening occurs at some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> sizes in the nanometer regime for some alloys. In this study, we discovered that plastic deformation mechanism of extremely fine nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong>ed metals and their hardness are adjustable through tailoring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> boundary (GB) stability. The electrodeposited nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong>ed nickel-molybdenum (Ni–Mo) samples become softened for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> sizes below 10 nanometers because of GB-mediated processes. With GB stabilization through relaxation and Mo segregation, ultrahigh hardness is achieved in the nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong>ed samples with a plastic deformation mechanism dominated by generation of extended partial dislocations. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> boundary stability provides an alternative dimension, in addition to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> size, for producing novel nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong>ed metals with extraordinary properties.</p>

MiR408 Regulates Grain Yield and Photosynthesis via a Phytocyanin Protein
<p>Increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> yield is the most important object of crop breeding. Here, we report that the elevated expression of a conserved microRNA, OsmiR408, could positively regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> yield in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) by increasing panicle branches and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> number. We further showed that OsmiR408 regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> yield by down-regulating its downstream target, <i>OsUCL8</i>, which is an uclacyanin (UCL) gene of the phytocyanin family. The knock down or knock out of <i>OsUCL8</i> also increases <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> yield, while the overexpression of <i>OsUCL8</i> results in an opposite phenotype. Spatial and temporal expression analyses showed that <i>OsUCL8</i> was highly expressed in pistils, young panicles, developing seeds, and inflorescence meristem and was nearly complementary to that of OsmiR408. Interestingly, the OsUCL8 protein was localized to the cytoplasm, distinct from a majority of phytocyanins, which localize to the plasma membrane. Further studies revealed that the cleavage of <i>OsUCL8</i> by miR408 affects copper homeostasis in the plant cell, which, in turn, affects the abundance of plastocyanin proteins and photosynthesis in rice. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the effects of miR408-<i>OsUCL8</i> in regulating rice photosynthesis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> yield. Our study further broadens the perspective of microRNAs and UCLs and provides important information for breeding high-yielding crops through genetic engineering.</p>

Cholesterol Efflux Capacity, High-Density Lipoprotein Particle Number, and Incident Cardiovascular Events
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Recent failures of drugs that raised high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels to reduce cardiovascular events in clinical trials have led to increased interest in alternative indices of HDL quality, such as cholesterol efflux capacity, and HDL quantity, such as HDL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e number.

In total, 314 cases of incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) (myocardial infarction, unstable angina, arterial revascularization, stroke, or cardiovascular death) were compared to age- and gender-matched controls.

Baseline HDL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e number was inversely associated with incident CVD (adjusted odds ratio per SD increment [OR/SD], 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56–0.86; <i>P</i><0.001), whereas no significant association was found for baseline cholesterol efflux capacity (OR/SD, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.72–1.10; <i>P</i>=0.28), HDL cholesterol (OR/SD, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.66–1.02; <i>P</i>=0.08), or apolipoprotein A-I (OR/SD, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.67–1.03; <i>P</i>=0.08). Twelve months of rosuvastatin (20 mg/day) did not change cholesterol efflux capacity (average percentage change −1.5%, 95% CI, −13.3 to +10.2; <i>P</i>=0.80), but increased HDL cholesterol (+7.7%), apolipoprotein A-I (+4.3%), and HDL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e number (+5.2%).

Atmospheric new particle formation from sulfuric acid and amines in a Chinese megacity
<p>Atmospheric new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e formation (NPF) is an important global phenomenon that is nevertheless sensitive to ambient conditions. According to both observation and theoretical arguments, NPF usually requires a relatively high sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) concentration to promote the formation of new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es and a low preexisting aerosol loading to minimize the sink of new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es. We investigated NPF in Shanghai and were able to observe both precursor vapors (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) and initial clusters at a molecular level in a megacity. High NPF rates were observed to coincide with several familiar markers suggestive of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>–dimethylamine (DMA)–water (H<sub>2</sub>O) nucleation, including sulfuric acid dimers and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>-DMA clusters. In a cluster kinetics simulation, the observed concentration of sulfuric acid was high enough to explain the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e growth to ~3 nanometers under the very high condensation sink, whereas the subsequent higher growth rate beyond this size is believed to result from the added contribution of condensing organic species. These findings will help in understanding urban NPF and its air quality and climate effects, as well as in formulating policies to mitigate secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e formation in China.</p>

Rice Leaf Angle and Grain Size Are Affected by the OsBUL1 Transcriptional Activator Complex<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Rice atypical HLH protein <i>Oryza sativa BRASSINOSTEROID UPREGULATED 1</i>-<i>LIKE1</i> (<i>OsBUL1</i>) is preferentially expressed in the lamina joint where it controls cell elongation and positively affects leaf angles. <i>OsBUL1</i> knockout mutant (<i>osbul1</i>) and transgenic rice for double-stranded RNA interference (dsRNAi) of <i>OsBUL1</i> produced erect leaves with smaller <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong>s, whereas <i>OsBUL1</i> overexpressors and an activation tagging line of <i>OsBUL1</i> exhibited increased lamina inclination and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> size. Moreover, <i>OsBUL1</i> expression was induced by brassinolide (BL) and <i>osbul1</i> did not respond to BL treatment. To understand the molecular network of OsBUL1 function in rice, we isolated a novel OsBUL1-interacting protein, LO9-177, an uncharacterized protein containing a KxDL motif, and functionally studied it with respect to the lamina inclination and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> size of rice. OsBUL1 COMPLEX1 (OsBC1) is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcriptional activator that interacts with OsBUL1 only in the presence of LO9-177 forming a possible trimeric complex for cell elongation in the lamina joint of rice. Expression of <i>OsBC1</i> is also upregulated by BL and has a similar pattern to that of <i>OsBUL1</i>. Transgenic rice plants expressing <i>OsBC1</i> under the control of <i>OsBUL1</i> promoter showed increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> size as well as leaf bending, while transgenic lines for dsRNAi and/or expressing a dominant repressor form of <i>OsBC1</i> displayed reduced plant height and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> size. Together, these results demonstrated that a novel protein complex consisting of OsBUL1, LO9-177, and OsBC1 is associated with the HLH-bHLH system, providing new insight into the molecular functional network based on HLH-bHLH proteins for cell elongation.</p>

Systems Genetics Identifies a Novel Regulatory Domain of Amylose Synthesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>A deeper understanding of the regulation of starch biosynthesis in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) endosperm is crucial in tailoring digestibility without sacrificing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> quality. In this study, significant association peaks on chromosomes 6 and 7 were identified through a genomewide association study (GWAS) of debranched starch structure from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong>s of a 320 <i>indica</i> rice diversity panel using genotyping data from the high-density rice array. A systems genetics approach that interrelates starch structure data from GWAS to functional pathways from a gene regulatory network identified known genes with high correlation to the proportion of amylose and amylopectin. An SNP in the promoter region of <i>Granule Bound Starch Synthase I</i> was identified along with seven other SNPs to form haplotypes that discriminate samples into different phenotypic ranges of amylose. A GWAS peak on chromosome 7 between LOC_Os07g11020 and LOC_Os07g11520 indexed by a nonsynonymous SNP mutation on exon 5 of a bHLH transcription factor was found to elevate the proportion of amylose at the expense of reduced short-chain amylopectin. Linking starch structure with starch digestibility by determining the kinetics of cooked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> amylolysis of selected haplotypes revealed strong association of starch structure with estimated digestibility kinetics. Combining all results from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> quality genomics, systems genetics, and digestibility phenotyping, we propose target haplotypes for fine-tuning starch structure in rice through marker-assisted breeding that can be used to alter the digestibility of rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong>, thus offering rice consumers a new diet-based intervention to mitigate the impact of nutrition-related noncommunicable diseases.</p>

Robust double-network hydrogels provided with a sustained monomer supply undergo self-growth, and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als are substantially strengthened under repetitive loading through a structural destruction-reconstruction process. This strategy also endows the hydrogels with tailored functions at desired positions by mechanical stamping. This work may pave the way for the development of self-growing gel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als for applications such as soft robots and intelligent devices.</p>

Wafer-scale single-crystal hexagonal boron nitride film via self-collimated grain formation
<p>Although polycrystalline hexagonal boron nitride (PC-hBN) has been realized, defects and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> boundaries still cause charge scatterings and trap sites, impeding high-performance electronics. Here, we report a method of synthesizing wafer-scale single-crystalline hBN (SC-hBN) monolayer films by chemical vapor deposition. The limited solubility of boron (B) and nitrogen (N) atoms in liquid gold promotes high diffusion of adatoms on the surface of liquid at high temperature to provoke the circular hBN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong>s. These further evolve into closely packed unimodal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong>s by means of self-collimation of B and N edges inherited by electrostatic interaction between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong>s, eventually forming an SC-hBN film on a wafer scale. This SC-hBN film also allows for the synthesis of wafer-scale graphene/hBN heterostructure and single-crystalline tungsten disulfide.</p>

Controlled crack propagation for atomic precision handling of wafer-scale two-dimensional materials
<p>Although flakes of two-dimensional (2D) heterostructures at the micrometer scale can be formed with adhesive-tape exfoliation methods, isolation of 2D flakes into monolayers is extremely time consuming because it is a trial-and-error process. Controlling the number of 2D layers through direct growth also presents difficulty because of the high nucleation barrier on 2D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als. We demonstrate a layer-resolved 2D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al splitting technique that permits high-throughput production of multiple monolayers of wafer-scale (5-centimeter diameter) 2D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als by splitting single stacks of thick 2D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als grown on a single wafer.

Resonance-stabilized hydrocarbon-radical chain reactions may explain soot inception and growth
<p>Mystery surrounds the transition from gas-phase hydrocarbon precursors to terrestrial soot and interstellar dust, which are carbonaceous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es formed under similar conditions. Although polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are known precursors to high-temperature carbonaceous-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e formation, the molecular pathways that initiate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e formation are unknown. We present experimental and theoretical evidence for rapid molecular clustering–reaction pathways involving radicals with extended conjugation. These radicals react with other hydrocarbon species to form covalently bound complexes that promote further growth and clustering by regenerating resonance-stabilized radicals through low-barrier hydrogen-abstraction and hydrogen-ejection reactions. Such radical–chain reaction pathways may lead to covalently bound clusters of PAHs and other hydrocarbons that would otherwise be too small to condense at high temperatures, thus providing the key mechanistic steps for rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e formation and surface growth by hydrocarbon chemisorption.</p>

Direct measurements of two-way wave-particle energy transfer in a collisionless space plasma
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e acceleration by plasma waves and spontaneous wave generation are fundamental energy and momentum exchange processes in collisionless plasmas. Such wave-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e interactions occur ubiquitously in space. We present ultrafast measurements in Earth’s magnetosphere by the Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft that enabled quantitative evaluation of energy transfer in interactions associated with electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves. The observed ion distributions are not symmetric around the magnetic field direction but are in phase with the plasma wave fields. The wave-ion phase relations demonstrate that a cyclotron resonance transferred energy from hot protons to waves, which in turn nonresonantly accelerated cold He<sup>+</sup> to energies up to ~2 kilo–electron volts. These observations provide direct quantitative evidence for collisionless energy transfer in plasmas between distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e populations via wave-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e interactions.</p>

High dislocation density–induced large ductility in deformed and partitioned steels
<p>A wide variety of industrial applications require <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als with high strength and ductility. Unfortunately, the strategies for increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al strength, such as processing to create line defects (dislocations), tend to decrease ductility. We developed a strategy to circumvent this in inexpensive, medium manganese steel. Cold rolling followed by low-temperature tempering developed steel with metastable austenite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong>s embedded in a highly dislocated martensite matrix. This deformed and partitioned (D and P) process produced dislocation hardening but retained high ductility, both through the glide of intensive mobile dislocations and by allowing us to control martensitic transformation. The D and P strategy should apply to any other alloy with deformation-induced martensitic transformation and provides a pathway for the development of high-strength, high-ductility <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als.</p>

Nanocrystalline copper films are never flat
<p>We used scanning tunneling microscopy to study low-angle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> boundaries at the surface of nearly planar copper nanocrystalline (111) films. The presence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> boundaries and their emergence at the film surface create valleys composed of dissociated edge dislocations and ridges where partial dislocations have recombined. Geometric analysis and simulations indicated that valleys and ridges were created by an out-of-plane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> rotation driven by reduction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> boundary energy. These results suggest that in general, it is impossible to form flat two-dimensional nanocrystalline films of copper and other metals exhibiting small stacking fault energies and/or large elastic anisotropy, which induce a large anisotropy in the dislocation-line energy.</p>

Highly elastic binders integrating polyrotaxanes for silicon microparticle anodes in lithium ion batteries
<p>Lithium-ion batteries with ever-increasing energy densities are needed for batteries for advanced devices and all-electric vehicles. Silicon has been highlighted as a promising anode <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al because of its superior specific capacity.

Direction-specific van der Waals attraction between rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> nanocrystals
<p>Mutual lattice orientations dictate the types and magnitudes of forces between crystalline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es. When lattice polarizability is anisotropic, the van der Waals dispersion attraction can, in principle, contribute to this direction dependence. We report measurement of this attraction between rutile nanocrystals, as a function of their mutual orientation and surface hydration extent. At tens of nanometers of separation, the attraction is weak and shows no dependence on azimuthal alignment or surface hydration. At separations of approximately one hydration layer, the attraction is strongly dependent on azimuthal alignment and systematically decreases as intervening water density increases. Measured forces closely agree with predictions from Lifshitz theory and show that dispersion forces can generate a torque between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es interacting in solution and between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong>s in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als.</p>

OsHAC1;1 and OsHAC1;2 Function as Arsenate Reductases and Regulate Arsenic Accumulation<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Rice is a major dietary source of the toxic metalloid arsenic (As). Reducing its accumulation in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> is of critical importance to food safety. Rice roots take up arsenate and arsenite depending on the prevailing soil conditions. The first step of arsenate detoxification is its reduction to arsenite, but the enzyme(s) catalyzing this reaction in rice remains unknown. Here, we identify OsHAC1;1 and OsHAC1;2 as arsenate reductases in rice. <i>OsHAC1;1</i> and <i>OsHAC1;2</i> are able to complement an <i>Escherichia coli</i> mutant lacking the endogenous arsenate reductase and to reduce arsenate to arsenite. <i>OsHAC1:1</i> and <i>OsHAC1;2</i> are predominantly expressed in roots, with <i>OsHAC1;1</i> being abundant in the epidermis, root hairs, and pericycle cells while <i>OsHAC1;2</i> is abundant in the epidermis, outer layers of cortex, and endodermis cells. Expression of the two genes was induced by arsenate exposure. Knocking out <i>OsHAC1;1</i> or <i>OsHAC1;2</i> decreased the reduction of arsenate to arsenite in roots, reducing arsenite efflux to the external medium. Loss of arsenite efflux was also associated with increased As accumulation in shoots. Greater effects were observed in a double mutant of the two genes. In contrast, overexpression of either <i>OsHAC1;1</i> or <i>OsHAC1;2</i> increased arsenite efflux, reduced As accumulation, and enhanced arsenate tolerance. When grown under aerobic soil conditions, overexpression of either <i>OsHAC1;1</i> or <i>OsHAC1;2</i> also decreased As accumulation in rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong>, whereas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> As increased in the knockout mutants. We conclude that OsHAC1;1 and OsHAC1;2 are arsenate reductases that play an important role in restricting As accumulation in rice shoots and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong>.</p>

Extra strengthening and work hardening in gradient nanotwinned metals
<p>Gradient structures exist ubiquitously in nature and are increasingly being introduced in engineering.

We explored the mechanical performance of a gradient nanotwinned structure with highly tunable structural gradients in pure copper. A large structural gradient allows for superior work hardening and strength that can exceed those of the strongest component of the gradient structure. We found through systematic experiments and atomistic simulations that this unusual behavior is afforded by a unique patterning of ultrahigh densities of dislocations in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> interiors. These observations not only shed light on gradient structures, but may also indicate a promising route for improving the mechanical properties of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als through gradient design.</p>

Increase in crop losses to insect pests in a warming climate

Global yield losses of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong>s are projected to increase by 10 to 25% per degree of global mean surface warming.

High thermal conductivity in cubic boron arsenide crystals

We report the experimental discovery of high thermal conductivity at room temperature in cubic boron arsenide (BAs) grown through a modified chemical vapor transport technique. The thermal conductivity of BAs, 1000 ± 90 watts per meter per kelvin meter-kelvin, is higher than that of silicon carbide by a factor of 3 and is surpassed only by diamond and the basal-plane value of graphite.

Our spectroscopy study, in conjunction with atomistic theory, reveals that the distinctive band structure of BAs allows for very long phonon mean free paths and strong high-order anharmonicity through the four-phonon process.

Mechanically robust, readily repairable polymers via tailored noncovalent cross-linking

The structure reveals how large ribosome biogenesis complexes assist the 5′ external transcribed spacer and U3 small nucleolar RNA in providing an intertwined RNA-protein assembly platform for the separate maturation of 18<i>S</i> rRNA domains. The strategic placement of a molecular motor at the center of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e further suggests a mechanism for mediating conformational changes within this giant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e. This study provides a structural framework for a mechanistic understanding of eukaryotic ribosome assembly in the model organism <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>.</p>

Perovskite-perovskite tandem photovoltaics with optimized band gaps
<p>We demonstrate four- and two-terminal perovskite-perovskite tandem solar cells with ideally matched band gaps. We develop an infrared-absorbing 1.2–electron volt band-gap perovskite, FA<sub>0.75</sub>Cs<sub>0.25</sub>Sn<sub>0.5</sub>Pb<sub>0.5</sub>I<sub>3</sub>, that can deliver 14.8% efficiency. By combining this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al with a wider–band gap FA<sub>0.83</sub>Cs<sub>0.17</sub>Pb(I<sub>0.5</sub>Br<sub>0.5</sub>)<sub>3</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al, we achieve monolithic two-terminal tandem efficiencies of 17.0% with >1.65-volt open-circuit voltage. We also make mechanically stacked four-terminal tandem cells and obtain 20.3% efficiency. Notably, we find  that our infrared-absorbing perovskite cells exhibit excellent thermal and atmospheric stability, not previously achieved for Sn-based perovskites. This device architecture and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als set will enable “all-perovskite” thin-film solar cells to reach the highest efficiencies in the long term at the lowest costs.</p>

The Hydrogen Isotope Composition δ<sup>2</sup>H Reflects Plant Performance
<p>The stable carbon (δ<sup>13</sup>C) and oxygen (δ<sup>18</sup>O) isotope compositions in plant matter reflect photosynthetic and transpirative conditions in plants, respectively. However, the nature of hydrogen isotope composition (δ<sup>2</sup>H) and what it reflects of plant performance is poorly understood. Using durum wheat (<i>Triticum turgidum</i> var <i>durum</i>), this study evaluated the effect of different water and nitrogen growing field conditions on transpiration and how this effect influenced the performance of δ<sup>2</sup>H in autotrophic (flag leaf), mixotrophic (ears), and heterotrophic (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong>s and roots) organs. Moreover, δ<sup>2</sup>H was compared with the δ<sup>13</sup>C and δ<sup>18</sup>O in the same organs. Isotope compositions were analyzed in dry matter, the water-soluble fraction, and in water from different tissues of a set of genotypes. Similar to δ<sup>13</sup>C, the δ<sup>2</sup>H correlated negatively with stomatal conductance, whereas no correlation was observed for δ<sup>18</sup>O. Moreover, δ<sup>2</sup>H was not only affected by changes in transpiration but also by photosynthetic reactions, probably as a consequence of NADPH formation in autotrophic organs. Compared with the δ<sup>2</sup>H of stem water, plant δ<sup>2</sup>H was strongly diminished in photosynthetic organs such as the flag leaves, whereas it strongly increased in heterotrophic organs such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong>s and roots. In heterotrophic organs, δ<sup>2</sup>H was associated with postphotosynthetic effects because there are several processes that lead to <sup>2</sup>H-enrichment of carbohydrates. In summary, δ<sup>2</sup>H exhibited specific features that inform about the water conditions of the wheat crop, together with the photosynthetic characteristics of the plant part considered. Moreover, correlations of δ<sup>2</sup>H with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> yield illustrate that this isotope can be used to assess plant performance under different growing conditions.</p>

The Amino Acid Permease 5 (OsAAP5) Regulates Tiller Number and Grain Yield in Rice
<p>As fundamental nutrients, amino acids are important for rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) growth and development. Here, we identified the amino acid permease 5 (OsAAP5), that regulates tiller number and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> yield in rice. The <i>OsAAP5</i> promoter sequence differed between <i>indica</i> and <i>japonica</i> rice varieties. Lower expression of <i>OsAAP5</i> in the young leaf blade in <i>indica</i> varieties than in <i>japonica</i> varieties was associated with more tillers in <i>indica</i> than in <i>japonica</i>. Down-regulation of <i>OsAAP5</i> expression in <i>japonica</i> using RNA interference (RNAi) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats led to increases in tiller number and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> yield, whereas <i>OsAAP5</i> overexpression (OE) had the opposite effect. Both a protoplast amino acid uptake assay and HPLC analysis indicated that more basic (Lys, Arg) and neutral (Val, Ala) amino acids were transported and accumulated in the OE lines than in the wild type, but the opposite was observed in the RNAi lines. Furthermore, exogenous application of Lys, Arg, Val, and Ala in the OE lines substantially inhibited tiller bud elongation, but the effect was lost in the RNAi lines. Notably, concentrations of the cytokinins cis-zeatin and dihydrozeatin were much lower in the OE lines than in the wild type, whereas concentrations in the RNAi lines were higher. Thus, <i>OsAAP5</i> could regulate tiller bud outgrowth by affecting cytokinin levels, and knockout of <i>OsAAP5</i> could be valuable for <i>japonica</i> breeding programs seeking high yield and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> quality.</p>

The Spermine Synthase OsSPMS1 Regulates Seed Germination, Grain Size, and Yield
<p>Polyamines, including putrescine, spermidine, and spermine, play essential roles in a wide variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) contains four putative spermidine/spermine synthase (SPMS)-encoding genes (<i>OsSPMS1</i>, <i>OsSPMS2</i>, <i>OsSPMS3</i>, and <i>OsACAULIS5</i>), but none have been functionally characterized. In this study, we used a reverse genetic strategy to investigate the biological function of <i>OsSPMS1</i>. We generated several homozygous RNA interference (RNAi) and overexpression (OE) lines of <i>OsSPMS1</i>. Phenotypic analysis indicated that <i>OsSPMS1</i> negatively regulates seed germination, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> size, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> yield per plant. The ratio of spermine to spermidine was significantly lower in the RNAi lines and considerably higher in the OE lines than in the wild type, suggesting that OsSPMS1 may function as a SPMS. <i>S</i>-Adenosyl-<sc>l</sc>-methionine is a common precursor of polyamines and ethylene biosynthesis. The 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) and ethylene contents in seeds increased significantly in RNAi lines and decreased in OE lines, respectively, compared with the wild type. Additionally, the reduced germination rates and growth defects of OE lines could be rescued with ACC treatment. These data suggest that <i>OsSPMS1</i> affects ethylene synthesis and may regulate seed germination and plant growth by affecting the ACC and ethylene pathways. Most importantly, an <i>OsSPMS1</i> knockout mutant showed an increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grain</span></strong> yield per plant in a high-yield variety, Suken118, suggesting that <i>OsSPMS1</i> is an important target for yield enhancement in rice.</p>

Dynamics of the Pollen Sequestrome Defined by Subcellular Coupled Omics
<p>Reproduction success in angiosperm plants depends on robust pollen tube growth through the female pistil tissues to ensure successful fertilization. Accordingly, there is an apparent evolutionary trend to accumulate significant reserves during pollen maturation, including a population of stored mRNAs, that are utilized later for a massive translation of various proteins in growing pollen tubes. Here, we performed a thorough transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of stored and translated transcripts in three subcellular compartments of tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>), long-term storage EDTA/puromycin-resistant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es, translating polysomes, and free ribonuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es, throughout tobacco pollen development and in in vitro-growing pollen tubes. We demonstrated that the composition of the aforementioned complexes is not rigid and that numerous transcripts were redistributed among these complexes during pollen development, which may represent an important mechanism of translational regulation. Therefore, we defined the pollen sequestrome as a distinct and highly dynamic compartment for the storage of stable, translationally repressed transcripts and demonstrated its dynamics. We propose that EDTA/puromycin-resistant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e complexes represent aggregated nontranslating monosomes as the primary mediators of messenger RNA sequestration. Such organization is extremely useful in fast tip-growing pollen tubes, where rapid and orchestrated protein synthesis must take place in specific regions.</p>

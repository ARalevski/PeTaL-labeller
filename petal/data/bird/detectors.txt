Does Use of Bilateral Internal Mammary Artery Grafting Reduce Long-Term Risk of Repeat Coronary Revascularization?
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although previous studies have demonstrated that patients <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">receiv</span></strong>ing bilateral internal mammary artery (BIMA) conduits during coronary artery bypass grafting have better long-term survival than those <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">receiv</span></strong>ing a single internal mammary artery (SIMA), data on risk of repeat revascularization are more limited. In this analysis, we compare the timing, frequency, and type of repeat coronary revascularization among patients <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">receiv</span></strong>ing BIMA and SIMA.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a multicenter, retrospective analysis of 47 984 consecutive coronary artery bypass grafting surgeries performed from 1992 to 2014 among 7 medical centers reporting to a prospectively maintained clinical registry. Among the study population, 1482 coronary artery bypass grafting surgeries with BIMA were identified, and 1297 patients <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">receiv</span></strong>ing BIMA were propensity-matched to 1297 patients <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">receiv</span></strong>ing SIMA. The primary end point was freedom from repeat coronary revascularization.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The median duration of follow-up was 13.2 (IQR, 7.4–17.7) years. Patients were well matched by age, body mass index, major comorbidities, and cardiac function. There was a higher freedom from repeat revascularization among patients <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">receiv</span></strong>ing BIMA than among patients <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">receiv</span></strong>ing SIMA (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio [HR], 0.78 [95% CI, 0.65–0.94]; <i>P</i>=0.009). Among the matched cohort, 19.4% (n=252) of patients <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">receiv</span></strong>ing SIMA underwent repeat revascularization, whereas this frequency was 15.1% (n=196) among patients <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">receiv</span></strong>ing BIMA (<i>P</i>=0.004). The majority of repeat revascularization procedures were percutaneous coronary interventions (94.2%), and this did not differ between groups (<i>P</i>=0.274). Groups also did not differ in the ratio of native versus graft vessel percutaneous coronary intervention (<i>P</i>=0.899), or regarding percutaneous coronary intervention target vessels; the most common targets in both groups were the right coronary (<i>P</i>=0.133) and circumflex arteries (<i>P</i>=0.093). In comparison with SIMA, BIMA grafting was associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality at 12 years of follow-up (HR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.69–0.91]; <i>P</i>=0.001), and there was no difference in in-hospital morbidity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>BIMA grafting was associated with a reduced risk of repeat revascularization and an improvement in long-term survival and should be considered more frequently during coronary artery bypass grafting.</p></sec>

Subclinical Atrial Fibrillation in Older Patients
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Long-term continuous electrocardiographic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monitor</span></strong>ing shows a substantial prevalence of asymptomatic, subclinical atrial fibrillation (SCAF) in patients with pacemakers and patients with cryptogenic stroke. Whether SCAF is also common in other patients without these conditions is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We implanted subcutaneous electrocardiographic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monitor</span></strong>s (St. Jude CONFIRM-AF) in patients ≥65 years of age attending cardiovascular or neurology outpatient clinics if they had no history of atrial fibrillation but had any of the following: CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score of ≥2, sleep apnea, or body mass index >30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Eligibility also required either left atrial enlargement (≥4.4 cm or volume ≥58 mL) or increased (≥290 pg/mL) serum NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide). Patients were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monitor</span></strong>ed for SCAF lasting ≥5 minutes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Two hundred fifty-six patients were followed up for 16.3±3.8 months. Baseline age was 74±6 years; mean CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score was 4.1±1.4; left atrial diameter averaged 4.7±0.8 cm; and 48% had a prior stroke, transient ischemic attack, or systemic embolism. SCAF ≥5 minutes was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ed in 90 patients (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ion rate, 34.4%/y; 95% confidence interval [CI], 27.7–42.3). Baseline predictors of SCAF were increased age (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio [HR] per decade, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.11–2.15), left atrial dimension (HR per centimeter diameter, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.09–1.86), and blood pressure (HR per 10 mm Hg, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.78–0.98), but not prior stroke. The rate of occurrence of SCAF in those with a history of stroke, systemic embolism, or transient ischemic attack was 39.4%/y versus 30.3%/y without (<i>P</i>=0.32). The cumulative SCAF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ion rate was higher (51.9%/y) in those with left atrial volume above the median value of 73.5 mL.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>SCAF is frequently <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ed by continuous electrocardiographic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monitor</span></strong>ing in older patients without a history of atrial fibrillation who are attending outpatient cardiology and neurology clinics.

Low-Dose Aspirin for Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Events in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The long-term efficacy and safety of low-dose aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are still inconclusive.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The JPAD trial (Japanese Primary Prevention of Atherosclerosis With Aspirin for Diabetes) was a randomized, open-label, standard care–controlled trial examining whether low-dose aspirin affected cardiovascular events in 2539 Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and without preexisting cardiovascular disease. Patients were randomly allocated to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">receiv</span></strong>e aspirin (81 or 100 mg daily; aspirin group) or no aspirin (no-aspirin group) in the JPAD trial. After that trial ended in 2008, we followed up with the patients until 2015, with no attempt to change the previously assigned therapy. Primary end points were cardiovascular events, including sudden death, fatal or nonfatal coronary artery disease, fatal or nonfatal stroke, and peripheral vascular disease. For the safety analysis, hemorrhagic events, consisting of gastrointestinal bleeding, hemorrhagic stroke, and bleeding from any other sites, were also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed. The primary analysis was conducted for cardiovascular events among patients who retained their original allocation (a per-protocol cohort). Analyses on an intention-to-treat cohort were conducted for hemorrhagic events and statistical sensitivity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The median follow-up period was 10.3 years; 1621 patients (64%) were followed up throughout the study; and 2160 patients (85%) retained their original allocation. Low-dose aspirin did not reduce cardiovascular events in the per-protocol cohort (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 1.14; 95% confidence interval, 0.91–1.42). Multivariable Cox proportional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> model adjusted for age, sex, glycemic control, kidney function, smoking status, hypertension, and dyslipidemia showed similar results (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 0.83–1.30), with no heterogeneity of efficacy in subgroup analyses stratified by each of these factors (all interaction <i>P</i>>0.05). Sensitivity analyses on the intention-to-treat cohort yielded consistent results (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 1.01; 95% confidence interval, 0.82–1.25). Gastrointestinal bleeding occurred in 25 patients (2%) in the aspirin group and 12 (0.9%) in the no-aspirin group (<i>P</i>=0.03), and the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was not different between groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Low-dose aspirin did not affect the risk for cardiovascular events but increased risk for gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in a primary prevention setting.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

High On-Treatment Platelet Reactivity as a Risk Factor for Secondary Prevention After Coronary Stent Revascularization
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Individualizing antiplatelet therapy after platelet function testing did not improve outcome after coronary stenting in the Assessment by a Double Randomization of a Conventional Antiplatelet Strategy Versus a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monitor</span></strong>ing-Guided Strategy for Drug-Eluting Stent Implantation and of Treatment Interruption Versus Continuation One Year After Stenting (ARCTIC) study. Whether results are different during the phase of secondary prevention starting after hospital discharge, when periprocedural events have been excluded, is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>In ARCTIC, 2440 patients were randomized before coronary stenting to a strategy of platelet function <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monitor</span></strong>ing (VerifyNow P2Y<sub>12</sub>/aspirin point-of-care assay) with drug adjustment in suboptimal responders to antiplatelet therapy or to a conventional strategy without <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monitor</span></strong>ing and without drug or dose changes. We performed a landmark analysis starting at the time of hospital discharge evaluating the primary end point of death, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, stroke, or urgent revascularization through 1 year. After discharge, the primary end point occurred in 8.6% of patients in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monitor</span></strong>ing arm and 7.9% in the conventional arm (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 1.105; 95% confidence interval, 0.835–1.461; <i>P</i>=0.48).

Long-Term Safety and Effectiveness of Mechanical Versus Biologic Aortic Valve Prostheses in Older Patients
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>There is a paucity of long-term data comparing biological versus mechanical aortic valve prostheses in older individuals.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We performed follow-up of patients aged 65 to 80 years undergoing aortic valve replacement with a biological (n=24 410) or mechanical (n=14 789) prosthesis from 1991 to 1999 at 605 centers within the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database using Medicare inpatient claims (mean, 12.6 years; maximum, 17 years; minimum, 8 years), and outcomes were compared by propensity methods. Among Medicare-linked patients undergoing aortic valve replacement (mean age, 73 years), both reoperation (4.0%) and endocarditis (1.9%) were uncommon to 12 years; however, the risk for other adverse outcomes was high, including death (66.5%), stroke (14.1%), and bleeding (17.9%). Compared with those <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">receiv</span></strong>ing a mechanical valve, patients given a bioprosthesis had a similar adjusted risk for death (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.01–1.07), higher risks for reoperation (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 2.55; 95% confidence interval, 2.14–3.03) and endocarditis (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 1.60; 95% confidence interval, 1.31–1.94), and lower risks for stroke (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.82–0.93) and bleeding (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.62–0.70). Although these results were generally consistent among patient subgroups, bioprosthesis patients aged 65 to 69 years had a substantially elevated 12-year absolute risk of reoperation (10.5%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Among patients undergoing aortic valve replacement, long-term mortality rates were similar for those who <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">receiv</span></strong>ed bioprosthetic versus mechanical valves.

Nucleic acid detection with CRISPR-Cas13a/C2c2

The RNA-guided, RNA-targeting clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) effector Cas13a (previously known as C2c2) exhibits a “collateral effect” of promiscuous ribonuclease activity upon target recognition. We combine the collateral effect of Cas13a with isothermal amplification to establish a CRISPR-based diagnostic (CRISPR-Dx), providing rapid DNA or RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ion with attomolar sensitivity and single-base mismatch specificity. We use this Cas13a-based molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ion platform, termed Specific High-Sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter UnLOCKing (SHERLOCK), to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong> specific strains of Zika and Dengue virus, distinguish pathogenic bacteria, genotype human DNA, and identify mutations in cell-free tumor DNA. Furthermore, SHERLOCK reaction reagents can be lyophilized for cold-chain independence and long-term storage and be readily reconstituted on paper for field applications.</p>

Safety and Tolerability of CSL112, a Reconstituted, Infusible, Plasma-Derived Apolipoprotein A-I, After Acute Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Human or recombinant apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) has been shown to increase high-density lipoprotein–mediated cholesterol efflux capacity and to regress atherosclerotic disease in animal and clinical studies. CSL112 is an infusible, plasma-derived apoA-I that has been studied in normal subjects or those with stable coronary artery disease. This study aimed to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of CSL112 in patients with a recent acute myocardial infarction.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The AEGIS-I trial (Apo-I Event Reducing in Ischemic Syndromes I) was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging phase 2b trial. Patients with myocardial infarction were stratified by renal function and randomized 1:1:1 to CSL112 (2 g apoA-I per dose) and high-dose CSL112 (6 g apoA-I per dose), or placebo for 4 consecutive weekly infusions. Coprimary safety end points were occurrence of either a hepatic safety event (an increase in alanine transaminase >3 times the upper limit of normal or an increase in total bilirubin >2 times the upper limit of normal) or a renal safety event (an increase in serum creatinine >1.5 times the baseline value or a new requirement for renal replacement therapy).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 1258 patients were randomized, and 91.2% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">receiv</span></strong>ed all 4 infusions. The difference in incidence rates for an increase in alanine transaminase or total bilirubin between both CSL112 arms and placebo was within the protocol-defined noninferiority margin of 4%. Similarly, the difference in incidence rates for an increase in serum creatinine or a new requirement for renal replacement therapy was within the protocol-defined noninferiority margin of 5%. CSL112 was associated with increases in apoA-I and ex vivo cholesterol efflux similar to that achieved in patients with stable coronary artery disease. In regard to the secondary efficacy end point, the risk for the composite of major adverse cardiovascular events among the groups was similar.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among patients with acute myocardial infarction, 4 weekly infusions of CSL112 are feasible, well tolerated, and not associated with any significant alterations in liver or kidney function or other safety concern. The ability of CSL112 to acutely enhance cholesterol efflux was confirmed. The potential benefit of CSL112 to reduce major adverse cardiovascular events needs to be assessed in an adequately powered phase 3 trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

<sec><title>Aims</title><p>This study aimed to determine the diagnostic performance of radiographic   criteria to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong> aseptic acetabular loosening after revision total   hip arthroplasty (THA). Secondary aims were to determine the predictive   values of different thresholds of migration and to determine the   predictive values of radiolucency criteria.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Acetabular component migration to re-revision was measured retrospectively   using Ein-Bild-Rontgen-Analyse (EBRA-Cup) and manual measurements   (Sutherland method) in two groups: Group A, 52 components (48 patients) found   not loose at re-revision and Group B, 42 components (36 patients)   found loose at re-revision between 1980 and 2015. The presence and   extent of radiolucent lines was also assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Using EBRA, both proximal translation and sagittal rotation were   excellent diagnostic tests for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ing aseptic loosening. The   area under the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">receiv</span></strong>er operating characteristic (ROC) curves was   0.94 and 0.93, respectively. The thresholds of 2.5 mm proximal translation   or 2° sagittal rotation (EBRA) in combination with radiolucency   criteria had a sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 88% to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>   aseptic loosening. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive   value and negative predictive value (NPV) of radiolucency criteria   were 41%, 100%, 100% and 68% respectively.

Oral Anticoagulation in Very Elderly Patients With Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Stroke prevention with oral anticoagulants (OACs) is the cornerstone for the management of atrial fibrillation (AF). However, data about the use of OACs among patients ≥90 years of age are limited. We aimed to investigate the risk of ischemic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and the net clinical benefit of OAC treatment for very elderly patients with AF (≥90 years of age).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This study used the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. Risks of ischemic stroke and ICH were compared between 11 064 and 14 658 patients with and without AF ≥90 years of age without antithrombotic therapy from 1996 to 2011. Patients with AF (n=15 756) were divided into 3 groups (no treatment, antiplatelet agents, and warfarin), and the risks of stroke and ICH were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed. The risks of ischemic stroke and ICH were further compared between patients treated with warfarin and nonvitamin K antagonist OACs (NOACs) from 2012 to 2015 when NOACs were available in Taiwan.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Compared with patients without AF, patients with AF had an increased risk of ischemic stroke (event number/patient number, incidence = 742/11 064, 5.75%/y versus 1399/14 658, 3.00%/y; <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 1.93; 95% confidence interval, 1.74–2.14) and similar risk of ICH (131/11 064, 0.97%/y versus 206/14 658, 0.54%/y; <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.66–1.09) in competing risk analysis for mortality. Among patients with AF, warfarin use was associated with a lower stroke risk (39/617, 3.83%/y versus 742/11 064, 5.75%/y; <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.49–0.96 in a competing risk model), with no difference in ICH risk compared with nontreatment. When compared with no antithrombotic therapy or antiplatelet drugs, warfarin was associated with a positive net clinical benefit. These findings persisted in propensity-matched analyses. Compared with warfarin, NOACs were associated with a lower risk of ICH (4/978, 0.42%/y versus 19/768, 1.63%/y; <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 0.32; 95% confidence interval, 0.10–0.97 in a competing risk model), with no difference in risk of ischemic stroke.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among patients with AF ≥90 years of age, warfarin was associated with a lower risk of ischemic stroke and positive net clinical benefit.

<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Late survival and symptomatic status of children with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have not been well defined. We examined long-term outcomes for pediatric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The National Australian Childhood Cardiomyopathy Study is a longitudinal population-based cohort study of children (0–10 years of age) diagnosed with cardiomyopathy between 1987 and 1996. The primary study end point was time to death or cardiac transplantation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>There were 80 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, with a median age at diagnosis of 0.48 (interquartile range, 0.1, 2.5) years. Freedom from death/transplantation was 86% (95% confidence interval [CI], 77.0–92.0) 1 year after presentation, 80% (95% CI, 69.0–87.0) at 10 years, and 78% (95% CI, 67.0–86.0) at 20 years. From multivariable analyses, risk factors for death/transplantation included symmetrical left ventricular hypertrophy at the time of diagnosis (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 4.20; 95% CI, 1.60–11.05; <i>P</i>=0.004), Noonan syndrome (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.02–8.08; <i>P</i>=0.045), higher posterior wall thickness <i>z</i> score (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.22–1.73; <i>P</i><0.001), and lower fractional shortening <i>z</i> score (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.74–0.95; <i>P</i>=0.005) during follow-up.

<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Hospital volume is frequently used as a structural metric for assessing quality of care, but its utility in patients admitted with acute heart failure (HF) is not well characterized. Accordingly, we sought to determine the relationship between admission volume, process-of-care metrics, and short- and long-term outcomes in patients admitted with acute HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients enrolled in the Get With The Guidelines-HF registry with linked Medicare inpatient data at 342 hospitals were assessed. Volume was assessed both as a continuous variable, and quartiles based on the admitting hospital annual HF case volume, as well: 5 to 38 (quartile 1), 39 to 77 (quartile 2), 78 to 122 (quartile 3), 123 to 457 (quartile 4). The main outcome measures were (1) process measures at discharge (achievement of HF achievement, quality, reporting, and composite metrics); (2) 30-day mortality and hospital readmission; and (3) 6-month mortality and hospital readmission. Adjusted logistic and Cox proportional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong>s models were used to study these associations with hospital volume.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 125 595 patients with HF were included. Patients admitted to high-volume hospitals had a higher burden of comorbidities. On multivariable modeling, lower-volume hospitals were significantly less likely to be adherent to HF process measures than higher-volume hospitals. Higher hospital volume was not associated with a difference in in-hospital (odds ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.94–1.05; <i>P</i>=0.78) or 30-day mortality (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.97–1.01; <i>P</i>=0.26), or 30-day readmissions (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.97–1.00; <i>P</i>=0.10). There was a weak association of higher volumes with lower 6-month mortality (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97–0.99; <i>P</i>=0.001) and lower 6-month all-cause readmissions (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 0.98; 95%, CI 0.97–1.00; <i>P</i>=0.025).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our analysis of a large contemporary prospective national quality improvement registry of older patients with HF indicates that hospital volume as a structural metric correlates with process measures, but not with 30-day outcomes, and only marginally with outcomes up to 6 months of follow-up. Hospital profiling should focus on participation in systems of care, adherence to process metrics, and risk-standardized outcomes rather than on hospital volume itself.</p></sec>

Association of Statin Dose With Amputation and Survival in Patients With Peripheral Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Statin dose guidelines for patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) are largely based on coronary artery disease and stroke data. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of statin intensity on PAD outcomes of amputation and mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using an observational cohort study design and a validated algorithm, we identified patients with incident PAD (2003–2014) in the national Veterans Affairs data. Highest statin intensity exposure (high-intensity versus low-to-moderate–intensity versus antiplatelet therapy but no statin use) was determined within 1 year of diagnosis of PAD. Outcomes of interest were lower extremity amputations and death. The association of statin intensity with incident amputation and mortality was assessed with Kaplan-Meier plots, Cox proportional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong>s modeling, propensity score–matched analysis, and sensitivity and subgroup analyses, as well, to reduce confounding.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In 155 647 patients with incident PAD, more than a quarter (28%) were not on statins. Use of high-intensity statins was lowest in patients with PAD only (6.4%) in comparison with comorbid coronary/carotid disease (18.4%). Incident amputation and mortality risk declined significantly with any statin use in comparison with the antiplatelet therapy–only group. In adjusted Cox models, the high-intensity statin users were associated with lower amputation risk and mortality in comparison with antiplatelet therapy–only users (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.61–0.74 and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.70–0.77, respectively). Low-to-moderate–intensity statins also had significant reductions in the risk of amputation and mortality (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio amputation, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.75– 0.86; <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio death, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.81–0.86) in comparison with no statins (antiplatelet therapy only), but effect size was significantly weaker than the high-intensity statins (<i>P</i><0.001). The association of high-intensity statins with lower amputation and death risk remained significant and robust in propensity score–matched, sensitivity, and subgroup analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Statins, especially high-intensity formulations, are underused in patients with PAD. This is the first population-based study to show that high-intensity statin use at the time of PAD diagnosis is associated with a significant reduction in limb loss and mortality in comparison with low-to-moderate–intensity statin users, and patients treated only with antiplatelet medications but not with statins, as well.</p></sec>

Black-White Differences in Incident Fatal, Nonfatal, and Total Coronary Heart Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Blacks have higher coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality compared with whites. However, a previous study suggests that nonfatal CHD risk may be lower for black versus white men.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We compared fatal and nonfatal CHD incidence and CHD case-fatality among blacks and whites in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study (ARIC), the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), and the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke study (REGARDS) by sex. Participants 45 to 64 years of age in ARIC (men=6479, women=8488) and REGARDS (men=5296, women=7822), and ≥65 years of age in CHS (men=1836, women=2790) and REGARDS (men=3381, women=4112), all without a history of CHD, were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed. Fatal and nonfatal CHD incidence was assessed from baseline (ARIC=1987–1989, CHS=1989–1990, REGARDS=2003–2007) through up to 11 years of follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Age-adjusted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratios comparing black versus white men 45 to 64 years of age in ARIC and REGARDS were 2.09 (95% confidence interval, 1.42–3.06) and 2.11 (1.32–3.38), respectively, for fatal CHD, and 0.82 (0.64–1.05) and 0.94 (0.69–1.28), respectively, for nonfatal CHD. After adjustment for social determinants of health and cardiovascular risk factors, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratios in ARIC and REGARDS were 1.19 (95% confidence interval, 0.74–1.92) and 1.09 (0.62–1.93), respectively, for fatal CHD, and 0.64 (0.47–0.86) and 0.67 (0.48–0.95), respectively, for nonfatal CHD. Similar patterns were present among men ≥65 years of age in CHS and REGARDS. Among women 45 to 64 years of age in ARIC and REGARDS, age-adjusted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratios comparing blacks versus whites were 2.61 (95% confidence interval, 1.57–4.34) and 1.79 (1.06–3.03), respectively, for fatal CHD, and 1.47 (1.13–1.91) and 1.29 (0.91–1.83), respectively, for nonfatal CHD. After multivariable adjustment, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratios in ARIC and REGARDS were 0.67 (95% confidence interval, 0.36–1.24) and 1.00 (0.54–1.85), respectively, for fatal CHD, and 0.70 (0.51–0.97) and 0.70 (0.46–1.06), respectively, for nonfatal CHD. Racial differences in CHD incidence were attenuated among older women.

Stellarex Drug-Coated Balloon for Treatment of Femoropopliteal Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Drug-coated balloons (DCBs) are a predominant revascularization therapy for symptomatic femoropopliteal artery disease. Because of the differences in excipients, paclitaxel dose, and coating morphologies, varying clinical outcomes have been observed with different DCBs. We report the results of 2 studies investigating the pharmacokinetic and clinical outcomes of a new DCB to treat femoropopliteal disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In the ILLUMENATE Pivotal Study (Prospective, Randomized, Single-Blind, U.S. Multi-Center Study to Evaluate Treatment of Obstructive Superficial Femoral Artery or Popliteal Lesions With A Novel Paclitaxel-Coated Percutaneous Angioplasty Balloon), 300 symptomatic patients (Rutherford class 2–4) were randomly assigned to DCB (n=200) or standard angioplasty (percutaneous transluminal angioplasty [PTA]) (n=100). The primary safety end point was freedom from device- and procedure-related death through 30 days, and freedom from target limb major amputation and clinically driven target lesion revascularization through 12 months. The primary effectiveness end point was primary patency through 12 months. In the ILLUMENATE PK study (Pharmacokinetic Study of the Stellarex Drug-Coated Angioplasty Balloon), paclitaxel plasma concentrations were measured after last DCB deployment and at prespecified times (at 1, 4, 24 hours and at 7 and 14 days postprocedure) until no longer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>able.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In the ILLUMENATE Pivotal Study, baseline characteristics were similar between groups: 50% had diabetes mellitus, 41% were women, mean lesion length was 8.3 cm, and 44% were severely calcified. The primary safety end point was met (92.1% for DCB versus 83.2% for PTA, <i>P</i>=0.025 for superiority) and the primary patency rate was significantly higher with DCB (76.3% for DCB versus 57.6% for PTA, <i>P</i>=0.003). Primary patency per Kaplan-Meier estimates at day 365 was 82.3% for DCB versus 70.9% for PTA (<i>P</i>=0.002). The rate of clinically driven target lesion revascularization was significantly lower in the DCB cohort (7.9% versus 16.8%, <i>P</i>=0.023). Improvements in ankle-brachial index, Rutherford class, and quality of life were comparable, but the PTA cohort required twice as many revascularizations. Pharmacokinetic outcomes showed that all patients had <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>able paclitaxel levels after DCB deployment that declined within the first hour (54.4±116.9 ng/mL to 1.4±1.0 ng/mL).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The data demonstrate superior safety and effectiveness of the Stellarex DCB in comparison with PTA, and plasma levels of paclitaxel fall to low levels within 1 hour.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Risk for Major Bleeding in Patients Receiving Ticagrelor Compared With Aspirin After Transient Ischemic Attack or Acute Ischemic Stroke in the SOCRATES Study (Acute Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack Treated With Aspirin or Ticagrelor and Patient Outcomes)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients with minor acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack are at high risk for subsequent stroke, and more potent antiplatelet therapy in the acute setting is needed. However, the potential benefit of more intense antiplatelet therapy must be assessed in relation to the risk for major bleeding. The SOCRATES trial (Acute Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack Treated With Aspirin or Ticagrelor and Patient Outcomes) was the first trial with ticagrelor in patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack in which the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor were compared with those of aspirin. The main safety objective was assessment of PLATO (Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes)–defined major bleeds on treatment, with special focus on intracranial hemorrhage (ICrH).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>An independent adjudication committee blinded to study treatment classified bleeds according to the PLATO, TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction), and GUSTO (Global Use of Strategies to Open Occluded Coronary Arteries) definitions. The definitions of ICrH and major bleeding excluded cerebral microbleeds and asymptomatic hemorrhagic transformations of cerebral infarctions so that the definitions better discriminated important events in the acute stroke population.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 13 130 of 13 199 randomized patients <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">receiv</span></strong>ed at least 1 dose of study drug and were included in the safety analysis set. PLATO major bleeds occurred in 31 patients (0.5%) on ticagrelor and 38 patients (0.6%) on aspirin (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.52–1.34). The most common locations of major bleeds were intracranial and gastrointestinal. ICrH was reported in 12 patients (0.2%) on ticagrelor and 18 patients (0.3%) on aspirin. Thirteen of all 30 ICrHs (4 on ticagrelor and 9 on aspirin) were hemorrhagic strokes, and 4 (2 in each group) were symptomatic hemorrhagic transformations of brain infarctions. The ICrHs were spontaneous in 6 and 13, traumatic in 3 and 3, and procedural in 3 and 2 patients on ticagrelor and aspirin, respectively. In total, 9 fatal bleeds occurred on ticagrelor and 4 on aspirin. The composite of ICrH or fatal bleeding included 15 patients on ticagrelor and 18 on aspirin. Independently of bleeding classification, PLATO, TIMI, or GUSTO, the relative difference between treatments for major/severe bleeds was similar. Nonmajor bleeds were more common on ticagrelor.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor in patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack showed a bleeding profile similar to that of aspirin for major bleeds. There were few ICrHs.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>. Unique identifier: NCT01994720.</p></sec>

Risk Factors for Coarctation of the Aorta on Prenatal Ultrasound
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Prenatal diagnosis of coarctation of the aorta (CoA) is still challenging and affected by high rates of false-positive diagnoses. The aim of this study was to ascertain the strength of association and to quantify the diagnostic accuracy of different ultrasound signs in predicting CoA prenatally.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases were searched. Random-effects and hierarchical summary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">receiv</span></strong>er operating characteristic model meta-analyses were used to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>e the data.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Seven hundred ninety-four articles were identified, and 12 (922 fetuses at risk for CoA) articles were included. Mean mitral valve diameter <i>z</i> score was lower (<i>P</i><0.001) and the mean tricuspid valve diameter <i>z</i> score was higher in fetuses with CoA than in those without CoA (<i>P</i>=0.01). Mean aortic valve diameter <i>z</i> score was lower in fetuses with CoA than in healthy fetuses (<i>P</i>≤0.001), but the ascending aorta diameter, expressed as <i>z</i> score or millimeters, was similar between groups (<i>P</i>=0.07 and 0.47, respectively). Mean aortic isthmus diameter <i>z</i> scores measured either in sagittal (<i>P</i>=0.02) or in 3-vessel trachea view (<i>P</i><0.001) were lower in fetuses with CoA. Conversely, the mean pulmonary artery diameter <i>z</i> score, the right/left ventricular and pulmonary artery/ascending aorta diameter ratios were higher (<i>P</i><0.001, <i>P</i>=0.02, and <i>P</i>=0.02, respectively) in fetuses with CoA in comparison with controls, although aortic isthmus/arterial duct diameter ratio was lower in fetuses with CoA than in those without CoA (<i>P</i><0.001). The presence of coarctation shelf and aortic arch hypoplasia were more common in fetuses with CoA than in controls (odds ratio, 26.0; 95% confidence interval, 4.42–153; <i>P</i><0.001 and odds ratio, 38.2; 95% confidence interval, 3.01–486; <i>P</i>=0.005), whereas persistent left superior vena cava (<i>P</i>=0.85), ventricular septal defect (<i>P</i>=0.12), and bicuspid aortic valve (<i>P</i>=0.14) did not carry an increased risk for this anomaly. Multiparametric diagnostic models integrating different ultrasound signs for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ion of CoA were associated with an increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ion rate.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ion rate of CoA may improve when a multiple-criteria prediction model is adopted.

Low-Dose Paclitaxel–Coated Versus Uncoated Percutaneous Transluminal Balloon Angioplasty for Femoropopliteal Peripheral Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Numerous studies have reported favorable outcomes using drug-coated balloons (DCBs) for treatment of symptomatic peripheral artery disease of the superficial femoral and popliteal arteries. However, the treatment effect compared with an uncoated balloon has differed greatly among the randomized trials, with better outcomes observed with higher-dose DCBs. This European trial was designed to assess the safety and effectiveness of a next-generation low-dose (2-µg/mm<sup>2</sup> surface dose of paclitaxel) DCB.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This was a prospective, randomized, multicenter, single-blinded trial. Patients were randomized (3:1) to treatment with a low-dose DCB or an uncoated percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) balloon. The primary safety end point was a composite of freedom from device- and procedure-related death through 30 days after the procedure and freedom from target limb major amputation and clinically driven target lesion revascularization through 12 months after the procedure. The primary effectiveness end point was primary patency at 12 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Patients were randomized to treatment with a DCB (222 patients, 254 lesions) or uncoated PTA balloon (72 patients, 79 lesions) after successful predilatation. Mean lesion length was 7.2 and 7.1 cm, and 19.2% and 19.0% of lesions represented total occlusions, respectively. The primary safety end point was met, and superiority was demonstrated; freedom from a primary safety event was 94.1% (193 of 205) with DCB and 83.3% (50 of 60) with PTA, for a difference of 10.8% (95% confidence interval, 0.9%–23.0%). The primary effectiveness end point was met, and superiority of DCB over PTA was achieved (83.9% [188 of 224] versus 60.6% [40 of 66]; <i>P</i><0.001). Outcomes with DCB were also superior to PTA per the Kaplan-Meier estimate for primary patency (89.0% versus 65.0% at 365 days; log-rank <i>P</i><0.001) and for rates of clinically driven target lesion revascularization (5.9% versus 16.7%; <i>P</i>=0.014).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Superiority with a low-dose DCB for femoropopliteal interventions was demonstrated over PTA for both the safety and effectiveness end points.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

The objective of this study was to assess the safety and tolerability of evolocumab in a pooled safety analysis from phase 2 or 3 randomized and placebo or comparator-controlled trials (integrated parent trials) and the first year of open-label extension (OLE) trials that included a standard-of-care control group.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This analysis included adverse event (AE) data from 6026 patients in 12 phase 2 and 3 parent trials, with a median exposure of 2.8 months, and, of those patients, from 4465 patients who continued with a median follow-up of 11.1 months in 2 OLE trials. AEs were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed separately for the parent and OLE trials. Overall AE rates, serious AEs, laboratory assessments, and AEs of interest were evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall AE rates were similar between evolocumab and control in the parent trials (51.1% versus 49.6%) and in year 1 of OLE trials (70.0% versus 66.0%), as were those for serious AEs. Elevations of serum transaminases, bilirubin, and creatine kinase were infrequent and similar between groups. Muscle-related AEs were similar between evolocumab and control. Neurocognitive AEs were infrequent and balanced during the double-blind parent studies (5 events [0.1%], evolocumab groups versus 6 events [0.3%], control groups). In the OLE trials, 27 patients (0.9%) in the evolocumab groups and 5 patients (0.3%) in the control groups reported neurocognitive AEs.

Evaluation of Cell Therapy on Exercise Performance and Limb Perfusion in Peripheral Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Atherosclerotic peripheral artery disease affects 8% to 12% of Americans >65 years of age and is associated with a major decline in functional status, increased myocardial infarction and stroke rates, and increased risk of ischemic amputation. Current treatment strategies for claudication have limitations. PACE (Patients With Intermittent Claudication Injected With ALDH Bright Cells) is a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute–sponsored, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 exploratory clinical trial designed to assess the safety and efficacy of autologous bone marrow–derived aldehyde dehydrogenase bright (ALDHbr) cells in patients with peripheral artery disease and to explore associated claudication physiological mechanisms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>All participants, randomized 1:1 to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">receiv</span></strong>e ALDHbr cells or placebo, underwent bone marrow aspiration and isolation of ALDHbr cells, followed by 10 injections into the thigh and calf of the index leg.

Detailed Echocardiographic Phenotyping in Breast Cancer Patients
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiovascular disease in patients with breast cancer is of growing concern. The longitudinal effects of commonly used therapies, including doxorubicin and trastuzumab, on cardiac remodeling and function remain unknown in this population. We aimed to define the changes in echocardiographic parameters of structure, function, and ventricular-arterial coupling, and their associations with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and heart failure symptoms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a longitudinal prospective cohort study of 277 breast cancer participants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">receiv</span></strong>ing doxorubicin (Dox), trastuzumab (Tras), or both (Dox+Tras), we obtained 1249 echocardiograms over a median follow-up of 2.0 (interquartile range, 1.0–3.0) years. Left ventricular structure, diastolic and contractile function, and ventricular-arterial coupling measures were quantified in a core laboratory blinded to participant characteristics. We evaluated changes in echocardiographic parameters over time, and used repeated-measures regression models to define their association with LVEF decline and recovery.

With Dox, there was a sustained, modest decrease in LVEF over the follow-up duration (1-year change in LVEF –3.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI], –4.4% to –2.8%; 3-year change –3.8%; 95% CI, –5.1% to –2.5%). With Tras, a similar LVEF decline was observed at 1 year (–4.5%; 95% CI, –6.0% to –2.9%) and 3 years (–2.8%; 95%CI, –5.3 to –0.4%). Participants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">receiv</span></strong>ing Dox+Tras demonstrated the greatest declines at 1 year (–6.6%; 95% CI, –8.2 to –5.0%), with partial recovery at 3 years (–2.8%; 95% CI, –4.8 to –0.8%). LVEF declines and recovery were associated primarily with changes in systolic volumes, longitudinal and circumferential strain, and ventricular-arterial coupling indices, effective arterial elastance (Ea) and the coupling ratio Ea/Ees<sub>sb</sub>, without evidence for effect modification across therapies. Early changes in volumes, strain, and Ea/Ees<sub>sb</sub> at 4 to 6 months were associated with 1- and 2-year LVEF changes. Similarly, early changes in strain and Ea were associated with worsening heart failure symptoms at 1 year.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Doxorubicin and trastuzumab resulted in modest, persistent declines in LVEF at 3 years.

Temporal Relationship Between Subclinical Atrial Fibrillation and Embolic Events
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Among patients with implantable pacemakers and defibrillators, subclinical atrial fibrillation (SCAF) is associated with an increased risk of stroke; however, there is limited understanding of their temporal relationship.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>The Asymptomatic Atrial Fibrillation and Stroke Evaluation in Pacemaker Patients and the Atrial Fibrillation Reduction Atrial Pacing Trial (ASSERT) enrolled 2580 pacemaker and defibrillator patients aged ≥65 years with a history of hypertension but without a history of atrial fibrillation. Pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators precisely logged the time and duration of all episodes of SCAF and recorded electrograms that were adjudicated by experts. We examined the temporal relationship between SCAF >6 minutes in duration and stroke or systemic embolism. Of 51 patients who experienced stroke or systemic embolism during follow-up, 26 (51%) had SCAF. In 18 patients (35%), SCAF was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ed before stroke or systemic embolism. However, only 4 patients (8%) had SCAF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ed within 30 days before stroke or systemic embolism, and only 1 of these 4 patients was experiencing SCAF at the time of the stroke. In the 14 patients with SCAF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ed >30 days before stroke or systemic embolism, the most recent episode occurred at a median interval of 339 days (25th to 75th percentile, 211–619) earlier.

Transplantation-Free Survival and Interventions at 3 Years in the Single Ventricle Reconstruction Trial
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>In the Single Ventricle Reconstruction (SVR) trial, 1-year transplantation-free survival was better for the Norwood procedure with right ventricle–to–pulmonary artery shunt (RVPAS) compared with a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt (MBTS). At 3 years, we compared transplantation-free survival, echocardiographic right ventricular ejection fraction, and unplanned interventions in the treatment groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Vital status and medical history were ascertained from annual medical records, death indexes, and phone interviews. The cohort included 549 patients randomized and treated in the SVR trial. Transplantation-free survival for the RVPAS versus MBTS groups did not differ at 3 years (67% versus 61%; <i>P</i>=0.15) or with all available follow-up of 4.8±1.1 years (log-rank <i>P</i>=0.14). Pre-Fontan right ventricular ejection fraction was lower in the RVPAS group than in the MBTS group (41.7<i>±</i>5.1% versus 44.7<i>±</i>6.0%; <i>P</i>=0.007), and right ventricular ejection fraction deteriorated in RVPAS (<i>P</i>=0.004) but not MBTS (<i>P</i>=0.40) subjects (pre-Fontan minus 14-month mean, −3.25±8.24% versus 0.99±8.80%; <i>P</i>=0.009). The RVPAS versus MBTS treatment effect had nonproportional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong>s (<i>P</i>=0.004); the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio favored the RVPAS before 5 months (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio=0.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.45–0.88) but the MBTS beyond 1 year (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio=2.22; 95% confidence interval, 1.07–4.62). By 3 years, RVPAS subjects had a higher incidence of catheter interventions (<i>P</i><0.001) with an increasing HR over time (<i>P</i>=0.005): <5 months, 1.14 (95% confidence interval, 0.81–1.60); from 5 months to 1 year, 1.94 (95% confidence interval, 1.02–3.69); and >1 year, 2.48 (95% confidence interval, 1.28–4.80).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>By 3 years, the Norwood procedure with RVPAS compared with MBTS was no longer associated with superior transplantation-free survival.

Autonomous vehicles: No driver…no regulation?
<p>According to the latest statistics from the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), 37,461 people were killed on the nation's roads in 2016 (<i>1</i>). Autonomous vehicle (AV) technology has the potential to reduce this number substantially. However, proper safeguards must be established immediately by federal regulators to govern the testing and deployment of AVs and ensure public safety. We must not undermine current safety standards for the sake of AV development. Moreover, reconsidering current requirements may be necessary to take advantage of this revolution. Nearly two-thirds (64%) of respondents in a recent CARAVAN public opinion poll expressed concern about sharing the road with driverless cars (<i>2</i>). If commonsense protections are not in place to govern AV development, and problems occur, the public will reject AVs, and the opportunity this new technology presents to improve public safety will be lost.</p>

Multiplexed and portable nucleic acid detection platform with Cas13, Cas12a, and Csm6
<p>Rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ion of nucleic acids is integral for clinical diagnostics and biotechnological applications. We recently developed a platform termed SHERLOCK (specific high-sensitivity enzymatic reporter unlocking) that combines isothermal preamplification with Cas13 to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong> single molecules of RNA or DNA. Through characterization of CRISPR enzymology and application development, we report here four advances integrated into SHERLOCK version 2 (SHERLOCKv2) (i) four-channel single-reaction multiplexing with orthogonal CRISPR enzymes; (ii) quantitative measurement of input as low as 2 attomolar; (iii) 3.5-fold increase in signal sensitivity by combining Cas13 with Csm6, an auxiliary CRISPR-associated enzyme; and (iv) lateral-flow readout. SHERLOCKv2 can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong> Dengue or Zika virus single-stranded RNA as well as mutations in patient liquid biopsy samples via lateral flow, highlighting its potential as a multiplexable, portable, rapid, and quantitative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ion platform of nucleic acids.</p>

Detection and localization of surgically resectable cancers with a multi-analyte blood test
<p>Earlier <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ion is key to reducing cancer deaths. Here, we describe a blood test that can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong> eight common cancer types through assessment of the levels of circulating proteins and mutations in cell-free DNA. We applied this test, called CancerSEEK, to 1005 patients with nonmetastatic, clinically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ed cancers of the ovary, liver, stomach, pancreas, esophagus, colorectum, lung, or breast. CancerSEEK tests were positive in a median of 70% of the eight cancer types. The sensitivities ranged from 69 to 98% for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ion of five cancer types (ovary, liver, stomach, pancreas, and esophagus) for which there are no screening tests available for average-risk individuals. The specificity of CancerSEEK was greater than 99%: only 7 of 812 healthy controls scored positive. In addition, CancerSEEK localized the cancer to a small number of anatomic sites in a median of 83% of the patients.</p>

Development of the GABA-ergic signaling system and its role in larval swimming in sea urchin
<p>The present study aimed to elucidate the development and γ-amino butyric acid (GABA)-ergic regulation of larval swimming in the sea urchin <i>Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus</i> by cloning glutamate decarboxylase (<i>Hp-gad</i>), GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor (<i>Hp-gabrA</i>) and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-associated protein (<i>Hp-gabarap</i>), and by performing immunohistochemistry. The regulation of larval swimming was increasingly dependent on the GABAergic system, which was active from the 2 days post-fertilization (d.p.f.) pluteus stage onwards. GABA-immunoreactive cells were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ed as a subpopulation of secondary mesenchyme cells during gastrulation and eventually constituted the ciliary band and a subpopulation of blastocoelar cells during the pluteus stage. <i>Hp-gad</i> transcription was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ed by RT-PCR during the period when Hp-Gad-positive cells were seen as a subpopulation of blastocoelar cells and on the apical side of the ciliary band from the 2 d.p.f. pluteus stage. Consistent with these observations, inhibition of GAD with 3-mercaptopropioninc acid inhibited GABA immunoreactivity and larval swimming dose dependently. <i>Hp-gabrA</i> amplimers were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ed weakly in unfertilized eggs and 4 d.p.f. plutei but strongly from fertilized eggs to 2 d.p.f. plutei, and Hp-GabrA, together with GABA, was localized at the ciliary band in association with dopamine receptor D1 from the two-arm pluteus stage. <i>Hp-gabarap</i> transcription and protein expression were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ed from the swimming blastula stage. Inhibition of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor by bicuculline inhibited larval swimming dose dependently. Inhibition of larval swimming by either 3-mercaptopropionic acid or bicuculline was more severe in older larvae (17 and 34 d.p.f. plutei) than in younger ones (1 d.p.f. prism larvae).</p>

Residual Inflammatory Risk on Treatment With PCSK9 Inhibition and Statin Therapy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The combination of statin therapy and PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibition markedly lowers low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and reduces cardiovascular event rates. Whether residual inflammatory risk as measured by on-treatment high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) remains an important clinical issue in such patients is uncertain.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We evaluated residual inflammatory risk among 9738 patients participating in the SPIRE-1 and SPIRE-2 cardiovascular outcomes trials (Studies of PCSK9 Inhibition and the Reduction in Vascular Events), who were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">receiv</span></strong>ing both statin therapy and bococizumab, according to on-treatment levels of hsCRP (hsCRP<sub>OT</sub>) and LDL-C<sub>OT</sub> measured 14 weeks after drug initiation.

Incidence rates for future cardiovascular events for patients treated with both statin therapy and bococizumab according to hsCRP<sub>OT</sub> <1, 1 to 3, and >3 mg/L were 1.96, 2.50, and 3.59 events per 100 person-years, respectively, corresponding to multivariable adjusted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratios of 1.0, 1.16 (95% CI, 0.81–1.66), and 1.62 (95% CI, 1.14–2.30) (<i>P</i>-trend=0.001) after adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors and LDL-C<sub>OT</sub>.

Long-Term Risk of Cardiovascular Disease in Women Who Have Had Infants With Heart Defects

We identified women whose infants had critical, noncritical, or no heart defects, and tracked the women over time for future hospitalizations for cardiovascular disease, with follow-up extending up to 25 years past pregnancy. We calculated the incidence of cardiovascular hospitalization per 1000 person-years, and used Cox proportional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong>s regression to estimate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between infant heart defects and risk of maternal cardiovascular hospitalization. Models were adjusted for age, parity, preeclampsia, comorbidity, material deprivation, and time period.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Women whose infants had heart defects had a higher overall incidence of cardiovascular hospitalization. There were 3.38 cardiovascular hospitalizations per 1000 person-years for those with critical defects (95% CI, 2.67–4.27), 3.19 for noncritical defects (95% CI, 2.96–3.45), and 2.42 for no heart defects (95% CI, 2.39–2.44). In comparison with no heart defects, women whose infants had critical defects had a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio of 1.43 (95% CI, 1.13–1.82) for any cardiovascular hospitalization, and women whose infants had noncritical defects had a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio of 1.24 (95% CI, 1.15–1.34), in adjusted models.

The goal of this study is to conduct a head-to-head comparison of the safety and effectiveness of intensified antiplatelet therapies (either double-dose clopidogrel [DOUBLE] or adjunctive cilostazol [TRIPLE]) and conventional strategy (STANDARD) in patients after percutaneous coronary intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In this single-center, randomized, controlled trial, we used thromboelastography, a platelet function test, to select 1078 patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention at high thrombotic risk and compared the intensified antiplatelet therapies with standard antiplatelet therapy. The primary outcome was the incidence of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events at 18 months after percutaneous coronary intervention, defined as a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularization, or stroke. Bleeding Academic Research Consortium defined bleeding complications (types 1, 2, 3, or 5) were the safety end points.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The primary end point occurred in 52 patients (14.4%) in the STANDARD group, 38 patients (10.6%) in the DOUBLE group, and 30 patients (8.5%) in the TRIPLE group (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 0.720; 95% confidence interval, 0.474–1.094, DOUBLE versus STANDARD; <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 0.550; 95% confidence interval, 0.349–0.866, TRIPLE versus STANDARD). No significant difference in the rates of major bleeding (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium grade≥3) was found in the DOUBLE group (3.34% versus 1.93% in STANDARD, <i>P</i>=0.133) and the TRIPLE group (2.53% versus 1.93% in STANDARD, <i>P</i>=0.240). The rate of Bleeding Academic Research Consortium–defined minor bleeding increased in the DOUBLE group (27.4% versus 20.3% in STANDARD, <i>P</i>=0.031), but not in the TRIPLE group (23.6% versus 20.3% in STANDARD, <i>P</i>=0.146).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In patients with low responsiveness to clopidogrel, as measured by thromboelastography, the intensified antiplatelet strategies with adjunctive use of cilostazol significantly improved the clinical outcomes without increasing the risk of major bleeding.

Particulate Matter Air Pollution Exposure and Heart Disease Mortality Risks by Race and Ethnicity in the United States
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Most US studies of mortality and air pollution have been conducted on largely non-Hispanic white study populations. However, many health and mortality outcomes differ by race and ethnicity, and non-Hispanic white persons experience lower air pollution exposure than those who are non-Hispanic black or Hispanic. This study examines whether associations between air pollution and heart disease mortality differ by race/ethnicity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used data from the 1997 to 2009 National Health Interview Survey linked to mortality records through December 2011 and annual estimates of fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) by census tract. Proportional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong>s models were used to estimate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratios and 95% confidence intervals between PM<sub>2.5</sub> (per 10 µg/m<sup>3</sup>) and heart disease mortality using the full sample and the sample adults, which have information on additional health variables. Interaction terms were used to examine differences in the PM<sub>2.5</sub>-mortality association by race/ethnicity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, 65 936 of the full sample died during follow-up, and 22 152 died from heart disease. After adjustment for several factors, we found a significant positive association between PM<sub>2.5</sub> and heart disease mortality (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 1.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.08–1.25). This association was similar in sample adults with adjustment for smoking and body mass index (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 1.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.06–1.31). Interaction terms for non-Hispanic black and Hispanic groups compared with the non-Hispanic white group were not statistically significant.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Using a nationally representative sample, the association between PM<sub>2.5</sub> and heart disease mortality was elevated and similar to previous estimates. Associations for non-Hispanic black and Hispanic adults were not statistically significantly different from those for non-Hispanic white adults.</p></sec>

Long-Term Outcomes in Patients With Type 2 Myocardial Infarction and Myocardial Injury
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury are common in clinical practice, but long-term consequences are uncertain. We aimed to define long-term outcomes and explore risk stratification in patients with type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We identified consecutive patients (n=2122) with elevated cardiac troponin I concentrations (≥0.05 µg/L) at a tertiary cardiac center. All diagnoses were adjudicated as per the universal definition of myocardial infarction. The primary outcome was all-cause death. Secondary outcomes included major adverse cardiovascular events (eg, nonfatal myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death) and noncardiovascular death. To explore competing risks, cause-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratios were obtained using Cox regression models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The adjudicated index diagnosis was type 1 or 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury in 1171 (55.2%), 429 (20.2%), and 522 (24.6%) patients, respectively. At 5 years, all-cause death rates were higher in those with type 2 myocardial infarction (62.5%) or myocardial injury (72.4%) compared with type 1 myocardial infarction (36.7%). The majority of excess deaths in those with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury were because of noncardiovascular causes (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 2.32; 95% confidence interval, 1.92–2.81 versus type 1 myocardial infarction). Despite this finding, the observed crude major adverse cardiovascular event rates were similar between groups (30.6% versus 32.6%), with differences apparent after adjustment for covariates (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.69–0.96). Coronary heart disease was an independent predictor of major adverse cardiovascular events in those with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 1.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.31–2.24).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Despite an excess in noncardiovascular death, patients with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury have a similar crude rate of major adverse cardiovascular events as those with type 1 myocardial infarction. Identifying underlying coronary heart disease in this vulnerable population may help target therapies that could modify future risk.</p></sec>

Assessment of Remote Heart Rhythm Sampling Using the AliveCor Heart Monitor to Screen for Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Asymptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF) is increasingly common in the aging population and implicated in many ischemic strokes. Earlier identification of AF with appropriate anticoagulation may decrease stroke morbidity and mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a randomized controlled trial of AF screening using an AliveCor Kardia <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monitor</span></strong> attached to a WiFi-enabled iPod to obtain ECGs (iECGs) in ambulatory patients. Patients ≥65 years of age with a CHADS-VASc score ≥2 free from AF were randomized to the iECG arm or routine care (RC). iECG participants acquired iECGs twice weekly over 12 months (plus additional iECGs if symptomatic) onto a secure study server with overread by an automated AF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ion algorithm and by a cardiac physiologist and/or consultant cardiologist. Time to diagnosis of AF was the primary outcome measure. The overall cost of the devices, ECG interpretation, and patient management were captured and used to generate the cost per AF diagnosis in iECG patients. Clinical events and patient attitudes/experience were also evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We studied 1001 patients (500 iECG, 501 RC) who were 72.6±5.4 years of age; 534 were female. Mean CHADS-VASc score was 3.0 (heart failure, 1.4%; hypertension, 54%; diabetes mellitus, 30%; prior stroke/transient ischemic attack, 6.5%; arterial disease, 15.9%; all CHADS-VASc risk factors were evenly distributed between groups). Nineteen patients in the iECG group were diagnosed with AF over the 12-month study period versus 5 in the RC arm (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 3.9; 95% confidence interval=1.4–10.4; <i>P</i>=0.007) at a cost per AF diagnosis of $10 780 (£8255). There was a similar number of stroke/transient ischemic attack/systemic embolic events (6 versus 10, iECG versus RC; <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio=0.61; 95% confidence interval=0.22–1.69; <i>P</i>=0.34). The majority of iECG patients were satisfied with the device, finding it easy to use without restricting activities or causing anxiety.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Screening with twice-weekly single-lead iECG with remote interpretation in ambulatory patients ≥65 years of age at increased risk of stroke is significantly more likely to identify incident AF than RC over a 12-month period. This approach is also highly acceptable to this group of patients, supporting further evaluation in an appropriately powered, event-driven clinical trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.isrctn.com</ext-link>.

Anti-Müllerian Hormone Trajectories Are Associated With Cardiovascular Disease in Women
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Earlier age at menopause is widely considered to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. However, the underlying mechanisms of this relationship remain undetermined. Indications suggest that anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), an ovarian reserve marker, plays a physiological role outside of the reproductive system. Therefore, we investigated whether longitudinal AMH decline trajectories are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) occurrence.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This study included 3108 female participants between 20 and 60 years of age at baseline of the population-based Doetinchem Cohort. Participants completed ≥1 of 5 consecutive quinquennial visits between 1987 and 2010, resulting in a total follow-up time of 20 years. AMH was measured in 8507 stored plasma samples. Information on total CVD, stroke, and coronary heart disease was obtained through a hospital discharge registry linkage. The association of AMH trajectories with CVD was quantified with joint modeling, with adjustment for age, smoking, oral contraceptive use, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone therapy use, diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and glucose levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>By the end of follow-up, 8.2% of the women had suffered from CVD, 4.9% had suffered from coronary heart disease, and 2.6% had experienced a stroke. After adjustment, each ng/mL lower <sub>log</sub>AMH level was associated with a 21% higher risk of CVD (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.07–1.36) and a 26% higher risk of coronary heart disease (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.08–1.46). Each additional ng/mL/year decrease of <sub>log</sub>AMH was associated with a significantly higher risk of CVD (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 1.46; 95% confidence interval, 1.14–1.87) and coronary heart disease (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 1.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.15–2.12). No association between AMH and stroke was found.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These results indicate that AMH trajectories in women are independently associated with CVD risk. Therefore, we postulate that the decline of circulating AMH levels may be part of the pathophysiology of the increased cardiovascular risk of earlier menopause. Confirmation of this association and elucidation of its underlying mechanisms are needed to place these results in a clinical perspective.</p></sec>

Sex Differences in 1-Year All-Cause Rehospitalization in Patients After Acute Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Compared with men, women are at higher risk of rehospitalization in the first month after discharge for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, it is unknown whether this risk extends to the full year and varies by age. Explanatory factors potentially mediating the relationship between sex and rehospitalization remain unexplored and are needed to reduce readmissions. The aim of this study was to assess sex differences and factors associated with 1-year rehospitalization rates after AMI.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We recruited 3536 patients (33% women) ≥18 years of age hospitalized with AMI from 24 US centers into the TRIUMPH study (Translational Research Investigating Underlying Disparities in Acute Myocardial Infarction Patients’ Health Status). Data were obtained by medical record abstraction and patient interviews, and a physician panel adjudicated hospitalizations within the first year after AMI. We compared sex differences in rehospitalization using a Cox proportional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong>s model, following sequential adjustment for covariates and testing for an age-sex interaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>One-year crude all-cause rehospitalization rates for women were significantly higher than men after AMI (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 1.29 for women; 95% confidence interval, 1.12−1.48). After adjustment for demographics and clinical factors, women had a persistent 26% higher risk of rehospitalization (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 1.26; 95% confidence interval, 1.08−1.47). However, after adjustment for health status and psychosocial factors (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 1.14; 95% confidence interval, 0.96−1.35), the association was attenuated. No significant age-sex interaction was found for 1-year rehospitalization, suggesting that the increased risk applied to both older and younger women.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Regardless of age, women have a higher risk of rehospitalization compared with men over the first year after AMI. Although the increased risk persisted after adjustment for clinical factors, the poorer health and psychosocial state of women attenuated the difference.</p></sec>

Impact of Computed Tomography Perfusion Imaging on the Response to Tenecteplase in Ischemic Stroke
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>We pooled 2 clinical trials of tenecteplase compared with alteplase for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke, 1 that demonstrated superiority of tenecteplase and the other that showed no difference between the treatments in patient clinical outcomes. We tested the hypotheses that reperfusion therapy with tenecteplase would be superior to alteplase in improving functional outcomes in the group of patients with target mismatch as identified with advanced imaging.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We investigated whether tenecteplase-treated patients had a different 24-hour reduction in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and a favorable odds ratio of a modified Rankin scale score of 0 to 1 versus 2 to 6 compared with alteplase-treated patients using linear regression to generate odds ratios. Imaging outcomes included rates of vessel recanalization and infarct growth at 24 hours and occurrence of large parenchymal hematoma. Baseline computed tomography perfusion was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed to assess whether patients met the target mismatch criteria (absolute mismatch volume >15 mL, mismatch ratio >1.8, baseline ischemic core <70 mL, and volume of severely hypoperfused tissue <100 mL). Patients meeting target mismatch criteria were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed as a subgroup to identify whether they had different treatment responses from the pooled group.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 146 pooled patients, 71 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">receiv</span></strong>ed alteplase and 75 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">receiv</span></strong>ed tenecteplase. Tenecteplase-treated patients had greater early clinical improvement (median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score change: tenecteplase, 7; alteplase, 2; <i>P</i>=0.018) and less parenchymal hematoma (2 of 75 versus 10 of 71; <i>P</i>=0.02).

Thrombus Aspiration in ST-Segment–Elevation Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Thrombus aspiration during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for the treatment of ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) has been widely used; however, recent trials have questioned its value and safety. In this meta-analysis, we, the trial investigators, aimed to pool the individual patient data from these trials to determine the benefits and risks of thrombus aspiration during PCI in patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Included were large (n≥1000), randomized, controlled trials comparing manual thrombectomy and PCI alone in patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction. Individual patient data were provided by the leadership of each trial. The prespecified primary efficacy outcome was cardiovascular mortality within 30 days, and the primary safety outcome was stroke or transient ischemic attack within 30 days.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The 3 eligible randomized trials (TAPAS [Thrombus Aspiration During Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in Acute Myocardial Infarction], TASTE [Thrombus Aspiration in ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction in Scandinavia], and TOTAL [Trial of Routine Aspiration Thrombectomy With PCI Versus PCI Alone in Patients With STEMI]) enrolled 19 047 patients, of whom 18 306 underwent PCI and were included in the primary analysis. Cardiovascular death at 30 days occurred in 221 of 9155 patients (2.4%) randomized to thrombus aspiration and 262 of 9151 (2.9%) randomized to PCI alone (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 0.70–1.01; <i>P</i>=0.06). Stroke or transient ischemic attack occurred in 66 (0.8%) randomized to thrombus aspiration and 46 (0.5%) randomized to PCI alone (odds ratio, 1.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.98–2.10; <i>P</i>=0.06). There were no significant differences in recurrent myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, heart failure, or target vessel revascularization. In the subgroup with high thrombus burden (TIMI [Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction] thrombus grade ≥3), thrombus aspiration was associated with fewer cardiovascular deaths (170 [2.5%] versus 205 [3.1%]; <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.65–0.98; <i>P</i>=0.03) and with more strokes or transient ischemic attacks (55 [0.9%] versus 34 [0.5%]; odds ratio, 1.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.02–2.42, <i>P</i>=0.04). However, the interaction <i>P</i> values were 0.32 and 0.34, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Routine thrombus aspiration during PCI for ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction did not improve clinical outcomes.

Fractional Flow Reserve and Cardiac Events in Coronary Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>We evaluated the prognosis of deferred and revascularized coronary stenoses after fractional flow reserve (FFR) measurement to assess its revascularization threshold in clinical practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The IRIS-FFR registry (Interventional Cardiology Research In-cooperation Society Fractional Flow Reserve) prospectively enrolled 5846 patients with ≥1coronary lesion with FFR measurement. Revascularization was deferred in 6468 lesions and performed in 2165 lesions after FFR assessment. The primary end point was major adverse cardiac events (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and repeat revascularization) at a median follow-up of 1.9 years and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed on a per-lesion basis. A marginal Cox model accounted for correlated data in patients with multiple lesions, and a model to predict per-lesion outcomes was adjusted for confounding factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>For deferred lesions, the risk of major adverse cardiac events demonstrated a significant, inverse relationship with FFR (adjusted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 1.05–1.08; <i>P</i><0.001). However, this relationship was not observed in revascularized lesions (adjusted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.98–1.02; <i>P</i>=0.70). For lesions with FFR ≥0.76, the risk of major adverse cardiac events was not significantly different between deferred and revascularized lesions. Conversely, in lesions with FFR ≤0.75, the risk of major adverse cardiac events was significantly lower in revascularized lesions than in deferred lesions (for FFR 0.71–0.75, adjusted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.24–0.89; <i>P</i>=0.021; for FFR ≤0.70, adjusted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio 0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.26–0.84; <i>P</i>=0.012).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This large, prospective registry showed that the FFR value was linearly associated with the risk of cardiac events in deferred lesions.

Multimodality Strategy for Cardiovascular Risk Assessment
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Current strategies for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk assessment among adults without known CVD are limited by suboptimal performance and a narrow focus on only atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD). We hypothesized that a strategy combining promising biomarkers across multiple different testing modalities would improve global and atherosclerotic CVD risk assessment among individuals without known CVD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We included participants from MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) (n=6621) and the Dallas Heart Study (n=2202) who were free from CVD and underwent measurement of left ventricular hypertrophy by ECG, coronary artery calcium, N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Associations of test results with the global composite CVD outcome (CVD death, myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary or peripheral revascularization, incident heart failure, or atrial fibrillation) and ASCVD (fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke) were assessed over >10 years of follow-up. Multivariable analyses for the primary global CVD end point adjusted for traditional risk factors plus statin use and creatinine (base model).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Each test result was independently associated with global composite CVD events in MESA after adjustment for the components of the base model and the other test results (<i>P</i><0.05 for each). When the 5 tests were added to the base model, the c-statistic improved from 0.74 to 0.79 (<i>P</i>=0.001), significant integrated discrimination improvement (0.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.06–0.08, <i>P</i><0.001) and category free net reclassification improvement (0.47; 95% CI, 0.38–0.56; <i>P</i>=0.003) were observed, and the model was well calibrated (χ<sup>2</sup>=12.2, <i>P</i>=0.20). Using a simple integer score counting the number of abnormal tests, compared with those with a score of 0, global CVD risk was increased among participants with a score of 1 (adjusted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.4–2.6), 2 (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 3.2; 95% CI, 2.3–4.4), 3 (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 4.7; 95% CI, 3.4–6.5), and ≥4 (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 7.5; 95% CI, 5.2–10.6).

Cardiac Outcomes After Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Insulin resistance is highly prevalent among patients with atherosclerosis and is associated with an increased risk for myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke. The IRIS trial (Insulin Resistance Intervention after Stroke) demonstrated that pioglitazone decreased the composite risk for fatal or nonfatal stroke and MI in patients with insulin resistance without diabetes mellitus, after a recent ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. The type and severity of cardiac events in this population and the impact of pioglitazone on these events have not been described.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed a secondary analysis of the effects of pioglitazone, in comparison with placebo, on acute coronary syndromes (MI and unstable angina) among IRIS participants.

The majority of MIs were type 1 (94, 65%), followed by type 2 (45, 32%). Serum troponin was 10× to 100× upper limit of normal in 49 (35%) and >100× upper limit of normal in 39 (28%). Pioglitazone reduced the risk of acute coronary syndrome (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 0.71; 95% confidence interval, 0.54–0.94; <i>P</i>=0.02). Pioglitazone also reduced the risk of type 1 MI (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 0.62; 95% confidence interval, 0.40–0.96; log-rank <i>P</i>=0.03), but not type 2 MI (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 1.05; 95% confidence interval, 0.58–1.91; <i>P</i>=0.87). Similarly, pioglitazone reduced the risk of large MIs with serum troponin >100× upper limit of normal (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 0.44; 95% confidence interval, 0.22–0.87; <i>P</i>=0.02), but not smaller MIs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among patients with insulin resistance without diabetes mellitus, pioglitazone reduced the risk for acute coronary syndromes after a recent cerebrovascular event. Pioglitazone appeared to have its most prominent effect in preventing spontaneous type 1 MIs.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Impact of Practice-Based Management of Pulmonary Artery Pressures in 2000 Patients Implanted With the CardioMEMS Sensor
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Elevated pulmonary artery (PA) pressures in patients with heart failure are associated with a high risk for hospitalization and mortality. Recent clinical trial evidence demonstrated a direct relationship between lowering remotely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monitor</span></strong>ed PA pressures and heart failure hospitalization risk reduction with a novel implantable PA pressure <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monitor</span></strong>ing system (CardioMEMS HF System, St. Jude Medical). This study examines PA pressure changes in the first 2000 US patients implanted in general practice use.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Deidentified data from the remote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monitor</span></strong>ing Merlin.net (St. Jude Medical) database were used to examine PA pressure trends from the first consecutive 2000 patients with at least 6 months of follow-up. Changes in PA pressures were evaluated with an area under the curve methodology to estimate the total sum increase or decrease in pressures (mm Hg-day) during the follow-up period relative to the baseline pressure. As a reference, the PA pressure trends were compared with the historic CHAMPION clinical trial (CardioMEMS Heart Sensor Allows <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monitor</span></strong>ing of Pressure to Improve Outcomes in New York Heart Association [NYHA] Functional Class III Heart Failure Patients). The area under the curve results are presented as mean±2 SE, and <i>P</i> values comparing the area under the curve of the general-use cohort with outcomes in the CHAMPION trial were computed by the <i>t</i> test with equal variance.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Patients were on average 70±12 years old; 60% were male; 34% had preserved ejection fraction; and patients were followed up for an average of 333±125 days. At implantation, the mean PA pressure for the general-use patients was 34.9±10.2 mm Hg compared with 31.3±10.9 mm Hg for CHAMPION treatment and 32.0±10.5 mm Hg for CHAMPION control groups. The general-use patients had an area under the curve of −32.8 mm Hg-day at the 1-month time mark, −156.2 mm Hg-day at the 3-month time mark, and −434.0 mm Hg-day after 6 months of hemodynamic guided care, which was significantly lower than the treatment group in the CHAMPION trial. Patients consistently transmitted pressure information with a median of 1.27 days between transmissions after 6 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The first 2000 general-use patients managed with hemodynamic-guided heart failure care had higher PA pressures at baseline and experienced greater reduction in PA pressure over time compared with the pivotal CHAMPION clinical trial. These data demonstrate that general use of implantable hemodynamic technology in a nontrial setting leads to significant lowering of PA pressures.</p></sec>

Three Arterial Grafts Improve Late Survival
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Little evidence shows whether a third arterial graft provides superior outcomes compared with the use of 2 arterial grafts in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. A meta-analysis of all the propensity score-matched observational studies comparing the long-term outcomes of coronary artery bypass grafting with the use of 2-arterial versus 3-arterial grafts was performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science to identify relevant articles. Long-term mortality in the propensity score-matched populations was the primary end point. Secondary end points were in-hospital/30-day mortality for the propensity score-matched populations and long-term mortality for the unmatched populations. In the matched population, time-to-event outcome for long-term mortality was extracted as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratios, along with their variance. Statistical pooling of survival (time-to-event) was performed according to a random effect model, computing risk estimates with 95% confidence intervals.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Eight propensity score-matched studies reporting on 10 287 matched patients (2-arterial graft: 5346; 3-arterial graft: 4941) were selected for final comparison. The mean follow-up time ranged from 37.2 to 196.8 months. The use of 3 arterial grafts was not statistically associated with early mortality (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 0.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.71–1.22; <i>P</i>=0.62). The use of 3 arterial grafts was associated with statistically significantly lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> for late death (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 0.8; 95% confidence interval, 0.75–0.87; <i>P</i><0.001), irrespective of sex and diabetic mellitus status. This result was qualitatively similar in the unmatched population (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.33–0.98; <i>P</i>=0.04).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The use of a third arterial conduit in patients with coronary artery bypass grafting is not associated with higher operative risk and is associated with superior long-term survival, irrespective of sex and diabetic mellitus status.</p></sec>

Point-of-Care Hemostatic Testing in Cardiac Surgery
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac surgery is frequently complicated by coagulopathic bleeding that is difficult to optimally manage using standard hemostatic testing. We hypothesized that point-of-care hemostatic testing within the context of an integrated transfusion algorithm would improve the management of coagulopathy in cardiac surgery and thereby reduce blood transfusions.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a pragmatic multicenter stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial of a point-of-care–based transfusion algorithm in consecutive patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass at 12 hospitals from October 6, 2014, to May 1, 2015. Following a 1-month data collection at all participating hospitals, a transfusion algorithm incorporating point-of-care hemostatic testing was sequentially implemented at 2 hospitals at a time in 1-month intervals, with the implementation order randomly assigned. No other aspects of care were modified. The primary outcome was red blood cell transfusion from surgery to postoperative day 7. Other outcomes included transfusion of other blood products, major bleeding, and major complications. The analysis adjusted for secular time trends, within-hospital clustering, and patient-level risk factors. All outcomes and analyses were prespecified before study initiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among the 7402 patients studied, 3555 underwent surgery during the control phase and 3847 during the intervention phase. Overall, 3329 (45.0%) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">receiv</span></strong>ed red blood cells, 1863 (25.2%) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">receiv</span></strong>ed platelets, 1645 (22.2%) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">receiv</span></strong>ed plasma, and 394 (5.3%) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">receiv</span></strong>ed cryoprecipitate. Major bleeding occurred in 1773 (24.1%) patients, and major complications occurred in 740 (10.2%) patients. The trial intervention reduced rates of red blood cell transfusion (adjusted relative risk, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.85–0.98; <i>P</i>=0.02; number needed to treat, 24.7), platelet transfusion (relative risk, 0.77; 95% confidence interval, 0.68–0.87; <i>P</i><0.001; number needed to treat, 16.7), and major bleeding (relative risk, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.72–0.94; <i>P</i>=0.004; number needed to treat, 22.6), but had no effect on other blood product transfusions or major complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Implementation of point-of-care hemostatic testing within the context of an integrated transfusion algorithm reduces red blood cell transfusions, platelet transfusions, and major bleeding following cardiac surgery. Our findings support the broader adoption of point-of-care hemostatic testing into clinical practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Berlin Heart EXCOR Pediatric Ventricular Assist Device for Bridge to Heart Transplantation in US Children
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Recent data suggest that the Berlin Heart EXCOR Pediatric ventricular assist device is superior to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for bridge to heart transplantation. Published data are limited to 1 in 4 children who <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">receiv</span></strong>ed the device as part of the US clinical trial. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed outcomes for all US children who <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">receiv</span></strong>ed the EXCOR to characterize device outcomes in an unselected cohort and to identify risk factors for mortality to facilitate patient selection.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>This multicenter, prospective cohort study involved all children implanted with the Berlin Heart EXCOR Pediatric ventricular assist device at 47 centers from May 2007 through December 2010. Multiphase nonproportional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong>s modeling was used to identify risk factors for early (<2 months) and late mortality. Of 204 children supported with the EXCOR, the median duration of support was 40 days (range, 1–435 days). Survival at 12 months was 75%, including 64% who reached transplantation, 6% who recovered, and 5% who were alive on the device. Multivariable analysis identified lower weight, biventricular assist device support, and elevated bilirubin as risk factors for early mortality and bilirubin extremes and renal dysfunction as risk factors for late mortality. Neurological dysfunction occurred in 29% and was the leading cause of death.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Use of the Berlin Heart EXCOR has risen dramatically over the past decade. The EXCOR has emerged as a new treatment standard in the United States for pediatric bridge to transplantation. Three-quarters of children survived to transplantation or recovery; an important fraction experienced neurological dysfunction. Smaller patient size, renal dysfunction, hepatic dysfunction, and biventricular assist device use were associated with mortality, whereas extracorporeal membrane oxygenation before implantation and congenital heart disease were not.</p></sec>

Genetic Determinants of Dabigatran Plasma Levels and Their Relation to Bleeding
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Fixed-dose un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monitor</span></strong>ed treatment with dabigatran etexilate is effective and has a favorable safety profile in the prevention of stroke in atrial fibrillation patients compared with warfarin. We hypothesized that genetic variants could contribute to interindividual variability in blood concentrations of the active metabolite of dabigatran etexilate and influence the safety and efficacy of dabigatran.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We successfully conducted a genome-wide association study in 2944 Randomized Evaluation of Long-term Anticoagulation Therapy (RE-LY) participants. The <i>CES1</i> single-nucleotide polymorphism rs2244613 was associated with trough concentrations, and the <i>ABCB1</i> single-nucleotide polymorphism rs4148738 and the <i>CES1</i> single-nucleotide polymorphism rs8192935 were associated with peak concentrations at genome-wide significance (<i>P</i><9×10<sup>−8</sup>) with a gene-dose effect. Each minor allele of the <i>CES1</i> single-nucleotide polymorphism rs2244613 was associated with lower trough concentrations (15% decrease per allele; 95% confidence interval, 10–19; <i>P</i>=1.2×10<sup>−8</sup>) and a lower risk of any bleeding (odds ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.55–0.82; <i>P</i>=7×10<sup>−5</sup>) in dabigatran-treated participants, with a consistent but nonsignificant lower risk of major bleeding (odds ratio, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.43–1.01). The interaction between treatment (warfarin versus all dabigatran) and carrier status was statistically significant (<i>P</i>=0.002), with carriers having less bleeding with dabigatran than warfarin (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.46–0.76; <i>P</i>=5.2×10<sup>−</sup>5) in contrast to no difference in noncarriers (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.81–1.14; <i>P</i>=0.65). There was no association with ischemic events, and neither rs4148738 nor rs8192935 was associated with bleeding or ischemic events.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Genome-wide association analysis identified that carriage of the <i>CES1</i> rs2244613 minor allele occurred in 32.8% of patients in RE-LY and was associated with lower exposure to active dabigatran metabolite.

Association Between Physician Follow-Up and Outcomes of Care After Chest Pain Assessment in High-Risk Patients
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Assessment of chest pain is one of the most common reasons for emergency department visits in developed countries. Although guidelines recommend primary care physician (PCP) follow-up for patients who are subsequently discharged, little is known about the relationship between physician follow-up and clinical outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>An observational study was conducted on patients with higher baseline risk, defined as having diabetes mellitus or established cardiovascular disease, who were evaluated for chest pain, discharged, and without adverse clinical outcomes for 30 days in Ontario from 2004 to 2010. Multivariable proportional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> models were constructed to adjust for potential confounding between physician groups (cardiologist, PCP, or none). Among 56767 included patients, 17% were evaluated by cardiologists, 58% were evaluated by PCPs alone, and 25% had no physician follow-up. The mean age was 66±15 years, and 53% were male. The highest rates of diagnostic testing, medical therapy, and coronary revascularization were seen among patients treated by cardiologists. At 1 year, the rate of death or MI was 5.5% (95% confidence interval, 5.0–5.9) in the cardiology group, 7.7% (95% confidence interval, 7.4–7.9) in the PCP group, and 8.6% (95% confidence interval, 8.2–9.1) in the no-physician group. After adjustment, cardiologist follow-up was associated with significantly lower adjusted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio of death or MI compared with PCP (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.78–0.92) and no physician (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hazard</span></strong> ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.71–0.88) follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Among patients with higher baseline cardiovascular risk who were discharged from the emergency department after evaluation for chest pain in Ontario, follow-up with a cardiologist was associated with a decreased risk of all-cause mortality or hospitalization for MI at 1 year compared with follow-up with a PCP or no physician follow-up.</p></sec>

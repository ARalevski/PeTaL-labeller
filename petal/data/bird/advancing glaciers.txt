Friction at the bed does not control fast glacier flow
<p>The largest uncertainty in the ice sheet models used to predict future sea level rise originates from our limited understanding of processes at the ice/bed interface. Near <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glacier</span></strong> termini, where basal sliding controls ice flow, most predictive ice sheet models use a parameterization of sliding that has been theoretically derived for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glacier</span></strong> flow over a hard bed. We find that this sliding relation does not apply to the 140 Greenland <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glacier</span></strong>s that we analyzed. There is no relationship between basal sliding and frictional stress at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glacier</span></strong> bed, contrary to theoretical predictions. There is a strong relationship between sliding speed and net pressure at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glacier</span></strong> bed. This latter finding is in agreement with earlier observations of mountain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glacier</span></strong>s that have been largely overlooked by the glaciological community.</p>

Marine Ice Sheet Collapse Potentially Under Way for the Thwaites Glacier Basin, West Antarctica
<sec><title>Antarctic Collapse</title><p>The West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) is particularly vulnerable to ocean warming-induced collapse. The Thwaites <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glacier</span></strong> of West Antarctica is one of the largest WAIS regional contributors to sea level rise, and has been considered to be potentially unstable for many years. <bold>Joughin <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 735) used a combination of a numerical model and observations of its recent geometry and movement to investigate the stability of the Thwaites <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glacier</span></strong>. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glacier</span></strong> has already entered the early stages of collapse, and rapid and irreversible collapse is likely in the next 200 to 1000 years.</p></sec>

Slowdown in Antarctic mass loss from solid Earth and sea-level feedbacks
<p>Geodetic investigations of crustal motions in the Amundsen Sea sector of West Antarctica and models of ice-sheet evolution in the past 10,000 years have recently highlighted the stabilizing role of solid-Earth uplift on polar ice sheets. One critical aspect, however, that has not been assessed is the impact of short-wavelength uplift generated by the solid-Earth response to unloading over short time scales close to ice-sheet grounding lines (areas where the ice becomes afloat). Here, we present a new global simulation of Antarctic evolution at high spatiotemporal resolution that captures all solid Earth processes that affect ice sheets and show a projected negative feedback in grounding line migration of 38% for Thwaites Glacier 350 years in the future, or 26.8% reduction in corresponding sea-level contribution.</p>

Cordilleran Ice Sheet mass loss preceded climate reversals near the Pleistocene Termination
<p>The Cordilleran Ice Sheet (CIS) once covered an area comparable to that of Greenland. Previous geologic evidence and numerical models indicate that the ice sheet covered much of westernmost Canada as late as 12.5 thousand years ago (ka). New data indicate that substantial areas throughout westernmost Canada were ice free prior to 12.5 ka and some as early as 14.0 ka, with implications for climate dynamics and the timing of meltwater discharge to the Pacific and Arctic oceans. Early Bølling-Allerød warmth halved the mass of the CIS in as little as 500 years, causing 2.5 to 3.0 meters of sea-level rise. Dozens of cirque and valley <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glacier</span></strong>s, along with the southern margin of the CIS, advanced into recently deglaciated regions during the Bølling-Allerød and Younger Dryas.</p>

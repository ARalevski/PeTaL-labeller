Microresonator soliton dual-comb spectroscopy
<p>Measurement of optical and vibrational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spectra</span></strong> with high resolution provides a way to identify chemical species in cluttered environments and is of general importance in many fields. Dual-comb spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful approach for acquiring nearly instantaneous Raman and optical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spectra</span></strong> with unprecedented resolution. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spectra</span></strong> are generated directly in the electrical domain, without the need for bulky mechanical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spectromet</span></strong>ers. We demonstrate a miniature soliton-based dual-comb system that can potentially transfer the approach to a chip platform. These devices achieve high-coherence pulsed mode locking. They also feature broad, reproducible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spectra</span></strong>l envelopes, an essential feature for dual-comb spectroscopy. Our work shows the potential for integrated spectroscopy with high signal-to-noise ratios and fast acquisition rates.</p>

Dual-comb spectroscopy of water vapor with a free-running semiconductor disk laser
<p>Dual-comb spectroscopy offers the potential for high accuracy combined with fast data acquisition. Applications are often limited, however, by the complexity of optical comb systems. Here we present dual-comb spectroscopy of water vapor using a substantially simplified single-laser system. Very good spectroscopy measurements with fast sampling rates are achieved with a free-running dual-comb mode-locked semiconductor disk laser. The absolute stability of the optical comb modes is characterized both for free-running operation and with simple microwave stabilization. This approach drastically reduces the complexity for dual-comb spectroscopy. Band-gap engineering to tune the center wavelength from the ultraviolet to the mid-infrared could optimize frequency combs for specific gas targets, further enabling dual-comb spectroscopy for a wider range of industrial applications.</p>

Vernier spectrometer using counterpropagating soliton microcombs
<p>Determination of laser frequency with high resolution under continuous and abrupt tuning conditions is important for sensing, spectroscopy, and communications. We show that a single microresonator provides rapid and broadband measurement of optical frequencies with a relative frequency precision comparable to that of conventional dual-frequency comb systems. Dual-locked counterpropagating solitons having slightly different repetition rates were used to implement a vernier <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spectromet</span></strong>er, which enabled characterization of laser tuning rates as high as 10 terahertz per second, broadly step-tuned lasers, multiline laser <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spectra</span></strong>, and molecular absorption lines. Besides providing a considerable technical simplification through the dual-locked solitons and enhanced capability for measurement of arbitrarily tuned sources, our results reveal possibilities for chip-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spectromet</span></strong>ers that exceed the performance of tabletop grating and interferometer-based devices.</p>

Structure Annotation and Quantification of Wheat Seed Oxidized Lipids by High-Resolution LC-MS/MS
<p>Lipid oxidation is a process ubiquitous in life, but the direct and comprehensive analysis of oxidized lipids has been limited by available analytical methods. We applied high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spectromet</span></strong>ry (LC-MS) and tandem mass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spectromet</span></strong>ry (MS/MS) to quantify oxidized lipids (glycerides, fatty acids, phospholipids, lysophospholipids, and galactolipids) and implemented a platform-independent high-throughput-amenable analysis pipeline for the high-confidence annotation and acyl composition analysis of oxidized lipids. Lipid contents of 90 different naturally aged wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) seed stocks were quantified in an untargeted high-resolution LC-MS experiment, resulting in 18,556 quantitative mass-to-charge ratio features. In a posthoc liquid chromatography-tandem mass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spectromet</span></strong>ry experiment, high-resolution MS/MS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spectra</span></strong> (5 mD accuracy) were recorded for 8,957 out of 12,080 putatively monoisotopic features of the LC-MS data set. A total of 353 nonoxidized and 559 oxidized lipids with up to four additional oxygen atoms were annotated based on the accurate mass recordings (1.5 ppm tolerance) of the LC-MS data set and filtering procedures. MS/MS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spectra</span></strong> available for 828 of these annotations were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed by translating experimentally known fragmentation rules of lipids into the fragmentation of oxidized lipids. This led to the identification of 259 nonoxidized and 365 oxidized lipids by both accurate mass and MS/MS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spectra</span></strong> and to the determination of acyl compositions for 221 nonoxidized and 295 oxidized lipids. Analysis of 15-year aged wheat seeds revealed increased lipid oxidation and hydrolysis in seeds stored in ambient versus cold conditions.</p>

Genome-Wide Biases in the Rate and Molecular Spectrum of Spontaneous Mutations in <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> and <i>Vibrio fischeri</i>
<p>The vast diversity in nucleotide composition and architecture among bacterial genomes may be partly explained by inherent biases in the rates and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spectra</span></strong> of spontaneous mutations. Bacterial genomes with multiple chromosomes are relatively unusual but some are relevant to human health, none more so than the causative agent of cholera, <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>. Here, we present the genome-wide mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spectra</span></strong> in wild-type and mismatch repair (MMR) defective backgrounds of two <i>Vibrio</i> species, the low-%GC squid symbiont <i>V. fischeri</i> and the pathogen <i>V. cholerae</i>, collected under conditions that greatly minimize the efficiency of natural selection. In apparent contrast to their high diversity in nature, both wild-type <i>V. fischeri</i> and <i>V. cholerae</i> have among the lowest rates for base-substitution mutations (bpsms) and insertion–deletion mutations (indels) that have been measured, below 10<sup>−</sup><sup>3</sup>/genome/generation. <i>Vibrio fischeri</i> and <i>V. cholerae</i> have distinct mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spectra</span></strong>, but both are AT-biased and produce a surprising number of multi-nucleotide indels. Furthermore, the loss of a functional MMR system caused the mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spectra</span></strong> of these species to converge, implying that the MMR system itself contributes to species-specific mutation patterns. Bpsm and indel rates varied among genome regions, but do not explain the more rapid evolutionary rates of genes on chromosome 2, which likely result from weaker purifying selection. More generally, the very low mutation rates of <i>Vibrio</i> species correlate inversely with their immense population sizes and suggest that selection may not only have maximized replication fidelity but also optimized other polygenic traits relative to the constraints of genetic drift.</p>

Identification of site-specific isotopic labels by vibrational spectroscopy in the electron microscope
<p>The identification of isotopic labels by conventional macroscopic techniques lacks spatial resolution and requires relatively large quantities of material for measurements. We recorded the vibrational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spectra</span></strong> of an α amino acid, <sc>l</sc>-alanine, with damage-free “aloof” electron energy-loss spectroscopy in a scanning transmission electron microscope to directly resolve carbon-site–specific isotopic labels in real space with nanoscale spatial resolution. An isotopic red shift of 4.8 ± 0.4 milli–electron volts in C–O asymmetric stretching modes was observed for <sup>13</sup>C-labeled <sc>l</sc>-alanine at the carboxylate carbon site, which was confirmed by macroscopic infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. The accurate measurement of this shift opens the door to nondestructive, site-specific, spatially resolved identification of isotopically labeled molecules with the electron microscope.</p>

Rovibrational quantum state resolution of the C<sub>60</sub> fullerene
<p>The unique physical properties of buckminsterfullerene, C<sub>60</sub>, have attracted intense research activity since its original discovery. Total quantum state–resolved spectroscopy of isolated C<sub>60</sub> molecules has been of particularly long-standing interest. Such observations have, to date, been unsuccessful owing to the difficulty in preparing cold, gas-phase C<sub>60</sub> in sufficiently high densities. Here we report high-resolution infrared absorption spectroscopy of C<sub>60</sub> in the 8.5-micron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spectra</span></strong>l region (1180 to 1190 wave number). A combination of cryogenic buffer-gas cooling and cavity-enhanced direct frequency comb spectroscopy has enabled the observation of quantum state–resolved rovibrational transitions. Characteristic nuclear spin statistical intensity patterns confirm the indistinguishability of the 60 carbon-12 atoms, while rovibrational fine structure encodes further details of the molecule’s rare icosahedral symmetry.</p>

Early spectra of the gravitational wave source GW170817: Evolution of a neutron star merger
<p>On 17 August 2017, Swope Supernova Survey 2017a (SSS17a) was discovered as the optical counterpart of the binary neutron star gravitational wave event GW170817. We report time-series spectroscopy of SSS17a from 11.75 hours until 8.5 days after the merger. Over the first hour of observations, the ejecta rapidly expanded and cooled. Applying blackbody fits to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spectra</span></strong>, we measured the photosphere cooling from [Formula] to [Formula] kelvin, and determined a photospheric velocity of roughly 30% of the speed of light. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spectra</span></strong> of SSS17a began displaying broad features after 1.46 days and evolved qualitatively over each subsequent day, with distinct blue (early-time) and red (late-time) components. The late-time component is consistent with theoretical models of r-process–enriched neutron star ejecta, whereas the blue component requires high-velocity, lanthanide-free material.</p>

Nanoscale nuclear magnetic resonance with chemical resolution
<p>Nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnetic reson</span></strong>ance (NMR) spectroscopy is a key analytical technique in chemistry, biology, and medicine. However, conventional NMR spectroscopy requires an at least nanoliter-sized sample volume to achieve sufficient signal. We combined the use of a quantum memory and high magnetic fields with a dedicated quantum sensor based on nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond to achieve chemical shift resolution in <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>19</sup>F NMR spectroscopy of 20-zeptoliter sample volumes. We demonstrate the application of NMR pulse sequences to achieve homonuclear decoupling and spin diffusion measurements. The best measured NMR linewidth of a liquid sample was ~1 part per million, mainly limited by molecular diffusion. To mitigate the influence of diffusion, we performed high-resolution solid-state NMR by applying homonuclear decoupling and achieved a 20-fold narrowing of the NMR linewidth.</p>

Novel Desmin Mutation p.Glu401Asp Impairs Filament Formation, Disrupts Cell Membrane Integrity, and Causes Severe Arrhythmogenic Left Ventricular Cardiomyopathy/Dysplasia
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Desmin (<i>DES</i>) mutations cause severe skeletal and cardiac muscle disease with heterogeneous phenotypes. Recently, <i>DES</i> mutations were described in patients with inherited arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia, although their cellular and molecular pathomechanisms are not precisely known. Our aim is to describe clinically and functionally the novel <i>DES</i>-p.Glu401Asp mutation as a cause of inherited left ventricular arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy/dysplasia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We identified the novel <i>DES</i> mutation p.Glu401Asp in a large Spanish family with inherited left ventricular arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy/dysplasia and a high incidence of adverse cardiac events. A full clinical evaluation was performed on all mutation carriers and noncarriers to establish clinical and genetic cosegregation. In addition, desmin, and intercalar disc–related proteins expression were histologically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed in explanted cardiac tissue affected by the <i>DES</i> mutation. Furthermore, mesenchymal stem cells were isolated and cultured from 2 family members with the <i>DES</i> mutation (1 with mild and 1 with severe symptomatology) and a member without the mutation (control) and differentiated ex vivo to cardiomyocytes. Then, important genes related to cardiac differentiation and function were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction.

One hundred percent of genotype-positive patients presented data consistent with inherited arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy/dysplasia phenotype with variable disease severity expression, high-incidence of sudden cardiac death, and absence of skeletal myopathy or conduction system disorders.

Functional Characterization of the <i>GUCY1A3</i> Coronary Artery Disease Risk Locus
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>A chromosomal locus at 4q32.1 has been genome-wide significantly associated with coronary artery disease risk. The locus encompasses <i>GUCY1A3</i>, which encodes the α<sub>1</sub> subunit of the soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC), a key enzyme in the nitric oxide/cGMP signaling pathway. The mechanism linking common variants in this region with coronary risk is not known.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Gene expression and protein expression were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed with quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting, respectively. Putative allele-specific transcription factors were identified with in silico analyses and validated via allele-specific quantification of antibody-precipitated chromatin fractions. Regulatory properties of the lead risk variant region were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed with reporter gene assays. To assess the effect of zinc finger E box-binding homeobox 1 transcription factor (ZEB1), siRNA-mediated knockdown and overexpression experiments were performed. Association of <i>GUCY1A3</i> genotype and cellular phenotypes was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed with vascular smooth muscle cell migration assays and platelet aggregation analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Whole-blood <i>GUCY1A3</i> mRNA levels were significantly lower in individuals homozygous for the lead (rs7692387) risk variant. Likewise, reporter gene assays demonstrated significantly lower <i>GUCY1A3</i> promoter activity for constructs carrying this allele. In silico analyses located a DNase I hypersensitivity site to rs7692387 and predicted binding of the transcription factor ZEB1 rather to the nonrisk allele, which was confirmed experimentally. Knockdown of <i>ZEB1</i> resulted in more profound reduction of nonrisk allele promoter activity and a significant reduction of endogenous <i>GUCY1A3</i> expression. Ex vivo–studied platelets from homozygous nonrisk allele carriers displayed enhanced inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation by the nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside and the phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor sildenafil compared with homozygous risk allele carriers. Moreover, pharmacological stimulation of sGC led to reduced migration only in vascular smooth muscle cells homozygous for the nonrisk allele.

Measuring the ratio of CO<sub>2</sub> efflux to O<sub>2</sub> influx in tree stem respiration
<p>In recent studies, the ratio of tree stem CO<sub>2</sub> efflux to O<sub>2</sub> influx has been defined as the apparent respiratory quotient (ARQ). The metabolism of carbohydrates, the putative respiratory substrate in trees, is expected to yield an ARQ of 1.0. However, previous studies have reported ARQ values ranging between 0.23 and 0.90. These interesting results may indicate internal transport of respired CO<sub>2</sub> within stems; yet no simple field applicable methods for ARQ measurement have been available. Here, we report on the assembly of a closed circulating system called ‘<i>Hampadah</i>’, which uses CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ers to measure air samples from stem chambers. We tested the performance of the <i>Hampadah</i> with samples from 36 trees (<i>Tetragastris panamensis</i> (Engl.) Kuntze). Additionally, we showed the feasibility of measuring ARQ directly from stem chambers, using portable CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> sensors, in both discrete and continuous modes of operation. The <i>Hampadah</i> measurement proved to be consistent with CO<sub>2</sub> gas standards (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.999) and with O<sub>2</sub> determined by O<sub>2</sub>/Ar measurements with a mass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spectromet</span></strong>er (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.998). The <i>Hampadah</i> gave highly reproducible results for ARQ determination of field samples (±0.01 for duplicates). The portable sensors measurement showed good correlation with the <i>Hampadah</i> in measuring CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub> and ARQ (<i>n</i> = 5, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.97, 0.98 and 0.91, respectively). We have demonstrated here that the <i>Hampadah</i> and the sensors’ methods enable accurate ARQ measurements for both laboratory and field research.</p>

Identifying protein kinase–specific effectors of the osmostress response in yeast
<p>The budding yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> reacts to increased external osmolarity by modifying many cellular processes. Adaptive signaling relies primarily on the high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway, which is closely related to the mammalian p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in core architecture. To identify target proteins of the MAPK Hog1, we designed a mass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spectromet</span></strong>ry–based high-throughput experiment to measure the impact of Hog1 activation or inhibition on the <i>S</i>. <i>cerevisiae</i> phosphoproteome. In addition, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed how deletion of <i>RCK2</i>, which encodes a known effector protein kinase target of Hog1, modulated osmotic stress–induced phosphorylation. Our results not only provide an overview of the diversity of cellular functions that are directly and indirectly affected by the activity of the HOG pathway but also enabled an assessment of the Hog1-independent events that occur under osmotic stress conditions. We extended the number of putative Hog1 direct targets by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ing the modulation of motifs consisting of serine or threonine followed by a proline (S/T-P motif) and subsequently validated these with an in vivo interaction assay. Rck2 appears to act as a central hub for many Hog1-mediated secondary phosphorylation events. This study clarifies many of the direct and indirect effects of HOG signaling and its stress-adaptive functions.</p>

A weak, narrow absorption feature centered at 2.72 micrometers was detected across the entire observed surface, indicating that hydroxyl (OH)–bearing minerals are ubiquitous there. The intensity of the OH feature and low albedo are similar to thermally and/or shock-metamorphosed carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. There are few variations in the OH-band position, which is consistent with Ryugu being a compositionally homogeneous rubble-pile object generated from impact fragments of an undifferentiated aqueously altered parent body.</p>

Molecular mechanism of extreme mechanostability in a pathogen adhesin
<p>High resilience to mechanical stress is key when pathogens adhere to their target and initiate infection. Using atomic force microscopy–based single-molecule force spectroscopy, we explored the mechanical stability of the prototypical staphylococcal adhesin SdrG, which targets a short peptide from human fibrinogen β. Steered molecular dynamics simulations revealed, and single-molecule force spectroscopy experiments confirmed, the mechanism by which this complex withstands forces of over 2 nanonewtons, a regime previously associated with the strength of a covalent bond. The target peptide, confined in a screwlike manner in the binding pocket of SdrG, distributes forces mainly toward the peptide backbone through an intricate hydrogen bond network. Thus, these adhesins can attach to their target with exceptionally resilient mechanostability, virtually independent of peptide side chains.</p>

Encoding of vinylidene isomerization in its anion photoelectron spectrum
<p>Vinylidene-acetylene isomerization is the prototypical example of a 1,2-hydrogen shift, one of the most important classes of isomerization reactions in organic chemistry.

Peaks in the photoelectron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spectra</span></strong> are considerably narrower than in previous work and reveal subtleties in the isomerization dynamics of neutral vinylidene, as well as vibronic coupling with an excited state of vinylidene. Comparison with theory permits assignment of most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spectra</span></strong>l features to eigenstates dominated by vinylidene character. However, excitation of the ν<sub>6</sub> in-plane rocking mode in H<sub>2</sub>CC results in appreciable tunneling-facilitated mixing with highly vibrationally excited states of acetylene, leading to broadening and/or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spectra</span></strong>l fine structure that is largely suppressed for analogous vibrational levels of D<sub>2</sub>CC.</p>

Second-scale nuclear spin coherence time of ultracold <sup>23</sup>Na<sup>40</sup>K molecules
<p>Coherence, the stability of the relative phase between quantum states, is central to quantum mechanics and its applications. For ultracold dipolar molecules at sub-microkelvin temperatures, internal states with robust coherence are predicted to offer rich prospects for quantum many-body physics and quantum information processing. We report the observation of stable coherence between nuclear spin states of ultracold fermionic sodium-potassium (NaK) molecules in the singlet rovibrational ground state. Ramsey spectroscopy reveals coherence times on the scale of 1 second; this enables high-resolution spectroscopy of the molecular gas. Collisional shifts are shown to be absent down to the 100-millihertz level. This work opens the door to the use of molecules as a versatile quantum memory and for precision measurements on dipolar quantum matter.</p>

Selective anaerobic oxidation of methane enables direct synthesis of methanol
<p>Direct functionalization of methane in natural gas remains a key challenge. We present a direct stepwise method for converting methane into methanol with high selectivity (~97%) over a copper-containing zeolite, based on partial oxidation with water. The activation in helium at 673 kelvin (K), followed by consecutive catalyst exposures to 7 bars of methane and then water at 473 K, consistently produced 0.204 mole of CH<sub>3</sub>OH per mole of copper in zeolite. Isotopic labeling confirmed water as the source of oxygen to regenerate the zeolite active centers and renders methanol desorption energetically favorable. On the basis of in situ x-ray absorption spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations, we propose a mechanism involving methane oxidation at Cu<sup>II</sup> oxide active centers, followed by Cu<sup>I</sup> reoxidation by water with concurrent formation of hydrogen.</p>

NMR Spectroscopy of Native and in Vitro Tissues Implicates PolyADP Ribose in Biomineralization
<sec><title>Fundamentals of Bone Formation</title><p>In vitro models can help guide research for tissue engineering or drug delivery, but the extent to which results from in vitro experiments may mimic in vivo ones will depend on the robustness of the model.

Diurnal Variation in Nonstructural Carbohydrate Storage in Trees: Remobilization and Vertical Mixing
<p>Nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) storage plays a critical role in tree function and survival, but understanding and predicting local NSC storage dynamics is challenging because NSC storage pools are dispersed throughout the complex architecture of trees and continuously exchange carbon between source and sink organs at different time scales. To address these knowledge gaps, characterization and understanding of NSC diel variation are necessary. Here, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed diurnal NSC dynamics in the overall architecture of almond (<i>Prunus dulcis</i>) trees. We also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed the allocation of newly assimilated carbon using isotopic labeling. We show that both components of NSC (i.e. soluble carbohydrates and starch) are highly dynamic at the diurnal time scale and that these trends are influenced by tissue type, age, and/or position within the canopy. In leaves, starch reserves can be depleted completely during the night, while woody tissue starch levels may vary by more than 50% over a daily cycle. Recently assimilated carbon showed a dispersed downward allocation across the entire tree. NSC diurnal fluctuations within the tree’s structure in combination with dispersed carbon allocation patterns provide evidence for the presence of vertical mixing and suggest that the xylem acts as a secondary NSC redistribution pathway.</p>

The Extra-Pathway Interactome of the TCA Cycle: Expected and Unexpected Metabolic Interactions
<p>The plant tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle provides essential precursors for respiration, amino acid biosynthesis, and general nitrogen metabolism; moreover, it is closely involved in biotic stress responses and cellular redox homeostasis. To further understand the in vivo function of the TCA cycle enzymes, we combined affinity purification with proteomics to generate a comprehensive extra-pathway protein-protein interaction network of the plant TCA cycle. We identified 125 extra-pathway interactions in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mostly related to the mitochondrial electron transport complex/ATP synthesis and amino acid metabolism but also to proteins associated with redox stress. We chose three high-scoring and two low-scoring interactions for complementary bimolecular fluorescence complementation and yeast two-hybrid assays, which highlighted the reliability of our approach, supported the intimate involvement of TCA cycle enzymes within many biological processes, and reflected metabolic changes reported previously for the corresponding mutant lines. To <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>e the function of a subset of these interactions, we selected two mutants of mitochondrial glutaredoxin S15 and Amidase, which have not yet been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed with respect to their TCA cycle function, and performed metabolite profiling and flux analysis. Consistent with their interactions identified in this study, TCA cycle metabolites and the relative TCA flux of the two mutants were altered significantly.</p>

Gradients in Wall Mechanics and Polysaccharides along Growing Inflorescence Stems
<p>At early stages of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) flowering, the inflorescence stem undergoes rapid growth, with elongation occurring predominantly in the apical ∼4 cm of the stem. We measured the spatial gradients for elongation rate, osmotic pressure, cell wall thickness, and wall mechanical compliances and coupled these macroscopic measurements with molecular-level characterization of the polysaccharide composition, mobility, hydration, and intermolecular interactions of the inflorescence cell wall using solid-state nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnetic reson</span></strong>ance spectroscopy and small-angle neutron scattering. Force-extension curves revealed a gradient, from high to low, in the plastic and elastic compliances of cell walls along the elongation zone, but plots of growth rate versus wall compliances were strikingly nonlinear. Neutron-scattering curves showed only subtle changes in wall structure, including a slight increase in cellulose microfibril alignment along the growing stem. In contrast, solid-state nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnetic reson</span></strong>ance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spectra</span></strong> showed substantial decreases in pectin amount, esterification, branching, hydration, and mobility in an apical-to-basal pattern, while the cellulose content increased modestly. These results suggest that pectin structural changes are connected with increases in pectin-cellulose interaction and reductions in wall compliances along the apical-to-basal gradient in growth rate. These pectin structural changes may lessen the ability of the cell wall to undergo stress relaxation and irreversible expansion (e.g. induced by expansins), thus contributing to the growth kinematics of the growing stem.</p>

Circadian, Carbon, and Light Control of Expansion Growth and Leaf Movement
<p>We used Phytotyping<sup>4D</sup> to investigate the contribution of clock and light signaling to the diurnal regulation of rosette expansion growth and leaf movement in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Wild-type plants and clock mutants with a short (<i>lhycca1</i>) and long (<i>prr7prr9</i>) period were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed in a T24 cycle and in T-cycles that were closer to the mutants’ period. Wild types also were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed in various photoperiods and after transfer to free-running light or darkness. Rosette expansion and leaf movement exhibited a circadian oscillation, with superimposed transients after dawn and dusk. Diurnal responses were modified in clock mutants. <i>lhycca1</i> exhibited an inhibition of growth at the end of night and growth rose earlier after dawn, whereas <i>prr7prr9</i> showed decreased growth for the first part of the light period. Some features were partly rescued by a matching T-cycle, like the inhibition in <i>lhycca1</i> at the end of the night, indicating that it is due to premature exhaustion of starch. Other features were not rescued, revealing that the clock also regulates expansion growth more directly. Expansion growth was faster at night than in the daytime, whereas published work has shown that the synthesis of cellular components is faster in the day than at nighttime. This temporal uncoupling became larger in short photoperiods and may reflect the differing dependence of expansion and biosynthesis on energy, carbon, and water. While it has been proposed that leaf expansion and movement are causally linked, we did not observe a consistent temporal relationship between expansion and leaf movement.</p>

Modeling of Dolichol Mass Spectra Isotopic Envelopes as a Tool to Monitor Isoprenoid Biosynthesis
<p>The cooperation of the mevalonate (MVA) and methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathways, operating in parallel in plants to generate isoprenoid precursors, has been studied extensively. Elucidation of the isoprenoid metabolic pathways is indispensable for the rational design of plant and microbial systems for the production of industrially valuable terpenoids. Here, we describe a new method, based on numerical modeling of mass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spectra</span></strong> of metabolically labeled dolichols (Dols), designed to quantitatively follow the cooperation of MVA and MEP reprogrammed upon osmotic stress (sorbitol treatment) in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The contribution of the MEP pathway increased significantly (reaching 100%) exclusively for the dominating Dols, while for long-chain Dols, the relative input of the MEP and MVA pathways remained unchanged, suggesting divergent sites of synthesis for dominating and long-chain Dols. The analysis of numerically modeled Dol mass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spectra</span></strong> is a novel method to follow modulation of the concomitant activity of isoprenoid-generating pathways in plant cells; additionally, it suggests an exchange of isoprenoid intermediates between plastids and peroxisomes.</p>

Two Trichome Birefringence-Like Proteins Mediate Xylan Acetylation, Which Is Essential for Leaf Blight Resistance in Rice
<p>Acetylation is a ubiquitous modification on cell wall polymers, which play a structural role in plant growth and stress defenses. However, the mechanisms for how crop plants accomplish cell wall polymer <i>O</i>-acetylation are largely unknown. Here, we report on the isolation and characterization of two <i>trichome birefringence-like</i> (<i>tbl</i>) mutants in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), which are affected in xylan <i>O</i>-acetylation. <i>ostbl1</i> and <i>ostbl2</i> single mutant and the <i>tbl1 tbl2</i> double mutant displayed a stunted growth phenotype with varied degree of dwarfism. As shown by chemical assays, the wall acetylation level is affected in the mutants and the knock-down and overexpression transgenic plants. Furthermore, NMR spectroscopy analyses showed that all those mutants have varied decreases in xylan monoacetylation. The divergent expression levels of <i>OsTBL1</i> and <i>OsTBL2</i> explained the chemotype difference and indicated that <i>OsTBL1</i> is a functionally dominant gene. OsTBL1 was found to be Golgi-localized. The recombinant OsTBL1 protein incorporates acetyl groups onto xylan. By using xylopentaose, a preferred acceptor substrate, OsTBL1 can transfer up to four acetyl residues onto xylopentaose, and this activity showed saturable kinetics. 2D-NMR spectroscopy showed that OsTBL1 transfers acetate to both 2-<i>O</i> and 3-<i>O</i> sites of xylosyl residues. In addition, <i>ostbl1</i> and <i>tbl1 tbl2</i> displayed susceptibility to rice blight disease, indicating that this xylan modification is required for pathogen resistance. This study identifies the major genes responsible for xylan acetylation in rice plants.</p>

Histone Modifications Define Expression Bias of Homoeologous Genomes in Allotetraploid Cotton
<p>Histone modifications regulate gene expression in eukaryotes, but their roles in gene expression changes in interspecific hybrids or allotetraploids are poorly understood. Histone modifications can be mapped by immunostaining of metaphase chromosomes at the single cell level and/or by chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ing individual genes. Here, we comparatively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed immunostained metaphase chromosomes and ChIP-seq of individual genes, which revealed a chromatin basis for biased homoeologous gene expression in polyploids. We examined H3K4me3 density and transcriptome maps in root-tip cells of allotetraploid cotton (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>). The overall H3K4me3 levels were relatively equal between A and D chromosomes, which were consistent with equal numbers of expressed genes between the two subgenomes. However, intensities per chromosomal area were nearly twice as high in the D homeologs as in the A homeologs. Consistent with the cytological observation, ChIP-seq analysis showed that more D homeologs with biased H3K4me3 levels than A homeologs with biased modifications correlated with the greater number of the genes with D-biased expression than that with A-biased expression in most homeologous chromosome pairs. Two chromosomes displayed different expression levels compared with other chromosomes, which correlate with known translocations and may affect the local chromatin structure and expression levels for the genes involved. This example of genome-wide histone modifications that determine expression bias of homeologous genes in allopolyploids provides a molecular basis for the evolution and domestication of polyploid species, including many important crops.</p>

Brown and Polar Bear Y Chromosomes Reveal Extensive Male-Biased Gene Flow within Brother Lineages
<p>Brown and polar bears have become prominent examples in phylogeography, but previous phylogeographic studies relied largely on maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or were geographically restricted. The male-specific Y chromosome, a natural counterpart to mtDNA, has remained underexplored. Although this paternally inherited chromosome is indispensable for comprehensive analyses of phylogeographic patterns, technical difficulties and low variability have hampered its application in most mammals. We developed 13 novel Y-chromosomal sequence and microsatellite markers from the polar bear genome and screened these in a broad geographic sample of 130 brown and polar bears. We also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed a 390-kb-long Y-chromosomal scaffold using sequencing data from published male ursine genomes. Y chromosome evidence support the emerging understanding that brown and polar bears started to diverge no later than the Middle Pleistocene. Contrary to mtDNA patterns, we found 1) brown and polar bears to be reciprocally monophyletic sister (or rather brother) lineages, without signals of introgression, 2) male-biased gene flow across continents and on phylogeographic time scales, and 3) male dispersal that links the Alaskan ABC islands population to mainland brown bears. Due to female philopatry, mtDNA provides a highly structured estimate of population differentiation, while male-biased gene flow is a homogenizing force for nuclear genetic variation. Our findings highlight the importance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ing both maternally and paternally inherited loci for a comprehensive view of phylogeographic history, and that mtDNA-based phylogeographic studies of many mammals should be reevaluated. Recent advances in sequencing technology render the analysis of Y-chromosomal variation feasible, even in nonmodel organisms.</p>

Efficient Inference of Recombination Hot Regions in Bacterial Genomes
<p>In eukaryotes, detailed surveys of recombination rates have shown variation at multiple genomic scales and the presence of “hotspots” of highly elevated recombination. In bacteria, studies of recombination rate variation are less developed, in part because there are few analysis methods that take into account the clonal context within which bacterial evolution occurs. Here, we focus in particular on identifying “hot regions” of the genome where DNA is transferred frequently between isolates. We present a computationally efficient algorithm based on the recently developed “chromosome painting” algorithm, which characterizes patterns of haplotype sharing across a genome. We compare the average genome wide painting, which principally reflects clonal descent, with the painting for each site which additionally reflects the specific deviations at the site due to recombination. Using simulated data, we show that hot regions have consistently higher deviations from the genome wide average than normal regions. We applied our approach to previously <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed <i>Escherichia coli</i> genomes and revealed that the new method is highly correlated with the number of recombination events affecting each site inferred by ClonalOrigin, a method that is only applicable to small numbers of genomes. Furthermore, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed recombination hot regions in <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> by using 200 genomes. We identified three recombination hot regions, which are enriched for genes related to membrane proteins. Our approach and its implementation, which is downloadable from <ext-link>https://github.com/bioprojects/orderedPainting</ext-link>, will help to develop a new phase of population genomic studies of recombination in prokaryotes.</p>

Experimental analysis of the liquid-feeding mechanism of the butterfly <i>Pieris rapae</i>
<p>The butterfly <i>Pieirs rapae</i> drinks liquid using a long proboscis. A high pressure gradient is induced in the proboscis when cibarial pump muscles contract. However, liquid feeding through the long proboscis poses a disadvantage of high flow resistance. Hence, butterflies may possess special features to compensate for this disadvantage and succeed in foraging. The main objective of this study is to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>e the liquid-feeding mechanism of butterflies. The systaltic motion of the cibarial pump organ was visualized using the synchrotron X-ray imaging technique. In addition, an ellipsoidal pump model was established based on synchrotron X-ray micro-computed tomography. To determine the relationship between the cyclic variation of the pump volume and the liquid-feeding flow, velocity fields of the intake flow at the tip of the proboscis were measured using micro-particle image velocimetry. Reynolds and Womersley numbers of liquid-feeding flow in the proboscis were ~1.40 and 0.129, respectively. The liquid-feeding flow could be characterized as a quasi-steady state laminar flow. Considering these results, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed the dimensions of the feeding apparatus on the basis of minimum energy consumption during the liquid-feeding process. The relationship between the proboscis and the cibarial pump was determined when minimum energy consumption occurs. As a result, the volume of the cibarial pump is proportional to the cube of the radius of the proboscis. It seems that the liquid-feeding system of butterflies and other long-proboscid insects follow the cube relationship. The present results provide insights into the feeding strategies of liquid-feeding butterflies.</p>

Time to Endovascular Treatment and Outcome in Acute Ischemic Stroke
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Randomized, clinical trials in selected acute ischemic stroke patients reported that for every hour delay of endovascular treatment (EVT), chances of functional independence diminish by up to 3.4%. These findings may not be fully generalizable to clinical practice because of strict in- and exclusion criteria in these trials. Therefore, we aim to assess the association of time to EVT with functional outcome in current, everyday clinical practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The MR CLEAN Registry (Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in The Netherlands) is an ongoing, prospective, observational study in all centers that perform EVT in The Netherlands. Data were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed from patients treated between March 2014 and June 2016.

An increased time to start of EVT was associated with worse functional outcome (adjusted common odds ratio, 0.83 per hour; 95% confidence interval, 0.77–0.89) and a 2.2% increase in mortality. Every hour increase from stroke onset to EVT start resulted in a 5.3% decreased probability of functional independence (modified Rankin Scale, 0–2). In the 742 patients with successful reperfusion, every hour increase from stroke onset to reperfusion was associated with a 7.7% decreased probability of functional independence.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Time to EVT for acute ischemic stroke in current clinical practice is strongly associated with functional outcome. Our data suggest that this association might be even stronger than previously suggested in reports on more selected patient populations from randomized, controlled trials.

Early treatment with rhASB in the transverse aortic constriction model and delayed treatment in the isoprenaline model proved rhASB to be effective at preventing cardiac deterioration and augmenting functional recovery. Functional improvement was accompanied by reduced myocardial inflammation and overall fibrosis. Tumor necrosis factor–α was identified as a direct binding partner of CS glycosaminoglycan chains, and rhASB reduced tumor necrosis factor–α—induced inflammatory gene activation in vitro in endothelial cells and macrophages.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>CS glycosaminoglycans accumulate during cardiac pathological remodeling and mediate myocardial inflammation and fibrosis. rhASB targets CS effectively as a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of heart failure.</p></sec>

A younger age at the time of repair (<i>P</i>=0.001), mixed (<i>P</i>=0.004) and infracardiac (<i>P</i>=0.035) TAPVC, preoperative PVO (<i>P</i>=0.027), prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass time (<i>P</i><0.001), and longer duration of ventilation (<i>P</i>=0.028) were associated with mortality. The median follow-up was 23.2 months (range; 1–112 months). Among the 717 survivors, recurrent PVO was observed in 111 patients (15%). Associated risk factors for recurrent PVO included preoperative PVO (<i>P</i><0.001), infracardiac TAPVC (<i>P</i><0.001), mixed TAPVC (<i>P</i>=0.013), and prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass time (<i>P</i><0.001). Sutureless technique was associated with a lower restenosis rate compared with conventional repair in patients with preoperative PVO (<i>P</i>=0.038), except in newborn patients (<i>P</i>=0.443). Reintervention for restenosis was performed in 24 patients. The function of most survivors (91%) was classified according to the New York Heart Association as functional class I or II.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Surgical correction in patients with TAPVC with a biventricular anatomy can achieve an acceptable outcome.

Second-trimester fetuses diagnosed with a CHD between 2007 and 2013 were also compared with Group III (532 fetuses diagnosed with a CHD in the second trimester from 1996 to 2001, the period before first-trimester screening was introduced).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The spectrum of CHDs diagnosed in the first and second trimesters in the same time period differed significantly, with a greater number of comorbidities (<i>P</i><0.0001), CHDs with univentricular outcome (<i>P</i><0.0001), intrauterine deaths (<i>P</i>=0.01), and terminations of pregnancy (<i>P</i><0.0001) in Group I compared with Group II. In Group III, significantly more cases of CHDs with univentricular outcome (<i>P</i><0.0001), intrauterine demise (<i>P</i>=0.036), and early termination (<i>P</i><0.0001) were identified compared with fetuses diagnosed with CHDs in the second trimester between 2007 and 2013.

Disturbed Placental Imprinting in Preeclampsia Leads to Altered Expression of DLX5, a Human-Specific Early Trophoblast Marker
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Preeclampsia is a complex and common human-specific pregnancy syndrome associated with placental pathology. The human specificity provides both intellectual and methodological challenges, lacking a robust model system. Given the role of imprinted genes in human placentation and the vulnerability of imprinted genes to loss of imprinting changes, there has been extensive speculation, but no robust evidence, that imprinted genes are involved in preeclampsia. Our study aims to investigate whether disturbed imprinting contributes to preeclampsia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We first aimed to confirm that preeclampsia is a disease of the placenta by generating and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ing genome-wide molecular data on well-characterized patient material. We performed high-throughput transcriptome analyses of multiple placenta samples from healthy controls and patients with preeclampsia. Next, we identified differentially expressed genes in preeclamptic placentas and intersected them with the list of human imprinted genes. We used bioinformatics/statistical analyses to confirm association between imprinting and preeclampsia and to predict biological processes affected in preeclampsia. Validation included epigenetic and cellular assays. In terms of human specificity, we established an in vitro invasion-differentiation trophoblast model. Our comparative phylogenetic analysis involved single-cell transcriptome data of human, macaque, and mouse preimplantation embryogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We found disturbed placental imprinting in preeclampsia and revealed potential candidates, including <i>GATA3</i> and <i>DLX5</i>, with poorly explored imprinted status and no prior association with preeclampsia. As a result of loss of imprinting, <i>DLX5</i> was upregulated in 69% of preeclamptic placentas. Levels of <i>DLX5</i> correlated with classic preeclampsia markers. DLX5 is expressed in human but not in murine trophoblast. The DLX5<sup>high</sup> phenotype resulted in reduced proliferation, increased metabolism, and endoplasmic reticulum stress-response activation in trophoblasts in vitro. The transcriptional profile of such cells mimics the transcriptome of preeclamptic placentas. Pan-mammalian comparative analysis identified <i>DLX5</i> as part of the human-specific regulatory network of trophoblast differentiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our analysis provides evidence of a true association among disturbed imprinting, gene expression, and preeclampsia. As a result of disturbed imprinting, the upregulated <i>DLX5</i> affects trophoblast proliferation. Our in vitro model might fill a vital niche in preeclampsia research. Human-specific regulatory circuitry of <i>DLX5</i> might help explain certain aspects of preeclampsia.</p></sec>

Exploring Coronary Circulatory Response to Stenosis and Its Association With Invasive Physiologic Indexes Using Absolute Myocardial Blood Flow and Coronary Pressure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although invasive physiological assessment for coronary stenosis has become a standard practice to guide treatment strategy, coronary circulatory response and changes in invasive physiological indexes, according to different anatomic and hemodynamic lesion severity, have not been fully demonstrated in patients with coronary artery disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>One hundred fifteen patients with left anterior descending artery stenosis who underwent both <sup>13</sup>N-ammonia positron emission tomography and invasive physiological measurement were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed. Myocardial blood flow (MBF) measured with positron emission tomography and invasively measured coronary pressures were used to calculate microvascular resistance and stenosis resistance.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>With progressive worsening of angiographic stenosis severity, both resting and hyperemic transstenotic pressure gradient and stenosis resistance increased (<i>P</i><0.001 for all) and hyperemic MBF (<i>P</i><0.001) and resting microvascular resistance (<i>P</i>=0.012) decreased. Resting MBF (<i>P</i>=0.383) and hyperemic microvascular resistance (<i>P</i>=0.431) were not changed and maintained stable. Both fractional flow reserve and instantaneous wave-free ratio decreased as angiographic stenosis severity, stenosis resistance, and transstenotic pressure gradient increased and hyperemic MBF decreased (all <i>P</i><0.001). When the presence of myocardial ischemia was defined by both low hyperemic MBF and low coronary flow reserve, the diagnostic accuracy of fractional flow reserve and instantaneous wave-free ratio did not differ, regardless of cutoff values of hyperemic MBF and coronary flow reserve.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This study demonstrated how the coronary circulation changes in response to increasing coronary stenosis severity using <sup>13</sup>N-ammonium positron emission tomography–derived MBF and invasively measured pressure data. Currently used resting and hyperemic pressure–derived invasive physiological indexes have similar patterns of relationships to the different anatomic and hemodynamic lesion severities.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

A Population-Based Study of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Treatment in Finland 2000 to 2014
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In the event of rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), mortality is very high. AAA prevalence and incidence of ruptures have been reported to be decreasing. The treatment of AAA has also undergone a change in recent decades with a shift toward endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). Our aim was to evaluate how these changes have affected the elective and emergency treatment of AAA and their results in Finland.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>All patients treated for AAA in Finland, a country with a population of 5.5 million, during 2000 to 2014 were searched from the registry of the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare. Data on all patients who had died of AAA during the same time period were obtained from Statistics Finland. The data were combined and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The annual incidence of ruptured AAA was 16.4 per 100 000 population over 50 years and decreased significantly during the study period. Over half of the 4949 patients who had a ruptured AAA died outside the hospital. Thirty-day mortality after emergency repair was 39.4%. Intact AAA repairs numbered 4956. The absolute number of annual repairs increased during the study period, and the use of EVAR became the dominant method of elective repair. Thirty-day mortality in elective AAA repair dropped significantly from 6.3% in 2000 to 2004 to 2.7% in 2010 to 2014 mostly because of the increased number of EVAR procedures with lower mortality. Long-term mortality in patients treated with EVAR was higher than in patients treated with open repair. Mortality after elective AAA repair was primarily attributable to cardiovascular causes, but there was a slightly higher proportion of AAA-related late deaths in patients treated with EVAR.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Ruptured AAA incidence for men >65 years has declined by nearly 30% in Finland, likely because of the decrease in AAA prevalence. The treatment results have improved as well for both elective and emergency repair. Increased use of EVAR has resulted in a decrease of mortality after elective AAA repair, but results of open repair have improved as well. However, late mortality from elective EVAR is surprisingly high in comparison with open repair, which may have been exaggerated by patient selection.</p></sec>

Left Ventricular Assist Device Malfunctions
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Reports of left ventricular assist device (LVAD) malfunction have focused on pump thrombosis. However, the device consists of the pump, driveline, and peripherals, all of which are potentially subject to failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Prospectively collected data were reviewed for all LVAD device malfunctions (DMs) occurring in rotary LVADs implanted at a single center between April 2004 and May 2016. Durable LVADs included 108 Heartmate II (HM II) and 105 HeartWare VAD (HVAD). DM data were categorized according to device type and into categories related to the component that failed: (1) controller, (2) peripheral components, and (3) implantable blood pump or its integral electric driveline. Pump-related events were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed as pump-specific (suspected or confirmed thrombosis) or nonpump-specific (driveline failure). DM rates were reported as events per 1000 patient-days, and Cox proportional hazard models were used for time-to-event analyses. Cumulative rates of malfunction were examined for the main components of each type of LVAD.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Types of DM included controller failure (30%), battery failure (19%), or patient cable failure (14%), whereas only 13% were because of pump failure. DMs were more common in the HM II device (3.73 per 1000 patient-days versus 3.06 per 1000 patient-days for the HVAD, <i>P</i><0.01). A higher rate of pump-specific malfunctions was discovered in those implanted with an HM II versus an HVAD (0.55 versus 0.39, respectively; <i>P</i><0.01) and peripheral malfunctions (2.32 versus 1.78 for the HM II and HVAD, respectively; <i>P</i><0.01); no difference occurred in the incidence of controller DM between the 2 LVADs. Patients with HVAD were 90% free of a pump-specific malfunction at 3 years compared with 56% for the HM II (log-rank <i>P</i><0.003). Only 74% of the patients with HM II were free of pump thrombosis at 3 years compared with 90% of the patients with HVAD. Freedom from failure of the integrated driveline was 79% at 3 years for the HM II but 100% for the HVAD (log-rank <i>P</i><0.02).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Device malfunction is much broader than pump failure alone and occurs for different components at different rates based on the type of LVAD.</p></sec>

The Fluid Mechanics of Transcatheter Heart Valve Leaflet Thrombosis in the Neosinus
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Transcatheter heart valve (THV) thrombosis has been increasingly reported. In these studies, thrombus quantification has been based on a 2-dimensional assessment of a 3-dimensional phenomenon.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Postprocedural, 4-dimensional, volume-rendered CT data of patients with CoreValve, Evolut R, and SAPIEN 3 transcatheter aortic valve replacement enrolled in the RESOLVE study (Assessment of Transcatheter and Surgical Aortic Bioprosthetic Valve Dysfunction With Multimodality Imaging and Its Treatment with Anticoagulation) were included in this analysis. Patients on anticoagulation were excluded. SAPIEN 3 and CoreValve/Evolut R patients with and without hypoattenuated leaflet thickening were included to study differences between groups. Patients were classified as having THV thrombosis if there was any evidence of hypoattenuated leaflet thickening. Anatomic and THV deployment geometries were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed, and thrombus volumes were computed through manual 3-dimensional reconstruction. We aimed to identify and evaluate risk factors that contribute to THV thrombosis through the combination of retrospective clinical data analysis and in vitro imaging in the space between the native and THV leaflets (neosinus).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>SAPIEN 3 valves with leaflet thrombosis were on average 10% further expanded (by diameter) than those without (95.5±5.2% versus 85.4±3.9%; <i>P</i><0.001). However, this relationship was not evident with the CoreValve/Evolut R. In CoreValve/Evolut Rs with thrombosis, the thrombus volume increased linearly with implant depth (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>=0.7, <i>P</i><0.001). This finding was not seen in the SAPIEN 3. The in vitro analysis showed that a supraannular THV deployment resulted in a nearly 7-fold decrease in stagnation zone size (velocities <0.1 m/s) when compared with an intraannular deployment. In addition, the in vitro model indicated that the size of the stagnation zone increased as cardiac output decreased.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Although transcatheter aortic valve replacement thrombosis is a multifactorial process involving foreign materials, patient-specific blood chemistry, and complex flow patterns, our study indicates that deployed THV geometry may have implications on the occurrence of thrombosis. In addition, a supraannular neosinus may reduce thrombosis risk because of reduced flow stasis. Although additional prospective studies are needed to further develop strategies for minimizing thrombus burden, these results may help identify patients at higher thrombosis risk and aid in the development of next-generation devices with reduced thrombosis risk.</p></sec>

Factors associated with event-free survival, relapse-free survival, and incidences of vascular complications were assessed. Risk factors for vascular complications were identified in a multivariable model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The median age at TA diagnosis was 36 [25–47] years, and 276 patients (86.8%) were women. After a median follow-up of 6.1 years, relapses were observed in 43%, vascular complications in 38%, and death in 5%. Progressive clinical course was observed in 45%, carotidodynia in 10%, and retinopathy in 4%. The 5- and 10-year event-free survival, relapse-free survival, and complication-free survival were 48.2% (42.2; 54.9) and 36.4% (30.3; 43.9), 58.6% (52.7; 65.1) and 47.7% (41.2; 55.1), and 69.9% (64.3; 76.0) and 53.7% (46.8; 61.7), respectively.

A Cytokine-Like Protein Dickkopf-Related Protein 3 Is Atheroprotective
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Dickkopf-related protein 3 (DKK3) is a secreted protein that is involved in the regulation of cardiac remodeling and vascular smooth muscle cell differentiation, but little is known about its role in atherosclerosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We tested the hypothesis that DKK3 is atheroprotective using both epidemiological and experimental approaches. Blood DKK3 levels were measured in the Bruneck Study in 2000 (n=684) and then in 2005 (n=574). <i>DKK3</i>-deficient mice were crossed with <i>apolipoprotein E</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice to evaluate atherosclerosis development and vessel injury-induced neointimal formation. Endothelial cell migration and the underlying mechanisms were studied using in vitro cell culture models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In the prospective population-based Bruneck Study, the level of plasma DKK3 was inversely related to carotid artery intima-media thickness and 5-year progression of carotid atherosclerosis independently from standard risk factors for atherosclerosis. Experimentally, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed the area of atherosclerotic lesions, femoral artery injury-induced reendothelialization, and neointima formation in both <i>DKK3</i><sup><i>-/-</i></sup><i>/apolipoprotein E</i><sup><i>-/-</i></sup> and <i>DKK3</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup><i>/apolipoprotein E</i><sup><i>-/-</i></sup> mice. It was demonstrated that DKK3 deficiency accelerated atherosclerosis and delayed reendothelialization with consequently exacerbated neointima formation. To explore the underlying mechanisms, we performed transwell and scratch migration assays using cultured human endothelial cells, which exhibited a significant induction in cell migration in response to DKK3 stimulation. This DKK3-induced migration activated ROR2 and DVL1, activated Rac1 GTPases, and upregulated JNK and c-jun phosphorylation in endothelial cells. Knockdown of the ROR2 receptor using specific siRNA or transfection of a dominant-negative form of Rac1 in endothelial cells markedly inhibited cell migration and downstream JNK and c-jun phosphorylation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This study provides the evidence for a role of DKK3 in the protection against atherosclerosis involving endothelial migration and repair, with great therapeutic potential implications against atherosclerosis.</p></sec>

Optical Coherence Tomography Findings in Patients With Coronary Stent Thrombosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Stent thrombosis (ST) is a serious complication following coronary stenting. Intravascular optical coherence tomography (OCT) may provide insights into mechanistic processes leading to ST. We performed a prospective, multicenter study to evaluate OCT findings in patients with ST.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Consecutive patients presenting with ST were prospectively enrolled in a registry by using a centralized telephone registration system. After angiographic confirmation of ST, OCT imaging of the culprit vessel was performed with frequency domain OCT. Clinical data were collected according to a standardized protocol. OCT acquisitions were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed at a core laboratory. Dominant and contributing findings were adjudicated by an imaging adjudication committee.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Two hundred thirty-one patients presenting with ST underwent OCT imaging; 14 (6.1%) had image quality precluding further analysis. Of the remaining patients, 62 (28.6%) and 155 (71.4%) presented with early and late/very late ST, respectively. The underlying stent type was a new-generation drug-eluting stent in 50.3%. Mean reference vessel diameter was 2.9±0.6 mm and mean reference vessel area was 6.8±2.6 mm<sup>2</sup>. Stent underexpansion (stent expansion index <0.8) was observed in 44.4% of patients. The predicted average probability (95% confidence interval) that any frame had uncovered (or thrombus-covered) struts was 99.3% (96.1–99.9), 96.6% (92.4–98.5), 34.3% (15.0–60.7), and 9.6% (6.2–14.5) and malapposed struts was 21.8% (8.4–45.6), 8.5% (4.6–15.3), 6.7% (2.5–16.3), and 2.0% (1.2–3.3) for acute, subacute, late, and very late ST, respectively. The most common dominant finding adjudicated for acute ST was uncovered struts (66.7% of cases); for subacute ST, the most common dominant finding was uncovered struts (61.7%) and underexpansion (25.5%); for late ST, the most common dominant finding was uncovered struts (33.3%) and severe restenosis (19.1%); and for very late ST, the most common dominant finding was neoatherosclerosis (31.3%) and uncovered struts (20.2%). In patients presenting very late ST, uncovered stent struts were a common dominant finding in drug-eluting stents, and neoatherosclerosis was a common dominant finding in bare metal stents.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In patients with ST, uncovered and malapposed struts were frequently observed with the incidence of both decreasing with longer time intervals between stent implantation and presentation. The most frequent dominant observation varied according to time intervals from index stenting: uncovered struts and underexpansion in acute/subacute ST and neoatherosclerosis and uncovered struts in late/very late ST.</p></sec>

Random-effects and hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic model meta-analyses were used to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>e the data.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Seven hundred ninety-four articles were identified, and 12 (922 fetuses at risk for CoA) articles were included. Mean mitral valve diameter <i>z</i> score was lower (<i>P</i><0.001) and the mean tricuspid valve diameter <i>z</i> score was higher in fetuses with CoA than in those without CoA (<i>P</i>=0.01). Mean aortic valve diameter <i>z</i> score was lower in fetuses with CoA than in healthy fetuses (<i>P</i>≤0.001), but the ascending aorta diameter, expressed as <i>z</i> score or millimeters, was similar between groups (<i>P</i>=0.07 and 0.47, respectively). Mean aortic isthmus diameter <i>z</i> scores measured either in sagittal (<i>P</i>=0.02) or in 3-vessel trachea view (<i>P</i><0.001) were lower in fetuses with CoA. Conversely, the mean pulmonary artery diameter <i>z</i> score, the right/left ventricular and pulmonary artery/ascending aorta diameter ratios were higher (<i>P</i><0.001, <i>P</i>=0.02, and <i>P</i>=0.02, respectively) in fetuses with CoA in comparison with controls, although aortic isthmus/arterial duct diameter ratio was lower in fetuses with CoA than in those without CoA (<i>P</i><0.001). The presence of coarctation shelf and aortic arch hypoplasia were more common in fetuses with CoA than in controls (odds ratio, 26.0; 95% confidence interval, 4.42–153; <i>P</i><0.001 and odds ratio, 38.2; 95% confidence interval, 3.01–486; <i>P</i>=0.005), whereas persistent left superior vena cava (<i>P</i>=0.85), ventricular septal defect (<i>P</i>=0.12), and bicuspid aortic valve (<i>P</i>=0.14) did not carry an increased risk for this anomaly. Multiparametric diagnostic models integrating different ultrasound signs for the detection of CoA were associated with an increased detection rate.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The detection rate of CoA may improve when a multiple-criteria prediction model is adopted. Further large multicenter studies sharing the same imaging protocols are needed to develop objective models for risk assessment in these fetuses.</p></sec>

Low-Dose Aspirin for Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Events in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The long-term efficacy and safety of low-dose aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are still inconclusive.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The JPAD trial (Japanese Primary Prevention of Atherosclerosis With Aspirin for Diabetes) was a randomized, open-label, standard care–controlled trial examining whether low-dose aspirin affected cardiovascular events in 2539 Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and without preexisting cardiovascular disease. Patients were randomly allocated to receive aspirin (81 or 100 mg daily; aspirin group) or no aspirin (no-aspirin group) in the JPAD trial. After that trial ended in 2008, we followed up with the patients until 2015, with no attempt to change the previously assigned therapy. Primary end points were cardiovascular events, including sudden death, fatal or nonfatal coronary artery disease, fatal or nonfatal stroke, and peripheral vascular disease. For the safety analysis, hemorrhagic events, consisting of gastrointestinal bleeding, hemorrhagic stroke, and bleeding from any other sites, were also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed. The primary analysis was conducted for cardiovascular events among patients who retained their original allocation (a per-protocol cohort). Analyses on an intention-to-treat cohort were conducted for hemorrhagic events and statistical sensitivity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The median follow-up period was 10.3 years; 1621 patients (64%) were followed up throughout the study; and 2160 patients (85%) retained their original allocation. Low-dose aspirin did not reduce cardiovascular events in the per-protocol cohort (hazard ratio, 1.14; 95% confidence interval, 0.91–1.42). Multivariable Cox proportional hazard model adjusted for age, sex, glycemic control, kidney function, smoking status, hypertension, and dyslipidemia showed similar results (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 0.83–1.30), with no heterogeneity of efficacy in subgroup analyses stratified by each of these factors (all interaction <i>P</i>>0.05). Sensitivity analyses on the intention-to-treat cohort yielded consistent results (hazard ratio, 1.01; 95% confidence interval, 0.82–1.25). Gastrointestinal bleeding occurred in 25 patients (2%) in the aspirin group and 12 (0.9%) in the no-aspirin group (<i>P</i>=0.03), and the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was not different between groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Low-dose aspirin did not affect the risk for cardiovascular events but increased risk for gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in a primary prevention setting.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

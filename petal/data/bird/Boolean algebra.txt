The outcome and complications of vascularised fibular grafts
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Free vascularised fibular grafting has been used for the treatment   of large bony defects for more than 40 years. However, there is   little information about the risk factors for failure and whether   newer locking techniques of fixation improve the rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">union</span></strong>.   The purpose of this study was to compare the rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">union</span></strong> of free   fibular grafts fixed with locking and traditional techniques, and   to quantify the risk factors for non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">union</span></strong> and failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A retrospective review involved 134 consecutive procedures over   a period of 20 years. Of these, 25 were excluded leaving 109 patients   in the study. There were 66 men and 43 women, with a mean age of   33 years (5 to 78). Most (62) were performed for onco<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">logic</span></strong>al indications,   and the most common site (52) was the lower limb. Rate of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">union</span></strong>   was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and risk factors for   non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">union</span></strong> were assessed using Cox regression. All patients were followed   up for at least one year.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The rate of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">union</span></strong> was 82% at two years and 97% at five years.   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">union</span></strong> was achieved after the initial procedure in 76 patients (70%)   at a mean of ten months (3 to 19), and overall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">union</span></strong> was achieved   in 99 patients (91%)<bold>. </bold>No surgical factor, including   the use of locked fixation or supplementary corticocancellous bone   grafts increased the rate of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">union</span></strong>. A history of smoking was significantly   associated with a risk of non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">union</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Free vascularised fibular grafting is a successful form of treatment   for large bony defects. These results suggest that the use of modern   techniques of fixation does not affect the risk of non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">union</span></strong> when   compared with traditional forms of fixation, and smoking increases   the risk of non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">union</span></strong> following this procedure.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:134–8.</p></sec>

The management of open tibial fractures in children
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Following the introduction of national standards in 2009, most   major paediatric trauma is now triaged to specialist units offering   combined orthopaedic and plastic surgical expertise. We investigated   the management of open tibia fractures at a paediatric trauma centre,   primarily reporting the risk of infection and rate of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">union</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A retrospective review was performed on 61 children who between   2007 and 2015 presented with an open tibia fracture. Their mean   age was nine years (2 to 16) and the median follow-up was ten months   (interquartile range 5 to 18). Management involved IV antibiotics,   early debridement and combined treatment of the skeletal and soft-tissue injuries   in line with standards proposed by the British Orthopaedic Association.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were 36 diaphyseal fractures and 25 distal tibial fractures.   Of the distal fractures, eight involved the physis. Motor vehicle   collisions accounted for two thirds of the injuries and 38 patients   (62%) arrived outside of normal working hours. The initial method   of stabilisation comprised: casting in nine cases (15%); elastic   nailing in 19 (31%); Kirschner (K)-wiring in 13 (21%); intramedullary   nailing in one (2%); open reduction and plate fixation in four (7%); and   external fixation in 15 (25%). Wound management comprised: primary   wound closure in 24 (39%), delayed primary closure in 11 (18%),   split skin graft (SSG) in eight (13%), local flap with SSG in 17   (28%) and a free flap in one. A total of 43 fractures (70%) were   Gustilo-Anderson grade III. There were four superficial (6.6%) and   three (4.9%) deep infections. Two deep infections occurred following   open reduction and plate fixation and the third after    K-wire fixation of a distal fracture. No patient who underwent primary   wound closure developed an infection. All the fractures united,   although nine patients required revision of a mono-lateral to circular   frame for delayed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">union</span></strong> (two) or for altered alignment or length   (seven). The mean time to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">union</span></strong> was two weeks longer in diaphyseal fractures   than in distal fractures (13 weeks <i>versus</i> 10.8   weeks, p<i> = </i>0.016). Children aged > 12 years had   a significantly longer time to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">union</span></strong> than those aged < 12 years   (16.3 weeks <i>versus</i> 11.4 weeks, p<i> = </i>0.045).   The length of stay in hospital for patients with a Gustilo-Anderson   grade IIIB fracture was twice as long as for less severe injuries. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Fractures in children heal better than those in adults. Based   on our experience of deep infection we discourage the use of internal   fixation with a plate for open tibial fractures in children. We   advocate aggressive initial wound debridement in theatre with early   definitive combined orthopaedic and plastic surgery in order to   obtain skeletal stabilisation and soft-tissue cover.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:544–53.</p></sec>

The effect of a single early high-dose vitamin D supplement on fracture union in patients with hypovitaminosis D
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To evaluate the effect of a single early high-dose vitamin D   supplement on fracture <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">union</span></strong> in patients with hypovitaminosis D   and a long bone fracture.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between July 2011 and August 2013, 113 adults with a long bone   fracture were enrolled in a prospective randomised double-blind   placebo-controlled trial. Their serum vitamin D levels were measured   and a total of 100 patients were found to be vitamin D deficient   (< 20 ng/ml) or insufficient (< 30 ng/mL). These were then   randomised to receive a single dose of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> orally   (100 000 IU) within two weeks of injury (treatment group, n = 50)   or a placebo (control group, n = 50). We recorded patient demographics,   fracture location and treatment, vitamin D level, time to fracture   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">union</span></strong> and complications, including vitamin D toxicity.</p><p>Outcomes included <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">union</span></strong>, non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">union</span></strong> or complication requiring an   early, unplanned secondary procedure. Patients without an outcome   at 15 months and no scheduled follow-up were considered lost to   follow-up. The <i>t</i>-test and cross tabulations verified   the adequacy of randomisation. An intention-to-treat analysis was   carried out.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In all, 100 (89%) patients had hypovitaminosis D. Both treatment   and control groups had similar demographics and injury characteristics.   The initial median vitamin D levels were 16 ng/mL (interquartile   range 5 to 28) in both groups (p = 0.885). A total of 14 patients   were lost to follow-up (seven from each group), two had fixation   failure (one in each group) and one control group patient developed   an infection. Overall, the non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">union</span></strong> rate was 4% (two per group).   No patient showed signs of clinical toxicity from their supplement.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Despite finding a high level of hypovitaminosis D, the rate of   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">union</span></strong> was high and independent of supplementation with vitamin D<sub>3</sub>.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1520–5.</p></sec>

Uncertainty boosts Brexit jitters for U.K. scientists
<p>U.K. scientists dreading the country's impending departure from the European Union, known as Brexit, now face possible outcomes ranging from undesirable to potentially disastrous. On 11 December, Parliament will vote on a withdrawal agreement that lays out the terms of a costly but smooth departure from the European Union, starting in March 2019. If the agreement is rejected, the United Kingdom could crash out instead, triggering chaos at the border, food shortages, and economic hardship. A no-deal exit would also immediately void many research agreements. Regardless of how the United Kingdom departs, it will have to negotiate new science agreements with the European Union and come up with a new EU immigration policy. A long-awaited government white paper on immigration is expected to be published this month. Two and a half years after the divisive popular referendum that launched the Brexit process, some scientists hold out hope for a reprieve: A growing number of politicians are agitating for a second referendum that might reverse the first one.</p>

Fault-tolerant detection of a quantum error
<p>A critical component of any quantum error–correcting scheme is detection of errors by using an ancilla system. However, errors occurring in the ancilla can propagate onto the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">logic</span></strong>al qubit, irreversibly corrupting the encoded information. We demonstrate a fault-tolerant error-detection scheme that suppresses spreading of ancilla errors by a factor of 5, while maintaining the assignment fidelity. The same method is used to prevent propagation of ancilla excitations, increasing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">logic</span></strong>al qubit dephasing time by an order of magnitude. Our approach is hardware-efficient, as it uses a single multilevel transmon ancilla and a cavity-encoded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">logic</span></strong>al qubit, whose interaction is engineered in situ by using an off-resonant sideband drive. The results demonstrate that hardware-efficient approaches that exploit system-specific error models can yield advances toward fault-tolerant quantum computation.</p>

Precursors of logical reasoning in preverbal human infants
<p>Infants are able to entertain hypotheses about complex events and to modify them rationally when faced with inconsistent evidence. These capacities suggest that infants can use elementary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">logic</span></strong>al representations to frame and prune hypotheses. By presenting scenes containing ambiguities about the identity of an object, here we show that 12- and 19-month-old infants look longer at outcomes that are inconsistent with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">logic</span></strong>al inference necessary to resolve such ambiguities. At the moment of a potential deduction, infants’ pupils dilated, and their eyes moved toward the ambiguous object when inferences could be computed, in contrast to transparent scenes not requiring inferences to identify the object. These oculomotor markers resembled those of adults inspecting similar scenes, suggesting that intuitive and stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">logic</span></strong>al structures involved in the interpretation of dynamic scenes may be part of the fabric of the human mind.</p>

‘Modern’ distal femoral locking plates allow safe, early weight-bearing with a high rate of union and low rate of failure
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Fractures of the distal femur can be challenging to manage and   are on the increase in the elderly osteoporotic population. Management   with casting or bracing can unacceptably limit a patient’s ability   to bear weight, but historically, operative fixation has been associated   with a high rate of re-operation. In this study, we describe the outcomes   of fixation using modern implants within a strategy of early return   to function.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>All patients treated at our centre with lateral distal femoral   locking plates (LDFLP) between 2009 and 2014 were identified. Fracture   classification and operative information including weight-bearing   status, rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">union</span></strong>, re-operation, failure of implants and mortality   rate, were recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 127 fractures were identified in 122 patients. The   mean age was 72.8 years (16 to 101) and 92 of the patients (75%)   were female. A consultant performed the operation in 85 of the cases,   (67%) with the remainder performed under direct consultant supervision.   In total 107 patients (84%) were allowed to bear full weight immediately.   The rate of clinical and radio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">logic</span></strong>al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">union</span></strong> was 81/85 (95%) and   only four fractures of 127 (3%) fractures required re-operation   for failure of surgery.

Chirally coupled nanomagnets
<p>Magnetically coupled nanomagnets have multiple applications in nonvolatile memories, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">logic</span></strong> gates, and sensors. The most effective couplings have been found to occur between the magnetic layers in a vertical stack. We achieved strong coupling of laterally adjacent nanomagnets using the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. This coupling is mediated by chiral domain walls between out-of-plane and in-plane magnetic regions and dominates the behavior of nanomagnets below a critical size. We used this concept to realize lateral exchange bias, field-free current-induced switching between multistate magnetic configurations as well as synthetic antiferromagnets, skyrmions, and artificial spin ices covering a broad range of length scales and topologies. Our work provides a platform to design arrays of correlated nanomagnets and to achieve all-electric control of planar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">logic</span></strong> gates and memory devices.</p>

A new and reliable classification system for fractures of the navicular and associated injuries to the midfoot
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Fractures of the navicular can occur in isolation but, owing   to the intimate anatomical and biomechanical relationships, are   often associated with other injuries to the neighbouring bones and   joints in the foot. As a result, they can lead to long-term morbidity   and poor function. Our aim in this study was to identify patterns   of injury in a new classification system of traumatic fractures   of the navicular, with consideration being given to the commonly associated   injuries to the midfoot.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We undertook a retrospective review of 285 consecutive patients   presenting over an eight- year period with a fracture of the navicular.   Five common patterns of injury were identified and classified according   to the radio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">logic</span></strong>al features. Type 1 fractures are dorsal avulsion   injuries related to the capsule of the talonavicular joint. Type   2 fractures are isolated avulsion injuries to the tuberosity of   the navicular. Type 3 fractures are a variant of tarsometatarsal   fracture/dislocations creating instability of the medial ray. Type   4 fractures involve the body of the navicular with no associated   injury to the lateral column and type 5 fractures occur in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conjunct</span></strong>ion   with disruption of the midtarsal joint with crushing of the medial   or lateral, or both, columns of the foot.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In order to test the reliability and reproducibility of this   new classification, a cohort of 30 patients with a fracture of the   navicular were classified by six independent assessors at two separate   times, six months apart.

First insights into the functional role of vasicentric tracheids and parenchyma in eucalyptus species with solitary vessels: do they contribute to xylem efficiency or safety?
<p>The relationship between hydraulic specific conductivity (<i>k</i><sub><i>s</i></sub>) and vulnerability to cavitation (VC) with size and number of vessels has been studied in many angiosperms. However, few of the studies link other cell types (vasicentric tracheids (VT), fibre–tracheids, parenchyma) with these hydraulic functions. <i>Eucalyptus</i> is one of the most important genera in forestry worldwide. It exhibits a complex wood anatomy, with solitary vessels surrounded by VT and parenchyma, which could serve as a good model to investigate the functional role of the different cell types in xylem functioning. Wood anatomy (several traits of vessels, VT, fibres and parenchyma) in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conjunct</span></strong>ion with maximum <i>k</i><sub><i>s</i></sub> and VC was studied in adult trees of commercial species with medium-to-high wood density (<i>Eucalyptus globulus</i> Labill., <i>Eucalyptus viminalis</i> Labill. and <i>Eucalyptus camaldulensis</i> Dehnh.). Traits of cells accompanying vessels presented correlations with functional variables suggesting that they contribute to both increasing connectivity between adjacent vessels—and, therefore, to xylem conduction efficiency—and decreasing the probability of embolism propagation into the tissue, i.e., xylem safety. All three species presented moderate-to-high resistance to cavitation (mean <i>P</i><sub>50</sub> values = −2.4 to −4.2 MPa) with no general trade-off between efficiency and safety at the interspecific level. The results in these species do not support some well-established hypotheses of the functional meaning of wood anatomy.</p>

Cooperation between T cell receptor and Toll-like receptor 5 signaling for CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activation
<p>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells recognize antigens through their T cell receptors (TCRs); however, additional signals involving costimulatory receptors, for example, CD28, are required for proper T cell activation. Alternative costimulatory receptors have been proposed, including members of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family, such as TLR5 and TLR2. To understand the molecular mechanism underlying a potential costimulatory role for TLR5, we generated detailed molecular maps and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">logic</span></strong>al models for the TCR and TLR5 signaling pathways and a merged model for cross-interactions between the two pathways. Furthermore, we validated the resulting model by analyzing how T cells responded to the activation of these pathways alone or in combination, in terms of the activation of the transcriptional regulators CREB, AP-1 (c-Jun), and NF-κB (p65). Our merged model accurately predicted the experimental results, showing that the activation of TLR5 can play a similar role to that of CD28 activation with respect to AP-1, CREB, and NF-κB activation, thereby providing insights regarding the cross-regulation of these pathways in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p>

Unique BIR domain sets determine inhibitor of apoptosis protein–driven cell death and NOD2 complex signal specificity
<p>The mammalian IAPs, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 and 2 (cIAP1 and cIAP2), play pivotal roles in innate immune signaling and inflammatory homeostasis, often working in parallel or in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conjunct</span></strong>ion at a signaling complex. IAPs direct both nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing 2 (NOD2) signaling complexes and cell death mechanisms to appropriately regulate inflammation. Although it is known that XIAP is critical for NOD2 signaling and that the loss of cIAP1 and cIAP2 blunts NOD2 activity, it is unclear whether these three highly related proteins can compensate for one another in NOD2 signaling or in mechanisms governing apoptosis or necroptosis. This potential redundancy is critically important, given that genetic loss of XIAP causes both very early onset inflammatory bowel disease and X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome 2 (XLP-2) and that the overexpression of cIAP1 and cIAP2 is linked to both carcinogenesis and chemotherapeutic resistance. Given the therapeutic interest in IAP inhibition and the potential toxicities associated with disruption of inflammatory homeostasis, we used synthetic biology techniques to examine the functional redundancies of key domains in the IAPs. From this analysis, we defined the features of the IAPs that enable them to function at overlapping signaling complexes but remain independent and functionally exclusive in their roles as E3 ubiquitin ligases in innate immune and inflammatory signaling.</p>

Acoel genome reveals the regulatory landscape of whole-body regeneration

To decipher the regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">logic</span></strong> that orchestrates regeneration, we sequenced the genome of the acoel worm <i>Hofstenia miamia</i>, a highly regenerative member of the sister lineage of other bilaterians. Epigenomic profiling revealed thousands of regeneration-responsive chromatin regions and identified dynamically bound transcription factor motifs, with the early growth response (EGR) binding site as the most variably accessible during <i>Hofstenia</i> regeneration. Combining <i>egr</i> inhibition with chromatin profiling suggests that Egr functions as a pioneer factor to directly regulate early wound-induced genes. The genetic connections inferred by this approach allowed the construction of a gene regulatory network for whole-body regeneration, enabling genomics-based comparisons of regeneration across species.</p>

AIDS push gets mixed reviews
<p>When President Donald Trump announced in his State of the Union address last week that his administration would launch a new push to end the AIDS epidemic in the United States, many advocates reacted skeptically. They contend the Trump administration has ostracized some of the communities most affected by HIV/AIDS, including men who have sex with men, transgender people, and African-Americans and Latinos. They also noted that many Republicans opposed Medicaid expansion, which offers healthcare to many people who are living with HIV. But some researchers welcomed the news, and administration officials insisted that they, too, wanted to battle the stigma and discrimination that undermines efforts to combat HIV/AIDS. The administration said the initiative would not take money from existing programs; Trump will request an as yet unspecified amount in his budget proposal next month.</p>

Elevated trawling inside protected areas undermines conservation outcomes in a global fishing hot spot
<p>Marine protected areas (MPAs) are increasingly used as a primary tool to conserve biodiversity. This is particularly relevant in heavily exploited fisheries hot spots such as Europe, where MPAs now cover 29% of territorial waters, with unknown effects on fishing pressure and conservation outcomes. We investigated industrial trawl fishing and sensitive indicator species in and around 727 MPAs designated by the European Union. We found that 59% of MPAs are commercially trawled, and average trawling intensity across MPAs is at least 1.4-fold higher as compared with nonprotected areas. Abundance of sensitive species (sharks, rays, and skates) decreased by 69% in heavily trawled areas. The widespread industrial exploitation of MPAs undermines global biodiversity conservation targets, elevating recent concerns about growing human pressures on protected areas worldwide.</p>

Cellular checkpoint control using programmable sequential logic
<p>Bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">logic</span></strong>al processes that require orderly progression, such as growth and differentiation, proceed via regulatory checkpoints where the cell waits for signals before continuing to the next state. Implementing such control would allow genetic engineers to divide complex tasks into stages. We present genetic circuits that encode sequential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">logic</span></strong> to instruct <i>Escherichia coli</i> to proceed through a linear or cyclical sequence of states. These are built with 11 set-reset latches, designed with repressor-based NOR gates, which can connect to each other and sensors. The performance of circuits with up to three latches and four sensors, including a gated D latch, closely match predictions made by using nonlinear dynamics. Checkpoint control is demonstrated by switching cells between multiple circuit states in response to external signals over days.</p>

Programmable protein circuits in living cells
<p>Synthetic protein-level circuits could enable engineering of powerful new cellular behaviors. Rational protein circuit design would be facilitated by a composable protein-protein regulation system in which individual protein components can regulate one another to create a variety of different circuit architectures. In this study, we show that engineered viral proteases can function as composable protein components, which can together implement a broad variety of circuit-level functions in mammalian cells. In this system, termed CHOMP (circuits of hacked orthogonal modular proteases), input proteases dock with and cleave target proteases to inhibit their function. These components can be connected to generate regulatory cascades, binary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">logic</span></strong> gates, and dynamic analog signal-processing functions. To demonstrate the utility of this system, we rationally designed a circuit that induces cell death in response to upstream activators of the Ras oncogene. Because CHOMP circuits can perform complex functions yet be encoded as single transcripts and delivered without genomic integration, they offer a scalable platform to facilitate protein circuit engineering for biotechno<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">logic</span></strong>al applications.</p>

Experimental observation of high thermal conductivity in boron arsenide
<p>Improving the thermal management of small-scale devices requires developing materials with high thermal conductivities. The semiconductor boron arsenide (BAs) is an attractive target because of ab initio calculation indicating that single crystals have an ultrahigh thermal conductivity. We synthesized BAs single crystals without detectable defects and measured a room-temperature thermal conductivity of 1300 watts per meter-kelvin. Our spectroscopy study, in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conjunct</span></strong>ion with atomistic theory, reveals that the distinctive band structure of BAs allows for very long phonon mean free paths and strong high-order anharmonicity through the four-phonon process. The single-crystal BAs has better thermal conductivity than other metals and semiconductors. Our study establishes BAs as a benchmark material for thermal management applications and exemplifies the power of combining experiments and ab initio theory in new materials discovery.</p>

Morphogen gradient reconstitution reveals Hedgehog pathway design principles
<p>In developing tissues, cells estimate their spatial position by sensing graded concentrations of diffusible signaling proteins called morphogens. Morphogen-sensing pathways exhibit diverse molecular architectures, whose roles in controlling patterning dynamics and precision have been unclear. In this work, combining cell-based in vitro gradient reconstitution, genetic rewiring, and mathematical modeling, we systematically analyzed the distinctive architectural features of the Sonic Hedgehog pathway. We found that the combination of double-negative regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">logic</span></strong> and negative feedback through the PTCH receptor accelerates gradient formation and improves robustness to variation in the morphogen production rate compared with alternative designs. The ability to isolate morphogen patterning from concurrent developmental processes and to compare the patterning behaviors of alternative, rewired pathway architectures offers a powerful way to understand and engineer multicellular patterning.</p>

Asylum applications respond to temperature fluctuations
<p>International negotiations on climate change, along with recent upsurges in migration across the Mediterranean Sea, have highlighted the need to better understand the possible effects of climate change on human migration—in particular, across national borders. Here we examine how, in the recent past (2000–2014), weather variations in 103 source countries translated into asylum applications to the European Union, which averaged 351,000 per year in our sample. We find that temperatures that deviated from the moderate optimum (~20°C) increased asylum applications in a nonlinear fashion, which implies an accelerated increase under continued future warming. Holding everything else constant, asylum applications by the end of the century are predicted to increase, on average, by 28% (98,000 additional asylum applications per year) under representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenario 4.5 and by 188% (660,000 additional applications per year) under RCP 8.5 for the 21 climate models in the NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections (NEX-GDDP).</p>

Structural basis of membrane disruption and cellular toxicity by α-synuclein oligomers
<p>Oligomeric species populated during the aggregation process of α-synuclein have been linked to neuronal impairment in Parkinson’s disease and related neurodegenerative disorders.

A neural algorithm for a fundamental computing problem
<p>Similarity search—for example, identifying similar images in a database or similar documents on the web—is a fundamental computing problem faced by large-scale information retrieval systems. We discovered that the fruit fly olfactory circuit solves this problem with a variant of a computer science algorithm (called locality-sensitive hashing). The fly circuit assigns similar neural activity patterns to similar odors, so that behaviors learned from one odor can be applied when a similar odor is experienced. The fly algorithm, however, uses three computational strategies that depart from traditional approaches. These strategies can be translated to improve the performance of computational similarity searches. This perspective helps illuminate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">logic</span></strong> supporting an important sensory function and provides a conceptually new algorithm for solving a fundamental computational problem.</p>

DNA sequence–directed shape change of photopatterned hydrogels via high-degree swelling
<p>Shape-changing hydrogels that can bend, twist, or actuate in response to external stimuli are critical to soft robots, programmable matter, and smart medicine. Shape change in hydrogels has been induced by global cues, including temperature, light, or pH. Here we demonstrate that specific DNA molecules can induce 100-fold volumetric hydrogel expansion by successive extension of cross-links. We photopattern up to centimeter-sized gels containing multiple domains that undergo different shape changes in response to different DNA sequences. Experiments and simulations suggest a simple design rule for controlled shape change. Because DNA molecules can be coupled to molecular sensors, amplifiers, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">logic</span></strong> circuits, this strategy introduces the possibility of building soft devices that respond to diverse biochemical inputs and autonomously implement chemical control programs.</p>

Multipotent peripheral glial cells generate neuroendocrine cells of the adrenal medulla
<p>Adrenaline is a fundamental circulating hormone for bodily responses to internal and external stressors. Chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla (AM) represent the main neuroendocrine adrenergic component and are believed to differentiate from neural crest cells. We demonstrate that large numbers of chromaffin cells arise from peripheral glial stem cells, termed Schwann cell precursors (SCPs). SCPs migrate along the visceral motor nerve to the vicinity of the forming adrenal gland, where they detach from the nerve and form postsynaptic neuroendocrine chromaffin cells. An intricate molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">logic</span></strong> drives two sequential phases of gene expression, one unique for a distinct transient cellular state and another for cell type specification. Subsequently, these programs down-regulate SCP-gene and up-regulate chromaffin cell–gene networks. The AM forms through limited cell expansion and requires the recruitment of numerous SCPs. Thus, peripheral nerves serve as a stem cell niche for neuroendocrine system development.</p>

A modular and enantioselective synthesis of the pleuromutilin antibiotics
<p>The tricyclic diterpene fungal metabolite (+)-pleuromutilin has served as a starting point for antibiotic development. Semisynthetic modification of its glycolic acid subunit at C14 provided the first analogs fit for human use, and derivatization at C12 led to 12-<i>epi</i>-pleuromutilins with extended-spectrum antibacterial activity, including activity against Gram-negative pathogens.

Complex multifault rupture during the 2016 <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 7.8 Kaikōura earthquake, New Zealand

Field observations, in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conjunct</span></strong>ion with interferometric synthetic aperture radar, Global Positioning System, and seismology data, reveal this to be one of the most complex earthquakes ever recorded.

Geodetic and field observations reveal surface ruptures along at least 12 major faults, including possible slip along the southern Hikurangi subduction interface; extensive uplift along much of the coastline; and widespread anelastic deformation, including the ~8-meter uplift of a fault-bounded block. This complex earthquake defies many conventional assumptions about the degree to which earthquake ruptures are controlled by fault segmentation and should motivate reevaluation of these issues in seismic hazard models.</p>

Vectorial representation of spatial goals in the hippocampus of bats

Neural representations of an animal’s own position and orientation have been extensively studied. However, it is unknown how navigational goals are encoded in the brain. We recorded from hippocampal CA1 neurons of bats flying in complex trajectories toward a spatial goal. We discovered a subpopulation of neurons with angular tuning to the goal direction. Many of these neurons were tuned to an occluded goal, suggesting that goal-direction representation is memory-based. We also found cells that encoded the distance to the goal, often in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conjunct</span></strong>ion with goal direction.

Characterization and Cloning of Grape Circular RNAs Identified the Cold Resistance-Related <i>Vv-circATS1</i>
<p>Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are widely distributed and play essential roles in a series of developmental processes, although none have been identified or characterized in grapevines (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>). In this study, we characterized the function of grape circRNA and uncovered thousands of putative back-splicing sites by global transcriptome analysis. Our results indicated that several reported circRNA prediction algorithms should be used simultaneously to obtain comprehensive and reliable circRNA predictions in plants. Furthermore, the length of introns flanking grape circRNAs was closely related to exon circularization. Although the longer introns flanking grape circRNAs appeared to circularize more efficiently, a 20- to 50-nt region seemed large enough to drive grape circRNA biogenesis. In addition, the endogenous introns flanking circularized exon(s) in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conjunct</span></strong>ion with reverse complementary sequences could support the accurate and efficient circularization of various exons in grape, which constitutes a new tool for exploring the functional consequences caused by circRNA expression. Finally, we identified 475 differentially expressed circRNAs in grape leaves under cold stress. Overexpression of <i>Vv-circATS1</i>, a circRNA derived from <i>glycerol-3-P acyltransferase</i>, improved cold tolerance in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), while the linear RNA derived from the same sequence cannot. These results indicate the functional difference between circRNA and linear RNA, and provide new insight into plant abiotic stress resistance.</p>

<p><i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973 (<i>Synechococcus</i> 2973) has the shortest reported doubling time (2.1 h) among cyanobacteria, making it a promising platform for the solar-based production of biochemicals. In this meta-analysis, its intracellular flux distribution was recomputed using genome-scale isotopic nonstationary <sup>13</sup>C-metabolic flux analysis given the labeling dynamics of 13 metabolites reported in an earlier study. To achieve this, a genome-scale mapping model, namely <i>i</i>mSyu593, was constructed using the <i>i</i>mSyn617 mapping model for <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 (<i>Synechocystis</i> 6803) as the starting point encompassing 593 reactions. The flux elucidation revealed nearly complete conversion (greater than 96%) of the assimilated carbon into biomass in <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973. In contrast, <i>Synechocystis</i> 6803 achieves complete conversion of only 86% of the assimilated carbon. This high biomass yield was enabled by the reincorporation of the fixed carbons lost in anabolic and photorespiratory pathways in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conjunct</span></strong>ion with flux rerouting through a nondecarboxylating reaction such as phosphoketolase. This reincorporation of lost CO<sub>2</sub> sustains a higher flux through the photorespiratory C2 cycle that fully meets the glycine and serine demands for growth. In accordance with the high carbon efficiency drive, acetyl-coenzyme A was entirely produced using the carbon-efficient phosphoketolase pathway. Comparison of the <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973 flux map with that of <i>Synechocystis</i> 6803 revealed differences in the use of Calvin cycle and photorespiratory pathway reactions. The two species used different reactions for the synthesis of metabolites such as fructose-6-phosphate, glycine, sedoheptulose-7-phosphate, and Ser. These findings allude to a highly carbon-efficient metabolism alongside the fast carbon uptake rate in <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973, which explains its faster growth rate.</p>

DNA Topoisomerase Iα Affects the Floral Transition
<p>DNA topoisomerases modulate DNA topology to maintain chromosome superstructure and genome integrity, which is indispensable for DNA replication and RNA transcription. Their function in plant development still remains largely unknown. Here, we report a hitherto unidentified role of Topoisomerase Iα (TOP1α) in controlling flowering time in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Loss of function of <i>TOP1α</i> results in early flowering under both long and short days. This is attributed mainly to a decrease in the expression of a central flowering repressor, <i>FLOWERING LOCUS C</i> (<i>FLC</i>), and its close homologs, <i>MADS AFFECTING FLOWERING4</i> (<i>MAF4</i>) and <i>MAF5</i>, during the floral transition. TOP1α physically binds to the genomic regions of <i>FLC</i>, <i>MAF4</i>, and <i>MAF5</i> and promotes the association of RNA polymerase II complexes to their transcriptional start sites. These correlate with the changes in histone modifications but do not directly affect nucleosome occupancy at these loci. Our results suggest that TOP1α mediates DNA topology to facilitate the recruitment of RNA polymerase II at <i>FLC</i>, <i>MAF4</i>, and <i>MAF5</i> in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conjunct</span></strong>ion with histone modifications, thus facilitating the expression of these key flowering repressors to prevent precocious flowering in Arabidopsis.</p>

Phosphorylation of GENOMES UNCOUPLED 4 Alters Stimulation of Mg Chelatase Activity in Angiosperms
<p>GENOMES UNCOUPLED 4 (GUN4) is a positive regulator of light-dependent chlorophyll biosynthesis. GUN4 activates Mg chelatase (MgCh) that catalyzes the insertion of an Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion into protoporphyrin IX. We show that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) GUN4 is phosphorylated at Ser 264 (S264), the penultimate amino acid residue at the C terminus. While GUN4 is preferentially phosphorylated in darkness, phosphorylation is reduced upon accumulation of Mg porphyrins. Expression of a phosphomimicking <i>GUN4</i>(S264D) results in an incomplete complementation of the white <i>gun4-2 null</i> mutant and a chlorotic phenotype comparable to <i>gun4</i> knockdown mutants. Phosphorylated GUN4 has a reduced stimulatory effect on MgCh in vitro and in vivo but retains its protein stability and tetrapyrrole binding capacity. Analysis of GUN4 found in oxygenic photosynthetic organisms reveals the evolution of a C-terminal extension, which harbors the phosphorylation site of GUN4 expressed in angiosperms. Homologs of GUN4 from <i>Synechocystis</i> and <i>Chlamydomonas</i> lack the conserved phosphorylation site found in a C-terminal extension of angiosperm GUN4. Biochemical studies proved the importance of the C-terminal extension for MgCh stimulation and inactivation of GUN4 by phosphorylation in angiosperms. An additional mechanism regulating MgCh activity is proposed. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conjunct</span></strong>ion with the dark repression of 5-aminolevulinic acid synthesis, GUN4 phosphorylation minimizes the flow of intermediates into the Mg branch of the tetrapyrrole metabolic pathway for chlorophyll biosynthesis.</p>

Each treatment was run under control (pH 7.8) and CO<sub>2</sub>-acidified seawater conditions (decreasing pH from 7.8 to 6.8). After 105 min of CO<sub>2</sub> addition, by which time the external pH (pH<sub>e</sub>) had declined to 6.8, the dinoflagellate symbionts had increased their pH<sub>i</sub> by 0.5 pH units above control levels when in the absence of DCMU. In contrast, in both symbiotic and non-symbiotic host coral cells, 15 min of CO<sub>2</sub> addition (0.2 pH unit drop in pH<sub>e</sub>) led to cytoplasmic acidosis equivalent to 0.3–0.4 pH units irrespective of whether DCMU was present. Despite further seawater acidification over the duration of the experiment, the pH<sub>i</sub> of non-symbiotic coral cells did not change, though in host cells containing a symbiont cell the pH<sub>i</sub> recovered to control levels when photsynthesis was not inhibited. This recovery was negated when cells were incubated with DCMU. Our results reveal that photosynthetic activity of the endosymbiont is tightly coupled with the ability of the host cell to recover from cellular acidosis after exposure to high CO<sub>2</sub>/low pH.</p>

The use of an anterior pelvic internal fixator to treat disruptions of the anterior pelvic ring
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The anterior pelvic internal fixator is increasingly used for   the treatment of unstable, or displaced, injuries of the anterior   pelvic ring. The evidence for its use, however, is limited. The   aim of this paper is to describe the indications for its use, how   it is applied and its complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We reviewed the case notes and radiographs of 50 patients treated   with an anterior pelvic internal fixator between April 2010 and   December 2015 at a major trauma centre in the United Kingdom. The   median follow-up time was 38 months (interquartile range 24 to 51).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Three patients were excluded from the analysis leaving 47 patients   with complete follow-up data. Of the 47 patients, 46 achieved radio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">logic</span></strong>al   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">union</span></strong> and one progressed to an asymptomatic non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">union</span></strong>. Of the remaining patients,   45 required supplementary posterior fixation with percutaneous iliosacral   screws, 2 of which required sacral plating. The incidence of injury   to the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN) was 34%. The rate   of infection was 2%. There were no other significant complications.   Without this treatment, 44 patients (94%) would have needed unilateral   or bilateral open reduction and plate fixation extending laterally   to the hip joint.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The anterior pelvic internal fixator reduces the need for extensive   open surgery and is a useful addition to the armamentarium for the   treatment of anterior pelvic injuries. It is associated with injury   to the LFCN in a third of patients.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B.1232–6.</p></sec>

Unnaturally aglow with a bright inner light
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bioluminesc</span></strong>ent insects, fungi, and sea creatures must have seemed mysterious and supernatural to the people of antiquity. It was not until the late 19th century that science began to displace the magic by demonstrating that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bioluminesc</span></strong>ence in insects, such as the firefly (<i>Photinus pyralis</i>), is a chemical reaction that requires a protein (a luciferase) and substrates [adenosine triphosphate (ATP), O<sub>2</sub>, and a luciferin, <sc>d</sc>-luciferin] (<i>1</i>). Understanding of the biochemical mechanisms of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bioluminesc</span></strong>ence has grown over the past century, as has appreciation of its widespread prevalence in nature. Since cloning the gene for firefly luciferase (<i>2</i>), researchers have sought to exploit this molecular lightbulb for bioanalysis applications and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bioluminesc</span></strong>ence imaging (BLI) in model animals (<i>3</i>). On page 935 of this issue, Iwano <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) report the development of a luciferase-luciferin pair that, due to its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bright</span></strong>ness and red-colored <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glow</span></strong>, opens the door to a range of biomedical applications, such as detection of single cells deep within tissue, that were not previously feasible with BLI.</p>

Improving Assessment of Drug Safety Through Proteomics
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Early detection of adverse effects of novel therapies and understanding of their mechanisms could improve the safety and efficiency of drug development. We have retrospectively applied large-scale proteomics to blood samples from ILLUMINATE (Investigation of Lipid Level Management to Understand its Impact in Atherosclerotic Events), a trial of torcetrapib (a cholesterol ester transfer protein inhibitor), that involved 15 067 participants at high cardiovascular risk. ILLUMINATE was terminated at a median of 550 days because of significant absolute increases of 1.2% in cardiovascular events and 0.4% in mortality with torcetrapib. The aims of our analysis were to determine whether a proteomic analysis might reveal biological mechanisms responsible for these harmful effects and whether harmful effects of torcetrapib could have been detected early in the ILLUMINATE trial with proteomics.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A nested case-control analysis of paired plasma samples at baseline and at 3 months was performed in 249 participants assigned to torcetrapib plus atorvastatin and 223 participants assigned to atorvastatin only. Within each treatment arm, cases with events were matched to controls 1:1. Main outcomes were a survey of 1129 proteins for discovery of biological pathways altered by torcetrapib and a 9-protein risk score validated to predict myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, or death.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Plasma concentrations of 200 proteins changed significantly with torcetrapib. Their pathway analysis revealed unexpected and widespread changes in immune and inflammatory functions, as well as changes in endocrine systems, including in aldosterone function and glycemic control. At baseline, 9-protein risk scores were similar in the 2 treatment arms and higher in participants with subsequent events. At 3 months, the absolute 9-protein derived risk increased in the torcetrapib plus atorvastatin arm compared with the atorvastatin-only arm by 1.08% (<i>P</i>=0.0004). Thirty-seven proteins changed in the direction of increased risk of 49 proteins previously associated with cardiovascular and mortality risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Heretofore unknown effects of torcetrapib were revealed in immune and inflammatory functions. A protein-based risk score predicted harm from torcetrapib within just 3 months. A protein-based risk assessment embedded within a large proteomic survey may prove to be useful in the evaluation of therapies to prevent harm to patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Selective Targeting of Mobile mRNAs to Plasmodesmata for Cell-to-Cell Movement
<p>Many plant mRNAs move from cell to cell or long distance to execute non-cell-autonomous functions. These mobile mRNAs traffic through the phloem to regulate many developmental processes, but despite the burgeoning discovery of mobile mRNAs, little is known about the mechanism underlying the intracellular sorting of these mRNAs. Here, we exploited a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ence-based mRNA labeling system, using the bacteriophage coat protein MS2, fused to GFP (MS2-GFP) and an MS2 recognition site in the RNA of interest, to visualize the intracellular trafficking of mobile mRNAs in living plant cells of <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. We first improved this system by using the nuclear localization sequence from FD, which substantially reduced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ent background of MS2-GFP in the cytoplasm. The modified system allowed us to observe the cytoplasmic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ent foci dependent on MS2-binding sites. Coexpressing the MS2-GFP system with a virus movement protein, which is a plasmodesmata (PD)-localized nonspecific RNA-binding protein, targeted cytoplasmic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ent foci to the PD, suggesting that the cytoplasmic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ent foci contain mRNA and MS2-GFP. Our ex vivo RNA imaging revealed that mobile but not nonmobile mRNAs were selectively targeted to PD. Real-time images of intracellular translocation revealed that the translocation of mRNA and organelles in the transvacuolar strands may be governed by the same mechanism. Our study suggests that PD targeting of mRNA is a selective step in determining mRNA cell-to-cell movement of mRNAs.</p>

Chloroplast Ca<sup>2+</sup> Fluxes into and across Thylakoids Revealed by Thylakoid-Targeted Aequorin Probes
<p>Chloroplasts require a fine-tuned control of their internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, which is crucial for many aspects of photosynthesis and for other chloroplast-localized processes. Increasing evidence suggests that calcium regulation within chloroplasts also may influence Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathways in the cytosol. To investigate the involvement of thylakoids in Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and in the modulation of chloroplast Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in vivo, we targeted the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bioluminesc</span></strong>ent Ca<sup>2+</sup> reporter aequorin as a YFP fusion to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lumen</span></strong> and the stromal surface of thylakoids in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Thylakoid localization of aequorin-based probes in stably transformed lines was confirmed by confocal microscopy, immunogold labeling, and biochemical analyses. In resting conditions in the dark, free Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in the thylakoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lumen</span></strong> were maintained at about 0.5 μ<sc>m</sc>, which was a 3- to 5-fold higher concentration than in the stroma. Monitoring of chloroplast Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in different intrachloroplast subcompartments (stroma, thylakoid membrane, and thylakoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lumen</span></strong>) revealed the occurrence of stimulus-specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, characterized by unique kinetic parameters. Oxidative and salt stresses initiated pronounced free Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes in the thylakoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lumen</span></strong>. Localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases also were observed on the thylakoid membrane surface, mirroring transient Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes observed for the bulk stroma, but with specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics. Moreover, evidence was obtained for dark-stimulated intrathylakoid Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes, suggesting a new scenario for light-to-dark-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes inside chloroplasts. Hence, thylakoid-targeted aequorin reporters can provide new insights into chloroplast Ca<sup>2+</sup> storage and signal transduction. These probes represent novel tools with which to investigate the role of thylakoids in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling networks within chloroplasts and plant cells.</p>

Partitioning of vessel resistivity in three liana species
<p>Vessels with simple perforation plates, found in the majority of angiosperms, are considered the evolutionarily most advanced conduits, least impeding the xylem sap flow. Nevertheless, when measured, their hydraulic resistivity (<i>R</i>, i.e., inverse value of hydraulic conductivity) is significantly higher than resistivity predicted using Hagen–Poiseuille equation (<i>R</i><sub>HP</sub>). In our study we aimed (i) to quantify two basic components of the total vessel resistivity – vessel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lumen</span></strong> resistivity and end wall resistivity, and (ii) to analyze how the variable inner diameter of the vessel along its longitudinal axis affects resistivity. We measured flow rates through progressively shortened stems of hop (<i>Humulus lupulus</i> L.), grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i> L.), and clematis (<i>Clematis vitalba</i> L.) and used elastomer injection for identification of open vessels and for measurement of changing vessel inner diameters along its axis. The relative contribution of end wall resistivity to total vessel resistivity was 0.46 for hop, 0.55 for grapevine, and 0.30 for clematis. Vessel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lumen</span></strong> resistivity calculated from our measurements was substantially higher than theoretical resistivity – about 43% for hop, 58% for grapevine, and 52% for clematis. We identified variation in the vessel inner diameter as an important source of vessel resistivity. The coefficient of variation of vessel inner diameter was a good predictor for the increase of the ratio of integral <i>R</i><sub>HP</sub> to <i>R</i><sub>HP</sub> calculated from the mean value of inner vessel diameter. We discuss the fact that we dealt with the longest vessels in a given stem sample, which may lead to the overestimation of vessel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lumen</span></strong> resistivity, which consequently precludes decision whether the variable vessel inner diameter explains fully the difference between vessel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lumen</span></strong> resistivity and <i>R</i><sub>HP</sub> we observed.</p>

Light-induced lattice expansion leads to high-efficiency perovskite solar cells
<p>Light-induced structural dynamics plays a vital role in the physical properties, device performance, and stability of hybrid perovskite–based optoelectronic devices. We report that continuous light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">illumin</span></strong></span></strong>ation leads to a uniform lattice expansion in hybrid perovskite thin films, which is critical for obtaining high-efficiency photovoltaic devices. Correlated, in situ structural and device characterizations reveal that light-induced lattice expansion benefits the performances of a mixed-cation pure-halide planar device, boosting the power conversion efficiency from 18.5 to 20.5%. The lattice expansion leads to the relaxation of local lattice strain, which lowers the energetic barriers at the perovskite-contact interfaces, thus improving the open circuit voltage and fill factor. The light-induced lattice expansion did not compromise the stability of these high-efficiency photovoltaic devices under continuous operation at full-spectrum 1-sun (100 milliwatts per square centimeter) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">illumin</span></strong></span></strong>ation for more than 1500 hours.</p>

Colloidally prepared La-doped BaSnO<sub>3</sub> electrodes for efficient, photostable perovskite solar cells
<p>Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) exceeding a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20% have mainly been demonstrated by using mesoporous titanium dioxide (mp-TiO<sub>2</sub>) as an electron-transporting layer. However, TiO<sub>2</sub> can reduce the stability of PSCs under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">illumin</span></strong></span></strong>ation (including ultraviolet light). Lanthanum (La)–doped BaSnO<sub>3</sub> (LBSO) perovskite would be an ideal replacement given its electron mobility and electronic structure, but LBSO cannot be synthesized as well-dispersible fine particles or crystallized below 500°C. We report a superoxide colloidal solution route for preparing a LBSO electrode under very mild conditions (below 300°C). The PSCs fabricated with LBSO and methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI<sub>3</sub>) show a steady-state power conversion efficiency of 21.2%, versus 19.7% for a mp-TiO<sub>2</sub> device. The LBSO-based PSCs could retain 93% of their initial performance after 1000 hours of full-Sun <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">illumin</span></strong></span></strong>ation.</p>

Efficient and stable solution-processed planar perovskite solar cells via contact passivation

Tandem Fluorescent Protein Timers for Noninvasive Relative Protein Lifetime Measurement in Plants
<p>Targeted protein degradation is an important and pervasive regulatory mechanism in plants, required for perception and response to the environment as well as developmental signaling. Despite the significance of this process, relatively few studies have assessed plant protein turnover in a quantitative fashion. Tandem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ent protein timers (tFTs) offer a powerful approach for the assessment of in vivo protein turnover in distinct subcellular compartments of single or multiple cells. A tFT is a fusion of two different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ent proteins with distinct fluorophore maturation kinetics, which enable protein age to be estimated from the ratio of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ence intensities of the two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ent proteins. Here, we used short-lived auxin signaling proteins and model N-end rule (N-recognin) pathway reporters to demonstrate the utility of tFTs for studying protein turnover in living plant cells of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. We present transient expression of tFTs as an efficient screen for relative protein lifetime, useful for testing the effects of mutations and different genetic backgrounds on protein stability. This work demonstrates the potential for using stably expressed tFTs to study native protein dynamics with high temporal resolution in response to exogenous or endogenous stimuli.</p>

Selective Elimination of Membrane-Damaged Chloroplasts via Microautophagy
<p>Plant chloroplasts constantly accumulate damage caused by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visibl</span></strong>e wavelengths of light during photosynthesis. Our previous study revealed that entire photodamaged chloroplasts are subjected to vacuolar digestion through an autophagy process termed chlorophagy; however, how this process is induced and executed remained poorly understood. In this study, we monitored intracellular induction of chlorophagy in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves and found that mesophyll cells damaged by high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visibl</span></strong>e light displayed abnormal chloroplasts with a swollen shape and 2.5 times the volume of normal chloroplasts. In wild-type plants, the activation of chlorophagy decreased the number of swollen chloroplasts. In the autophagy-deficient <i>autophagy</i> mutants, the swollen chloroplasts persisted, and dysfunctional chloroplasts that had lost chlorophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ence accumulated in the cytoplasm. Chloroplast swelling and subsequent induction of chlorophagy were suppressed by the application of exogenous mannitol to increase the osmotic pressure outside chloroplasts or by overexpression of VESICLE INDUCING PROTEIN IN PLASTID1, which maintains chloroplast envelope integrity. Microscopic observations of autophagy-related membranes showed that swollen chloroplasts were partly surrounded by autophagosomal structures and were engulfed directly by the tonoplast, as in microautophagy. Our results indicate that an elevation in osmotic potential inside the chloroplast due to high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visibl</span></strong>e light-derived envelope damage results in chloroplast swelling and serves as an induction factor for chlorophagy, and this process mobilizes entire chloroplasts via tonoplast-mediated sequestering to avoid the cytosolic accumulation of dysfunctional chloroplasts.</p>

Light Sheet Microscopy Imaging of Light Absorption and Photosynthesis Distribution in Plant Tissue
<p>In vivo variable chlorophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ence measurements of photosystem II (PSII) quantum yields in optically dense systems are complicated by steep tissue light gradients due to scattering and absorption. Consequently, externally measured effective PSII quantum yields may be composed of signals derived from cells differentially exposed to actinic light, where cells located deeper inside tissues receive lower irradiance than cells closer to the surface and can display distinct photophysiological status. We demonstrate how measured distributions of PSII quantum yields in plant tissue change under natural tissue light gradients as compared with conventionally measured quantum yields with even exposure to actinic light. This was achieved by applying actinic irradiance perpendicular to one side of thallus cross sections of the aquatic macrophyte <i>Fucus vesiculosus</i> with laser light sheets of defined spectral composition, while imaging variable chlorophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ence from cross sections with a microscope-mounted pulse amplitude-modulated imaging system. We show that quantum yields are highly affected by light gradients and that traditional surface-based variable chlorophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ence measurements result in substantial underestimations and/or overestimations, depending on incident actinic irradiance. We present a method for using chlorophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ence profiles in combination with integrating sphere measurements of reflectance and transmittance to calculate depth-resolved photon absorption profiles, which can be used to correct apparent PSII electron transport rates to photons absorbed by PSII. Absorption profiles of the investigated aquatic macrophyte were different in shape from what is typically observed in terrestrial leaves, and based on this finding, we discuss strategies for optimizing photon absorption via modulation of the structural organization of phytoelements according to in situ light environments.</p>

Subcellular Compartmentation of Alternatively Spliced Transcripts Defines <i>SERINE/ARGININE-RICH PROTEIN30</i> Expression<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Alternative splicing (AS) is prevalent in higher eukaryotes, and generation of different AS variants is tightly regulated. Widespread AS occurs in response to altered light conditions and plays a critical role in seedling photomorphogenesis, but despite its frequency and effect on plant development, the functional role of AS remains unknown for most splicing variants. Here, we characterized the light-dependent AS variants of the gene encoding the splicing regulator Ser/Arg-rich protein SR30 in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We demonstrated that the splicing variant <i>SR30.2</i>, which is predominantly produced in darkness, is enriched within the nucleus and strongly depleted from ribosomes. Light-induced AS from a downstream 3′ splice site gives rise to <i>SR30.1</i>, which is exported to the cytosol and translated, coinciding with SR30 protein accumulation upon seedling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">illumin</span></strong></span></strong>ation. Constitutive expression of SR30.1 and SR30.2 fused to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ent proteins revealed their identical subcellular localization in the nucleoplasm and nuclear speckles. Furthermore, expression of either variant shifted splicing of a genomic <i>SR30</i> reporter toward <i>SR30.2</i>, suggesting that an autoregulatory feedback loop affects <i>SR30</i> splicing. We provide evidence that <i>SR30.2</i> can be further spliced and, unlike <i>SR30.2</i>, the resulting cassette exon variant <i>SR30.3</i> is sensitive to nonsense-mediated decay. Our work delivers insight into the complex and compartmentalized RNA processing mechanisms that control the expression of the splicing regulator SR30 in a light-dependent manner.</p>

Light Signaling-Dependent Regulation of Photoinhibition and Photoprotection in Tomato<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Photoreceptor-mediated light signaling plays a critical role in plant growth, development, and stress responses but its contribution to the spatial regulation of photoinhibition and photoprotection within the canopy remains unclear. Here, we show that low-red/far-red (<i>L</i>-<i>R</i>/<i>FR</i>) ratio light conditions significantly alleviate PSII and PSI photoinhibition in the shade leaves of tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) plants. This protection is accompanied by a phytochrome A-dependent induction of LONG HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5). HY5 binds to the promoter of <i>ABA INSENSITIVE</i>5 (<i>ABI5</i>), triggering <i>RESPIRATORY BURST OXIDASE HOMOLOG1</i> (<i>RBOH1</i>)-dependent H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production in the apoplast. Decreased levels of <i>HY5</i>, <i>ABI5</i>, and <i>RBOH1</i> transcripts increased cold-induced photoinhibition and abolished <i>L</i>-<i>R</i>/<i>FR</i>-induced alleviation of photoinhibition. <i>L</i>-<i>R</i>/<i>FR</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">illumin</span></strong></span></strong>ation induced nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) of chlorophyll <i>a</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ence and increased the activities of Foyer-Halliwell-Asada cycle enzymes and cyclic electron flux (CEF) around PSI. In contrast, decreased <i>HY5</i>, <i>ABI5</i>, and <i>RBOH1</i> transcript levels abolished the positive effect of <i>L</i>-<i>R</i>/<i>FR</i> on photoprotection. Loss of <i>PROTON GRADIENT REGULATION5</i>-dependent CEF led to increased photoinhibition and attenuated <i>L</i>-<i>R</i>/<i>FR</i>-dependent NPQ. These data demonstrate that HY5 is an important hub in the cross talk between light and cold response pathways, integrating ABA and reactive oxygen species signaling, leading to the attenuation of photoinhibition by enhanced induction of photoprotection in shade leaves.</p>

Dead or Alive? Using Membrane Failure and Chlorophyll <i>a</i> Fluorescence to Predict Plant Mortality from Drought
<p>Climate models predict widespread increases in both drought intensity and duration in the next decades. Although water deficiency is a significant determinant of plant survival, limited understanding of plant responses to extreme drought impedes forecasts of both forest and crop productivity under increasing aridity. Drought induces a suite of physiological responses; however, we lack an accurate mechanistic description of plant response to lethal drought that would improve predictive understanding of mortality under altered climate conditions. Here, proxies for leaf cellular damage, chlorophyll <i>a</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ence, and electrolyte leakage were directly associated with failure to recover from drought upon rewatering in <i>Brassica</i> <i>rapa</i> (genotype R500) and thus define the exact timing of drought-induced death. We validated our results using a second genotype (imb211) that differs substantially in life history traits. Our study demonstrates that whereas changes in carbon dynamics and water transport are critical indicators of drought stress, they can be unrelated to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visibl</span></strong>e metrics of mortality, i.e. lack of meristematic activity and regrowth. In contrast, membrane failure at the cellular scale is the most proximate cause of death. This hypothesis was corroborated in two gymnosperms (<i>Picea engelmannii</i> and <i>Pinus contorta</i>) that experienced lethal water stress in the field and in laboratory conditions. We suggest that measurement of chlorophyll <i>a</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ence can be used to operationally define plant death arising from drought, and improved plant characterization can enhance surface model predictions of drought mortality and its consequences to ecosystem services at a global scale.</p>

A DII Domain-Based Auxin Reporter Uncovers Low Auxin Signaling during Telophase and Early G1
<p>A sensitive and dynamically responsive auxin signaling reporter based on the DII domain of the INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID28 (IAA28, DII) protein from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) was modified for use in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). The DII domain was fused to a yellow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ent protein and a nuclear localization sequence to simplify quantitative nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ence signal. DII degradation dynamics provide an estimate of input signal into the auxin signaling pathway that is influenced by both auxin accumulation and F-box coreceptor concentration. In maize, the DII-based marker responded rapidly and in a dose-dependent manner to exogenous auxin via proteasome-mediated degradation. Low levels of DII-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ence corresponding to high endogenous auxin signaling occurred near vasculature tissue and the outer layer and glume primordia of spikelet pair meristems and floral meristems, respectively. In addition, high DII levels were observed in cells during telophase and early G1, suggesting that low auxin signaling at these stages may be important for cell cycle progression.</p>

The NDH-1L-PSI Supercomplex Is Important for Efficient Cyclic Electron Transport in Cyanobacteria
<p>Two mutants isolated from a tagging library of <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. strain PCC 6803 were sensitive to high light and had a tag in <i>sll1471</i> encoding CpcG2, a linker protein for photosystem I (PSI)-specific antenna. Both mutants demonstrated strongly impaired NDH-1-dependent cyclic electron transport. Blue native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting and mass spectrometry analyses of the wild type and a mutant containing CpcG2 fused with yellow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ent protein-histidine6 indicated the presence of a novel NDH-1L-CpcG2-PSI supercomplex, which was absent in the <i>cpcG2</i> deletion mutant, the PSI-less mutant, and several other strains deficient in NDH-1L and/or NDH-1M. Coimmunoprecipitation and pull-down analyses on CpcG2-yellow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ent protein-histidine6, using antibody against green <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ent protein and nickel column chromatography, confirmed the association of CpcG2 with the supercomplex. Conversely, the use of antibodies against NdhH or NdhK after blue native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and in coimmunoprecipitation experiments verified the necessity of CpcG2 in stabilizing the supercomplex. Furthermore, deletion of CpcG2 destabilized NDH-1L as well as its degradation product NDH-1M and significantly decreased the number of functional PSI centers, consistent with the involvement of CpcG2 in NDH-1-dependent cyclic electron transport. The CpcG2 deletion, however, had no effect on respiration. Thus, we propose that the formation of an NDH-1L-CpcG2-PSI supercomplex in cyanobacteria facilitates PSI cyclic electron transport via NDH-1L.</p>

Physiological correlates of symbiont migration during bleaching of two octocoral species
<p>Perturbed colonies of <i>Phenganax parrini</i> and <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. exhibit migration of symbionts of <i>Symbiodinium</i> spp. into the stolons. Densitometry and visual inspection indicated that polyps bleached while stolons did not. When migration was triggered by temperature, light and confinement, colonies of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. decreased rates of oxygen formation in the light (due to the effects of perturbation on photosynthesis and respiration) and increased rates of oxygen uptake in the dark (due to the effects of perturbation on respiration alone). Colonies of <i>P. parrini</i>, by contrast, showed no significant changes in either aspect of oxygen metabolism. When migration was triggered by light and confinement, colonies of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. showed decreased rates of oxygen formation in the light and increased rates of oxygen uptake in the dark, while colonies of <i>P. parrini</i> maintained the former and increased the latter. During symbiont migration into their stolons, colonies of both species showed dramatic increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS), as visualized with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ent probe, with stolons of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. exhibiting a nearly immediate increase of ROS. Differences in symbiont type may explain the greater sensitivity of colonies of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. Using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ent probes, direct measurements of migrating symbionts in the stolons of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. showed higher levels of reactive nitrogen species and lower levels of ROS than the surrounding host tissue. As measured by native <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ence, levels of NAD(P)H in the stolons were unaffected by perturbation. Symbiont migration thus correlates with dramatic physiological changes and may serve as a marker for coral condition.</p>

Non-invasive long-term fluorescence live imaging of <i>Tribolium castaneum</i> embryos
<p>Insect development has contributed significantly to our understanding of metazoan development. However, most information has been obtained by analyzing a single species, the fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Embryonic development of the red flour beetle <i>Tribolium castaneum</i> differs fundamentally from that of <i>Drosophila</i> in aspects such as short-germ development, embryonic leg development, extensive extra-embryonic membrane formation and non-involuted head development. Although <i>Tribolium</i> has become the second most important insect model organism, previous live imaging attempts have addressed only specific questions and no long-term live imaging data of <i>Tribolium</i> embryogenesis have been available. By combining light sheet-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ence microscopy with a novel mounting method, we achieved complete, continuous and non-invasive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ence live imaging of <i>Tribolium</i> embryogenesis at high spatiotemporal resolution. The embryos survived the 2-day or longer imaging process, developed into adults and produced fertile progeny. Our data document all morphogenetic processes from the rearrangement of the uniform blastoderm to the onset of regular muscular movement in the same embryo and in four orientations, contributing significantly to the understanding of <i>Tribolium</i> development. Furthermore, we created a comprehensive chronological table of <i>Tribolium</i> embryogenesis, integrating most previous work and providing a reference for future studies. Based on our observations, we provide evidence that serosa window closure and serosa opening, although deferred by more than 1 day, are linked. All our long-term imaging datasets are available as a resource for the community. <i>Tribolium</i> is only the second insect species, after <i>Drosophila</i>, for which non-invasive long-term <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ence live imaging has been achieved.</p>

Interleukin-10 Inhibits Bone Marrow Fibroblast Progenitor Cell–Mediated Cardiac Fibrosis in Pressure-Overloaded Myocardium
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Activated fibroblasts (myofibroblasts) play a critical role in cardiac fibrosis; however, their origin in the diseased heart remains unclear, warranting further investigation. Recent studies suggest the contribution of bone marrow fibroblast progenitor cells (BM-FPCs) in pressure overload–induced cardiac fibrosis. We have previously shown that interleukin-10 (IL10) suppresses pressure overload–induced cardiac fibrosis; however, the role of IL10 in inhibition of BM-FPC–mediated cardiac fibrosis is not known. We hypothesized that IL10 inhibits pressure overload–induced homing of BM-FPCs to the heart and their transdifferentiation to myofibroblasts and thus attenuates cardiac fibrosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Pressure overload was induced in wild-type (WT) and IL10 knockout (IL10KO) mice by transverse aortic constriction. To determine the bone marrow origin, chimeric mice were created with enhanced green <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ent protein WT mice marrow to the IL10KO mice. For mechanistic studies, FPCs were isolated from mouse bone marrow.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Pressure overload enhanced BM-FPC mobilization and homing in IL10KO mice compared with WT mice. Furthermore, WT bone marrow (from enhanced green <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ent protein mice) transplantation in bone marrow–depleted IL10KO mice (IL10KO chimeric mice) reduced transverse aortic constriction–induced BM-FPC mobilization compared with IL10KO mice. Green <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ent protein costaining with α-smooth muscle actin or collagen 1α in left ventricular tissue sections of IL10KO chimeric mice suggests that myofibroblasts were derived from bone marrow after transverse aortic constriction. Finally, WT bone marrow transplantation in IL10KO mice inhibited transverse aortic constriction–induced cardiac fibrosis and improved heart function. At the molecular level, IL10 treatment significantly inhibited transforming growth factor-β–induced transdifferentiation and fibrotic signaling in WT BM-FPCs in vitro. Furthermore, fibrosis-associated microRNA (miRNA) expression was highly upregulated in IL10KO-FPCs compared with WT-FPCs. Polymerase chain reaction–based selective miRNA analysis revealed that transforming growth factor-β–induced enhanced expression of fibrosis-associated miRNAs (miRNA-21, -145, and -208) was significantly inhibited by IL10. Restoration of miRNA-21 levels suppressed the IL10 effects on transforming growth factor-β–induced fibrotic signaling in BM-FPCs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings suggest that IL10 inhibits BM-FPC homing and transdifferentiation to myofibroblasts in pressure-overloaded myocardium.

Inhibition of TOR Represses Nutrient Consumption, Which Improves Greening after Extended Periods of Etiolation
<p>Upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">illumin</span></strong></span></strong>ation, etiolated seedlings experience a transition from heterotrophic to photoautotrophic growth. During this process, the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway provides chlorophyll for photosynthesis. This pathway has to be tightly controlled to prevent the accumulation of photoreactive metabolites and to provide stoichiometric amounts of chlorophyll for its incorporation into photosynthetic protein complexes. Therefore, plants have evolved regulatory mechanisms to synchronize the biosynthesis of chlorophyll and chlorophyll-binding proteins. Two phytochrome-interacting factors (PIF1 and PIF3) and the DELLA proteins, which are controlled by the gibberellin pathway, are key regulators of this process. Here, we show that impairment of TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (TOR) activity in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), either by mutation of the TOR complex component <i>RAPTOR1B</i> or by treatment with TOR inhibitors, leads to a significantly reduced accumulation of the photoreactive chlorophyll precursor protochlorophyllide in darkness but an increased greening rate of etiolated seedlings after exposure to light. Detailed profiling of metabolic, transcriptomic, and physiological parameters revealed that the TOR-repressed lines not only grow slower, they grow in a nutrient-saving mode, which allows them to resist longer periods of low nutrient availability. Our results also indicated that <i>RAPTOR1B</i> acts upstream of the gibberellin-DELLA pathway and its mutation complements the repressed greening phenotype of <i>pif1</i> and <i>pif3</i> after etiolation.</p>

Network Modeling Unravels Mechanisms of Crosstalk between Ethylene and Salicylate Signaling in Potato
<p>To develop novel crop breeding strategies, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms underlying the interaction between plants and their pathogens. Network modeling represents a powerful tool that can unravel properties of complex biological systems. In this study, we aimed to use network modeling to better understand immune signaling in potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>). For this, we first built on a reliable Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) immune signaling model, extending it with the information from diverse publicly available resources. Next, we translated the resulting prior knowledge network (20,012 nodes and 70,091 connections) to potato and superimposed it with an ensemble network inferred from time-resolved transcriptomics data for potato. We used different network modeling approaches to generate specific hypotheses of potato immune signaling mechanisms. An interesting finding was the identification of a string of molecular events <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">illumin</span></strong></span></strong>ating the ethylene pathway modulation of the salicylic acid pathway through Nonexpressor of PR Genes1 gene expression. Functional validations confirmed this modulation, thus supporting the potential of our integrative network modeling approach for unraveling molecular mechanisms in complex systems. In addition, this approach can ultimately result in improved breeding strategies for potato and other sensitive crops.</p>

Identification of ASYNAPTIC4, a Component of the Meiotic Chromosome Axis
<p>During the leptotene stage of prophase I of meiosis, chromatids become organized into a linear looped array via a protein axis that forms along the loop bases. Establishment of the axis is essential for the subsequent synapsis of the homologous chromosome pairs and the progression of recombination to form genetic crossovers. Here, we describe ASYNAPTIC4 (ASY4), a meiotic axis protein in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). ASY4 is a small coiled-coil protein that exhibits limited sequence similarity with the carboxyl-terminal region of the axis protein ASY3. We used enhanced yellow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ent protein-tagged ASY4 to show that ASY4 localizes to the chromosome axis throughout prophase I. Bimolecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ence complementation revealed that ASY4 interacts with ASY1 and ASY3, and yeast two-hybrid analysis confirmed a direct interaction between ASY4 and ASY3. Mutants lacking full-length ASY4 exhibited defective axis formation and were unable to complete synapsis. Although the initiation of recombination appeared to be unaffected in the <i>asy4</i> mutant, the number of crossovers was reduced significantly, and crossovers tended to group in the distal parts of the chromosomes. We conclude that ASY4 is required for normal axis and crossover formation. Furthermore, our data suggest that ASY3/ASY4 are the functional homologs of the mammalian SYCP2/SYCP3 axial components.</p>

Glycolate Induces Redox Tuning Of Photosystem II in Vivo: Study of a Photorespiration Mutant
<p>Bicarbonate removal from the nonheme iron at the acceptor side of photosystem II (PSII) was shown recently to shift the midpoint potential of the primary quinone acceptor Q<sub>A</sub> to a more positive potential and lowers the yield of singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) production. The presence of Q<sub>A</sub><sup>−</sup> results in weaker binding of bicarbonate, suggesting a redox-based regulatory and protective mechanism where loss of bicarbonate or exchange of bicarbonate by other small carboxylic acids may protect PSII against <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> in vivo under photorespiratory conditions. Here, we compared the properties of Q<sub>A</sub> in the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) photorespiration mutant deficient in peroxisomal HYDROXYPYRUVATE REDUCTASE1 (<i>hpr1-1</i>), which accumulates glycolate in leaves, with the wild type. Photosynthetic electron transport was affected in the mutant, and chlorophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ence showed slower electron transport between Q<sub>A</sub> and Q<sub>B</sub> in the mutant. Glycolate induced an increase in the temperature maximum of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thermoluminesc</span></strong>ence emission, indicating a shift of the midpoint potential of Q<sub>A</sub> to a more positive value. The yield of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> production was lowered in thylakoid membranes isolated from <i>hpr1-1</i> compared with the wild type, consistent with a higher potential of Q<sub>A</sub>/Q<sub>A</sub><sup>−</sup>. In addition, electron donation to photosystem I was affected in <i>hpr1-1</i> at higher light intensities, consistent with diminished electron transfer out of PSII. This study indicates that replacement of bicarbonate at the nonheme iron by a small carboxylate anion occurs in plants in vivo. These findings suggested that replacement of the bicarbonate on the nonheme iron by glycolate may represent a regulatory mechanism that protects PSII against photooxidative stress under low-CO<sub>2</sub> conditions.</p>

GS<sup>yellow</sup>, a Multifaceted Tag for Functional Protein Analysis in Monocot and Dicot Plants
<p>The ability to tag proteins has boosted the emergence of generic molecular methods for protein functional analysis. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ent protein tags are used to visualize protein localization, and affinity tags enable the mapping of molecular interactions by, for example, tandem affinity purification or chromatin immunoprecipitation. To apply these widely used molecular techniques on a single transgenic plant line, we developed a multifunctional tandem affinity purification tag, named GS<sup>yellow</sup>, which combines the streptavidin-binding peptide tag with citrine yellow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ent protein. We demonstrated the versatility of the GS<sup>yellow</sup> tag in the dicot Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) using a set of benchmark proteins. For proof of concept in monocots, we assessed the localization and dynamic interaction profile of the leaf growth regulator ANGUSTIFOLIA3 (AN3), fused to the GS<sup>yellow</sup> tag, along the growth zone of the maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) leaf. To further explore the function of ZmAN3, we mapped its DNA-binding landscape in the growth zone of the maize leaf through chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing. Comparison with AN3 target genes mapped in the developing maize tassel or in Arabidopsis cell cultures revealed strong conservation of AN3 target genes between different maize tissues and across monocots and dicots, respectively. In conclusion, the GS<sup>yellow</sup> tag offers a powerful molecular tool for distinct types of protein functional analyses in dicots and monocots. As this approach involves transforming a single construct, it is likely to accelerate both basic and translational plant research.</p>

The Impacts of Phosphorus Deficiency on the Photosynthetic Electron Transport Chain
<p>Phosphorus (P) is an essential macronutrient, and P deficiency limits plant productivity. Recent work showed that P deficiency affects electron transport to photosystem I (PSI), but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here, we present a comprehensive biological model describing how P deficiency disrupts the photosynthetic machinery and the electron transport chain through a series of sequential events in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>). P deficiency reduces the orthophosphate concentration in the chloroplast stroma to levels that inhibit ATP synthase activity. Consequently, protons accumulate in the thylakoids and cause <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lumen</span></strong> acidification, which inhibits linear electron flow. Limited plastoquinol oxidation retards electron transport to the cytochrome <i>b<sub>6</sub>f</i> complex, yet the electron transfer rate of PSI is increased under steady-state growth light and is limited under high-light conditions. Under P deficiency, the enhanced electron flow through PSI increases the levels of NADPH, whereas ATP production remains restricted and, hence, reduces CO<sub>2</sub> fixation. In parallel, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lumen</span></strong> acidification activates the energy-dependent quenching component of the nonphotochemical quenching mechanism and prevents the overexcitation of photosystem II and damage to the leaf tissue. Consequently, plants can be severely affected by P deficiency for weeks without displaying any visual leaf symptoms. All of the processes in the photosynthetic machinery influenced by P deficiency appear to be fully reversible and can be restored in less than 60 min after resupply of orthophosphate to the leaf tissue.</p>

Mitochondria Affect Photosynthetic Electron Transport and Photosensitivity in a Green Alga
<p>Photosynthetic organisms use sunlight as the primary source of energy to support their metabolism. In eukaryotes, reactions responsible of the conversion of light into chemical energy occur in specific organelles, the chloroplasts. In this study, we showed that mitochondria also have a seminal influence on cells’ energy metabolism and on photosynthetic reactions. This is illustrated by the observation that the strong photosensitivity of <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> cells depleted of the chloroplast protein PGRL1 was rescued by the introduction of a mitochondrial mutation affecting respiratory complex I. Functional analysis showed that such a reduced respiratory activity influenced chloroplast electron transport with consequent overreduction of plastoquinone and donor-side limitation of photosystem I (PSI). As a consequence, damage due to excess light affected more photosystem II (PSII) rather than PSI. Double mutant cells are able to grow under excess <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">illumin</span></strong></span></strong>ation, while single <i>pgrl1</i> are not, thanks to the presence of an efficient repair mechanism of PSII. These results also underline the seminal biological relevance of the regulation of electron transport reactions within the photosynthetic complexes. Photosynthetic organisms evolved a strategy to respond to excess light where damage is targeting preferentially to a specific complex, PSII. Cells are able to endure extensive damage targeting this complex thanks to an efficient repair mechanisms, while if PSI is affected, there are drastic consequences on growth.</p>

In Silico Analysis of the Regulation of the Photosynthetic Electron Transport Chain in C3 Plants<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>We present a new simulation model of the reactions in the photosynthetic electron transport chain of C3 species. We show that including recent insights about the regulation of the thylakoid proton motive force, ATP/NADPH balancing mechanisms (cyclic and noncyclic alternative electron transport), and regulation of Rubisco activity leads to emergent behaviors that may affect the operation and regulation of photosynthesis under different dynamic environmental conditions. The model was parameterized with experimental results in the literature, with a focus on Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). A dataset was constructed from multiple sources, including measurements of steady-state and dynamic gas exchange, chlorophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ence, and absorbance spectroscopy under different light intensities and CO<sub>2</sub>, to test predictions of the model under different experimental conditions. Simulations suggested that there are strong interactions between cyclic and noncyclic alternative electron transport and that an excess capacity for alternative electron transport is required to ensure adequate redox state and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lumen</span></strong> pH. Furthermore, the model predicted that, under specific conditions, reduction of ferredoxin by plastoquinol is possible after a rapid increase in light intensity. Further analysis also revealed that the relationship between ATP synthesis and proton motive force was highly regulated by the concentrations of ATP, ADP, and inorganic phosphate, and this facilitated an increase in nonphotochemical quenching and proton motive force under conditions where metabolism was limiting, such as low CO<sub>2</sub>, high light intensity, or combined high CO<sub>2</sub> and high light intensity. The model may be used as an in silico platform for future research on the regulation of photosynthetic electron transport.</p>

Conserved Dynamics of Chloroplast Cytoskeletal FtsZ Proteins Across Photosynthetic Lineages
<p>The cytoskeletal Filamenting temperature-sensitive Z (FtsZ) ring is critical for cell division in bacteria and chloroplast division in photosynthetic eukaryotes. While bacterial FtsZ rings are composed of a single FtsZ, except in the basal glaucophytes, chloroplast division involves two heteropolymer-forming FtsZ isoforms: FtsZ1 and FtsZ2 in the green lineage and FtsZA and FtsZB in red algae. FtsZ1 and FtsZB probably arose by duplication of the more ancestral FtsZ2 and FtsZA, respectively. We expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ent fusions of FtsZ from diverse photosynthetic organisms in a heterologous system to compare their intrinsic assembly and dynamic properties. FtsZ2 and FtsZA filaments were morphologically distinct from FtsZ1 and FtsZB filaments. When coexpressed, FtsZ pairs from plants and algae colocalized, consistent with heteropolymerization. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ence recovery after photobleaching experiments demonstrated that subunit exchange was greater from FtsZ1 and FtsZB filaments than from FtsZ2 and FtsZA filaments and that FtsZ1 and FtsZB increased turnover of FtsZ2 and FtsZA, respectively, from heteropolymers. GTPase activity was essential only for turnover of FtsZ2 and FtsZA filaments. Cyanobacterial and glaucophyte FtsZ properties mostly resembled those of FtsZ2 and FtsZA, though the glaucophyte protein exhibited some hybrid features. Our results demonstrate that the more ancestral FtsZ2 and FtsZA have retained functional attributes of their common FtsZ ancestor, while eukaryotic-specific FtsZ1 and FtsZB acquired new but similar dynamic properties, possibly through convergent evolution. Our findings suggest that the evolution of a second FtsZ that could copolymerize with the more ancestral form to enhance FtsZ-ring dynamics may have been essential for plastid evolution in the green and red photosynthetic lineages.</p>

Abscisic Acid-Induced Reactive Oxygen Species Are Modulated by Flavonols to Control Stomata Aperture
<p>Abscisic acid (ABA) increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) in guard cells to close Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) stomata. In tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>), we find that ABA-increased ROS is followed by stomatal closure and that both responses are blocked by inhibitors of ROS-producing respiratory burst oxidase enzymes. ABA-induced ROS sensor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ence accumulates in the nucleus, chloroplasts, and endomembranes. The accumulation of flavonol antioxidants in guard cells, but not surrounding pavement cells, was visualized by confocal microscopy using a flavonol-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ent dye. Decreased flavonols in guard cells in the <i>anthocyanin reduced</i> (<i>are</i>) mutant and elevated levels in the <i>anthocyanin without</i> (<i>aw</i>) mutant were quantified by confocal microscopy and in leaf extracts by mass spectrometry. Consistent with flavonols acting as antioxidants, higher levels of ROS were detected in guard cells of the tomato <i>are</i> mutant and lower levels were detected in <i>aw</i> both at homeostasis and after treatment with ABA. These results demonstrate the inverse relationship between flavonols and ROS. Guard cells of <i>are</i> show greater ABA-induced closure than the wild type, reduced light-dependent guard cell opening, and reduced water loss, with <i>aw</i> having opposite responses. Ethylene treatment of wild-type tomato plants increased flavonol accumulation in guard cells; however, no flavonol increases were observed in <i>Neverripe</i> (<i>Nr</i>), an ethylene receptor mutant. Consistent with lower levels of ROS due to elevated flavonols, ethylene treatments decreased ABA-induced stomatal closure in the wild type, but not <i>Nr</i>, with ethylene responses attenuated in the <i>are</i> mutant. Together, these results are consistent with flavonols dampening the ABA-dependent ROS burst that drives stomatal closure and facilitating stomatal opening to modulate leaf gas exchange.</p>

A Dynamic Hydro-Mechanical and Biochemical Model of Stomatal Conductance for C<sub>4</sub> Photosynthesis
<p>C<sub>4</sub> plants are major grain (maize [<i>Zea mays</i>] and sorghum [<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>]), sugar (sugarcane [<i>Saccharum officinarum</i>]), and biofuel (<i>Miscanthus</i> spp.) producers and contribute ∼20% to global productivity. Plants lose water through stomatal pores in order to acquire CO<sub>2</sub> (assimilation [<i>A</i>]) and control their carbon-for-water balance by regulating stomatal conductance (<i>g</i><sub>S</sub>). The ability to mechanistically predict <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> and <i>A</i> in response to atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, water availability, and time is critical for simulating stomatal control of plant-atmospheric carbon and water exchange under current, past, or future environmental conditions. Yet, dynamic mechanistic models for <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> are lacking, especially for C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. We developed and coupled a hydromechanical model of stomatal behavior with a biochemical model of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis, calibrated using gas-exchange measurements in maize, and extended the coupled model with time-explicit functions to predict dynamic responses. We demonstrated the wider applicability of the model with three additional C<sub>4</sub> grass species in which interspecific differences in stomatal behavior could be accounted for by fitting a single parameter. The model accurately predicted steady-state responses of <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> to light, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and oxygen, soil drying, and evaporative demand as well as dynamic responses to light intensity. Further analyses suggest that the effect of variable leaf hydraulic conductance is negligible. Based on the model, we derived a set of equations suitable for incorporation in land surface models. Our model <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">illumin</span></strong></span></strong>ates the processes underpinning stomatal control in C<sub>4</sub> plants and suggests that the hydraulic benefits associated with fast stomatal responses of C<sub>4</sub> grasses may have supported the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis.</p>

Unique Motifs and Length of Hairpin in Oleosin Target the Cytosolic Side of Endoplasmic Reticulum and Budding Lipid Droplet
<p>Plant cytosolic lipid droplets (LDs) are covered with a layer of phospholipids and oleosin and were extensively studied before those in mammals and yeast. Oleosin has short amphipathic N- and C-terminal peptides flanking a conserved 72-residue hydrophobic hairpin, which penetrates and stabilizes the LD. Oleosin is synthesized on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and extracts ER-budding LDs to cytosol. To delineate the mechanism of oleosin targeting ER-LD, we have expressed modified-oleosin genes in <i>Physcomitrella patens</i> for transient expression and tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) BY2 cells for stable transformation. The results have identified oleosin motifs for targeting ER-LD and oleosin as the sole molecule responsible for budding-LD entering cytosol. Both the N-terminal and C-terminal peptides are not required for the targeting. The hairpin, including its entire length, initial N-portion residues, and hairpin-loop of three Pro and one Ser residues, as well as the absence of an N-terminal ER-targeting peptide, are necessary for oleosin targeting ER and moving onto budding LDs and extracting them to cytosol. In a reverse approach, eliminations of these necessities allow the modified oleosin to enter the ER <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lumen</span></strong> and extract budding LDs to the ER <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lumen</span></strong>. Modified oleosin with an added vacuole signal peptide transports the ER-luminal LDs to vacuoles. The overall findings define the mechanism of oleosin targeting ER-LDs and extracting budding LDs to the cytosol as well as reveal potential applications.</p>

Monogalactosyldiacylglycerol Facilitates Synthesis of Photoactive Protochlorophyllide in Etioplasts
<p>Cotyledon cells of dark-germinated angiosperms develop etioplasts that are plastids containing unique internal membranes called prolamellar bodies (PLBs). Protochlorophyllide (Pchlide), a precursor of chlorophyll, accumulates in PLBs and forms a ternary complex with NADPH and light-dependent NADPH:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (LPOR), which allows for the rapid formation of chlorophyll after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">illumin</span></strong></span></strong>ation while avoiding photodamage. PLBs are 3D lattice structures formed by the lipid bilayer rich in monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG). Although MGDG was found to be required for the formation and function of the thylakoid membrane in chloroplasts in various plants, the roles of MGDG in PLB formation and etioplast development are largely unknown. To analyze the roles of MGDG in etioplast development, we suppressed <i>MGD1</i> encoding the major isoform of MGDG synthase by using a dexamethasone-inducible artificial microRNA in etiolated Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings. Strong <i>MGD1</i> suppression caused a 36% loss of MGDG in etiolated seedlings, together with a 41% decrease in total Pchlide content. The loss of MGDG perturbed etioplast membrane structures and impaired the formation of the photoactive Pchlide-LPOR-NADPH complex and its oligomerization, without affecting LPOR accumulation. The <i>MGD1</i> suppression also impaired the formation of Pchlide from protoporphyrin IX via multiple enzymatic reactions in etioplast membranes, which suggests that MGDG is required for the membrane-associated processes in the Pchlide biosynthesis pathway. Suppressing <i>MGD1</i> at several germination stages revealed that MGDG biosynthesis at an early germination stage is particularly important for Pchlide accumulation. MGDG biosynthesis may provide a lipid matrix for Pchlide biosynthesis and the formation of Pchlide-LPOR complexes as an initial step of etioplast development.</p>

Flavodiiron Proteins Promote Fast and Transient O<sub>2</sub> Photoreduction in <i>Chlamydomonas</i><xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>During oxygenic photosynthesis, the reducing power generated by light energy conversion is mainly used to reduce carbon dioxide. In bacteria and archae, flavodiiron (Flv) proteins catalyze O<sub>2</sub> or NO reduction, thus protecting cells against oxidative or nitrosative stress. These proteins are found in cyanobacteria, mosses, and microalgae, but have been lost in angiosperms. Here, we used chlorophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ence and oxygen exchange measurement using [<sup>18</sup>O]-labeled O<sub>2</sub> and a membrane inlet mass spectrometer to characterize <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii flvB</i> insertion mutants devoid of both FlvB and FlvA proteins. We show that Flv proteins are involved in a photo-dependent electron flow to oxygen, which drives most of the photosynthetic electron flow during the induction of photosynthesis. As a consequence, the chlorophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ence patterns are strongly affected in <i>flvB</i> mutants during a light transient, showing a lower PSII operating yield and a slower nonphotochemical quenching induction. Photoautotrophic growth of <i>flvB</i> mutants was indistinguishable from the wild type under constant light, but severely impaired under fluctuating light due to PSI photo damage. Remarkably, net photosynthesis of <i>flv</i> mutants was higher than in the wild type during the initial hour of a fluctuating light regime, but this advantage vanished under long-term exposure, and turned into PSI photo damage, thus explaining the marked growth retardation observed in these conditions. We conclude that the <i>C. reinhardtii</i> Flv participates in a Mehler-like reduction of O<sub>2</sub>, which drives a large part of the photosynthetic electron flow during a light transient and is thus critical for growth under fluctuating light regimes.</p>

The DnaJ-Like Zinc-Finger Protein HCF222 Is Required for Thylakoid Membrane Biogenesis in Plants
<p>To understand the biogenesis of the thylakoid membrane in higher plants and to identify auxiliary proteins required to build up this highly complex membrane system, we have characterized the allelic nuclear mutants <i>high chlorophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ence222-1</i> (<i>hcf222-1</i>) and <i>hcf222-2</i> and isolated the causal gene by map-based cloning. In the ethyl methanesulfonate-induced mutant <i>hcf222-1</i>, the accumulation of the cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub><i>f</i> (Cytb6f) complex was reduced to 30% compared with the wild type. Other thylakoid membrane complexes accumulated to normal levels. The T-DNA knockout mutant <i>hcf222-2</i> showed a more severe defect with respect to thylakoid membrane proteins and accumulated only 10% of the Cytb6f complex, accompanied by a reduction in photosystem II, the photosystem II light-harvesting complex, and photosystem I. <i>HCF222</i> encodes a protein of 99 amino acids in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) that has similarities to the cysteine-rich zinc-binding domain of DnaJ chaperones. The insulin precipitation assay demonstrated that HCF222 has disulfide reductase activity in vitro. The protein is conserved in higher plants and bryophytes but absent in algae and cyanobacteria. Confocal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ence microscopy showed that a fraction of HCF222-green <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ent protein was detectable in the endoplasmic reticulum but that it also could be recognized in chloroplasts. A fusion construct of HCF222 containing a plastid transit peptide targets the protein into chloroplasts and was able to complement the mutational defect. These findings indicate that the chloroplast-targeted HCF222 is indispensable for the maturation and/or assembly of the Cytb6f complex and is very likely involved in thiol-disulfide biochemistry at the thylakoid membrane.</p>

Regulatory Phosphorylation of Bacterial-Type PEP Carboxylase by the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-Dependent Protein Kinase RcCDPK1 in Developing Castor Oil Seeds
<p>Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) is a tightly controlled cytosolic enzyme situated at a crucial branch point of central plant metabolism. In developing castor oil seeds (<i>Ricinus communis</i>) a novel, allosterically desensitized 910-kD Class-2 PEPC hetero-octameric complex, arises from a tight interaction between 107-kD plant-type PEPC and 118-kD bacterial-type (BTPC) subunits. The native Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein kinase (CDPK) responsible for in vivo inhibitory phosphorylation of Class-2 PEPC’s BTPC subunit’s at Ser-451 was highly purified from COS and identified as RcCDPK1 (XP_002526815) by mass spectrometry. Heterologously expressed RcCDPK1 catalyzed Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent, inhibitory phosphorylation of BTPC at Ser-451 while exhibiting: (<i>i</i>) a pair of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding sites with identical dissociation constants of 5.03 μM, (<i>ii</i>) a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent electrophoretic mobility shift, and (<i>iii</i>) a marked Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent hydrophobicity. Pull-down experiments established the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent interaction of N-terminal GST-tagged RcCDPK1 with BTPC. RcCDPK1-Cherry localized to the cytosol and nucleus of tobacco <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bright</span></strong> yellow-2 cells, but colocalized with mitochondrial-surface associated BTPC-enhanced yellow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ent protein when both fusion proteins were coexpressed. Deletion analyses demonstrated that although its N-terminal variable domain plays an essential role in optimizing Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent RcCDPK1 autophosphorylation and BTPC transphosphorylation activity, it is not critical for in vitro or in vivo target recognition. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) CPK4 and soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) CDPKβ are RcCDPK1 orthologs that effectively phosphorylated castor BTPC at Ser-451. Overall, the results highlight a potential link between cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and the posttranslational control of respiratory CO<sub>2</sub> refixation and anaplerotic photosynthate partitioning in support of storage oil and protein biosynthesis in developing COS.</p>

The <i>Synechocystis</i> Manganese Exporter Mnx Is Essential for Manganese Homeostasis in Cyanobacteria
<p>The essential micronutrient manganese (Mn) functions as redox-active cofactor in active sites of enzymes and, thus, is involved in various physiological reactions. Moreover, in oxygenic photosynthetic organisms, Mn is of special importance, since it is central to the oxygen-evolving complex in photosystem II. Although Mn is an essential micronutrient, increased amounts are detrimental to the organism; thus, only a small window exists for beneficial concentrations. Accordingly, Mn homeostasis must be carefully maintained. In contrast to the well-studied uptake mechanisms in cyanobacteria, it is largely unknown how Mn is distributed to the different compartments inside the cell. We identified a protein with so far unknown function as a hypothetical Mn transporter in the cyanobacterial model strain <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 and named this protein Mnx for Mn exporter. The knockout mutant Δ<i>mnx</i> showed increased sensitivity toward externally supplied Mn and Mn toxicity symptoms, which could be linked to intracellular Mn accumulation. <sup>54</sup>Mn chase experiments demonstrated that the mutant was not able to release Mn from the internal pool. Microscopic analysis of a Mnx::yellow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ent protein fusion showed that the protein resides in the thylakoid membrane. Heterologous expression of <i>mnx</i> suppressed the Mn-sensitive phenotype of the <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> mutant Δ<i>pmr1</i>. Our results indicate that Mnx functions as a thylakoid Mn transporter and is a key player in maintaining Mn homeostasis in <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803. We propose that Mn export from the cytoplasm into the thylakoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lumen</span></strong> is crucial to prevent toxic cytoplasmic Mn accumulation and to ensure Mn provision to photosystem II.</p>

Correlations between Circadian Rhythms and Growth in Challenging Environments
<p>In plants, the circadian system controls a plethora of processes, many with agronomic importance, such as photosynthesis, photoprotection, stomatal opening, and photoperiodic development, as well as molecular processes, such as gene expression. It has been suggested that modifying circadian rhythms may be a means to manipulate crops to develop improved plants for agriculture. However, there is very little information on how the clock influences the performance of crop plants. We used a noninvasive, high-throughput technique, based on prompt chlorophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ence, to measure circadian rhythms and demonstrated that the technique works in a range of plants. Using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ence, we analyzed circadian rhythms in populations of wild barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i> ssp. <i>spontaneum</i>) from widely different ecogeographical locations in the Southern Levant part of the Fertile Crescent, an area with a high proportion of the total genetic variation of wild barley. Our results show that there is variability for circadian traits in the wild barley lines. We observed that circadian period lengths were correlated with temperature and aspect at the sites of origin of the plants, while the amplitudes of the rhythms were correlated with soil composition. Thus, different environmental parameters may exert selection on circadian rhythms.</p>

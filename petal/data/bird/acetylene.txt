Snap deconvolution: An informatics approach to high-throughput discovery of catalytic reactions
<p>We present an approach to multidimensional high-throughput discovery of catalytic coupling reactions that integrates molecular design with automated analysis and interpretation of mass spectral data. We simultaneously assessed the reactivity of three pools of compounds that shared the same functional groups (halides, boronic acids, alkenes, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alkyn</span></strong>es, among other groups) but carried inactive substituents having specifically designed differences in masses. The substituents were chosen such that the products from any class of reaction in multiple reaction sets would have unique differences in masses, thus allowing simultaneous identification of the products of all transformations in a set of reactants. In this way, we easily distinguished the products of new reactions from noise and known couplings. Using this method, we discovered an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alkyn</span></strong>e hydroallylation and a nickel-catalyzed variant of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alkyn</span></strong>e diarylation.</p>

Direct Evidence of a Dinuclear Copper Intermediate in Cu(I)-Catalyzed Azide-Alkyne Cycloadditions
<sec><title>How Copper Clicks</title><p>The copper-catalyzed coupling of azides and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alkyn</span></strong>es has been termed a “click” reaction on account of its efficiency and versatility, but despite its widespread use, the mechanism remains somewhat unclear. Through a series of kinetic and isotopic labeling studies, <bold>Worrell <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 457, published online 4 April) show that, in the case of terminal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alkyn</span></strong>es (capped at one end by an H atom), two equivalents of copper participate in activating each molecule's reactivity toward azide. Surprisingly, the reaction also appears to proceed through an intermediate in which the two copper centers become equivalent and functionally exchangeable, despite initially coordinating to distinct sites on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alkyn</span></strong>e.</p></sec>

Measles and the canonical path to elimination
<p>All World Health Organization regions have set measles <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elimin</span></strong>ation goals. We find that as countries progress toward these goals, they undergo predictable changes in the size and frequency of measles outbreaks. A country’s position on this “canonical path” is driven by both measles control activities and demographic factors, which combine to change the effective size of the measles-susceptible population, thereby driving the country through theoretically established dynamic regimes. Further, position on the path to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elimin</span></strong>ation provides critical information for guiding vaccination efforts, such as the age profile of susceptibility, that could only otherwise be obtained through costly field studies or sophisticated analysis. Equipped with this information, countries can gain insight into their current and future measles epidemiology and select appropriate strategies to more quickly achieve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elimin</span></strong>ation goals.</p>

Sustained rescue of prefrontal circuit dysfunction by antidepressant-induced spine formation
<p>The neurobiological mechanisms underlying the induction and remission of depressive episodes over time are not well understood. Through repeated longitudinal imaging of medial prefrontal microcircuits in the living brain, we found that prefrontal spinogenesis plays a critical role in sustaining specific antidepressant behavioral effects and maintaining long-term behavioral remission. Depression-related behavior was associated with targeted, branch-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elimin</span></strong>ation of postsynaptic dendritic spines on prefrontal projection neurons. Antidepressant-dose ketamine reversed these effects by selectively rescuing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elimin</span></strong>ated spines and restoring coordinated activity in multicellular ensembles that predict motivated escape behavior. Prefrontal spinogenesis was required for the long-term maintenance of antidepressant effects on motivated escape behavior but not for their initial induction.</p>

Eradication genomics—lessons for parasite control
<p>Large-scale programs are seeking to control or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elimin</span></strong>ate infectious diseases with the greatest impact on global health. Many of these efforts target the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) that disproportionately affect the lives of the poor. Often the aim is to eradicate the causative pathogens. The idea—inspired by the success of smallpox eradication in the 1960s and 1970s—is that a large-scale, but time-limited, effort could <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elimin</span></strong>ate a disease for all successive generations, resulting in an enormous payoff both financially and in improved health. Here, we discuss the value of genomic approaches to support disease eradication efforts, particularly by analogy with how conservation genomics is supporting efforts to prevent extinctions.</p>

UBE2O remodels the proteome during terminal erythroid differentiation
<p>During terminal differentiation, the global protein complement is remodeled, as epitomized by erythrocytes, whose cytosol is ~98% globin. The erythroid proteome undergoes a rapid transition at the reticulocyte stage; however, the mechanisms driving programmed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elimin</span></strong>ation of preexisting cytosolic proteins are unclear. We found that a mutation in the murine <i>Ube2o</i> gene, which encodes a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme induced during erythropoiesis, results in anemia. Proteomic analysis suggested that UBE2O is a broad-spectrum ubiquitinating enzyme that remodels the erythroid proteome. In particular, ribosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elimin</span></strong>ation, a hallmark of reticulocyte differentiation, was defective in <i>Ube2o<sup>−/−</sup></i> mutants. UBE2O recognized ribosomal proteins and other substrates directly, targeting them to proteasomes for degradation. Thus, in reticulocytes, the induction of ubiquitinating factors may drive the transition from a complex to a simple proteome.</p>

A catalytic fluoride-rebound mechanism for C(sp<sup>3</sup>)-CF<sub>3</sub> bond formation
<p>The biological properties of trifluoromethyl compounds have led to their ubiquity in pharmaceuticals, yet their chemical properties have made their preparation a substantial challenge, necessitating innovative chemical solutions. We report the serendipitous discovery of a borane-catalyzed formal C(sp<sup>3</sup>)-CF<sub>3</sub> reductive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elimin</span></strong>ation from Au(III) that accesses these compounds by a distinct mechanism proceeding via fluoride abstraction, migratory insertion, and C-F reductive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elimin</span></strong>ation to achieve a net C-C bond construction. The parent bis(trifluoromethyl)Au(III) complexes tolerate a surprising breadth of synthetic protocols, enabling the synthesis of complex organic derivatives without cleavage of the Au-C bond.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
A Dioxygenase Catalyzes Steroid 16α-Hydroxylation in Steroidal Glycoalkaloid Biosynthesis
<p>Steroidal glycoalkaloids (SGAs) are toxic specialized metabolites that are found in the Solanaceae. Potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>) contains the SGAs α-solanine and α-chaconine, while tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) contains α-tomatine, all of which are biosynthesized from cholesterol. However, although two cytochrome P450 monooxygenases that catalyze the 22- and 26-hydroxylation of cholesterol have been identified, the 16-hydroxylase remains unknown. Feeding with deuterium-labeled cholesterol indicated that the 16α- and 16β-hydrogen atoms of cholesterol were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elimin</span></strong>ated to form α-solanine and α-chaconine in potato, while only the 16α-hydrogen atom was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elimin</span></strong>ated in α-tomatine biosynthesis, suggesting that a single oxidation at C-16 takes place during tomato SGA biosynthesis while a two-step oxidation occurs in potato. Here, we show that a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase, designated as 16DOX, is involved in SGA biosynthesis. We found that the transcript of potato <i>16DOX</i> (<i>St16DOX</i>) was expressed at high levels in the tuber sprouts, where large amounts of SGAs are accumulated. Biochemical analysis of the recombinant St16DOX protein revealed that St16DOX catalyzes the 16α-hydroxylation of hydroxycholesterols and that (22<i>S</i>)-22,26-dihydroxycholesterol was the best substrate among the nine compounds tested. <i>St16DOX</i>-silenced potato plants contained significantly lower levels of SGAs, and a detailed metabolite analysis revealed that they accumulated the glycosides of (22<i>S</i>)-22,26-dihydroxycholesterol. Analysis of the tomato <i>16DOX</i> (<i>Sl16DOX</i>) gene gave essentially the same results. These findings clearly indicate that 16DOX is a steroid 16α-hydroxylase that functions in the SGA biosynthetic pathway. Furthermore, <i>St16DOX</i> silencing did not affect potato tuber yield, indicating that <i>16DOX</i> may be a suitable target for controlling toxic SGA levels in potato.</p>

Cardiovascular Consequences of Childhood Secondhand Tobacco Smoke Exposure: Prevailing Evidence, Burden, and Racial and Socioeconomic Disparities: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although public health programs have led to a substantial decrease in the prevalence of tobacco smoking, the adverse health effects of tobacco smoke exposure are by no means a thing of the past. In the United States, 4 of 10 school-aged children and 1 of 3 adolescents are involuntarily exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke (SHS), with children of minority ethnic backgrounds and those living in low-socioeconomic-status households being disproportionately affected (68% and 43%, respectively). Children are particularly vulnerable, with little control over home and social environment, and lack the understanding, agency, and ability to avoid SHS exposure on their own volition; they also have physiological or behavioral characteristics that render them especially susceptible to effects of SHS. Side-stream smoke (the smoke emanating from the burning end of the cigarette), a major component of SHS, contains a higher concentration of some toxins than mainstream smoke (inhaled by the smoker directly), making SHS potentially as dangerous as or even more dangerous than direct smoking. Compelling animal and human evidence shows that SHS exposure during childhood is detrimental to arterial function and structure, resulting in premature atherosclerosis and its cardiovascular consequences. Childhood SHS exposure is also related to impaired cardiac autonomic function and changes in heart rate variability. In addition, childhood SHS exposure is associated with clustering of cardiometabolic risk factors such as obesity, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance. Individualized interventions to reduce childhood exposure to SHS are shown to be at least modestly effective, as are broader-based policy initiatives such as community smoking bans and increased taxation.</p></sec><sec><title>Purpose:</title><p>The purpose of this statement is to summarize the available evidence on the cardiovascular health consequences of childhood SHS exposure; this will support ongoing efforts to further reduce and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elimin</span></strong>ate SHS exposure in this vulnerable population. This statement reviews relevant data from epidemiological studies, laboratory-based experiments, and controlled behavioral trials concerning SHS and cardiovascular disease risk in children. Information on the effects of SHS exposure on the cardiovascular system in animal and pediatric studies, including vascular disruption and platelet activation, oxidation and inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, increased vascular stiffness, changes in vascular structure, and autonomic dysfunction, is examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The epidemiological, observational, and experimental evidence accumulated to date demonstrates the detrimental cardiovascular consequences of SHS exposure in children.</p></sec><sec><title>Implications:</title><p>Increased awareness of the adverse, lifetime cardiovascular consequences of childhood SHS may facilitate the development of innovative individual, family-centered, and community health interventions to reduce and ideally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elimin</span></strong>ate SHS exposure in the vulnerable pediatric population. This evidence calls for a robust public health policy that embraces zero tolerance of childhood SHS exposure.</p></sec>

A generic interface to reduce the efficiency-stability-cost gap of perovskite solar cells
<p>A major bottleneck delaying the further commercialization of thin-film solar cells based on hybrid organohalide lead perovskites is interface loss in state-of-the-art devices. We present a generic interface architecture that combines solution-processed, reliable, and cost-efficient hole-transporting materials without compromising efficiency, stability, or scalability of perovskite solar cells. Tantalum-doped tungsten oxide (Ta-WO<i><sub>x</sub></i>)/conjugated polymer multilayers offer a surprisingly small interface barrier and form quasi-ohmic contacts universally with various scalable conjugated polymers. In a simple device with regular planar architecture and a self-assembled monolayer, Ta-WO<i><sub>x</sub></i>–doped interface–based perovskite solar cells achieve maximum efficiencies of 21.2% and offer more than 1000 hours of light stability. By <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elimin</span></strong>ating additional ionic dopants, these findings open up the entire class of organics as scalable hole-transporting materials for perovskite solar cells.</p>

The Rydberg constant and proton size from atomic hydrogen

Neutrophils take a round-trip
<p>Inflammation is a body's response to harmful stimuli that aims to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elimin</span></strong>ate the trigger that caused the initial injury and enable tissue repair. Inflammation can be either pathogen-associated or sterile. Sterile inflammation can be triggered by acute conditions, such as trauma, toxin exposure, and ischemia-reperfusion injury, but it is also an important component of life-threatening chronic inflammatory conditions, such as atherosclerosis, cancer, and asbestosis (<i>1</i>). Regardless of etiology, the mechanisms resolving inflammatory responses constitute highly coordinated and active processes that are vital for restoring tissue homeostasis. Although the cellular and molecular signals that drive the initiation of sterile inflammation are well studied (<i>1</i>), we have a relatively poor understanding of the mechanisms through which sterile inflammation is resolved, thus limiting our ability to therapeutically tackle harmful inflammation. On page 111 of this issue, Wang <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) shed light on a provocative aspect of resolution by key orchestrators of the inflammatory process: neutrophils.</p>

The balance between immunity and inflammation
<p>Lungs execute two critical functions that can be at odds with one another: <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elimin</span></strong>ating harmful toxins, particulates, and microbes; and exchanging gas through uninflamed structures—alveoli—to collect oxygen and discharge carbon dioxide. Lungs have a multilayered response to unwanted invaders, offering physical barriers as well as arranging immune cells at airway surfaces. Yet, lungs have the “Goldilocks” challenge of deploying this armory with just the right amount of inflammation. Consequently, lung immunity must be choreographed so that invaders are purged quickly, inflammation tempered, and homeostasis preserved. In this issue, two papers reveal how lung immunity handles these tasks and what happens when things go awry. Shlezinger <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) on page 1037 unveil a clever trick that neutrophils play on inhaled fungal spores to resist life-threatening infections. This may reveal new treatment strategies. On page 1014, Sinclair <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) report metabolic derangements in dendritic cells (DCs) that reprogram the allergic response to inhaled particulates, with implications for asthma.</p>

Elimination of the male reproductive tract in the female embryo is promoted by COUP-TFII in mice
<p>The sexual differentiation paradigm contends that the female pattern of the reproductive system is established by default because the male reproductive tracts (Wolffian ducts) in the female degenerate owing to a lack of androgen. Here, we discovered that female mouse embryos lacking <i>Coup-tfII</i> (chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor II) in the Wolffian duct mesenchyme became intersex—possessing both female and male reproductive tracts. Retention of Wolffian ducts was not caused by ectopic androgen production or action. Instead, enhanced phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling in Wolffian duct epithelium was responsible for the retention of male structures in an androgen-independent manner. We thus suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elimin</span></strong>ation of Wolffian ducts in female embryos is actively promoted by COUP-TFII, which suppresses a mesenchyme-epithelium cross-talk responsible for Wolffian duct maintenance.</p>

UBE2O is a quality control factor for orphans of multiprotein complexes
<p>Many nascent proteins are assembled into multiprotein complexes of defined stoichiometry. Imbalances in the synthesis of individual subunits result in orphans. How orphans are selectively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elimin</span></strong>ated to maintain protein homeostasis is poorly understood. Here, we found that the conserved ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2O directly recognized juxtaposed basic and hydrophobic patches on unassembled proteins to mediate ubiquitination without a separate ubiquitin ligase. In reticulocytes, where UBE2O is highly up-regulated, unassembled α-globin molecules that failed to assemble with β-globin were selectively ubiquitinated by UBE2O. In nonreticulocytes, ribosomal proteins that did not engage nuclear import factors were targets for UBE2O. Thus, UBE2O is a self-contained quality control factor that comprises substrate recognition and ubiquitin transfer activities within a single protein to efficiently target orphans of multiprotein complexes for degradation.</p>

Control of species-dependent cortico-motoneuronal connections underlying manual dexterity

Last, differing <i>PlexA1</i> expression in layer 5 of the motor cortex, which is strong in wild-type mice but weak in humans, may be explained by FEZF2-mediated cis-regulatory elements that are found only in higher primates. Thus, species-dependent regulation of <i>PlexA1</i> expression may have been crucial in the evolution of mammalian CS systems that improved fine motor control in higher primates.</p>

Anti-inflammatory effect of IL-10 mediated by metabolic reprogramming of macrophages
<p>Interleukin 10 (IL-10) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that plays a critical role in the control of immune responses. However, its mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. Here, we show that IL-10 opposes the switch to the metabolic program induced by inflammatory stimuli in macrophages. Specifically, we show that IL-10 inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced glucose uptake and glycolysis and promotes oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, IL-10 suppresses mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity through the induction of an mTOR inhibitor, DDIT4. Consequently, IL-10 promotes mitophagy that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elimin</span></strong>ates dysfunctional mitochondria characterized by low membrane potential and a high level of reactive oxygen species. In the absence of IL-10 signaling, macrophages accumulate damaged mitochondria in a mouse model of colitis and inflammatory bowel disease patients, and this results in dysregulated activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and production of IL-1β.</p>

Senescent intimal foam cells are deleterious at all stages of atherosclerosis

Using transgenic and pharmacological approaches to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elimin</span></strong>ate senescent cells in atherosclerosis-prone low-density lipoprotein receptor–deficient (<i>Ldlr</i><sup>–/–</sup>) mice, we show that these cells are detrimental throughout disease pathogenesis. We find that foamy macrophages with senescence markers accumulate in the subendothelial space at the onset of atherosclerosis, where they drive pathology by increasing expression of key atherogenic and inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. In advanced lesions, senescent cells promote features of plaque instability, including elastic fiber degradation and fibrous cap thinning, by heightening metalloprotease production. Together, these results demonstrate that senescent cells are key drivers of atheroma formation and maturation and suggest that selective clearance of these cells by senolytic agents holds promise for the treatment of atherosclerosis.</p>

Inverse Correlation Between MPSR1 E3 Ubiquitin Ligase and HSP90.1 Balances Cytoplasmic Protein Quality Control
<p>MISFOLDED PROTEIN SENSING RING1 (MPSR1) is a chaperone-independent E3 ubiquitin ligase that participates in protein quality control by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elimin</span></strong>ating misfolded proteins in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Here, we report that in the early stages of proteotoxic stress, cellular levels of MPSR1 increased immediately, whereas levels of HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN90.1 (AtHSP90.1) were unaltered despite massively upregulated transcription. At this stage, the gene-silencing pathway mediated by microRNA 414 (miR414) suppressed AtHSP90.1 translation. By contrast, under prolonged stress, AtHSP90.1 was not suppressed, and instead competed with MPSR1 to act on misfolded proteins, promoting the destruction of MPSR1. Deficiency or excess of MPSR1 significantly abolished or intensified the suppression of AtHSP90.1, respectively. Similar to the <i>MPSR1</i>-overexpressing transgenic plants, the <i>miR414</i>-overexpressing plants showed an increased tolerance to proteotoxic stress as compared to the wild-type plants. Although the functional relationship between MPSR1 and miR414 remains unclear, both MPSR1 and miR414 demonstrated negative modulation of the expression of AtHSP90.1. The inverse correlation between MPSR1 and AtHSP90.1 via miR414 may adjust the set-point of the HSP90-mediated protein quality control process in response to increasing stress intensity in Arabidopsis.</p>

<i>PINOID</i> Is Required for Formation of the Stigma and Style in Rice
<p>The stigma is the entry point for sexual reproduction in plants, but the mechanisms underlying stigma development are largely unknown.

Disruption of the rice <i>PINOID</i> (<i>OsPID</i>) gene completely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elimin</span></strong>ated the development of stigmas, and overexpression of <i>OsPID</i> led to overproliferation of stigmas, suggesting that <i>OsPID</i> is a key determinant for stigma development. Interestingly, <i>ospid</i> mutants did not display defects in flower initiation, nor did they develop any pin-like inflorescences, a characteristic phenotype observed in <i>pid</i> mutants in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). We constructed double mutants of <i>OsPID</i> and its closest homolog, <i>OsPIDb</i>, yet the double mutants still did not develop any pin-like inflorescences, indicating that either <i>ospid</i> is compensated by additional homologous genes or <i>OsPID</i> has different functions in rice compared with <i>PID</i> in other organisms. We then knocked out one of the <i>NAKED PINS IN YUC MUTANTS</i> (<i>NPY</i>) genes, which cause the formation of pin-like inflorescences in Arabidopsis when compromised, in the <i>ospid</i> background. The <i>ospid osnpy2</i> double mutants developed pin-like inflorescences, which were phenotypically similar to <i>pid</i> mutants in Arabidopsis and maize, demonstrating that the roles of <i>OsPID</i> in inflorescence development are likely masked by redundant partners. This work identified a key determinant for stigma development in rice and revealed a complex picture of the <i>PID</i> gene in rice development. Furthermore, the stigma-less <i>ospid</i> mutants are potentially useful in producing hybrid rice.</p>

Visualizing Embolism Propagation in Gas-Injected Leaves
<p>Because the xylem in leaves is thought to be at the greatest risk of cavitation, reliable and efficient methods to characterize leaf xylem vulnerability are of interest. We report a method to generate leaf xylem vulnerability curves (VCs) by gas injection. Using optical light transmission, we visualized embolism propagation in grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) and red oak (<i>Quercus rubra</i>) leaves injected with positive gas pressure. This resulted in a rapid, stepwise reduction of transmitted light, identical to that observed during leaf dehydration, confirming that the optical method detects gas bubbles and provides insights into the air-seeding hypothesis. In red oak, xylem VCs generated using gas injection were similar to those generated using bench dehydration, but indicated 50% loss of conductivity at lower tension (∼0.4 MPa) in grapevine. In determining VC, this method <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elimin</span></strong>ates the need to ascertain xylem tension, thus avoiding potential errors in water potential estimations. It is also much faster (1 h per VC). However, severing the petiole and applying high-pressure gas could affect air-seeding and the generated VC.

MAPINS, a Highly Efficient Detection Method That Identifies Insertional Mutations and Complex DNA Rearrangements
<p>Insertional mutagenesis, in which a piece of exogenous DNA is integrated randomly into the genomic DNA of the recipient cell, is a useful method to generate new mutants with phenotypes of interest. The unicellular green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> is an outstanding model for studying many biological processes. We developed a new computational algorithm, MAPINS (mapping insertions), to efficiently identify insertion sites created by the integration of an <i>APHVIII</i> (<i>aminoglycoside 3′-phosphotransferase VIII</i>) cassette that confers paromomycin resistance. Using whole-genome sequencing data, this method <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elimin</span></strong>ates the need for genomic DNA manipulation and retains all the sequencing information provided by paired-end sequencing. We experimentally verified 38 insertion sites out of 41 sites (93%) identified by MAPINS from 20 paromomycin-resistant strains. Using meiotic analysis of 18 of these strains, we identified insertion sites that completely cosegregate with paromomycin resistance. In six of the seven strains with a mutant phenotype, we demonstrated complete cosegregation of the mutant phenotype and the verified insertion site. In addition, we provide direct evidence of complex rearrangements of genomic DNA in five strains, three of which involve the <i>APHVIII</i> insertion site. We suggest that strains obtained by insertional mutagenesis are more complicated than expected from previous analyses in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>. To map the locations of some complex insertions, we designed 49 molecular markers based on differences identified via whole-genome sequencing between wild-type strains CC-124 and CC-125. Overall, MAPINS provides a low-cost, efficient method to characterize insertional mutants in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>.</p>

The G Protein <i>β</i>-Subunit, AGB1, Interacts with FERONIA in RALF1-Regulated Stomatal Movement
<p>Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding (G) proteins are composed of Gα, G<i>β</i>, and Gγ subunits and function as molecular switches in signal transduction. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), there are one canonical Gα (GPA1), three extra-large Gα (XLG1, XLG2, and XLG3), one G<i>β</i> (AGB1), and three Gγ (AGG1, AGG2, and AGG3) subunits. To elucidate AGB1 molecular signaling, we performed immunoprecipitation using plasma membrane-enriched proteins followed by mass spectrometry to identify the protein interactors of AGB1. After <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elimin</span></strong>ating proteins present in the control immunoprecipitation, commonly identified contaminants, and organellar proteins, a total of 103 candidate AGB1-associated proteins were confidently identified. We identified all of the G protein subunits except XLG1, receptor-like kinases, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling-related proteins, and 14-3-3-like proteins, all of which may couple with or modulate G protein signaling. We confirmed physical interaction between AGB1 and the receptor-like kinase FERONIA (FER) using bimolecular fluorescence complementation. The Rapid Alkalinization Factor (RALF) family of polypeptides have been shown to be ligands of FER. In this study, we demonstrate that RALF1 regulates stomatal apertures and does so in a G protein-dependent manner, inhibiting stomatal opening and promoting stomatal closure in Columbia but not in <i>agb1</i> mutants. We further show that AGGs and XLGs, but not GPA1, participate in RALF1-mediated stomatal signaling. Our results suggest that FER acts as a G protein-coupled receptor for plant heterotrimeric G proteins.</p>

Biochemical and Structural Analysis of Substrate Specificity of a Phenylalanine Ammonia-Lyase
<p>Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) is the first enzyme of the general phenylpropanoid pathway catalyzing the nonoxidative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elimin</span></strong>ation of ammonia from <sc>l</sc>-phenylalanine to give <i>trans</i>-cinnamate. In monocots, PAL also displays tyrosine ammonia lyase (TAL) activity, leading to the formation of <i>p</i>-coumaric acid. The catalytic mechanism and substrate specificity of a major PAL from sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>; SbPAL1), a strategic plant for bioenergy production, were deduced from crystal structures, molecular docking, site-directed mutagenesis, and kinetic and thermodynamic analyses. This first crystal structure of a monocotyledonous PAL displayed a unique conformation in its flexible inner loop of the 4-methylidene-imidazole-5-one (MIO) domain compared with that of dicotyledonous plants. The side chain of histidine-123 in the MIO domain dictated the distance between the catalytic MIO prosthetic group created from <sup>189</sup>Ala-Ser-Gly<sup>191</sup> residues and the bound <sc>l</sc>-phenylalanine and <sc>l</sc>-tyrosine, conferring the deamination reaction through either the Friedel-Crafts or E<sub>2</sub> reaction mechanism. Several recombinant mutant SbPAL1 enzymes were generated via structure-guided mutagenesis, one of which, H123F-SbPAL1, has 6.2 times greater PAL activity without significant TAL activity. Additional PAL isozymes of sorghum were characterized and categorized into three groups. Taken together, this approach identified critical residues and explained substrate preferences among PAL isozymes in sorghum and other monocots, which can serve as the basis for the engineering of plants with enhanced biomass conversion properties, disease resistance, or nutritional quality.</p>

Reduction in Root Secondary Growth as a Strategy for Phosphorus Acquisition
<p>We tested the hypothesis that reduced root secondary growth of dicotyledonous species improves phosphorus acquisition. Functional-structural modeling in SimRoot indicates that, in common bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>), reduced root secondary growth reduces root metabolic costs, increases root length, improves phosphorus capture, and increases shoot biomass in low-phosphorus soil. Observations from the field and greenhouse confirm that, under phosphorus stress, resource allocation is shifted from secondary to primary root growth, genetic variation exists for this response, and reduced secondary growth improves phosphorus capture from low-phosphorus soil. Under low phosphorus in greenhouse mesocosms, genotypes with reduced secondary growth had 39% smaller root cross-sectional area, 60% less root respiration, 27% greater root length, 78% greater shoot phosphorus content, and 68% greater shoot mass than genotypes with advanced secondary growth. In the field under low phosphorus, these genotypes had 43% smaller root cross-sectional area, 32% greater root length, 58% greater shoot phosphorus content, and 80% greater shoot mass than genotypes with advanced secondary growth. Secondary growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elimin</span></strong>ated arbuscular mycorrhizal associations as cortical tissue was destroyed. These results support the hypothesis that reduced root secondary growth is an adaptive response to low phosphorus availability and merits investigation as a potential breeding target.</p>

Turnip Mosaic Virus Counteracts Selective Autophagy of the Viral Silencing Suppressor HCpro<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Autophagy is a conserved intracellular degradation pathway and has emerged as a key mechanism of antiviral immunity in metazoans, including the selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elimin</span></strong>ation of viral components. In turn, some animal viruses are able to escape and modulate autophagy for enhanced pathogenicity. Whether host autophagic responses and viral countermeasures play similar roles in plant-virus interactions is not well understood. Here, we have identified selective autophagy as antiviral pathway during plant infection with turnip mosaic virus (TuMV), a positive-stranded RNA potyvirus. We show that the autophagy cargo receptor NBR1 suppresses viral accumulation by targeting the viral RNA silencing suppressor helper-component proteinase (HCpro), presumably in association with virus-induced RNA granules. Intriguingly, TuMV seems to antagonize NBR1-dependent autophagy during infection by the activity of distinct viral proteins, thereby limiting its antiviral capacity. We also found that NBR1-independent bulk autophagy prevents premature plant death, thus extending the lifespan of virus reservoirs and particle production. Together, our study highlights a conserved role of selective autophagy in antiviral immunity and suggests the evolvement of viral protein functions to inhibit autophagy processes, despite a potential trade-off in host survival.</p>

Unique Motifs and Length of Hairpin in Oleosin Target the Cytosolic Side of Endoplasmic Reticulum and Budding Lipid Droplet
<p>Plant cytosolic lipid droplets (LDs) are covered with a layer of phospholipids and oleosin and were extensively studied before those in mammals and yeast. Oleosin has short amphipathic N- and C-terminal peptides flanking a conserved 72-residue hydrophobic hairpin, which penetrates and stabilizes the LD. Oleosin is synthesized on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and extracts ER-budding LDs to cytosol. To delineate the mechanism of oleosin targeting ER-LD, we have expressed modified-oleosin genes in <i>Physcomitrella patens</i> for transient expression and tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) BY2 cells for stable transformation. The results have identified oleosin motifs for targeting ER-LD and oleosin as the sole molecule responsible for budding-LD entering cytosol. Both the N-terminal and C-terminal peptides are not required for the targeting. The hairpin, including its entire length, initial N-portion residues, and hairpin-loop of three Pro and one Ser residues, as well as the absence of an N-terminal ER-targeting peptide, are necessary for oleosin targeting ER and moving onto budding LDs and extracting them to cytosol. In a reverse approach, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elimin</span></strong>ations of these necessities allow the modified oleosin to enter the ER lumen and extract budding LDs to the ER lumen. Modified oleosin with an added vacuole signal peptide transports the ER-luminal LDs to vacuoles. The overall findings define the mechanism of oleosin targeting ER-LDs and extracting budding LDs to the cytosol as well as reveal potential applications.</p>

Reconstitution of Abscisic Acid Signaling from the Receptor to DNA via bHLH Transcription Factors
<p>The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) confers drought tolerance in plants through stomatal closure and regulation of gene expression. The complex consisting of the ABA receptor PYRABACTIN RESISTANCE/REGULATORY COMPONENTS OF ABA RECEPTOR (PYR/RCAR), type 2C protein phosphatase (PP2C), and SNF1-related protein kinase 2 (SnRK2) has a key role in ABA signaling. Basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcriptional activator ABA-RESPONSIVE KINASE SUBSTRATE1 (AKS1, also known as FBH3) is released from DNA by phosphorylation-induced monomerization in response to ABA in guard cells. Here we reconstituted the release of AKS1 from DNA via the ABA signaling core complex in vitro. We first obtained evidence to confirm that AKS1 is an endogenous substrate for SnRK2s. Phosphorylation of AKS1 and activation of SnRK2 showed the same time course in response to ABA in guard cells. AKS1 was bound to SnRK2.6 in vivo. Three ABA-responsive SnRK2s (SnRK2.2/SRK2D, SnRK2.3/SRK2I, and SnRK2.6/SRK2E/OST1) phosphorylated AKS1 in vitro, and the phosphorylation was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elimin</span></strong>ated by the triple mutation of SnRK2s in plants. We reconstituted the AKS1 phosphorylation in vitro via the signaling complex containing the ABA receptor PYR1, a PP2C, HYPERSENSITIVE TO ABA1 (HAB1), and a protein kinase, SnRK2.6 in response to ABA. We further reconstituted the release of AKS1 from the target gene of <i>POTASSIUM CHANNEL IN ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA 1</i> (<i>KAT1</i>) via the complex in response to ABA. These results demonstrate that AKS1 provides a link between the signaling complex and ABA-responsive genes and furnish evidence for a minimal signaling mechanism from ABA perception to DNA.</p>

Analysis of Arabidopsis Accessions Hypersensitive to a Loss of Chloroplast Translation
<p>Natural accessions of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) differ in their ability to tolerate a loss of chloroplast translation. These differences can be attributed in part to variation in a duplicated nuclear gene (<i>ACC2</i>) that targets homomeric acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACCase) to plastids. This functional redundancy allows limited fatty acid biosynthesis to occur in the absence of heteromeric ACCase, which is encoded in part by the plastid genome. In the presence of functional <i>ACC2</i>, tolerant alleles of several nuclear genes, not yet identified, enhance the growth of seedlings and embryos disrupted in chloroplast translation. <i>ACC2</i> knockout mutants, by contrast, are hypersensitive. Here we describe an expanded search for hypersensitive accessions of Arabidopsis, evaluate whether all of these accessions are defective in <i>ACC2</i>, and characterize genotype-to-phenotype relationships for homomeric ACCase variants identified among 855 accessions with sequenced genomes. Null alleles with <i>ACC2</i> nonsense mutations, frameshift mutations, small deletions, genomic rearrangements, and defects in RNA splicing are included among the most sensitive accessions examined. By contrast, most missense mutations affecting highly conserved residues failed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elimin</span></strong>ate ACC2 function. Several accessions were identified where sensitivity could not be attributed to a defect in either ACC2 or Tic20-IV, the chloroplast membrane channel required for ACC2 uptake. Overall, these results underscore the central role of <i>ACC2</i> in mediating Arabidopsis response to a loss of chloroplast translation, highlight future applications of this system to analyzing chloroplast protein import, and provide valuable insights into the mutational landscape of an important metabolic enzyme that is highly conserved throughout eukaryotes.</p>

Genomic Basis of Adaptive Evolution: The Survival of Amur Ide (<i>Leuciscu</i>s <i>waleckii</i>) in an Extremely Alkaline Environment

The Lake Dali Nur population inhabits one of the most extreme aquatic environments on Earth, with an alkalinity up to 50 mmol/L (pH 9.6), thus providing an exceptional model with which to characterize the mechanisms of genomic evolution underlying adaptation to extreme environments. Here, we developed the reference genome assembly for <i>L. waleckii</i> from Lake Dali Nur. Intriguingly, we identified unusual expanded long terminal repeats (LTRs) with higher nucleotide substitution rates than in many other teleosts, suggesting their more recent insertion into the <i>L. waleckii</i> genome. We also identified expansions in genes encoding egg coat proteins and natriuretic peptide receptors, possibly underlying the adaptation to extreme environmental stress. We further sequenced the genomes of 10 additional individuals from freshwater and 18 from Lake Dali Nur populations, and we detected a total of 7.6 million SNPs from both populations. In a genome scan and comparison of these two populations, we identified a set of genomic regions under selective sweeps that harbor genes involved in ion homoeostasis, acid-base regulation, unfolded protein response, reactive oxygen species <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elimin</span></strong>ation, and urea excretion. Our findings provide comprehensive insight into the genomic mechanisms of teleost fish that underlie their adaptation to extreme alkaline environments.</p>

Heterochronic Meiotic Misexpression in an Interspecific Yeast Hybrid
<p>Regulatory changes rapidly accumulate between species, and interspecific hybrids often misexpress genes. Hybrid misexpression, expression levels outside the range of both parental species, can result from <i>cis-</i> and <i>trans</i>-acting regulatory changes that interact abnormally in hybrids. Thus, misexpressed genes may contribute to hybrid sterility. However, in the context of a whole organism, misexpression may not result directly from <i>cis–trans</i> interactions but rather indirectly from differences between hybrid and parental abundance of cell types. Here we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elimin</span></strong>ate the confounding effects of cell types by examining gene expression in a sterile interspecific yeast hybrid during meiosis. We investigated gene expression of the yeasts <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, <i>S. paradoxus</i>, and their hybrid at multiple meiotic stages. Although the hybrid and parents exhibit similar changes in expression levels across meiosis, the hybrid meiotic program occurs earlier than either parent. The timing change produces a heterochronic pattern of misexpression during midmeiosis. Coincident with the timing of misexpression, we find a transition from predominantly <i>trans</i>-acting to <i>cis-</i>acting expression divergence and an increase in the number of opposing <i>cis–trans</i> changes. However, we find no direct relationship between opposing <i>cis–trans</i> changes and misexpression. Contrary to the notion that <i>cis–trans</i> interactions cause misexpression, a heterochronic shift in the normal meiotic gene expression program produces patterns of misexpression in an yeast hybrid. Our results imply that temporal dynamics of single cell types is important to understanding hybrid misexpression and its relationship to <i>cis–trans</i> interactions.</p>

The Evolution of Genes within Genes and the Control of DNA Replication in Microviruses
<p>Single-stranded DNA(ssDNA) viral life cycles must balance double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and ssDNA biosynthesis. Previously published in vitro results suggest that microvirus C and host cell SSB proteins play antagonistic roles to achieve this balance. To investigate this in vivo, microvirus DNA replication was characterized in cells expressing cloned C or <i>ssb</i> genes, which would presumably alter the C:SSB protein ratios. Representatives of each microvirus clade (φX174, G4, and α3) were used in these studies. α3 DNA replication was significantly more complex. Results suggested that the recognized α3 C gene (C<sub>S</sub>: small) is one of two C genes. A larger 5′ extended gene could be translated from an upstream GTG start codon (C<sub>B</sub>: big). Wild-type α3 acquired resistance to elevated SSB levels by mutations that exclusively frameshifted the C<sub>B</sub> reading frame, whereas mutations in the origin of replication conferred resistance to elevated C protein levels. Expression of either the cloned C<sub>B</sub> or C<sub>S</sub> gene complemented <i>am(C)</i> mutants, demonstrating functional redundancy. When the C<sub>S</sub> start codon was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elimin</span></strong>ated, strains were only viable if an additional amber mutation was placed in gene C and propagated in an informational suppressing host. Thus, C<sub>B</sub> protein likely reaches toxic levels in the absence of C<sub>S</sub> translation. This phenomenon may have driven the evolution of the C<sub>S</sub> gene within the larger C<sub>B</sub> gene and could constitute a unique mechanism of regulation. Furthermore, cross-complementation data suggested that interactions between the α3 C and other viral proteins have evolved enough specificity to biochemically isolate its DNA replication from G4 and φX174.</p>

Building Phylogenetic Trees from Molecular Data with MEGA
<p>Phylogenetic analysis is sometimes regarded as being an intimidating, complex process that requires expertise and years of experience. In fact, it is a fairly straightforward process that can be learned quickly and applied effectively. This Protocol describes the several steps required to produce a phylogenetic tree from molecular data for novices. In the example illustrated here, the program MEGA is used to implement all those steps, thereby <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elimin</span></strong>ating the need to learn several programs, and to deal with multiple file formats from one step to another (Tamura K, Peterson D, Peterson N, Stecher G, Nei M, Kumar S. 2011. MEGA5: molecular evolutionary genetics analysis using maximum likelihood, evolutionary distance, and maximum parsimony methods. <i>Mol Biol Evol</i>. 28:2731–2739). The first step, identification of a set of homologous sequences and downloading those sequences, is implemented by MEGA's own browser built on top of the Google Chrome toolkit. For the second step, alignment of those sequences, MEGA offers two different algorithms: ClustalW and MUSCLE. For the third step, construction of a phylogenetic tree from the aligned sequences, MEGA offers many different methods. Here we illustrate the maximum likelihood method, beginning with MEGA's Models feature, which permits selecting the most suitable substitution model. Finally, MEGA provides a powerful and flexible interface for the final step, actually drawing the tree for publication. Here a step-by-step protocol is presented in sufficient detail to allow a novice to start with a sequence of interest and to build a publication-quality tree illustrating the evolution of an appropriate set of homologs of that sequence. MEGA is available for use on PCs and Macs from <ext-link>www.megasoftware.net</ext-link>.</p>

Recovery of otoacoustic emissions after high-level noise exposure in the American bullfrog
<p>The American bullfrog (<i>Rana catesbeiana</i>) has an amphibian papilla (AP) that senses airborne, low-frequency sound and generates distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) similar to other vertebrate species. Although ranid frogs are typically found in noisy environments, the effects of noise on the AP have not been studied. First, we determined the noise levels that diminished DPOAE at 2<i>f</i><sub>1</sub>–<i>f</i><sub>2</sub> using an <i>f</i><sub>2</sub> stimulus level at 80 dB SPL and that also produced morphological damage of the sensory epithelium. Second, we compared DPOAE (2<i>f</i><sub>1</sub>–<i>f</i><sub>2</sub>) responses with histopathologic changes occurring in bullfrogs after noise exposure. Consistent morphological damage, such as fragmented hair cells and missing bundles, as well as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elimin</span></strong>ation of DPOAE responses were seen only after very high-level (>150 dB SPL) sound exposures. The morphological response of hair cells to noise differed along the mediolateral AP axis: medial hair cells were sensitive to noise and lateral hair cells were relatively insensitive to noise. Renewed or repaired hair cells were not observed until 9 days post-exposure. Following noise exposure, DPOAE responses disappeared within 24 h and then recovered to normal pre-exposure levels within 3–4 days. Our results suggest that DPOAEs in the bullfrog are sensitive to the initial period of hair cell damage. After noise-induced damage, the bullfrog AP has functional recovery mechanisms that do not depend on substantial hair cell regeneration or repair. Thus, the bullfrog auditory system might serve as an interesting model for investigation of ways to prevent noise damage.</p>

A new potassium ion current induced by stimulation of M<sub>2</sub> cholinoreceptors in fish atrial myocytes

The current is elicited in atrial, but not ventricular, cells by application of carbamylcholine (CCh) in moderate to high concentrations (10<sup>−7</sup>–10<sup>−4</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>). It can be distinguished from the classic <i>I</i><sub>KACh</sub>, activated by the βγ-subunit of the G<sub>i</sub>-protein, because of its low sensitivity to Ba<sup>2+</sup> ions and distinct current–voltage relationship with a very small inward current component. Ni<sup>2+</sup> ions (5 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>) and KB-R7943 (10<sup>−5</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>), non-selective blockers of the sodium–calcium exchange current (<i>I</i><sub>NCX</sub>), strongly reduced and completely abolished, respectively, the <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>. Therefore, <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub> was initially regarded as a CCh-induced outward component of the <i>I</i><sub>NCX</sub>. However, the current is not affected by either exclusion of intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> or extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but is completely abolished by intracellular perfusion with K<sup>+</sup>-free solution. Atropine (10<sup>−6</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>), a non-selective muscarinic blocker, completely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elimin</span></strong>ated the <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>.

Pertussis toxin, which irreversibly inhibits G<sub>i</sub>-protein coupled to M<sub>2</sub> receptors, reduced the current by 95%, when applied into the pipette solution.

Gastrointestinal and renal responses to variable water intake in whitebellied sunbirds and New Holland honeyeaters
<p>Nectarivores face a constant challenge in terms of water balance, experiencing water loading or dehydration when switching between food plants or between feeding and fasting. To understand how whitebellied sunbirds and New Holland honeyeaters meet the challenges of varying preformed water load, we used the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elimin</span></strong>ation of intramuscular-injected [<sup>14</sup>C]-<sc>l</sc>-glucose and <sup>3</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O to quantify intestinal and renal water handling on diets varying in sugar concentration. Both sunbirds and honeyeaters showed significant modulation of intestinal water absorption, allowing excess water to be shunted through the intestine when on dilute diets. Despite reducing their fractional water absorption, both species showed linear increases in water flux and fractional body water turnover as water intake increased (both afternoon and morning), suggesting that the modulation of fractional water absorption was not sufficient to completely offset dietary water loads. In both species, glomerular filtration rate was independent of water gain (but was higher for the afternoon), as was renal fractional water reabsorption (measured in the afternoon). During the natural overnight fast, both sunbirds and honeyeaters arrested whole kidney function. Evaporative water loss in sunbirds was variable but correlated with water gain. Both sunbirds and honeyeaters appear to modulate intestinal water absorption as an important component of water regulation to help deal with massive preformed water loads. Shutting down glomerular filtration rate during the overnight fast is another way of saving energy for osmoregulatory function. Birds maintain osmotic balance on diets varying markedly in preformed water load by varying both intestinal water absorption and excretion through the intestine and kidneys.</p>

The impact of lifestyle risk factors on the rate of infection after surgery for a fracture of the ankle
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Lifestyle risk factors are thought to increase the risk of infection   after acute orthopaedic surgery but the evidence is scarce. We aimed   to investigate whether smoking, obesity and alcohol overuse are   risk factors for the development of infections after surgery for   a fracture of the ankle.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We retrospectively reviewed all patients who underwent internal   fixation of a fracture of the ankle between 2008 and 2013. The primary   outcome was the rate of deep infection and the secondary outcome   was any surgical site infection (SSI). Associations with the risk   factors and possible confounding variables were analysed univariably   and multivariably with backwards <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elimin</span></strong>ation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 1043 patients were included; 64 (6.1%) had a deep   infection and 146 (14.0%) had SSI. Obesity was strongly associated   with both outcomes (odds ratio (OR) 2.21, p = 0.017 and OR 1.68,   p = 0.032) in all analyses. Alcohol overuse was similarly associated,   though significant only in unadjusted analyses. Surprisingly, smoking   did not yield statistically significant associations with infections.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These findings suggest that obesity and possibly alcohol overuse   are independent risk factors for the development of infection following   surgery for a fracture of the ankle. This large study brings new   evidence concerning these common risk factors; although prospective   studies are needed to confirm causality.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:225–30.</p></sec>

Hemiarthroplasty proximal femoral endoprostheses following tumour reconstruction
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Dislocation rates are reportedly lower in patients requiring   proximal femoral hemiarthroplasty than for patients undergoing hip   arthroplasty for neoplasia. Without acetabular replacement, pain   due to acetabular wear necessitating revision surgery has been described.   We aimed to determine whether wear of the native acetabulum following   hemiarthroplasty necessitates revision surgery with secondary replacement   of the acetabulum after proximal femoral replacement (PFR) for tumour   reconstruction.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We reviewed 100 consecutive PFRs performed between January 2003   and January 2013 without acetabular resurfacing. The procedure was   undertaken in 74 patients with metastases, for a primary bone tumour   in 20 and for myeloma in six. There were 48 male and 52 female patients,   with a mean age of 61.4 years (19 to 85) and median follow-up of   two years (interquartile range (IQR) 0.5 to 3.7 years). In total,   52 patients presented with a pathological fracture and six presented   with failed fixation of a previously instrumented pathological fracture.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>All patients underwent reconstruction with either a unipolar   (n = 64) or bipolar (n = 36) articulation. There were no dislocations   and no acetabular resurfacings. Articular wear was graded using   the criteria of Baker et al from 0 to 3, where by 0 is normal; grade   1 represents a narrowing of articular cartilage and no bone erosion;   grade 2 represents acetabular bone erosion and early migration;   and grade 3 represents protrusio acetabuli. Of the 49 patients with radiological   follow-up greater than one year, six demonstrated grade 1 acetabular   wear and two demonstrated grade 2 acetabular wear. The remainder   demonstrated no radiographic evidence of wear. Median medial migration was   0.3 mm (IQR -0.2 to 0.7) and superior migration was 0.3 mm (IQR   -0.2 to 0.6). No relationship between unipolar <i>versus</i> bipolar   articulations and wear was evident.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Hemiarthroplasty PFRs for tumour reconstruction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elimin</span></strong>ate joint   instability and, in the short to medium term, do not lead to native   acetabular wear necessitating later acetabular resurfacing.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100B:101–8.</p></sec>

Bmal1 in Perivascular Adipose Tissue Regulates Resting-Phase Blood Pressure Through Transcriptional Regulation of Angiotensinogen
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) surrounding vessels constitutes a distinct functional integral layer of the vasculature required to preserve vascular tone under physiological conditions. However, there is little information on the relationship between PVAT and blood pressure regulation, including its potential contributions to circadian blood pressure variation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using unique brown adipocyte–specific aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like protein 1 (Bmal1) and angiotensinogen knockout mice, we determined the vasoactivity of homogenized PVAT in aortic rings and how brown adipocyte peripheral expression of Bmal1 and angiotensinogen in PVAT regulates the amplitude of diurnal change in blood pressure in mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We uncovered a peripheral clock in PVAT and demonstrated that loss of Bmal1 in PVAT reduces blood pressure in mice during the resting phase, leading to a superdipper phenotype. PVAT extracts from wild-type mice significantly induced contractility of isolated aortic rings in vitro in an endothelium-independent manner. This property was impaired in PVAT from brown adipocyte–selective Bmal1-deficient (BA-Bmal1-KO) mice. The PVAT contractile properties were mediated by local angiotensin II, operating through angiotensin II type 1 receptor–dependent signaling in the isolated vessels and linked to PVAT circadian regulation of angiotensinogen. Indeed, angiotensinogen mRNA and angiotensin II levels in PVAT of BA-Bmal1-KO mice were significantly reduced. Systemic infusion of angiotensin II, in turn, reduced Bmal1 expression in PVAT while <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elimin</span></strong>ating the hypotensive phenotype during the resting phase in BA-Bmal1-KO mice. Angiotensinogen, highly expressed in PVAT, shows circadian expression in PVAT, and selective deletion of angiotensinogen in brown adipocytes recapitulates the phenotype of selective deletion of Bmal1 in brown adipocytes. Furthermore, angiotensinogen is a transcriptional target of Bmal1 in PVAT.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These data indicate that local Bmal1 in PVAT regulates angiotensinogen expression and the ensuing increase in angiotensin II, which acts on smooth muscle cells in the vessel walls to regulate vasoactivity and blood pressure in a circadian fashion during the resting phase. These findings will contribute to a better understanding of the cardiovascular complications of circadian disorders, alterations in the circadian dipping phenotype, and cross-talk between systemic and peripheral regulation of blood pressure.</p></sec>

Prognostic Implications of Magnetic Resonance–Derived Quantification in Asymptomatic Patients With Organic Mitral Regurgitation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an accurate method for the quantitative assessment of organic mitral regurgitation (OMR). The aim of the present study was to compare the discriminative power of MRI quantification and the recommended Doppler echocardiography (ECHO)–derived integrative approach to identify asymptomatic patients with OMR and adverse outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The study population consisted of 258 asymptomatic patients (63±14 years, 60% men) with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (>60%) and chronic moderate and severe OMR (flail 25%, prolapse 75%) defined by using the ECHO-derived integrative approach. All patients underwent MRI to quantify regurgitant volume (RV) of OMR by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subtract</span></strong>ing the aortic forward flow volume from the total left ventricular stroke volume. Severe OMR was defined as RV≥60 mL.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Mean ECHO-derived RV was on average 17.1 mL larger than the MRI-derived RV (<i>P</i><0.05). Concordant grading of OMR severity with both techniques was observed in 197 (76%) individuals with 62 (31%) patients having severe OMR (MRI SEV-ECHO SEV) and 135 (69%) patients having moderate OMR (MRI MOD-ECHO MOD). The remaining 61 (24%) individuals had discordant findings (MRI SEV-ECHO MOD or MRI MOD-ECHO SEV) between the 2 techniques. The majority of these differences in OMR classification were observed in patients with late systolic or multiple jets (both κ<0.2). Patients with eccentric jets showed moderate agreement (κ=0.53; 95% confidence interval, 0.41–0.64). In contrast, a very good agreement (κ=0.90; 95% confidence interval, 0.82–0.98) was observed in a combination of holosystolic, central, and single jet. During a median follow-up of 5.0 years (interquartile range, 3.5–6.0 years), 38 (15%) patients died and 106 (41%) either died or developed indication for mitral valve surgery. In separate Cox regression analyses, the MRI-derived left ventricular end-systolic volume index, RV, and OMR category (severe versus moderate), and the ECHO-derived OMR category were independent predictors of all-cause mortality (all <i>P</i><0.05). The MRI-derived RV showed the largest area under the curve to predict mortality (0.72) or its combination with the development of indication for mitral valve surgery (0.83).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The findings of the present study suggest that the MRI-derived assessment of OMR can better identify patients with severe OMR and adverse outcome than ECHO-derived integrative approach warranting close follow-up and perhaps, early mitral valve surgery.</p></sec>

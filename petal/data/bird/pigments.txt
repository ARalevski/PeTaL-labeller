Distinct Mechanisms of the ORANGE Protein in Controlling Carotenoid Flux
<p>β-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>e adds nutritious value and determines the color of many fruits, including melon (<i>Cucumis melo</i>). In melon mesocarp, β-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>e accumulation is governed by the <i>Orange</i> gene (<i>CmOr</i>) golden single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) through a yet to be discovered mechanism. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), OR increases <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oid levels by posttranscriptionally regulating phytoene synthase (PSY). Here, we identified a <i>CmOr</i> nonsense mutation (<i>Cmor</i>-lowβ) that lowered fruit β-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>e levels with impaired chromoplast biogenesis. <i>Cmor</i>-lowβ exerted a minimal effect on <i>PSY</i> transcripts but dramatically decreased PSY protein levels and enzymatic activity, leading to reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oid metabolic flux and accumulation. However, the golden SNP was discovered to not affect PSY protein levels and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oid metabolic flux in melon fruit, as shown by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oid and immunoblot analyses of selected melon genotypes and by using chemical pathway inhibitors. The high β-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>e accumulation in golden SNP melons was found to be due to a reduced further metabolism of β-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>e. This was revealed by genetic studies with double mutants including <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oid isomerase</i> (<i>yofi</i>), a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oid-isomerase nonsense mutant, which arrests the turnover of prolycopene. The <i>yofi</i> F2 segregants accumulated prolycopene independently of the golden SNP. Moreover, <i>Cmor</i>-lowβ was found to inhibit chromoplast formation and chloroplast disintegration in fruits from 30 d after anthesis until ripening, suggesting that <i>CmOr</i> regulates the chloroplast-to-chromoplast transition. Taken together, our results demonstrate that <i>CmOr</i> is required to achieve PSY protein levels to maintain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oid biosynthesis metabolic flux but that the mechanism of the <i>CmOr</i> golden SNP involves an inhibited metabolism downstream of β-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>e to dramatically affect both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oid content and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> fate.</p>

Unusual Diversity of Myoglobin Genes in the Lungfish
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myoglobin</span></strong> is a respiratory protein that serves as a model system in a variety of biological fields. Its main function is to deliver and store O<sub>2</sub> in the heart and skeletal muscles, but <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myoglobin</span></strong> is also instrumental in homeostasis of nitric oxide (NO) and detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Almost every vertebrate harbors a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myoglobin</span></strong> gene; only some cyprinid fishes have two recently duplicated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myoglobin</span></strong> genes. Here we show that the West African lungfish <i>Protopterus annectens</i> has at least seven distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myoglobin</span></strong> genes (<i>PanMb1–7</i>), which diverged early in the evolution of lungfish and showed an enhanced evolutionary rate. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myoglobin</span></strong>s are lungfish specific, and no other globin gene was found amplified. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myoglobin</span></strong>s are differentially expressed in various lungfish tissues, and the brain is the main site of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myoglobin</span></strong> expression. The typical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myoglobin</span></strong>-containing tissues, the skeletal muscle and the heart, have much lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myoglobin</span></strong> mRNA levels. Muscle and heart express distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myoglobin</span></strong>s (<i>PanMb1</i> and <i>PanMb3</i>, respectively). In cell culture, lungfish <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myoglobin</span></strong>s improved cellular survival under hypoxia albeit with different efficiencies and reduced the production of reactive oxygen species. Only <i>Mb2</i> and <i>Mb6</i> enhanced the energy status of the cells. The unexpected diversity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myoglobin</span></strong> hints to a functional diversification of this gene: some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myoglobin</span></strong>s may have adapted to the O<sub>2</sub> requirements of the specific tissue and help the lungfish to survive hypoxic periods; other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myoglobin</span></strong>s may have taken over the roles of neuroglobin and cytoglobin, which appear to be missing in the West African lungfish.</p>

The Citrus Transcription Factor CsMADS6 Modulates Carotenoid Metabolism by Directly Regulating Carotenogenic Genes
<p>Although remarkable progress has been made toward understanding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oid biosynthesis, the mechanisms that regulate the transcription of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>ogenic genes remain poorly understood. Lycopene β-cyclases (LCYb) are critical enzymes located at the branch point of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oid biosynthetic pathway. Here, we used the promoter sequence of <i>LCYb1</i> as bait in a yeast one-hybrid screen for promoter-binding proteins from sweet orange (<i>Citrus sinensis</i>). This screen identified a MADS transcription factor, CsMADS6, that was coordinately expressed with fruit development and coloration. Acting as a nucleus-localized transcriptional activator, CsMADS6 directly bound the promoter of <i>LCYb1</i> and activated its expression. Overexpression of <i>CsMADS6</i> in citrus calli increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oid contents and induced the expression of <i>LCYb1</i> and other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>ogenic genes, including <i>phytoene synthase</i> (<i>PSY</i>), <i>phytoene desaturase</i> (<i>PDS</i>), and <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oid cleavage dioxygenase1</i> (<i>CCD1</i>). CsMADS6 up-regulated the expression of <i>PSY</i>, <i>PDS</i>, and <i>CCD1</i> by directly binding to their promoters, which suggested the multitargeted regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oid metabolism by CsMADS6. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, the ectopic expression of <i>CsMADS6</i> in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) affected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oid contents and the expression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>ogenic genes. The sepals of <i>CsMADS6</i>-overexpressing tomato lines exhibited dramatic changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oid profiles, accompanied by changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> ultrastructure. Global transcriptome analysis of transgenic sepals revealed that CsMADS6 regulates a series of pathways that promote increases in flux through the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oid pathway. Overall, these findings establish that CsMADS6 directly regulates <i>LCYb1</i> and other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>ogenic genes to coordinately and positively modulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oid metabolism in plants, which may provide strategies to improve the nutritional quality of crops.</p>

Efficient Plastid Transformation in Arabidopsis
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> transformation is routine in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) but 100-fold less frequent in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), preventing its use in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> biology. A recent study revealed that null mutations in <i>ACC2</i>, encoding a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>-targeted acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase, cause hypersensitivity to spectinomycin. We hypothesized that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> transformation efficiency should increase in the <i>acc2</i> background, because when ACC2 is absent, fatty acid biosynthesis becomes dependent on translation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>-encoded ACC β-carboxylase subunit. We bombarded <i>ACC2</i>-defective Arabidopsis leaves with a vector carrying a selectable spectinomycin resistance (<i>aadA</i>) gene and <i>gfp</i>, encoding the green fluorescence protein GFP. Spectinomycin-resistant clones were identified as green cell clusters on a spectinomycin medium. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> transformation was confirmed by GFP accumulation from the second open reading frame of a polycistronic messenger RNA, which would not be translated in the cytoplasm. We obtained one to two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> transformation events per bombarded sample in spectinomycin-hypersensitive Slavice and Columbia <i>acc2</i> knockout backgrounds, an approximately 100-fold enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> transformation frequency. Slavice and Columbia are accessions in which plant regeneration is uncharacterized or difficult to obtain. A practical system for Arabidopsis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> transformation will be obtained by creating an <i>ACC2</i> null background in a regenerable Arabidopsis accession. The recognition that the duplicated ACCase in Arabidopsis is an impediment to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> transformation provides a rational template to implement <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> transformation in related recalcitrant crops.</p>

Paralogs of the C-Terminal Domain of the Cyanobacterial Orange Carotenoid Protein Are Carotenoid Donors to Helical Carotenoid Proteins
<p>The photoactive Orange <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oid Protein (OCP) photoprotects cyanobacteria cells by quenching singlet oxygen and excess excitation energy. Its N-terminal domain is the active part of the protein, and the C-terminal domain regulates the activity. Recently, the characteristics of a family of soluble <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oid-binding proteins (Helical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oid Proteins [HCPs]), paralogs of the N-terminal domain of OCP, were described. Bioinformatics studies also revealed the existence of genes coding for homologs of CTD. Here, we show that the latter genes encode <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oid proteins (CTDHs). This family of proteins contains two subgroups with distinct characteristics. One CTDH of each clade was further characterized, and they proved to be very good singlet oxygen quenchers. When synthesized in <i>Escherichia coli</i> or <i>Synechocystis</i> PCC 6803, CTDHs formed dimers that share a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oid molecule and are able to transfer their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oid to apo-HCPs and apo-OCP. The CTDHs from clade 2 have a cysteine in position 103. A disulfide bond is easily formed between the monomers of the dimer preventing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oid transfer. This suggests that the transfer of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oid could be redox regulated in clade 2 CTDH. We also demonstrate here that apo-OCPs and apo-CTDHs are able to take the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oid directly from membranes, while HCPs are unable to do so. HCPs need the presence of CTDH to become holo-proteins. We propose that, in cyanobacteria, the CTDHs are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oid donors to HCPs.</p>

The Non-Mendelian Green Cotyledon Gene in Soybean Encodes a Small Subunit of Photosystem II
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l degradation plays important roles in leaf senescence including regulation of degradation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l-binding proteins. Although most genes encoding enzymes of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l degradation pathway have been identified, the regulation of their activity has not been fully understood. Green cotyledon mutants in legume are stay-green mutants, in which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l degradation is impaired during leaf senescence and seed maturation. Among them, the soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) green cotyledon gene <i>cytG</i> is unique because it is maternally inherited. To isolate <i>cytG</i>, we extensively sequenced the soybean chloroplast genome, and detected a 5-bp insertion causing a frame-shift in <i>psbM</i>, which encodes one of the small subunits of photosystem II. Mutant tobacco plants (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) with a disrupted <i>psbM</i> generated using a chloroplast transformation technique had green senescent leaves, confirming that <i>cytG</i> encodes PsbM. The phenotype of <i>cytG</i> was very similar to that of mutant of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l <i>b</i> reductase catalyzing the first step of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l <i>b</i> degradation. In fact, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l <i>b</i>-degrading activity in dark-grown <i>cytG</i> and <i>psbM</i>-knockout seedlings was significantly lower than that of wild-type plants. Our results suggest that PsbM is a unique protein l<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ink</span></strong>ing photosynthesis in presenescent leaves with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l degradation during leaf senescence and seed maturation. Additionally, we discuss the origin of <i>cytG</i>, which may have been selected during domestication of soybean.</p>

Importance of Translocon Subunit Tic56 for rRNA Processing and Chloroplast Ribosome Assembly
<p>Toc159-containing complexes at the outer chloroplast envelope membrane form stable supercomplexes with a 1-MD translocon at the inner chloroplast envelope membrane of which Tic56 is one essential subunit. While the single mutants <i>tic56-1</i> and <i>ppi2</i> (<i>toc159</i>) have an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">albin</span></strong>o phenotype and are able to grow heterotrophically, we find the double mutant to be embryo lethal. Comprehensive quantitative proteome profiling with both single mutants in combination with GeneChip analyses identified a posttranscriptional defect in the accumulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> ribosomal proteins and diminished expression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> encoded proteins. In the <i>tic56-1</i> mutant, the assembly of functional ribosomes is furthermore hampered by a processing defect of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> 23S rRNA. Spectinomycin-treatment of wild-type plants phenocopies the molecular phenotype of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> proteome accumulation in <i>tic56-1</i> and to a smaller degree also <i>ppi2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s, suggesting that a defect in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> translation is largely responsible for the phenotype of both import mutants. Import experiments with the <i>tic56-3</i> mutant revealed no significant defect in the import of small ribosomal protein 16 in the absence of full-length Tic56, suggesting that the defect in ribosome assembly in <i>tic56-1</i> may be independent of a function of Tic56 in protein import. Our data establish a previously unknown l<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ink</span></strong> between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> protein import, the processing of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> rRNAs, and the assembly of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> ribosomes and provide further knowledge on the function of the translocon components and the molecular basis for their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">albin</span></strong>o phenotype.</p>

Differential effects of vitamins E and C and carotenoids on growth, resistance to oxidative stress, fledging success and plumage colouration in wild great tits
<p>Oxidative stress is the imbalance between the production of reactive species and antioxidants, which causes damage to lipids, proteins and DNA. Antioxidants, like vitamins and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oids, can limit oxidative damage and can therefore regulate the trade-off between growth, which is a period of high reactive species production, and self-maintenance. However, the role of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oids as antioxidants <i>in vivo</i> has been debated, and it has been suggested that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oid-based signals indicate the availability of non-pigmentary antioxidants (e.g. vitamins) that protect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oids from oxidation, known as the ‘protection hypothesis’. To evaluate the importance of vitamins versus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oids as antioxidants during growth and to test the protection hypothesis, we supplemented nestling great tits, <i>Parus major</i>, 3, 5 and 7 days after hatching with a single dose of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oids and/or vitamins in a 2×2 full-factorial design. We subsequently measured body condition, antioxidant capacity, oxidative damage, fledging success and plumage reflectance. Vitamins enhanced antioxidant capacity, but did not affect oxidative damage. Vitamin-treated nestlings had higher growth rates and higher probability of fledging. In contrast, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oids did not affect any of these traits. Furthermore, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oid-based colouration increased over the breeding season in nestlings that received vitamins only. This study shows that vitamins are limiting for growth rate and fledging success, and suggests that vitamins could regulate the trade-off between growth and self-maintenance in favour of the former. Moreover, our results are consistent with the idea that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oids are minor antioxidants in birds, but they do not support the protection hypothesis.</p>

Specialized Plastids Trigger Tissue-Specific Signaling for Systemic Stress Response in Plants
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s comprise a complex set of organelles in plants that can undergo distinctive patterns of differentiation and redifferentiation during their lifespan. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s localized to the epidermis and vascular parenchyma are distinctive in size, structural features, and functions. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s are termed “sensory” <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s, and here we show their proteome to be distinct from chloroplasts, with specialized stress-associated features. The distinctive sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> proteome in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) derives from spatiotemporal regulation of nuclear genes encoding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>-targeted proteins. Perturbation caused by depletion of the sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>-specific protein MutS HOMOLOG1 conditioned local, programmed changes in gene networks controlling chromatin, stress-related phytohormone, and circadian clock behavior and producing a global, systemic stress response in the plant.

Mechanism of Dual Targeting of the Phytochrome Signaling Component HEMERA/pTAC12 to Plastids and the Nucleus
<p>HEMERA (HMR) is a nuclear and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>ial dual-targeted protein. While it functions in the nucleus as a transcriptional coactivator in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phytochrom</span></strong>e signaling to regulate a distinct set of light-responsive, growth-relevant genes, in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s it is known as pTAC12, which associates with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>-encoded RNA polymerase, and is essential for inducing the plastomic photosynthetic genes and initiating chloroplast biogenesis. However, the mechanism of targeting HMR to the nucleus and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s is still poorly understood. Here, we show that HMR can be directly imported into chloroplasts through a transit peptide residing in the N-terminal 50 amino acids. Upon cleavage of the transit peptide and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional proteolytic processing, mature HMR, which begins from Lys-58, retains its biochemical properties in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phytochrom</span></strong>e signaling. Unexpectedly, expression of mature HMR failed to rescue not only the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>ial but also the nuclear defects of the <i>hmr</i> mutant. This is because the predicted nuclear localization signals of HMR are nonfunctional, and therefore mature HMR is unable to accumulate in either <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s or the nucleus. Surprisingly, fusing the transit peptide of the small subunit of Rubisco with mature HMR rescues both its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>ial and nuclear localization and functions. These results, combined with the observation that the nuclear form of HMR has the same reduced molecular mass as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>ial HMR, support a retrograde protein translocation mechanism in which HMR is targeted first to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s, processed to the mature form, and then relocated to the nucleus.</p>

The Plastid Genome of <i>Polytoma uvella</i> Is the Largest Known among Colorless Algae and Plants and Reflects Contrasting Evolutionary Paths to Nonphotosynthetic Lifestyles
<p>The loss of photosynthesis is frequently associated with parasitic or pathogenic lifestyles, but it also can occur in free-living, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>-bearing lineages. A common consequence of becoming nonphotosynthetic is the reduction in size and gene content of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> genome. In exceptional circumstances, it can even result in the complete loss of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> DNA (ptDNA) and its associated gene expression system, as reported recently in several lineages, including the nonphotosynthetic green algal genus <i>Polytomella</i>. Closely related to <i>Polytomella</i> is the polyphyletic genus <i>Polytoma</i>, the members of which lost photosynthesis independently of <i>Polytomella</i>. Species from both genera are free-living organisms that contain nonphotosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s, but unlike <i>Polytomella</i>, <i>Polytoma</i> members have retained a genome in their colorless <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>. Here, we present the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> genome of <i>Polytoma uvella</i>: to our knowledge, the first report of ptDNA from a nonphotosynthetic chlamydomonadalean alga. The <i>P. uvella</i> ptDNA contains 25 protein-coding genes, most of which are related to gene expression and none are connected to photosynthesis. However, despite its reduced coding capacity, the <i>P. uvella</i> ptDNA is inflated with short repeats and is tens of kilobases larger than the ptDNAs of its closest known photosynthetic relatives, <i>Chlamydomonas leiostraca</i> and <i>Chlamydomonas applanata</i>. In fact, at approximately 230 kb, the ptDNA of <i>P. uvella</i> represents the largest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> genome currently reported from a nonphotosynthetic alga or plant. Overall, the <i>P. uvella</i> and <i>Polytomella</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> genomes reveal two very different evolutionary paths following the loss of photosynthesis: expansion and complete deletion, respectively. We hypothesize that recombination-based DNA-repair mechanisms are at least partially responsible for the different evolutionary outcomes observed in such closely related nonphotosynthetic algae.</p>

SEED CAROTENOID DEFICIENT Functions in Isoprenoid Biosynthesis via the Plastid MEP Pathway
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> isoprenoids, a diverse group of compounds that includes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oids, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>ls, tocopherols, and multiple hormones, are essential for plant growth and development. Here, we identified and characterized <i>SEED <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>OID DEFICIENT</i> (<i>SCD</i>), which encodes an enzyme that functions in the biosynthesis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> isoprenoids in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). SCD converts 2<i>C</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-erytrithol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate to 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl 4-diphosphate in the penultimate step of the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway. In <i>scd</i> mutants, plant growth and development are impaired and the levels of MEP-derived isoprenoids, such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oids, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>ls, and tocopherols, as well as abscisic and gibberellic acids, are reduced in leaves and seeds. This <i>scd</i> metabolic alteration varies among plant tissues and under different light conditions. RNA-sequencing of the <i>scd</i> mutant and wild type identified a limited number of differentially expressed genes in the MEP pathway, although isoprenoid levels were significantly reduced in <i>scd</i> seeds and dark-grown leaves. Furthermore, <i>SCD</i>-overexpressing transgenic lines showed little or no differences in isoprenoid levels, indicating that SCD may be subject to posttranslational regulation or not represent a rate-limiting step in the MEP pathway. These results enhance our understanding of the transcriptomic and metabolic regulatory roles of enzymes in the MEP pathway and of their effects on downstream isoprenoid pathways in various plant tissues and under different light conditions.</p>

LIL3, a Light-Harvesting Complex Protein, Links Terpenoid and Tetrapyrrole Biosynthesis in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>The LIL3 protein of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) belongs to the light-harvesting complex (LHC) protein family, which also includes the light-harvesting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l-binding proteins of photosystems I and II, the early-light-inducible proteins, PsbS involved in nonphotochemical quenching, and the one-helix proteins and their cyanobacterial homologs designated high-light-inducible proteins. Each member of this family is characterized by one or two LHC transmembrane domains (referred to as the LHC motif) to which potential functions such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l binding, protein interaction, and integration of interacting partners into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> membranes have been attributed. Initially, LIL3 was shown to interact with geranylgeranyl reductase (CHLP), an enzyme of terpene biosynthesis that supplies the hydrocarbon chain for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l and tocopherol. Here, we show another function of LIL3 for the stability of proto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>lide oxidoreductase (POR). Multiple protein-protein interaction analyses suggest the direct physical interaction of LIL3 with POR but not with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l synthase. Consistently, LIL3-deficient plants exhibit substantial loss of POR as well as CHLP, which is not due to defective transcription of the POR and CHLP genes but to the posttranslational modification of their protein products. Interestingly, in vitro biochemical analyses provide novel evidence that LIL3 shows high binding affinity to proto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>lide, the substrate of POR. Taken together, this study suggests a critical role for LIL3 in the organization of later steps in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l biosynthesis. We suggest that LIL3 associates with POR and CHLP and thus contributes to the supply of the two metabolites, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>lide and phytyl pyrophosphate, required for the final step in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l <i>a</i> synthesis.</p>

Photochemistry beyond the red limit in chlorophyll f–containing photosystems
<p>Photosystems I and II convert solar energy into the chemical energy that powers life. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l a photochemistry, using red light (680 to 700 nm), is near universal and is considered to define the energy “red limit” of oxygenic photosynthesis. We present biophysical studies on the photosystems from a cyanobacterium grown in far-red light (750 nm). The few long-wavelength <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>ls present are well resolved from each other and from the majority pigment, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l a.

Each photosystem has a few even longer-wavelength <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>ls f that collect light and pass excitation energy uphill to the photochemically active pigments. These photosystems function beyond the red limit using far-red pigments in only a few key positions.</p>

Inhibition of TOR Represses Nutrient Consumption, Which Improves Greening after Extended Periods of Etiolation
<p>Upon illumination, etiolated seedlings experience a transition from heterotrophic to photoautotrophic growth. During this process, the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway provides <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l for photosynthesis. This pathway has to be tightly controlled to prevent the accumulation of photoreactive metabolites and to provide stoichiometric amounts of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l for its incorporation into photosynthetic protein complexes. Therefore, plants have evolved regulatory mechanisms to synchronize the biosynthesis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l-binding proteins. Two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phytochrom</span></strong>e-interacting factors (PIF1 and PIF3) and the DELLA proteins, which are controlled by the gibberellin pathway, are key regulators of this process. Here, we show that impairment of TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (TOR) activity in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), either by mutation of the TOR complex component <i>RAPTOR1B</i> or by treatment with TOR inhibitors, leads to a significantly reduced accumulation of the photoreactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l precursor proto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>lide in darkness but an increased greening rate of etiolated seedlings after exposure to light. Detailed profiling of metabolic, transcriptomic, and physiological parameters revealed that the TOR-repressed lines not only grow slower, they grow in a nutrient-saving mode, which allows them to resist longer periods of low nutrient availability. Our results also indicated that <i>RAPTOR1B</i> acts upstream of the gibberellin-DELLA pathway and its mutation complements the repressed greening phenotype of <i>pif1</i> and <i>pif3</i> after etiolation.</p>

The Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein SOT5/EMB2279 Is Required for Plastid <i>rpl2</i> and <i>trnK</i> Intron Splicing
<p>Chloroplast biogenesis and development are highly complex processes requiring interaction between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> and nuclear genomic products. Using a high-throughput screen for chloroplast biogenesis suppressors in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), we identified a <i>suppressor of thf1</i> (<i>sot5</i>) that displays virescent and serrated leaves. Further characterization revealed that <i>sot5</i> mutants are defective in leaf adaxial and abaxial polarity and act as enhancers of <i>asymmetric leaves2</i>. Map-based cloning identified <i>SOT5</i> as a gene previously named <i>EMB2279</i> that encodes a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>-targeted pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein with 11 PPR motifs. A G-to-A mutation in <i>sot5</i> leads to a significant decrease in splicing efficiency, generating two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional mRNA variants. As reported previously, the <i>sot5</i> null mutation is embryo lethal. SOT5 is predicted to bind to specific RNA sequences found in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> <i>rpl2</i> and <i>trnK</i> genes, and we found decreased splicing efficiency of the <i>rpl2</i> and <i>trnK</i> genes in <i>sot5</i> mutants. Together, our results reveal that the PPR protein SOT5/EMB2279 is required for intron splicing of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> <i>rpl2</i> and <i>trnK</i>, providing insights into the role of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> translation in the coupled development between chloroplasts and leaves.</p>

A Light Harvesting Complex-Like Protein in Maintenance of Photosynthetic Components in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>
<p>Using a genetic approach, we have identified and characterized a novel protein, named Msf1 (Maintenance factor for photosystem I), that is required for the maintenance of specific components of the photosynthetic apparatus in the green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>. Msf1 belongs to the superfamily of light-harvesting complex proteins with three transmembrane domains and consensus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l-binding sites. Loss of Msf1 leads to reduced accumulation of photosystem I and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l-binding proteins/complexes. Msf1is a component of a thylakoid complex containing key enzymes of the tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway, thus revealing a possible l<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ink</span></strong> between Msf1 and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l biosynthesis. Protein interaction assays and greening experiments demonstrate that Msf1 interacts with Copper target homolog1 (CHL27B) and accumulates concomitantly with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>, implying that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l stabilizes Msf1. Contrary to other light-harvesting complex-like genes, the expression of <i>Msf1</i> is not stimulated by high-light stress, but its protein level increases significantly under heat shock, iron and copper limitation, as well as in stationary cells. Based on these results, we propose that Msf1 is required for the maintenance of photosystem I and specific protein-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l complexes especially under certain stress conditions.</p>

An Organelle RNA Recognition Motif Protein Is Required for Photosystem II Subunit <i>psbF</i> Transcript Editing
<p>Loss-of-function mutations in ORGANELLE RNA RECOGNITION MOTIF PROTEIN6 (ORRM6) result in the near absence of RNA editing of <i>psbF</i>-C77 and the reduction in <i>accD</i>-C794 editing in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The <i>orrm6</i> mutants have decreased levels of photosystem II (PSII) proteins, especially PsbF, lower PSII activity, pale green pigmentation, smaller leaf and plant sizes, and retarded growth. Stable expression of <i>ORRM6</i> rescues the <i>orrm6</i> editing defects and mutant phenotype. Unlike ORRM1, the other known ORRM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> editing factor, ORRM6, does not contain RNA editing interacting protein/multiple organellar RNA editing factor (RIP/MORF) boxes, which are required for ORRM1 to interact with site-specific pentatricopeptide repeat protein editing factors. ORRM6 interacts with RIP1/MORF8, RIP2/MORF2, and RIP9/MORF9, known components of RNA editosomes. While some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> RRM proteins are involved in other forms of RNA processing and translation, the primary function of ORRM6 is evidently to mediate <i>psbF</i>-C77 editing, like the essential site-specific pentatricopeptide repeat protein LOW PSII ACCUMULATION66. Stable expression in the <i>orrm6</i> mutants of a nucleus-encoded, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>-targeted PsbF protein from a <i>psbF</i> gene carrying a T at nucleotide 77 significantly increases leaf and plant sizes, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l content, and PSII activity. These transformants demonstrate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> RNA editing can be bypassed through the expression of nucleus-encoded, edited forms of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> genes.</p>

The Formation and Sequestration of Nonendogenous Ketocarotenoids in Transgenic <i>Nicotiana glauca</i>
<p>Ketolated and hydroxylated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oids are high-value compounds with industrial, food, and feed applications. Chemical synthesis is currently the production method of choice for these compounds, with no amenable plant sources readily available. In this study, the 4,4′ β-oxygenase (<i>crtW</i>) and 3,3′ β-hydroxylase (c<i>rtZ</i>) genes from <i>Brevundimonas</i> sp. SD-212 were expressed under constitutive transcriptional control in <i>Nicotiana glauca</i>, which has an emerging potential as a biofuel and biorefining feedstock. The transgenic lines produced significant levels of nonendogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oids in all tissues. In leaf and flower, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oids (∼0.5% dry weight) included 0.3% and 0.48%, respectively, of nonendogenous ketolated and hydroxylated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oids. These were 4-ketolutein, echinenone (and its 3-hydroxy derivatives), canthaxanthin, phoenicoxanthin, 4-ketozeaxanthin, and astaxanthin. Stable, homozygous genotypes expressing both transgenes inherited the chemotype. Subcellular fractionation of vegetative tissues and microscopic analysis revealed the presence of keto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oids in thylakoid membranes, not predominantly in the photosynthetic complexes but in plastoglobules. Despite keto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oid production and changes in cellular ultrastructure, intermediary metabolite levels were not dramatically affected. The study illustrates the utility of <i>Brevundimonas</i> sp. SD-212 CRTZ and CRTW to produce keto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oids in a plant species that is being evaluated as a biorefining feedstock, the adaptation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> to sequester nonendogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oids, and the robustness of plant metabolism to these changes.</p>

Carotenogenesis Is Regulated by 5′UTR-Mediated Translation of Phytoene Synthase Splice Variants
<p>Phytoene synthase (PSY) catalyzes the highly regulated, frequently rate-limiting synthesis of the first biosynthetically formed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>e. While <i>PSY</i> constitutes a small gene family in most plant taxa, the Brassicaceae, including Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), predominantly possess a single <i>PSY</i> gene. This monogenic situation is compensated by the differential expression of two alternative splice variants (ASV), which differ in length and in the exon/intron retention of their 5′UTRs. ASV1 contains a long 5′UTR (untranslated region) and is involved in developmentally regulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oid formation, such as during deetiolation. ASV2 contains a short 5′UTR and is preferentially induced when an immediate increase in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oid pathway flux is required, such as under salt stress or upon sudden light intensity changes. We show that the long 5′UTR of ASV1 is capable of attenuating the translational activity in response to high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oid pathway fluxes. This function resides in a defined 5′UTR stretch with two predicted interconvertible RNA conformations, as known from riboswitches, which might act as a flux sensor. The translation-inhibitory structure is absent from the short 5′UTR of ASV2 allowing to bypass translational inhibition under conditions requiring rapidly increased pathway fluxes. The mechanism is not found in the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) <i>PSY1</i> 5′UTR, consistent with the prevalence of transcriptional control mechanisms in taxa with multiple <i>PSY</i> genes. The translational control mechanism identified is interpreted in terms of flux adjustments needed in response to retrograde signals stemming from intermediates of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>-localized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oid biosynthesis pathway.</p>

Optimization of Light-Harvesting Pigment Improves Photosynthetic Efficiency
<p>Maximizing light capture by light-harvesting pigment optimization represents an attractive but challenging strategy to improve photosynthetic efficiency. Here, we report that loss of a previously uncharacterized gene, <i>HIGH PHOTOSYNTHETIC EFFICIENCY1</i> (<i>HPE1</i>), optimizes light-harvesting pigments, leading to improved photosynthetic efficiency and biomass production. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>hpe1</i> mutants show faster electron transport and increased contents of carbohydrates. <i>HPE1</i> encodes a chloroplast protein containing an RNA recognition motif that directly associates with and regulates the splicing of target RNAs of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> genes. HPE1 also interacts with other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> RNA-splicing factors, including CAF1 and OTP51, which share common targets with HPE1. Deficiency of HPE1 alters the expression of nucleus-encoded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l-related genes, probably through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>-to-nucleus signaling, causing decreased total content of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l (<i>a</i>+<i>b</i>) in a limited range but increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l <i>a</i>/<i>b</i> ratio. Interestingly, this adjustment of light-harvesting pigment reduces antenna size, improves light capture, decreases energy loss, mitigates photodamage, and enhances photosynthetic quantum yield during photosynthesis. Our findings suggest a novel strategy to optimize light-harvesting pigments that improves photosynthetic efficiency and biomass production in higher plants.</p>

OHP1, OHP2, and HCF244 Form a Transient Functional Complex with the Photosystem II Reaction Center
<p>The reaction center (RC) of photosystem II (PSII), which is composed of D1, D2, PsbI, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytochrom</span></strong>e <i>b559</i> subunits, forms at an early stage of PSII biogenesis. However, it is largely unclear how these components assemble to form a functional unit. In this work, we show that synthesis of the PSII core proteins D1/D2 and formation of the PSII RC is blocked specifically in the absence of ONE-HELIX PROTEIN1 (OHP1) and OHP2 proteins in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), indicating that OHP1 and OHP2 are essential for the formation of the PSII RC. Mutagenesis of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l-binding residues in OHP proteins impairs their function and/or stability, suggesting that they may function in the binding of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l in vivo. We further show that OHP1, OHP2, and HIGH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>L FLUORESCENCE244 (HCF244), together with D1, D2, PsbI, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytochrom</span></strong>e <i>b559</i>, form a complex. We designated this complex the PSII RC-like complex to distinguish it from the RC subcomplex in the intact PSII complex. Our data imply that OHP1, OHP2, and HCF244 are present in this PSII RC-like complex for a limited time at an early stage of PSII de novo assembly and of PSII repair under high-light conditions. In a subsequent stage of PSII biogenesis, OHP1, OHP2, and HCF244 are released from the PSII RC-like complex and replaced by the other PSII subunits. Together with previous reports on the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i>, our results demonstrate that the process of PSII RC assembly is highly conserved among photosynthetic species.</p>

ONE-HELIX PROTEIN2 (OHP2) Is Required for the Stability of OHP1 and Assembly Factor HCF244 and Is Functionally Linked to PSII Biogenesis
<p>The members of the light-harvesting complex protein family, which include the one-helix proteins (OHPs), are characterized by one to four membrane-spanning helices. These proteins function in light absorption and energy dissipation, sensing light intensity, and triggering photomorphogenesis or the binding of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l and intermediates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l biosynthesis. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) contains two OHPs, while four homologs (named high-light-induced proteins) exist in <i>Synechocystis</i> PCC6803. Various functions have been assigned to high-light-induced proteins, ranging from photoprotection and the assembly of photosystem I (PSI) and PSII to regulation of the early steps of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l biosynthesis, but little is known about the function of the two plant OHPs. Here, we show that the two Arabidopsis OHPs form heterodimers and that the stromal part of OHP2 interacts with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>-localized PSII assembly factor HIGH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>L FLUORESCENCE244 (HCF244). Moreover, concurrent accumulation of the two OHPs and HCF244 is critical for the stability of all three proteins. In particular, the absence of OHP2 leads to the complete loss of OHP1 and HCF244. We used a virus-induced gene silencing approach to minimize the expression of <i>OHP1</i> or <i>OHP2</i> in adult Arabidopsis plants and revealed that OHP2 is essential for the accumulation of the PSII core subunits, while the other photosynthetic complexes and the major light-harvesting complex proteins remained unaffected. We examined the potential functions of the OHP1-OHP2-HCF244 complex in the assembly and/or repair of PSII and propose a role for this heterotrimeric complex in thylakoid membrane biogenesis.</p>

Plastid Translation Elongation Factor Tu Is Prone to Heat-Induced Aggregation Despite Its Critical Role in Plant Heat Tolerance
<p>Translation elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) is a conserved GTP-binding protein essential for protein translation in prokaryotes and in eukaryotic mitochondria and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s. EF-Tu also has a GTP/GDP-independent chaperone activity that may function in acclimation to heat. Here, we report that the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> EF-Tu, Rabe1b, rapidly becomes insoluble at temperatures as low as 35°C in vitro and 41°C in vivo, with more than 90% aggregation after 9 h at 45°C in vivo. Based on its established function in protein translation, heat-induced aggregation likely inactivates Rabe1b. To determine the effect of heat-induced aggregation, we isolated an Arabidopsis <i>rabe1b</i> knockdown mutant and discovered it to be highly compromised in heat tolerance. Overexpression of constitutive GTP- or GDP-bound mutant forms of Rabe1b in Arabidopsis and virus-induced silencing of <i>Rabe1b</i> in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) also reduced heat tolerance. Compromised heat tolerance in the Arabidopsis <i>rabe1b</i> mutant and in the lines overexpressing constitutive GTP- or GDP-bound mutant Rabe1b proteins was associated with reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> translation under heat stress. The Arabidopsis <i>rabe1b</i> mutant also showed compromised heat-induced expression of <i>HsfA2</i> and its target genes. Constitutive overexpression of HsfA2 activated its target genes but only partially restored the heat tolerance of the <i>rabe1b</i> mutant. These results strongly suggest that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> protein EF-Tu is heat sensitive and acts as a critical limiting factor in plant heat stress responses, primarily functioning in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> protein translation but also in protein folding and retrograde signaling of nuclear heat-responsive gene expression.</p>

Light and Plastid Signals Regulate Different Sets of Genes in the Albino Mutant Pap7-1
<p>Plants possessing dysfunctional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s due to defects in pigment biosynthesis or translation are known to repress photosynthesis-associated nuclear genes via retrograde signals from the disturbed organelles toward the nucleus. These signals are thought to be essential for proper biogenesis and function of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>. Mutants lacking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>-encoded RNA polymerase-associated proteins (PAPs) display a genetic arrest in eoplast-chloroplast transition leading to an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">albin</span></strong>o phenotype in the light. Retrograde signaling in these mutants, therefore, could be expected to be similar as under conditions inducing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> dysfunction. To answer this question, we performed plastome- and genomewide array analyses in the <i>pap7</i>-<i>1</i> mutant of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). In parallel, we determined the potential overlap with light-regulated expression networks. To this end, we performed a comparative expression profiling approach using light- and dark-grown wild-type plants as relative control for the expression profiles obtained from light-grown <i>pap7</i>-<i>1</i> mutants. Our data indicate a specific impact of retrograde signals on metabolism-related genes in <i>pap7</i>-<i>1</i> mutants reflecting the starvation situation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">albin</span></strong>o seedlings. In contrast, light regulation of PhANGs and other nuclear gene groups appears to be fully functional in this mutant, indicating that a block in chloroplast biogenesis per se does not repress expression of them as suggested by earlier studies. Only genes for light harvesting complex proteins displayed a significant repression indicating an exclusive retrograde impact on this gene family. Our results indicate that chloroplasts and arrested <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s each emit specific signals that control different target gene modules both in positive and negative manner.</p>

Phospholipid:Diacylglycerol Acyltransferase-Mediated Triacylglyerol Synthesis Augments Basal Thermotolerance
<p>High temperatures rapidly induce a genetically programmed heat-shock response (HSR) that is essential to establish short-term acquired thermotolerance. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, an immediate HSR-independent metabolic response is triggered, resulting in an accumulation of unsaturated triacylglycerols (TAGs) in the cytosol. The metabolic processes involved in heat-induced TAG formation in plants and their physiological significance remain to be clarified. Lipidomic analyses of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings indicated that during heat stress, polyunsaturated fatty acids from thylakoid galactolipids are incorporated into cytosolic TAGs. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, rapid conversion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>ic monogalactosyl diacylglycerols (MGDGs) into oligogalactolipids, acylated MGDGs, and diacylglycerols (DAGs), the direct precursor of TAGs, was observed. For TAG synthesis, DAG requires a fatty acid from the acyl-CoA pool or phosphatidylcholine. Since seedlings deficient in PHOSPHOLIPID:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1 (PDAT1) were unable to accumulate TAGs after heat stress, phosphatidylcholine appears to be the major fatty acid donor. Results suggest that rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> lipid metabolism drives TAG accumulation during heat stress. PDAT1-mediated TAG accumulation was found to increase heat resistance, since nonacclimated <i>pdat1</i> mutant seedlings were more sensitive to severe heat stress, as indicated by a more dramatic decline of the maximum efficiency of PSII and lower seedling survival compared to wild-type seedlings. In contrast, nonacclimated <i>trigalactosyldiacylglycerol1</i> (<i>tgd1</i>) mutants overaccumulating TAGs and oligogalactolipids were more resistant to heat stress. Hence, thylakoid lipid metabolism and TAG formation increases thermotolerance in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion to the genetically encoded HSR.</p>

Mammalian pigmentation is regulated by a distinct cAMP-dependent mechanism that controls melanosome pH
<p>The production of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melanin</span></strong> increases skin pigmentation and reduces the risk of skin cancer. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melanin</span></strong> production depends on the pH of melanosomes, which are more acidic in lighter-skinned than in darker-skinned people. We showed that inhibition of soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) controlled pigmentation by increasing the pH of melanosomes both in cells and in vivo. Distinct from the canonical melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R)–dependent cAMP pathway that controls pigmentation by altering gene expression, we found that inhibition of sAC increased pigmentation by increasing the activity of tyrosinase, the rate-limiting enzyme in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melanin</span></strong> synthesis, which is more active at basic pH. We demonstrated that the effect of sAC activity on pH and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melanin</span></strong> production in human melanocytes depended on the skin color of the donor. Last, we identified sAC inhibitors as a new class of drugs that increase melanosome pH and pigmentation in vivo, suggesting that pharmacologic inhibition of this pathway may affect skin cancer risk or pigmentation conditions.</p>

Phytochromes function as thermosensors in <i>Arabidopsis</i>
<p>Plants are responsive to temperature, and some species can distinguish differences of 1°C. In <i>Arabidopsis</i>, warmer temperature accelerates flowering and increases elongation growth (thermomorphogenesis). However, the mechanisms of temperature perception are largely unknown. We describe a major thermosensory role for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phytochrom</span></strong>es (red light receptors) during the night. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phytochrom</span></strong>e null plants display a constitutive warm-temperature response, and consistent with this, we show in this background that the warm-temperature transcriptome becomes derepressed at low temperatures. We found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phytochrom</span></strong>e B (phyB) directly associates with the promoters of key target genes in a temperature-dependent manner. The rate of phyB inactivation is proportional to temperature in the dark, enabling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phytochrom</span></strong>es to function as thermal timers that integrate temperature information over the course of the night.</p>

An Aromatic Farnesyltransferase Functions in Biosynthesis of the Anti-HIV Meroterpenoid Daurichromenic Acid
<p><i>Rhododendron dauricum</i> produces daurichromenic acid, an anti-HIV meroterpenoid, via oxidative cyclization of the farnesyl group of grifolic acid. The prenyltransferase (PT) that synthesizes grifolic acid is a farnesyltransferase in plant specialized metabolism. In this study, we demonstrated that the isoprenoid moiety of grifolic acid is derived from the 2-<i>C</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-erythritol-4-phosphate pathway that takes place in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s. We explored candidate sequences of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>-localized PT homologs and identified a cDNA for this PT, RdPT1, which shares moderate sequence similarity with known aromatic PTs. RdPT1 is expressed exclusively in the glandular scales, where daurichromenic acid accumulates. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, the gene product was targeted to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s in plant cells. The recombinant RdPT1 regiospecifically synthesized grifolic acid from orsellinic acid and farnesyl diphosphate, demonstrating that RdPT1 is the farnesyltransferase involved in daurichromenic acid biosynthesis. This enzyme strictly preferred orsellinic acid as a prenyl acceptor, whereas it had a relaxed specificity for prenyl donor structures, also accepting geranyl and geranylgeranyl diphosphates with modest efficiency to synthesize prenyl chain analogs of grifolic acid. Such a broad specificity is a unique catalytic feature of RdPT1 that is not shared among secondary metabolic aromatic PTs in plants. We discuss the unusual substrate preference of RdPT1 using a molecular modeling approach. The biochemical properties as well as the localization of RdPT1 suggest that this enzyme produces meroterpenoids in glandular scales cooperatively with previously identified daurichromenic acid synthase, probably for chemical defense on the surface of <i>R. dauricum</i> plants.</p>

Molecular Mechanisms Preventing Senescence in Response to Prolonged Darkness in a Desiccation-Tolerant Plant
<p>The desiccation-tolerant plant <i>Haberlea rhodopensis</i> can withstand months of darkness without any visible senescence. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of this adaptation to prolonged (30 d) darkness and subsequent return to light. <i>H. rhodopensis</i> plants remained green and viable throughout the dark treatment. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that darkness regulated several transcription factor (TF) genes. Stress- and autophagy-related TFs such as <i>ERF8</i>, <i>HSFA2b</i>, <i>RD26</i>, <i>TGA1</i>, and <i>WRKY33</i> were up-regulated, while chloroplast- and flowering-related TFs such as <i>ATH1</i>, <i>COL2</i>, <i>COL4</i>, <i>RL1</i>, and <i>PTAC7</i> were repressed. <i>PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR4</i>, a negative regulator of photomorphogenesis and promoter of senescence, also was down-regulated. In response to darkness, most of the photosynthesis- and photorespiratory-related genes were strongly down-regulated, while genes related to autophagy were up-regulated. This occurred concomitant with the induction of SUCROSE NON-FERMENTING1-RELATED PROTEIN KINASES (SnRK1) signaling pathway genes, which regulate responses to stress-induced starvation and autophagy. Most of the genes associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l catabolism, which are induced by darkness in dark-senescing species, were either unregulated (<i>PHEOPHORBIDE A OXYGENASE, PAO; RED <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>L CATABOLITE REDUCTASE, RCCR</i>) or repressed (<i>STAY GREEN-LIKE</i>, <i>PHEOPHYTINASE</i>, and <i>NON-YELLOW COLORING1</i>). Metabolite profiling revealed increases in the levels of many amino acids in darkness, suggesting increased protein degradation. In darkness, levels of the chloroplastic lipids digalactosyldiacylglycerol, monogalactosyldiacylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, and sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol decreased, while those of storage triacylglycerols increased, suggesting degradation of chloroplast membrane lipids and their conversion to triacylglycerols for use as energy and carbon sources. Collectively, these data show a coordinated response to darkness, including repression of photosynthetic, photorespiratory, flowering, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l catabolic genes, induction of autophagy and SnRK1 pathways, and metabolic reconfigurations that enable survival under prolonged darkness.</p>

The Ribosome-Bound Protein Pam68 Promotes Insertion of Chlorophyll into the CP47 Subunit of Photosystem II
<p>Photosystem II (PSII) is a large enzyme complex embedded in the thylakoid membrane of oxygenic phototrophs. The biogenesis of PSII requires the assembly of more than 30 subunits, with the assistance of a number of auxiliary proteins. In plants and cyanobacteria, the photosynthesis-affected mutant 68 (Pam68) is important for PSII assembly. However, its mechanisms of action remain unknown. Using a <i>Synechocystis</i> PCC 6803 strain expressing Flag-tagged Pam68, we purified a large protein complex containing ribosomes, SecY translocase, and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l-binding PSII inner antenna CP47. Using 2D gel electrophoresis, we identified a pigmented Pam68-CP47 subcomplex and found Pam68 bound to ribosomes. Our results show that Pam68 binds to ribosomes even in the absence of CP47 translation. Furthermore, Pam68 associates with CP47 at an early phase of its biogenesis and promotes the synthesis of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l-binding polypeptide until the attachment of the small PSII subunit PsbH. Deletion of both Pam68 and PsbH nearly abolishes the synthesis of CP47, which can be restored by enhancing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l biosynthesis. These results strongly suggest that ribosome-bound Pam68 stabilizes membrane segments of CP47 and facilitates the insertion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l molecules into the translated CP47 polypeptide chain.</p>

Natural Variation Underlies Differences in ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR17 Activity in Fruit Peel Degreening
<p>Through natural or human selection, many fleshy fruits have evolved vivid external or internal coloration, which often develops during ripening. Such developmental changes in color are associated with the biosynthesis of pigments as well as with degreening through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l degradation. Here, we demonstrated that natural variation in the coding region of the gene <i>ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR17</i> (<i>ERF17</i>) contributes to apple (<i>Malus domestica</i>) fruit peel degreening. Specifically, <i>ERF17</i> mutant alleles with different serine (Ser) repeat insertions in the coding region exhibited enhanced transcriptional regulation activity in a dual-luciferase reporter assay when more Ser repeats were present. Notably, surface plasmon resonance analysis showed that the number of Ser repeats affected the binding activity of ERF17 to the promoter sequences of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l degradation-related genes. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, overexpression of <i>ERF17</i> in evergreen apples altered the accumulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l. Furthermore, we demonstrated that <i>ERF17</i> has been under selection since the origin of apple tree cultivation. Taken together, these results reveal allelic variation underlying an important fruit quality trait and a molecular genetic mechanism associated with apple domestication.</p>

The DEAD-box RNA Helicase RH50 Is a 23S-4.5S rRNA Maturation Factor that Functionally Overlaps with the Plastid Signaling Factor GUN1
<p>DEAD-box RNA helicases (DBRHs) modulate RNA secondary structure, allowing RNA molecules to adopt the conformations required for interaction with their target proteins. RH50 is a chloroplast-located DBRH that colocalizes and is coexpressed with GUN1, a central factor in chloroplast-to-nucleus signaling. When combined with mutations that impair <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> gene expression (<i>prors1</i>-<i>1</i>, <i>prpl11</i>-<i>1</i>, <i>prps1</i>-<i>1</i>, <i>prps21</i>-<i>1</i>, <i>prps17</i>-<i>1</i>, and <i>prpl24</i>-<i>1</i>), <i>rh50</i> and <i>gun1</i> mutations evoke similar patterns of epistatic effects. These observations, together with the synergistic growth phenotype of the double mutant <i>rh50</i>-<i>1 gun1</i>-<i>102</i>, suggest that RH50 and GUN1 are functionally related and that this function is associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> gene expression, in particular ribosome functioning. However, <i>rh50</i>-<i>1</i> itself is not a gun mutant, although—like <i>gun1</i>-<i>102—</i>the <i>rh50</i>-<i>1</i> mutation suppresses the down-regulation of nuclear genes for photosynthesis induced by the <i>prors1</i>-<i>1</i> mutation. The RH50 protein comigrates with ribosomal particles, and is required for efficient translation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> proteins. RH50 binds to transcripts of the 23S-4.5S intergenic region and, in its absence, levels of the corresponding rRNA processing intermediate are strongly increased, implying that RH50 is required for the maturation of the 23S and 4.5S rRNAs. This inference is supported by the finding that loss of RH50 renders chloroplast protein synthesis sensitive to erythromycin and exposure to cold. Based on these results, we conclude that RH50 is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> rRNA maturation factor.</p>

Light Sheet Microscopy Imaging of Light Absorption and Photosynthesis Distribution in Plant Tissue
<p>In vivo variable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l fluorescence measurements of photosystem II (PSII) quantum yields in optically dense systems are complicated by steep tissue light gradients due to scattering and absorption. Consequently, externally measured effective PSII quantum yields may be composed of signals derived from cells differentially exposed to actinic light, where cells located deeper inside tissues receive lower irradiance than cells closer to the surface and can display distinct photophysiological status. We demonstrate how measured distributions of PSII quantum yields in plant tissue change under natural tissue light gradients as compared with conventionally measured quantum yields with even exposure to actinic light. This was achieved by applying actinic irradiance perpendicular to one side of thallus cross sections of the aquatic macrophyte <i>Fucus vesiculosus</i> with laser light sheets of defined spectral composition, while imaging variable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l fluorescence from cross sections with a microscope-mounted pulse amplitude-modulated imaging system. We show that quantum yields are highly affected by light gradients and that traditional surface-based variable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l fluorescence measurements result in substantial underestimations and/or overestimations, depending on incident actinic irradiance. We present a method for using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l fluorescence profiles in combination with integrating sphere measurements of reflectance and transmittance to calculate depth-resolved photon absorption profiles, which can be used to correct apparent PSII electron transport rates to photons absorbed by PSII. Absorption profiles of the investigated aquatic macrophyte were different in shape from what is typically observed in terrestrial leaves, and based on this finding, we discuss strategies for optimizing photon absorption via modulation of the structural organization of phytoelements according to in situ light environments.</p>

The Liverwort, <i>Marchantia</i>, Drives Alternative Electron Flow Using a Flavodiiron Protein to Protect PSI
<p>The diffusion efficiency of oxygen in the atmosphere, like that of CO<sub>2</sub>, is approximately 10<sup>4</sup> times greater than that in aqueous environments. Consequently, terrestrial photosynthetic organisms need mechanisms to protect against potential oxidative damage. The liverwort <i>Marchantia polymorpha</i>, a basal land plant, has habitats where it is exposed to both water and the atmosphere. Furthermore, like cyanobacteria, <i>M. polymorpha</i> has genes encoding flavodiiron proteins (FLV). In cyanobacteria, FLVs mediate oxygen-dependent alternative electron flow (AEF) to suppress the production of reactive oxygen species. Here, we investigated whether FLVs are required for the protection of photosynthesis in <i>M. polymorpha</i>. A mutant deficient in the FLV1 isozyme (Δ<i>MpFlv1</i>) sustained photooxidative damage to photosystem I (PSI) following repetitive short-saturation pulses of light. Compared with the wild type (Takaragaike-1), Δ<i>MpFlv1</i> showed the same photosynthetic oxygen evolution rate but a lower electron transport rate during the induction phase of photosynthesis. Additionally, the reaction center <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l in PSI, P700, was highly reduced in Δ<i>MpFlv1</i> but not in Takaragaike-1. These results indicate that the gene product of <i>MpFlv1</i> drives AEF to oxidize PSI, as in cyanobacteria. Furthermore, FLV-mediated AEF supports the production of a proton motive force to possibly induce the nonphotochemical quenching of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l fluorescence and suppress electron transport in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytochrom</span></strong>e <i>b</i><sub>6</sub>/<i>f</i> complex. After submerging the thalli, a decrease in photosystem II operating efficiency was observed, particularly in Δ<i>MpFlv1</i>, which implies that species living in these sorts of habitats require FLV-mediated AEF.</p>

Ubiquitin-Proteasome Dependent Regulation of the GOLDEN2-LIKE 1 Transcription Factor in Response to Plastid Signals
<p>Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) GOLDEN2-LIKE (GLK) transcription factors promote chloroplast biogenesis by regulating the expression of photosynthesis-related genes. Arabidopsis GLK1 is also known to participate in retrograde signaling from chloroplasts to the nucleus. To elucidate the mechanism by which GLK1 is regulated in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> signals, we biochemically characterized Arabidopsis GLK1 protein. Expression analysis of GLK1 protein indicated that GLK1 accumulates in aerial tissues. Both tissue-specific and Suc-dependent accumulation of GLK1 were regulated primarily at the transcriptional level. In contrast, norflurazon- or lincomycin-treated <i>gun1</i>-<i>101</i> mutant expressing normal levels of <i>GLK1</i> mRNA failed to accumulate GLK1 protein, suggesting that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> signals directly regulate the accumulation of GLK1 protein in a GUN1-independent manner. Treatment of the <i>glk1glk2</i> mutant expressing functional GFP-GLK1 with a proteasome inhibitor, MG-132, induced the accumulation of polyubiquitinated GFP-GLK1. Furthermore, the level of endogenous GLK1 in plants with damaged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s was partially restored when those plants were treated with MG-132. Collectively, these data indicate that the ubiquitin-proteasome system participates in the degradation of Arabidopsis GLK1 in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> signals.</p>

A Single Arabidopsis Gene Encodes Two Differentially Targeted Geranylgeranyl Diphosphate Synthase Isoforms
<p>A wide diversity of isoprenoids is produced in different plant compartments. Most groups of isoprenoids synthesized in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s, and some produced elsewhere in the plant cell derive from geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) synthesized by GGPP synthase (GGPPS) enzymes. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), five genes appear to encode GGPPS isoforms localized in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s (two), the endoplasmic reticulum (two), and mitochondria (one). However, the loss of function of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>-targeted GGPPS11 isoform (referred to as G11) is sufficient to cause lethality. Here, we show that the absence of a strong transcription initiation site in the <i>G11</i> gene results in the production of transcripts of different lengths. The longer transcripts encode an isoform with a functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> import sequence that produces GGPP for the major groups of photosynthesis-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>ial isoprenoids. However, shorter transcripts are also produced that lack the first translation initiation codon and rely on a second in-frame ATG codon to produce an enzymatically active isoform lacking this N-terminal domain. This short enzyme localizes in the cytosol and is essential for embryo development. Our results confirm that the production of differentially targeted enzyme isoforms from the same gene is a central mechanism to control the biosynthesis of isoprenoid precursors in different plant cell compartments.</p>

Efficient Inference of Recombination Hot Regions in Bacterial Genomes
<p>In eukaryotes, detailed surveys of recombination rates have shown variation at multiple genomic scales and the presence of “hotspots” of highly elevated recombination. In bacteria, studies of recombination rate variation are less developed, in part because there are few analysis methods that take into account the clonal context within which bacterial evolution occurs. Here, we focus in particular on identifying “hot regions” of the genome where DNA is transferred frequently between isolates. We present a computationally efficient algorithm based on the recently developed “chromosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">paint</span></strong>ing” algorithm, which characterizes patterns of haplotype sharing across a genome. We compare the average genome wide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">paint</span></strong>ing, which principally reflects clonal descent, with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">paint</span></strong>ing for each site which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ionally reflects the specific deviations at the site due to recombination. Using simulated data, we show that hot regions have consistently higher deviations from the genome wide average than normal regions. We applied our approach to previously analyzed <i>Escherichia coli</i> genomes and revealed that the new method is highly correlated with the number of recombination events affecting each site inferred by ClonalOrigin, a method that is only applicable to small numbers of genomes. Furthermore, we analyzed recombination hot regions in <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> by using 200 genomes. We identified three recombination hot regions, which are enriched for genes related to membrane proteins. Our approach and its implementation, which is downloadable from <ext-l<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ink</span></strong>>https://github.com/bioprojects/ordered<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">paint</span></strong>ing</ext-l<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ink</span></strong>>, will help to develop a new phase of population genomic studies of recombination in prokaryotes.</p>

Vacuolar Iron Stores Gated by NRAMP3 and NRAMP4 Are the Primary Source of Iron in Germinating Seeds
<p>During seed germination, iron (Fe) stored in vacuoles is exported by the redundant NRAMP3 and NRAMP4 transporter proteins. A double <i>nramp3 nramp4</i> mutant is unable to mobilize Fe stores and does not develop in the absence of external Fe. We used RNA sequencing to compare gene expression in <i>nramp3 nramp4</i> and wild type during germination and early seedling development. Even though sufficient Fe was supplied, the Fe-responsive transcription factors <i>bHLH38</i>, <i>39</i>, <i>100</i>, and <i>101</i> and their downstream targets <i>FRO2</i> and <i>IRT1</i> mediating Fe uptake were strongly upregulated in the <i>nramp3 nramp4</i> mutant. Activation of the Fe deficiency response was confirmed by increased ferric chelate reductase activity in the mutant. At early stages, genes important for chloroplast redox control (<i>FSD1</i> and <i>SAPX</i>), Fe homeostasis (<i>FER1</i> and <i>SUFB</i>), and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l metabolism (<i>HEMA1</i> and <i>NYC1</i>) were downregulated, indicating limited Fe availability in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s. In contrast, expression of <i>FRO3</i>, encoding a ferric reductase involved in Fe import into the mitochondria, was maintained, and Fe-dependent enzymes in the mitochondria were unaffected in <i>nramp3 nramp4</i>. Together, these data show that a failure to mobilize Fe stores during germination triggered Fe deficiency responses and strongly affected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s, but not mitochondria.</p>

Candidate Enzymes for Saffron Crocin Biosynthesis Are Localized in Multiple Cellular Compartments
<p>Saffron is the dried stigmas of <i>Crocus sativus</i> and is the most expensive spice in the world. Its red color is due to crocins, which are apo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oid glycosides that accumulate in the vacuole to a level up to 10% of the stigma dry weight. Previously, we characterized the first dedicated enzyme in the crocin biosynthetic pathway, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oid cleavage dioxygenase2 (CsCCD2), which cleaves zeaxanthin to yield crocetin dialdehyde. In this work, we identified six putative <i>aldehyde dehydrogenase</i> (<i>ALDH</i>) genes expressed in <i>C. sativus</i> stigmas. Heterologous expression in <i>Escherichia coli</i> showed that only one of corresponding proteins (CsALDH3I1) was able to convert crocetin dialdehyde into the crocin precursor crocetin. CsALDH3I1 carries a carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic domain, similar to that of the <i>Neurospora crassa</i> membrane-associated apo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oid dehydrogenase YLO-1. We also characterized the UDP-glycosyltransferase CsUGT74AD1, which converts crocetin to crocins 1 and 2′. In vitro assays revealed high specificity of CsALDH3I1 for crocetin dialdehyde and long-chain apo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>als and of CsUGT74AD1 for crocetin. Following extract fractionation, CsCCD2, CsALDH3I1, and CsUGT74AD1 were found in the insoluble fraction, suggesting their association with membranes or large insoluble complexes. Analysis of protein localization in both <i>C. sativus</i> stigmas and following transgene expression in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaves revealed that CsCCD2, CsALDH3I, and CsUGT74AD1 were localized to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s, the endoplasmic reticulum, and the cytoplasm, respectively, in association with cytoskeleton-like structures. Based on these findings and current literature, we propose that the endoplasmic reticulum and cytoplasm function as transit centers for metabolites whose biosynthesis starts in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> and are accumulated in the vacuole.</p>

Stable Accumulation of Photosystem II Requires ONE-HELIX PROTEIN1 (OHP1) of the Light Harvesting-Like Family
<p>The cellular functions of two Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) one-helix proteins, OHP1 and OHP2 (also named LIGHT-HARVESTING-LIKE2 [LIL2] and LIL6, respectively, because they have sequence similarity to light-harvesting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l <i>a</i>/<i>b</i>-binding proteins), remain unclear. Tagged null mutants of <i>OHP1</i> and <i>OHP2</i> (<i>ohp1</i> and <i>ohp2</i>) showed stunted growth with pale-green leaves on agar plates, and these mutants were unable to grow on soil. Leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l fluorescence and the composition of thylakoid membrane proteins revealed that <i>ohp1</i> deletion substantially affected photosystem II (PSII) core protein function and led to reduced levels of photosystem I core proteins; however, it did not affect LHC accumulation. Transgenic <i>ohp1</i> plants rescued with OHP1-HA or OHP1-Myc proteins developed a normal phenotype. Using these tagged OHP1 proteins in transgenic plants, we localized OHP1 to thylakoid membranes, where it formed protein complexes with both OHP2 and High <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l Fluorescence244 (HCF244). We also found PSII core proteins D1/D2, HCF136, and HCF173 and a few other plant-specific proteins associated with the OHP1/OHP2-HCF244 complex, suggesting that these complexes are early intermediates in PSII assembly. OHP1 interacted directly with HCF244 in the complex. Therefore, OHP1 and HCF244 play important roles in the stable accumulation of PSII.</p>

Pausing of Chloroplast Ribosomes Is Induced by Multiple Features and Is Linked to the Assembly of Photosynthetic Complexes<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Many mRNAs contain pause sites that briefly interrupt the progress of translation. Specific features that induce ribosome pausing have been described; however, their individual contributions to pause-site formation, and the overall biological significance of ribosome pausing, remain largely unclear. We have taken advantage of the compact genome of chloroplasts to carry out a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> genome-wide survey of pause sites, as a basis for studying the impact of pausing on posttranslational processes. Based on ribosomal profiling of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) chloroplast mRNAs, we demonstrate that a combination of factors—mRNA secondary structure, internal Shine-Dalgarno sequences, and positively charged amino acids in the nascent peptide chain—explains 95% of the major pause sites on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> mRNAs, whereas codon usage has little impact. The distribution of the pause sites is nonrandom and conforms to distinct patterns in the vicinity of sequences coding for transmembrane domains, which depend on their orientation within the membrane as well as being next to sequences coding for cofactor binding sites. We found strong indications that the mechanisms causing ribosomal pausing and at least some of the ribosomes pause sites are conserved between distantly related plant species. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, the positions of features that cause pausing are well conserved in photoautotrophic plants, but less so in their nonphotosynthetic, parasitic relatives, implying that the synthesis and assembly of photosynthetic multiprotein complexes requires localized ribosome pausing.</p>

Extracellular ATP Acts on Jasmonate Signaling to Reinforce Plant Defense
<p>Damaged cells send various signals to stimulate defense responses. Recent identification and genetic studies of the plant purinoceptor, P2K1 (also known as DORN1), have demonstrated that extracellular ATP is a signal involved in plant stress responses, including wounding, perhaps to evoke plant defense. However, it remains largely unknown how extracellular ATP induces plant defense responses. Here, we demonstrate that extracellular ATP induces plant defense mediated through activation of the intracellular signaling of jasmonate (JA), a well-characterized defense hormone. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves, ATP pretreatment induced resistance against the necrotrophic fungus, <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>. The induced resistance was enhanced in the P2K1 receptor overexpression line, but reduced in the receptor mutant, <i>dorn1</i>-<i>3</i>. Mining the transcriptome data revealed that ATP induces a set of JA-induced genes. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, the P2K1-associated coexpression network contains defense-related genes, including those encoding jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins, which play key roles as repressors of JA signaling. We examined whether extracellular ATP impacts the stability of JAZ1 in Arabidopsis. The results showed that the JAZ1 stability decreased in response to ATP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion in a proteasome-dependent manner. This reduction required intracellular signaling via second messengers—cytosolic calcium, reactive oxygen species, and nitric oxide. Interestingly, the ATP-induced JAZ1 degradation was attenuated in the JA receptor mutant, <i>coi1</i>, but not in the JA biosynthesis mutant, <i>aos</i>, or upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion of JA biosynthesis inhibitors. Immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that ATP increases the interaction between COI1 and JAZ1, suggesting direct cross talk between extracellular ATP and JA in intracellular signaling events. Taken together, these results suggest that extracellular ATP signaling directly impacts the JA signaling pathway to maximize plant defense responses.</p>

A Program for Iron Economy during Deficiency Targets Specific Fe Proteins
<p>Iron (Fe) is an essential element for plants, utilized in nearly every cellular process. Because the adjustment of uptake under Fe limitation cannot satisfy all demands, plants need to acclimate their physiology and biochemistry, especially in their chloroplasts, which have a high demand for Fe. To investigate if a program exists for the utilization of Fe under deficiency, we analyzed how hydroponically grown Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) adjusts its physiology and Fe protein composition in vegetative photosynthetic tissue during Fe deficiency. Fe deficiency first affected photosynthetic electron transport with concomitant reductions in carbon assimilation and biomass production when effects on respiration were not yet significant. Photosynthetic electron transport function and protein levels of Fe-dependent enzymes were fully recovered upon Fe resupply, indicating that the Fe depletion stress did not cause irreversible secondary damage. At the protein level, ferredoxin, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytochrom</span></strong>e-<i>b<sub>6</sub>f</i> complex, and Fe-containing enzymes of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> sulfur assimilation pathway were major targets of Fe deficiency, whereas other Fe-dependent functions were relatively less affected. In coordination, SufA and SufB, two proteins of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> Fe-sulfur cofactor assembly pathway, were also diminished early by Fe depletion. Iron depletion reduced mRNA levels for the majority of the affected proteins, indicating that loss of enzyme was not just due to lack of Fe cofactors. SufB and ferredoxin were early targets of transcript down-regulation. The data reveal a hierarchy for Fe utilization in photosynthetic tissue and indicate that a program is in place to acclimate to impending Fe deficiency.</p>

Nitric Oxide Mediates Nitrite-Sensing and Acclimation and Triggers a Remodeling of Lipids
<p>Nitric oxide (NO) is an intermediate of the nitrogen cycle, an industrial pollutant, and a marker of climate change. NO also acts as a gaseous transmitter in a variety of biological processes. The impact of environmental NO needs to be addressed. In diatoms, a dominant phylum in phytoplankton, NO was reported to mediate programmed cell death in response to diatom-derived polyunsaturated aldehydes. Here, using the <i>Phaeodactylum</i> Pt1 strain, 2E,4E-decadienal supplied in the micromolar concentration range led to a nonspecific cell toxicity. We reexamined NO biosynthesis and response in <i>Phaeodactylum</i>. NO inhibits cell growth and triggers triacylglycerol (TAG) accumulation. Feeding experiments indicate that NO is not produced from Arg but via conversion of nitrite by the nitrate reductase. Genome-wide transcriptional analysis shows that NO up-regulates the expression of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> nitrite reductase and genes involved in the subsequent incorporation of ammonium into amino acids, via both Gln synthesis and Orn-urea pathway. The phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is also up-regulated, leading to the production of acetyl-CoA, which can feed TAG accumulation upon exposure to NO. Transcriptional reprogramming leading to higher TAG content is balanced with a decrease of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> via posttranslational inhibition of MGDG synthase enzymatic activity by NO. Intracellular and transient NO emission acts therefore at the basis of a nitrite-sensing and acclimating system, whereas a long exposure to NO can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ionally induce a redirection of carbon to neutral lipids and a stress response.</p>

Thioredoxin and NADPH-Dependent Thioredoxin Reductase C Regulation of Tetrapyrrole Biosynthesis
<p>In chloroplasts, thioredoxin (TRX) isoforms and NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase C (NTRC) act as redox regulatory factors involved in multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> biogenesis and metabolic processes. To date, less is known about the functional coordination between TRXs and NTRC in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l biosynthesis. In this study, we aimed to explore the potential functions of TRX m and NTRC in the regulation of the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis (TBS) pathway. Silencing of three genes, <i>TRX m1</i>, <i>TRX m2</i>, and <i>TRX m4</i> (<i>TRX ms</i>), led to pale-green leaves, a significantly reduced 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA)-synthesizing capacity, and reduced accumulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l and its metabolic intermediates in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The contents of ALA dehydratase, protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase, the I subunit of Mg-chelatase, Mg-protoporphyrin IX methyltransferase (CHLM), and NADPH-proto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>lide oxidoreductase were decreased in triple <i>TRX m-</i>silenced seedlings compared with the wild type, although the transcript levels of the corresponding genes were not altered significantly. Protein-protein interaction analyses revealed a physical interaction between the TRX m isoforms and CHLM. 4-Acetoamido-4-maleimidylstilbene-2,2-disulfonate labeling showed the regulatory impact of TRX ms on the CHLM redox status. Since CHLM also is regulated by NTRC (Richter et al., 2013), we assessed the concurrent functions of TRX m and NTRC in the control of CHLM. Combined deficiencies of three TRX m isoforms and NTRC led to a cumulative decrease in leaf pigmentation, TBS intermediate contents, ALA synthesis rate, and CHLM activity. We discuss the coordinated roles of TRX m and NTRC in the redox control of CHLM stability with its corollary activity in the TBS pathway.</p>

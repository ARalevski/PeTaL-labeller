Pavlovian conditioning–induced hallucinations result from overweighting of perceptual priors
<p>Some people hear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">voic</span></strong>es that others do not, but only some of those people seek treatment. Using a Pavlovian learning task, we induced conditioned hallucinations in four groups of people who differed orthogonally in their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">voic</span></strong>e-hearing and treatment-seeking statuses. People who hear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">voic</span></strong>es were significantly more susceptible to the effect. Using functional neuroimaging and computational modeling of perception, we identified processes that differentiated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">voic</span></strong>e-hearers from non–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">voic</span></strong>e-hearers and treatment-seekers from non–treatment-seekers and characterized a brain circuit that mediated the conditioned hallucinations. These data demonstrate the profound and sometimes pathological impact of top-down cognitive processes on perception and may represent an objective means to discern people with a need for treatment from those without.</p>

Is genome-guided cancer treatment hyped?
<p>For people with advanced cancer who are running out of options, many cancer centers now offer this hope: Have your tumor's genome sequenced, and doctors will match you with a drug that targets its weak spot. But this booming area of cancer treatment has critics, who say its promise has been oversold. Last week, two prominent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">voic</span></strong>es in the field faced off in a sometimes-tense debate on what's often called precision oncology at the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research in Chicago, Illinois. Their dispute threw a splash of cold water on a meeting packed with sessions on genome-based cancer treatments.</p>

A Synthetic Oxygen Sensor for Plants Based on Animal Hypoxia Signaling
<p>Due to the involvement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> in many essential metabolic reactions, all living organisms have developed molecular systems that allow adaptive physiological and metabolic transitions depending on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> availability. In mammals, the expression of hypoxia-response genes is controlled by the heterodimeric Hypoxia-Inducible Factor. The activity of this transcriptional regulator is linked mainly to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>-dependent hydroxylation of conserved proline residues in its α-subunit, carried out by prolyl-hydroxylases, and subsequent ubiquitination via the E3 ligase von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor, which targets Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-α to the proteasome. By exploiting bioengineered versions of this mammalian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> sensor, we designed and optimized a synthetic device that drives gene expression in an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>-dependent fashion in plants. Transient assays in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mesophyll protoplasts indicated that a combination of the yeast Gal4/upstream activating sequence system and the mammalian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> sensor machinery can be used effectively to engineer a modular, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>-inducible transcriptional regulator. This synthetic device also was shown to be selectively controlled by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> in whole plants when its components were expressed stably in Arabidopsis seedlings. We envision the exploitation of our genetically encoded controllers to generate plants able to switch gene expression selectively depending on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> availability, thereby providing a proof of concept for the potential of synthetic biology to assist agricultural practices in environments with variable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> provision.</p>

Singlet Oxygen Plays an Essential Role in the Root’s Response to Osmotic Stress
<p>The high osmotic potentials in plants subjected to drought stress can be mimicked by the application of high molecular weight polyethylene glycol. Here, we quantified the effects of exposure to polyethylene glycol on the growth of the main and lateral roots of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings. The effects on root growth were highly correlated with the appearance of singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>, as visualized using the singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>-specific probe singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> sensor green. The production of singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> was followed by cell death, as indicated by the intracellular accumulation of propidium iodide due to the loss of membrane integrity. Cell death began in the epidermal region of the root tip and spread in a dynamic manner to meristematic sections. In parallel, gene expression changes specific to the presence of singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> were observed. The accumulation of other reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species, namely hydrogen, peroxide, nitric oxide, and superoxide, did not correlate with cell death. In addition, both the singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> scavenger His and the lip<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ase inhibitor salicylhydroxamic acid specifically inhibited singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> accumulation and cell death. These results suggest a light-independent, type-I source of singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> production. Serpin-protease interactions were used as a model to assess the possibility of vacuolar-type cell death. Osmotic stress induced the accumulation of complexes between the cytoplasmic serpin AtSERPIN1 and its cognate vacuolar proteases, indicating that vacuolar integrity was compromised. These findings imply that singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> plays an essential role in conveying the root response to osmotic stress.</p>

Simultaneous high-resolution pH and spectrophotometric recordings of oxygen binding in blood microvolumes
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> equilibrium curves have been widely used to understand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> transport in numerous organisms. A major challenge has been to monitor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> binding characteristics and concomitant pH changes as they occur <i>in vivo</i>, in limited sample volumes. Here we report a technique allowing highly resolved and simultaneous monitoring of pH and blood pigment saturation in minute blood volumes. We equipped a gas diffusion chamber with a broad-range fibre-optic spectrophotometer and a micro-pH optode and recorded changes of pigment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ation along <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> partial pressure (<i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) and pH gradients to test the setup. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> binding parameters derived from measurements in only 15 μl of haemolymph from the cephalopod <i>Octopus vulgaris</i> showed low instrumental error (0.93%) and good agreement with published data. Broad-range spectra, each resolving 2048 data points, provided detailed insight into the complex absorbance characteristics of diverse blood types. After consideration of photobleaching and intrinsic fluorescence, pH optodes yielded accurate recordings and resolved a sigmoidal shift of 0.03 pH units in response to changing <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> from 0 to 21 kPa. Highly resolved continuous recordings along pH gradients conformed to stepwise measurements at low rates of pH changes. In this study we showed that a diffusion chamber upgraded with a broad-range spectrophotometer and an optical pH sensor accurately characterizes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> binding with minimal sample consumption and manipulation. We conclude that the modified diffusion chamber is highly suitable for experimental biologists who demand high flexibility, detailed insight into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> binding as well as experimental and biological accuracy combined in a single setup.</p>

Rapid mitochondrial adjustments in response to short-term hypoxia and re-oxygenation in the Pacific oyster, <i>Crassostrea gigas</i>
<p>As <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> concentrations in marine coastal habitats can fluctuate rapidly and drastically, sessile marine organisms such as the oyster <i>Crassostrea gigas</i> can experience marked and rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> variations. In this study, we investigated the responses of oyster gill mitochondria to short-term hypoxia (3 and 12 h, at 1.7 mg O<sub>2</sub> l<sup>−1</sup>) and subsequent re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ation. Mitochondrial respiratory rates (states 3 and 4 stimulated by glutamate) and phosphorylation efficiency [respiratory control ratio (RCR) and the relationship between ADP and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> consumption (ADP/O)] were measured. Cytochrome <i>c</i> oxidase (CCO) activity and cytochrome concentrations (<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>c</i>) were measured to investigate the rearrangements of respiratory chain subunits. The potential implication of an alternative oxidase (AOX) was investigated using an inhibitor of the respiratory chain (antimycin A) and through gene expression analysis in gills and digestive gland. Results indicate a downregulation of mitochondrial capacity, with 60% inhibition of respiratory rates after 12 h of hypoxia. RCR remained stable, while ADP/O increased after 12 h of hypoxia and 1 h of re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ation, suggesting increased phosphorylation efficiency. CCO showed a fast and remarkable increase of its catalytic activity only after 3 h of hypoxia. AOX mRNA levels showed similar patterns in gills and digestive gland, and were upregulated after 12 and 24 h of hypoxia and during re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ation. Results suggest a set of controls regulating mitochondrial functions in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> fluctuations, and demonstrate the fast and extreme plasticity of oyster mitochondria in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> variations.</p>

Histone demethylase KDM6A directly senses oxygen to control chromatin and cell fate
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> sensing is central to metazoan biology and has implications for human disease. Mammalian cells express multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>-dependent enzymes called 2-oxoglutarate (OG)-dependent di<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ases (2-OGDDs), but they vary in their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> affinities and hence their ability to sense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>. The 2-OGDD histone demethylases control histone methylation. Hypoxia increases histone methylation, but whether this reflects direct effects on histone demethylases or indirect effects caused by the hypoxic induction of the HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor) transcription factor or the 2-OG antagonist 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) is unclear. Here, we report that hypoxia promotes histone methylation in a HIF- and 2-HG–independent manner. We found that the H3K27 histone demethylase KDM6A/UTX, but not its paralog KDM6B, is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> sensitive. KDM6A loss, like hypoxia, prevented H3K27 demethylation and blocked cellular differentiation. Restoring H3K27 methylation homeostasis in hypoxic cells reversed these effects. Thus, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> directly affects chromatin regulators to control cell fate.</p>

Histone modifiers are oxygen sensors
<p>Approximately 2.6 billion years ago, during the Proterozoic period, the evolution of photosynthesis in cyanobacteria led to the introduction of the by-product of this reaction, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>, into Earth's atmosphere (<i>1</i>). This great oxidative event heralded the rise of multicellular organisms, which are almost totally dependent on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> as an efficient fuel for metabolism and as a cofactor in many critical physiological enzymatic reactions. Central to this adaptation, and to allow cellular physiology across a wide range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> concentrations (tensions), metazoans have evolved the highly conserved hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway (<i>2</i>). This is important for both physiological and pathological processes that occur in a hypoxic microenvironment, including embryogenesis, stem cell homeostasis, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. It has long been observed that hypoxia induces histone lysine hypermethylation, a form of epigenetic chromatin modification. However, whether this represents a direct sensing of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> tension or an indirect effect, perhaps through the HIF pathway, has not been established (<i>3</i>). On pages 1222 and 1217 of this issue, Batie <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) and Chakraborty <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>), respectively, resolve this question, demonstrating in different cellular systems that the activity of the lysine-specific demethylases (KDMs) KDM5A and KDM6A is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> sensitive, and thereby identifying them as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> sensors.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Root Bending Is Antagonistically Affected by Hypoxia and ERF-Mediated Transcription via Auxin Signaling
<p>When plants encounter soil water logging or flooding, roots are the first organs to be confronted with reduced gas diffusion resulting in limited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> supply. Since roots do not generate photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>, they are rapidly faced with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> shortage rendering roots particularly prone to damage. While metabolic adaptations to low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> conditions, which ensure basic energy supply, have been well characterized, adaptation of root growth and development have received less attention. In this study, we show that hypoxic conditions cause the primary root to grow sidewise in a low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> environment, possibly to escape soil patches with reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> availability. This growth behavior is reversible in that gravitropic growth resumes when seedlings are returned to normoxic conditions. Hypoxic root bending is inhibited by the group VII ethylene response factor (ERFVII) RAP2.12, as <i>rap2.12-1</i> seedlings show exaggerated primary root bending. Furthermore, overexpression of the ERFVII member <i>HRE2</i> inhibits root bending, suggesting that primary root growth direction at hypoxic conditions is antagonistically regulated by hypoxia and hypoxia-activated ERFVIIs. Root bending is preceded by the establishment of an auxin gradient across the root tip as quantified with DII-VENUS and is synergistically enhanced by hypoxia and the auxin transport inhibitor naphthylphthalamic acid. The protein abundance of the auxin efflux carrier PIN2 is reduced at hypoxic conditions, a response that is suppressed by RAP2.12 overexpression, suggesting antagonistic control of auxin flux by hypoxia and ERFVII. Taken together, we show that hypoxia triggers an escape response of the primary root that is controlled by ERFVII activity and mediated by auxin signaling in the root tip.</p>

Physiological correlates of symbiont migration during bleaching of two octocoral species
<p>Perturbed colonies of <i>Phenganax parrini</i> and <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. exhibit migration of symbionts of <i>Symbiodinium</i> spp. into the stolons. Densitometry and visual inspection indicated that polyps bleached while stolons did not. When migration was triggered by temperature, light and confinement, colonies of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. decreased rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> formation in the light (due to the effects of perturbation on photosynthesis and respiration) and increased rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> uptake in the dark (due to the effects of perturbation on respiration alone). Colonies of <i>P. parrini</i>, by contrast, showed no significant changes in either aspect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> metabolism. When migration was triggered by light and confinement, colonies of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. showed decreased rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> formation in the light and increased rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> uptake in the dark, while colonies of <i>P. parrini</i> maintained the former and increased the latter. During symbiont migration into their stolons, colonies of both species showed dramatic increases in reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species (ROS), as visualized with a fluorescent probe, with stolons of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. exhibiting a nearly immediate increase of ROS. Differences in symbiont type may explain the greater sensitivity of colonies of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. Using fluorescent probes, direct measurements of migrating symbionts in the stolons of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. showed higher levels of reactive nitrogen species and lower levels of ROS than the surrounding host tissue. As measured by native fluorescence, levels of NAD(P)H in the stolons were unaffected by perturbation. Symbiont migration thus correlates with dramatic physiological changes and may serve as a marker for coral condition.</p>

Late inception of a resiliently oxygenated upper ocean
<p>Rising oceanic and atmospheric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> levels through time have been crucial to enhanced habitability of surface Earth environments. Few redox proxies can track secular variations in dissolved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> concentrations around threshold levels for metazoan survival in the upper ocean. We present an extensive compilation of iodine-to-calcium ratios (I/Ca) in marine carbonates. Our record supports a major rise in the partial pressure of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> in the atmosphere at ~400 million years (Ma) ago and reveals a step change in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ation of the upper ocean to relatively sustainable near-modern conditions at ~200 Ma ago. An Earth system model demonstrates that a shift in organic matter remineralization to greater depths, which may have been due to increasing size and biomineralization of eukaryotic plankton, likely drove the I/Ca signals at ~200 Ma ago.</p>

Aqueous Au-Pd colloids catalyze selective CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation to CH<sub>3</sub>OH with O<sub>2</sub> under mild conditions
<p>The selective oxidation of methane, the primary component of natural gas, remains an important challenge in catalysis. We used colloidal gold-palladium nanoparticles, rather than the same nanoparticles supported on titanium oxide, to oxidize methane to methanol with high selectivity (92%) in aqueous solution at mild temperatures. Then, using isotopically labeled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> (O<sub>2</sub>) as an oxidant in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)<sub>,</sub> we demonstrated that the resulting methanol incorporated a substantial fraction (70%) of gas-phase O<sub>2</sub>. More <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ated products were formed than the amount of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> consumed, suggesting that the controlled breakdown of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> activates methane, which subsequently incorporates molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> through a radical process. If a source of methyl radicals can be established, then the selective oxidation of methane to methanol using molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> is possible.</p>

The Liverwort, <i>Marchantia</i>, Drives Alternative Electron Flow Using a Flavodiiron Protein to Protect PSI
<p>The diffusion efficiency of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> in the atmosphere, like that of CO<sub>2</sub>, is approximately 10<sup>4</sup> times greater than that in aqueous environments. Consequently, terrestrial photosynthetic organisms need mechanisms to protect against potential oxidative damage. The liverwort <i>Marchantia polymorpha</i>, a basal land plant, has habitats where it is exposed to both water and the atmosphere. Furthermore, like cyanobacteria, <i>M. polymorpha</i> has genes encoding flavodiiron proteins (FLV). In cyanobacteria, FLVs mediate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>-dependent alternative electron flow (AEF) to suppress the production of reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species. Here, we investigated whether FLVs are required for the protection of photosynthesis in <i>M. polymorpha</i>. A mutant deficient in the FLV1 isozyme (Δ<i>MpFlv1</i>) sustained photooxidative damage to photosystem I (PSI) following repetitive short-saturation pulses of light. Compared with the wild type (Takaragaike-1), Δ<i>MpFlv1</i> showed the same photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> evolution rate but a lower electron transport rate during the induction phase of photosynthesis. Additionally, the reaction center chlorophyll in PSI, P700, was highly reduced in Δ<i>MpFlv1</i> but not in Takaragaike-1. These results indicate that the gene product of <i>MpFlv1</i> drives AEF to oxidize PSI, as in cyanobacteria. Furthermore, FLV-mediated AEF supports the production of a proton motive force to possibly induce the nonphotochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence and suppress electron transport in the cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub>/<i>f</i> complex. After submerging the thalli, a decrease in photosystem II operating efficiency was observed, particularly in Δ<i>MpFlv1</i>, which implies that species living in these sorts of habitats require FLV-mediated AEF.</p>

Deep-diving sea lions exhibit extreme bradycardia in long-duration dives
<p>Heart rate and peripheral blood flow distribution are the primary determinants of the rate and pattern of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> store utilisation and ultimately breath-hold duration in marine endotherms. Despite this, little is known about how otariids (sea lions and fur seals) regulate heart rate (<i>f</i><sub>H</sub>) while diving. We investigated dive <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> in five adult female California sea lions (<i>Zalophus californianus</i>) during foraging trips by instrumenting them with digital electrocardiogram (ECG) loggers and time depth recorders. In all dives, dive <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> (number of beats/duration; 50±9 beats min<sup>−1</sup>) decreased compared with surface rates (113±5 beats min<sup>−1</sup>), with all dives exhibiting an instantaneous <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> below resting (<54 beats min<sup>−1</sup>) at some point during the dive. Both dive <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> and minimum instantaneous <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> significantly decreased with increasing dive duration. Typical instantaneous <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> profiles of deep dives (>100 m) consisted of: (1) an initial rapid decline in <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> resulting in the lowest instantaneous <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> of the dive at the end of descent, often below 10 beats min<sup>−1</sup> in dives longer than 6 min in duration; (2) a slight increase in <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> to ~10–40 beats min<sup>−1</sup> during the bottom portion of the dive; and (3) a gradual increase in <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> during ascent with a rapid increase prior to surfacing. Thus, <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> regulation in deep-diving sea lions is not simply a progressive bradycardia. Extreme bradycardia and the presumed associated reductions in pulmonary and peripheral blood flow during late descent of deep dives should (a) contribute to preservation of the lung <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> store, (b) increase dependence of muscle on the myoglobin-bound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> store, (c) conserve the blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> store and (d) help limit the absorption of nitrogen at depth. This <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> profile during deep dives of sea lions may be characteristic of deep-diving marine endotherms that dive on inspiration as similar <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> profiles have been recently documented in the emperor penguin, another deep diver that dives on inspiration.</p>

Hypoxia induces rapid changes to histone methylation and reprograms chromatin
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> is essential for the life of most multicellular organisms. Cells possess enzymes called molecular di<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ases that depend on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> for activity. A subclass of molecular di<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ases is the histone demethylase enzymes, which are characterized by the presence of a Jumanji-C (JmjC) domain. Hypoxia can alter chromatin, but whether this is a direct effect on JmjC-histone demethylases or due to other mechanisms is unknown. Here, we report that hypoxia induces a rapid and hypoxia-inducible factor–independent induction of histone methylation in a range of human cultured cells. Genomic locations of histone-3 lysine-4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and H3K36me3 after a brief exposure of cultured cells to hypoxia predict the cell’s transcriptional response several hours later. We show that inactivation of one of the JmjC-containing enzymes, lysine demethylase 5A (KDM5A), mimics hypoxia-induced cellular responses. These results demonstrate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> sensing by chromatin occurs via JmjC-histone demethylase inhibition.</p>

All members of the <i>Melainabacteria</i> and <i>Sericytochromatia</i> lack photosynthetic machinery, indicating that phototrophy was not an ancestral feature of the Cyanobacteria and that <i>Oxyphotobacteria</i> acquired the genes for photosynthesis relatively late in cyanobacterial evolution.

Archaeal (Per)Chlorate Reduction at High Temperature: An Interplay of Biotic and Abiotic Reactions
<sec><title>Archaea Powered by Rocket Fuel</title><p>Perchlorate is a ubiquitous chlorine-based compound that forms naturally in the atmosphere.

The archaeal perchlorate reduction pathway shares limited similarity with bacterial perchlorate reduction: Instead of producing chloride and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>, enzymatically produced chlorite reacts with sulfide to produce oxidized sulfur compounds. Because hyperthermophilic anaerobic archaea similar to <i>A. fulgidus</i> are thought to have been among the first complex organisms to evolve on Earth, they may have started creating oxidized conditions in some habitats before the emergence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>-generating photosynthesis.</p></sec>

Signal Dynamics and Interactions during Flooding Stress
<p>Flooding is detrimental for nearly all higher plants, including crops. The compound stress elicited by slow gas exchange and low light levels under water is responsible for both a carbon and an energy crisis ultimately leading to plant death. The endogenous concentrations of four gaseous compounds, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>, carbon dioxide, ethylene, and nitric oxide, change during the submergence of plant organs in water. These gases play a pivotal role in signal transduction cascades, leading to adaptive processes such as metabolic adjustments and anatomical features. Of these gases, ethylene is seen as the most consistent, pervasive, and reliable signal of early flooding stress, most likely in tight interaction with the other gases. The production of reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species (ROS) in plant cells during flooding and directly after subsidence, during which the plant is confronted with high light and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> levels, is characteristic for this abiotic stress. Low, well-controlled levels of ROS are essential for adaptive signaling pathways, in interaction with the other gaseous flooding signals. On the other hand, excessive uncontrolled bursts of ROS can be highly damaging for plants. Therefore, a fine-tuned balance is important, with a major role for ROS production and scavenging. Our understanding of the temporal dynamics of the four gases and ROS is basal, whereas it is likely that they form a signature readout of prevailing flooding conditions and subsequent adaptive responses.</p>

In bacteria and archae, flavodiiron (Flv) proteins catalyze O<sub>2</sub> or NO reduction, thus protecting cells against oxidative or nitrosative stress. These proteins are found in cyanobacteria, mosses, and microalgae, but have been lost in angiosperms. Here, we used chlorophyll fluorescence and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> exchange measurement using [<sup>18</sup>O]-labeled O<sub>2</sub> and a membrane inlet mass spectrometer to characterize <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii flvB</i> insertion mutants devoid of both FlvB and FlvA proteins. We show that Flv proteins are involved in a photo-dependent electron flow to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>, which drives most of the photosynthetic electron flow during the induction of photosynthesis. As a consequence, the chlorophyll fluorescence patterns are strongly affected in <i>flvB</i> mutants during a light transient, showing a lower PSII operating yield and a slower nonphotochemical quenching induction. Photoautotrophic growth of <i>flvB</i> mutants was indistinguishable from the wild type under constant light, but severely impaired under fluctuating light due to PSI photo damage. Remarkably, net photosynthesis of <i>flv</i> mutants was higher than in the wild type during the initial hour of a fluctuating light regime, but this advantage vanished under long-term exposure, and turned into PSI photo damage, thus explaining the marked growth retardation observed in these conditions. We conclude that the <i>C. reinhardtii</i> Flv participates in a Mehler-like reduction of O<sub>2</sub>, which drives a large part of the photosynthetic electron flow during a light transient and is thus critical for growth under fluctuating light regimes.</p>

The cost of muscle power production: muscle oxygen consumption per unit work increases at low temperatures in <i>Xenopus laevis</i>
<p>Metabolic energy (ATP) supply to muscle is essential to support activity and behaviour. It is expected, therefore, that there is strong selection to maximise muscle power output for a given rate of ATP use. However, the viscosity and stiffness of muscle increases with a decrease in temperature, which means that more ATP may be required to achieve a given work output. Here, we tested the hypothesis that ATP use increases at lower temperatures for a given power output in <i>Xenopus laevis.</i> To account for temperature variation at different time scales, we considered the interaction between acclimation for 4 weeks (to 15 or 25°C) and acute exposure to these temperatures. Cold-acclimated frogs had greater sprint speed at 15°C than warm-acclimated animals. However, acclimation temperature did not affect isolated gastrocnemius muscle biomechanics. Isolated muscle produced greater tetanus force, and faster isometric force generation and relaxation, and generated more work loop power at 25°C than at 15°C acute test temperature. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> consumption of isolated muscle at rest did not change with test temperature, but <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> consumption while muscle was performing work was significantly higher at 15°C than at 25°C, regardless of acclimation conditions. Muscle therefore consumed significantly more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> at 15°C for a given work output than at 25°C, and plastic responses did not modify this thermodynamic effect. The metabolic cost of muscle performance and activity therefore increased with a decrease in temperature. To maintain activity across a range of temperature, animals must increase ATP production or face an allocation trade-off at lower temperatures. Our data demonstrate the potential energetic benefits of warming up muscle before activity, which is seen in diverse groups of animals such as bees, which warm flight muscle before take-off, and humans performing warm ups before exercise.</p>

Antibody-Mediated Inhibition of Tspan12 Ameliorates Vasoproliferative Retinopathy Through Suppression of β-Catenin Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Anti-angiogenic biologicals represent an important concept for the treatment of vasoproliferative diseases. However, the need for continued treatment, the presence of nonresponders, and the risk of long-term side effects limit the success of existing therapeutic agents. Although Tspan12 has been shown to regulate retinal vascular development, nothing is known about its involvement in neovascular disease and its potential as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of vasoproliferative diseases.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Rodent models of retinal neovascular disease, including the mouse model of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>-induced retinopathy and the very low density lipoprotein receptor knockout mouse model were analyzed for Tspan/β-catenin regulation. Screening of a phage display of a human combinatorial antibody (Ab) library was used for the development of a high-affinity Ab against Tspan12. Therapeutic effects of the newly developed Ab on vascular endothelial cells were tested in vitro and in vivo in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>-induced retinopathy and very low density lipoprotein receptor knockout mouse model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The newly developed anti-Tspan12 Ab exhibited potent inhibitory effects on endothelial cell migration and tube formation. Mechanistic studies confirmed that the Ab inhibited the interaction between Tspan12 and Frizzled-4 and effectively modulates β-catenin levels and target genes in vascular endothelial cells. Tspan12/β-catenin signaling was activated in response to acute and chronic stress in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>-induced retinopathy and very low density lipoprotein receptor mouse model of proliferative retinopathy. Intravitreal application of the Ab showed significant therapeutic effects in both models without inducing negative side effects on retina function. Moreover, combined intravitreal injection of the Ab with a known vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor, Aflibercept, resulted in significant enhancement of the therapeutic efficacy of each monotherapy. Combination therapy with the Tspan12 blocking antibody can be used to reduce anti-vascular endothelial growth factor doses, thus decreasing the risk of long-term off-target effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Tspan12/β-catenin signaling is critical for the progression of vasoproliferative disease.

Physiology of Angina and Its Alleviation With Nitroglycerin
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The mechanisms governing exercise-induced angina and its alleviation by the most commonly used antianginal drug, nitroglycerin, are incompletely understood. The purpose of this study was to develop a method by which the effects of antianginal drugs could be evaluated invasively during physiological exercise to gain further understanding of the clinical impact of angina and nitroglycerin.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Forty patients (mean age, 65.2±7.6 years) with exertional angina and coronary artery disease underwent cardiac catheterization via radial access and performed incremental exercise using a supine cycle ergometer. As they developed limiting angina, sublingual nitroglycerin was administered to half the patients, and all patients continued to exercise for 2 minutes at the same workload. Throughout exercise, distal coronary pressure and flow velocity and central aortic pressure were recorded with sensor wires.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Patients continued to exercise after nitroglycerin administration with less ST-segment depression (<i>P</i>=0.003) and therefore myocardial ischemia. Significant reductions in afterload (aortic pressure, <i>P</i>=0.030) and myocardial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> demand were seen (tension-time index, <i>P</i>=0.024; rate-pressure product, <i>P</i>=0.046), as well as an increase in myocardial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> supply (Buckberg index, <i>P</i>=0.017). Exercise reduced peripheral arterial wave reflection (<i>P</i><0.05), which was not further augmented by the administration of nitroglycerin (<i>P</i>=0.648). The observed increases in coronary pressure gradient, stenosis resistance, and flow velocity did not reach statistical significance; however, the diastolic velocity–pressure gradient relation was consistent with a significant increase in relative stenosis severity (k coefficient, <i>P</i><0.0001), in keeping with exercise-induced vasoconstriction of stenosed epicardial segments and dilatation of normal segments, with trends toward reversal with nitroglycerin.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The catheterization laboratory protocol provides a model to study myocardial ischemia and the actions of novel and established antianginal drugs. Administration of nitroglycerin causes changes in the systemic and coronary circulation that combine to reduce myocardial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> demand and to increase supply, thereby attenuating exercise-induced ischemia.

Fructose-driven glycolysis supports anoxia resistance in the naked mole-rat
<p>The African naked mole-rat’s (<i>Heterocephalus glaber</i>) social and subterranean lifestyle generates a hypoxic niche. Under experimental conditions, naked mole-rats tolerate hours of extreme hypoxia and survive 18 minutes of total <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> deprivation (anoxia) without apparent injury. During anoxia, the naked mole-rat switches to anaerobic metabolism fueled by fructose, which is actively accumulated and metabolized to lactate in the brain. Global expression of the GLUT5 fructose transporter and high levels of ketohexokinase were identified as molecular signatures of fructose metabolism. Fructose-driven glycolytic respiration in naked mole-rat tissues avoids feedback inhibition of glycolysis via phosphofructokinase, supporting viability. The metabolic rewiring of glycolysis can circumvent the normally lethal effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> deprivation, a mechanism that could be harnessed to minimize hypoxic damage in human disease.</p>

High-quality graphene via microwave reduction of solution-exfoliated graphene oxide
<p>Efficient exfoliation of graphite in solutions to obtain high-quality graphene flakes is desirable for printable electronics, catalysis, energy storage, and composites. Graphite oxide with large lateral dimensions has an exfoliation yield of ~100%, but it has not been possible to completely remove the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> functional groups so that the reduced form of graphene oxide (GO; reduced form: rGO) remains a highly disordered material. Here we report a simple, rapid method to reduce GO into pristine graphene using 1- to 2-second pulses of microwaves. The desirable structural properties are translated into mobility values of >1000 square centimeters per volt per second in field-effect transistors with microwave-reduced GO (MW-rGO) as the channel material and into particularly high activity for MW-rGO catalyst support toward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> evolution reactions.</p>

High-CO<sub>2</sub>/Hypoxia-Responsive Transcription Factors DkERF24 and DkWRKY1 Interact and Activate <i>DkPDC2</i> Promoter
<p>Identification and functional characterization of hypoxia-responsive transcription factors is important for understanding plant responses to natural anaerobic environments and during storage and transport of fresh horticultural products. In this study, yeast one-hybrid library screening using the persimmon (<i>Diospyros kaki</i>) pyruvate decarboxylase (<i>DkPDC2</i>) promoter identified three ethylene response factor (ERF) genes (<i>DkERF23</i>/<i>DkERF24</i>/<i>DkERF25</i>) and four WRKY transcription factor genes (<i>DkWRKY/DdkWRKY5</i>/<i>DkWRKY6</i>/<i>DkWRKY7</i>) that were differentially expressed in response to high CO<sub>2</sub> (95%, with 4% N<sub>2</sub> and 1% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>) and high N<sub>2</sub> (99% N<sub>2</sub> and 1% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>). Yeast one-hybrid assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that DkERF23, DkERF24, DkERF25, DkWRKY6, and DkWRKY7 could directly bind to the <i>DkPDC2</i> promoter. Dual-luciferase assays confirmed that these transcription factors were capable of transactivating the <i>DkPDC2</i> promoter. DkERF24 and DkWRKY1 in combination synergistically transactivated the <i>DkPDC2</i> promoter, and yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays confirmed protein–protein interaction between DkERF24 and DkWRKY1. Transient overexpression of <i>DkERF24</i> and <i>DkWRKY1</i> separately and in combination in persimmon fruit discs was effective in maintaining insolubilization of tannins, concomitantly with the accumulation of DkPDC2 transcripts. Studies with Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) homologs <i>AtERF1</i> and <i>AtWRKY53</i> indicated that similar protein–protein interactions and synergistic regulatory effects also occur with the <i>DkPDC2</i> promoter. We propose that an ERF and WRKY transcription factor complex contributes to responses to hypoxia in both persimmon fruit and Arabidopsis, and the possibility that this is a general plant response requires further investigation.</p>

A <i>Magnaporthe</i> Chitinase Interacts with a Rice Jacalin-Related Lectin to Promote Host Colonization
<p>The genome of rice blast fungus (<i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>) encodes 15 glycoside hydrolase 18 family chitinases. In this study, we characterized the function of an <i>M. oryzae</i> extracellular chitinase, MoChi1, and its interaction with a host protein, OsMBL1, a jacalin-related Mannose-Binding Lectin (MBL) in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). Deletion of <i>MoChi1</i> resulted in reduced aerial hyphal formation and reduced virulence in rice by activating the expression of defense-responsive genes. We confirmed MoChi1 interaction with rice OsMBL1 in vitro and in vivo. <i>OsMBL1</i> was induced by pathogen-associated molecular patterns and <i>M. oryzae</i> infection. Overexpression of <i>OsMBL1</i> led to activation of rice defense-responsive genes and a chitin-induced reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species burst, thereby enhancing resistance to <i>M. oryzae</i>. Knockdown of <i>OsMBL1</i> enhances susceptibility of rice plants to <i>M. oryzae</i>. Furthermore, MoChi1 suppressed chitin-induced reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species in rice cells and competed with OsMBL1 for chitin binding. Taken together, our study reveals a mechanism in which MoChi1 targets a host lectin to suppress rice immunity.</p>

What Quantity of Photosystem I Is Optimum for Safe Photosynthesis?
<p>PSI has the potential to generate reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species and be oxidatively inactivated by the reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species. The photo-oxidative damage of PSI (also called PSI photoinhibition) causes the inhibition of the plant growth and is a lethal event for plants. It has been reported that PSI photoinhibition does not occur as long as the reaction-center chlorophyll (P700) remains oxidized, even in excess light conditions. This process is termed P700 oxidation and is supported by various regulatory mechanisms and likely also by the stoichiometric quantities of photosynthetic apparatus. In this study, we assessed how decreased photochemically active PSI in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) affected a variety of photosynthetic parameters, including P700 oxidation. Inactivation of PSI was rapidly and selectively induced by repetitive short-pulse illumination. PSI photoinhibition correlated linearly with decreases in effective quantum yield of PSII and nonphotochemical quenching; however, the photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate was less affected, as exemplified by ∼50% of the normal CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate maintained with an 80% loss in PSI photochemical activity. In contrast, effective quantum yield of PSI was enhanced following PSI photoinhibition, mainly owing to a decrease in the electron donor-side limitation of PSI. Based on these results, we propose that the stoichiometric quantity of PSI is optimized to induce P700 oxidation for dissipating excess light energy in PSI, thus avoiding inhibition of photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation caused by PSI photoinhibition.</p>

Phosphate Starvation Alters Abiotic-Stress-Induced Cytosolic Free Calcium Increases in Roots
<p>Phosphate (Pi) deficiency strongly limits plant growth, and plant roots foraging the soil for nutrients need to adapt to optimize Pi uptake. Ca<sup>2+</sup> is known to signal in root development and adaptation but has to be tightly controlled, as it is highly toxic to Pi metabolism. Under Pi starvation and the resulting decreased cellular Pi pool, the use of cytosolic free Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub>) as a signal transducer may therefore have to be altered. Employing aequorin-expressing Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), we show that Pi starvation, but not nitrogen starvation, strongly dampens the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> increases evoked by mechanical, salt, osmotic, and oxidative stress as well as by extracellular nucleotides. The altered root [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> response to extracellular ATP manifests during seedling development under chronic Pi deprivation but can be reversed by Pi resupply. Employing ratiometric imaging, we delineate that Pi-starved roots have a normal response to extracellular ATP at the apex but show a strongly dampened [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> response in distal parts of the root tip, correlating with high reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species levels induced by Pi starvation. Excluding iron, as well as Pi, rescues this altered [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> response and restores reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species levels to those seen under nutrient-replete conditions. These results indicate that, while Pi availability does not seem to be signaled through [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub>, Pi starvation strongly affects stress-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> signatures. These data reveal how plants can integrate nutritional and environmental cues, adding another layer of complexity to the use of Ca<sup>2+</sup> as a signal transducer.</p>

Guard Cell Salicylic Acid Signaling Is Integrated into Abscisic Acid Signaling via the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CPK-Dependent Pathway
<p>The phenolic hormone salicylic acid (SA) induces stomatal closure. It has been suggested that SA signaling is integrated with abscisic acid (ABA) signaling in guard cells, but the integration mechanism remains unclear. The Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent protein kinase Open Stomata1 (OST1) and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein kinases (CPKs) are key for ABA-induced activation of the slow-type anion channel SLAC1 and stomatal closure. Here, we show that SA-induced stomatal closure and SA activation of slow-type anion channel are impaired in the CPK disruption mutant <i>cpk3-2 cpk6-1</i> but not in the OST1 disruption mutant <i>ost1-3</i>. We also found that the key phosphorylation sites of SLAC1 in ABA signaling, serine-59 and serine-120, also are important for SA signaling. Chemiluminescence-based detection of superoxide anion revealed that SA did not require CPK3 and CPK6 for the induction of reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species production. Taken together, our results suggest that SA activates peroxidase-mediated reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species signal that is integrated into Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CPK-dependent ABA signaling branch but not the OST1-dependent signaling branch in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) guard cells.</p>

Roles of Receptor-Like Cytoplasmic Kinase VII Members in Pattern-Triggered Immune Signaling
<p>Pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), which consist of receptor kinases (RKs) and receptor-like proteins, sense microbe- and host-derived molecular patterns associated with pathogen infection to trigger immune responses in plants. Several kinases of the 46-member Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase (RLCK) subfamily VII play important roles in pattern-triggered immunity, but it is unclear whether different RLCK VII members act specifically or redundantly in immune signaling. Here, we constructed nine higher order mutants of this subfamily (named <i>rlck vii-1</i> to <i>rlck vii-9</i>) and systematically characterized their immune phenotypes. The mutants <i>rlck vii-5</i>, -<i>7</i>, and -<i>8</i> had compromised reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species production in response to all patterns tested, indicating that the corresponding members are broadly required for the signaling of multiple PRRs. However, <i>rlck vii-4</i> was defective specifically in chitin-induced reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species production, suggesting that RCLK VII-4 members mediate the signaling of specific PRRs. Furthermore, RLCK VII-4 members were required for the chitin-triggered activation of MAPK, demonstrating that these kinases link a PRR to MAPK activation. Moreover, we found that RLCK VII-6 and -8 also were required for RK-mediated root growth. Together, these results show that numerous RLCK VII members are involved in pattern-triggered immune signaling and uncover both common and specific roles of these kinases in plant development and immunity mediated by various RKs.</p>

Oxidation of Translation Factor EF-Tu Inhibits the Repair of Photosystem II<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The repair of photosystem II (PSII) is particularly sensitive to oxidative stress and the inhibition of repair is associated with oxidative damage to the translational elongation system in the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this inhibition are unknown. We previously demonstrated in vitro that EF-Tu, a translation factor that delivers aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosome, is inactivated by reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species via oxidation of the Cys residue Cys-82. In this study, we examined the physiological role of the oxidation of EF-Tu in <i>Synechocystis</i>. Under strong light, EF-Tu was rapidly oxidized to yield oxidized monomers in vivo. We generated a <i>Synechocystis</i> transformant that expressed mutated EF-Tu in which Cys-82 had been replaced with a Ser residue. Under strong light, the de novo synthesis of proteins that are required for PSII repair, such as D1, was enhanced in the transformant and photoinhibition of PSII was alleviated. However, photodamage to PSII, measured in the presence of lincomycin, was similar between the transformant and wild-type cells, suggesting that expression of mutated EF-Tu might enhance the repair of PSII. Alleviating photoinhibition through mutation of EF-Tu did not alter cell growth under strong light, perhaps due to the enhanced production of reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species. These observations suggest that the oxidation of EF-Tu under strong light inhibits PSII repair, resulting in the stimulation of photoinhibition.</p>

Gene Regulation and Survival under Hypoxia Requires Starch Availability and Metabolism
<p>Plants respond to hypoxia, often caused by submergence, by expressing a specific set of genes that contribute to acclimation to this unfavorable environmental condition. Genes induced by low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> include those encoding enzymes for carbohydrate metabolism and fermentation, pathways that are required for survival. Sugar availability is therefore of crucial importance for energy production under hypoxia. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants require starch for surviving submergence as well as for ensuring the rapid induction of genes encoding enzymes required for anaerobic metabolism. The starchless <i>pgm</i> mutant is highly susceptible to submergence and also fails to induce anaerobic genes at the level of the wild type. Treating wild-type plants under conditions inducing sugar starvation results in a weak induction of alcohol dehydrogenase and other anaerobic genes. Induction of gene expression under hypoxia requires transcription factors belonging to group VII ethylene response factors (ERF-VII) that, together with plant Cys oxidases, act as an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>-sensing mechanism. We show that repression of this pathway by sugar starvation occurs downstream of the hypoxia-dependent stabilization of ERF-VII proteins and independently of the energy sensor protein kinases SnRK1.1 (SNF1-related kinase 1.1).</p>

Carnosic Acid and Carnosol, Two Major Antioxidants of Rosemary, Act through Different Mechanisms
<p>Carnosic acid, a phenolic diterpene specific to the Lamiaceae family, is highly abundant in rosemary (<i>Rosmarinus officinalis</i>). Despite numerous industrial and medicinal/pharmaceutical applications of its antioxidative features, this compound in planta and its antioxidant mechanism have received little attention, except a few studies of rosemary plants under natural conditions. In vitro analyses, using high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet and luminescence imaging, revealed that carnosic acid and its major oxidized derivative, carnosol, protect lipids from oxidation. Both compounds preserved linolenic acid and monogalactosyldiacylglycerol from singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> and from hydroxyl radical. When applied exogenously, they were both able to protect thylakoid membranes prepared from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves against lipid peroxidation. Different levels of carnosic acid and carnosol in two contrasting rosemary varieties correlated with tolerance to lipid peroxidation. Upon reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species (ROS) oxidation of lipids, carnosic acid was consumed and oxidized into various derivatives, including into carnosol, while carnosol resisted, suggesting that carnosic acid is a chemical quencher of ROS. The antioxidative function of carnosol relies on another mechanism, occurring directly in the lipid oxidation process. Under oxidative conditions that did not involve ROS generation, carnosol inhibited lipid peroxidation, contrary to carnosic acid. Using spin probes and electron paramagnetic resonance detection, we confirmed that carnosic acid, rather than carnosol, is a ROS quencher. Various oxidized derivatives of carnosic acid were detected in rosemary leaves in low light, indicating chronic oxidation of this compound, and accumulated in plants exposed to stress conditions, in parallel with a loss of carnosic acid, confirming that chemical quenching of ROS by carnosic acid takes place in planta.</p>

Paralogs of the C-Terminal Domain of the Cyanobacterial Orange Carotenoid Protein Are Carotenoid Donors to Helical Carotenoid Proteins
<p>The photoactive Orange Carotenoid Protein (OCP) photoprotects cyanobacteria cells by quenching singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> and excess excitation energy. Its N-terminal domain is the active part of the protein, and the C-terminal domain regulates the activity. Recently, the characteristics of a family of soluble carotenoid-binding proteins (Helical Carotenoid Proteins [HCPs]), paralogs of the N-terminal domain of OCP, were described. Bioinformatics studies also revealed the existence of genes coding for homologs of CTD. Here, we show that the latter genes encode carotenoid proteins (CTDHs). This family of proteins contains two subgroups with distinct characteristics. One CTDH of each clade was further characterized, and they proved to be very good singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> quenchers. When synthesized in <i>Escherichia coli</i> or <i>Synechocystis</i> PCC 6803, CTDHs formed dimers that share a carotenoid molecule and are able to transfer their carotenoid to apo-HCPs and apo-OCP. The CTDHs from clade 2 have a cysteine in position 103. A disulfide bond is easily formed between the monomers of the dimer preventing carotenoid transfer. This suggests that the transfer of the carotenoid could be redox regulated in clade 2 CTDH. We also demonstrate here that apo-OCPs and apo-CTDHs are able to take the carotenoid directly from membranes, while HCPs are unable to do so. HCPs need the presence of CTDH to become holo-proteins. We propose that, in cyanobacteria, the CTDHs are carotenoid donors to HCPs.</p>

Histone Deacetylase Is Required for GA-Induced Programmed Cell Death in Maize Aleurone Layers
<p>Recent discoveries have shown that epigenetic regulation is an integral part of phytohormone-mediated processes. The phytohormone gibberellin (GA) triggers a series of events in cereal aleurone cells that lead to programmed cell death (PCD), but the signaling cascade mediating GA-induced PCD in cereal aleurone layers remains largely unknown. Here, we showed that histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity gradually increased relative to histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity, leading to a global decrease in histone H3 and H4 acetylation levels during PCD of maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) embryoless aleurone layers after 3 d of treatment with GA. HDAC inhibition prevented GA-induced PCD in embryoless aleurone cells, whereas HAT inhibition resulted in PCD even in the absence of GA. Hydrogen peroxide concentrations increased in GA- or HAT inhibitor-treated aleurone cells due to reduced levels of reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species scavengers. Hydrogen peroxide-treated aleurone cells showed no changes in the activity or expression of HATs and HDACs. We show that it is possible to predict whether epigenetic modification enzymes serve as a regulator of the GA-triggered PCD signaling pathway in maize aleurone layers. Taken together, these findings reveal that HDAC activity is required for GA-induced PCD in maize aleurone layers and regulates PCD via the reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species-mediated signal transduction pathway.</p>

Temperature-Induced Remodeling of the Photosynthetic Machinery Tunes Photosynthesis in the Thermophilic Alga <i>Cyanidioschyzon merolae</i>
<p>The thermophilic alga <i>C. merolae</i> thrives in extreme environments (low pH and temperature between 40°C and 56°C). In this study, we investigated the acclimation process of the alga to a colder temperature (25°C). A long-term cell growth experiment revealed an extensive remodeling of the photosynthetic apparatus in the first 250 h of acclimation, which was followed by cell growth to an even higher density than the control (grown at 42°C) cell density. Once the cells were shifted to the lower temperature, the proteins of the light-harvesting antenna were greatly down-regulated and the phycobilisome composition was altered. The amount of PSI and PSII subunits was also decreased, but the chlorophyll to photosystems ratio remained unchanged. The 25°C cells possessed a less efficient photon-to-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> conversion rate and require a 2.5 times higher light intensity to reach maximum photosynthetic efficiency. With respect to chlorophyll, however, the photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> evolution rate of the 25°C culture was 2 times higher than the control. Quantitative proteomics revealed that acclimation requires, besides remodeling of the photosynthetic apparatus, also adjustment of the machinery for protein folding, degradation, and homeostasis. In summary, these remodeling processes tuned photosynthesis according to the demands placed on the system and revealed the capability of <i>C. merolae</i> to grow under a broad range of temperatures.</p>

The <i>Synechocystis</i> Manganese Exporter Mnx Is Essential for Manganese Homeostasis in Cyanobacteria
<p>The essential micronutrient manganese (Mn) functions as redox-active cofactor in active sites of enzymes and, thus, is involved in various physiological reactions. Moreover, in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ic photosynthetic organisms, Mn is of special importance, since it is central to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>-evolving complex in photosystem II. Although Mn is an essential micronutrient, increased amounts are detrimental to the organism; thus, only a small window exists for beneficial concentrations. Accordingly, Mn homeostasis must be carefully maintained. In contrast to the well-studied uptake mechanisms in cyanobacteria, it is largely unknown how Mn is distributed to the different compartments inside the cell. We identified a protein with so far unknown function as a hypothetical Mn transporter in the cyanobacterial model strain <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 and named this protein Mnx for Mn exporter. The knockout mutant Δ<i>mnx</i> showed increased sensitivity toward externally supplied Mn and Mn toxicity symptoms, which could be linked to intracellular Mn accumulation. <sup>54</sup>Mn chase experiments demonstrated that the mutant was not able to release Mn from the internal pool. Microscopic analysis of a Mnx::yellow fluorescent protein fusion showed that the protein resides in the thylakoid membrane. Heterologous expression of <i>mnx</i> suppressed the Mn-sensitive phenotype of the <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> mutant Δ<i>pmr1</i>. Our results indicate that Mnx functions as a thylakoid Mn transporter and is a key player in maintaining Mn homeostasis in <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803. We propose that Mn export from the cytoplasm into the thylakoid lumen is crucial to prevent toxic cytoplasmic Mn accumulation and to ensure Mn provision to photosystem II.</p>

Jasmonate Regulates Plant Responses to Postsubmergence Reoxygenation through Transcriptional Activation of Antioxidant Synthesis
<p>Submergence induces hypoxia in plants; exposure to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> following submergence, termed re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ation, produces a burst of reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species. The mechanisms of hypoxia sensing and signaling in plants have been well studied, but how plants respond to re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ation remains unclear. Here, we show that re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) involves rapid accumulation of jasmonates (JAs) and increased transcript levels of JA biosynthesis genes. Application of exogenous methyl jasmonate improved tolerance to re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ation in wild-type Arabidopsis; also, mutants deficient in JA biosynthesis and signaling were very sensitive to re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ation. Moreover, overexpression of the transcription factor gene <i>MYC2</i> enhanced tolerance to posthypoxic stress, and <i>myc2</i> knockout mutants showed increased sensitivity to re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ation, indicating that MYC2 functions as a key regulator in the JA-mediated re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ation response. MYC2 transcriptionally activates members of the <i>VITAMIN C DEFECTIVE</i> (<i>VTC</i>) and <i>GLUTATHIONE SYNTHETASE</i> (<i>GSH</i>) gene families, which encode rate-limiting enzymes in the ascorbate and glutathione synthesis pathways. Overexpression of <i>VTC1</i> and <i>GSH1</i> in the <i>myc2-2</i> mutant suppressed the posthypoxic hypersensitive phenotype. The JA-inducible accumulation of antioxidants may alleviate oxidative damage caused by re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ation, improving plant survival after submergence. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that JA signaling interacts with the antioxidant pathway to regulate re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ation responses in Arabidopsis.</p>

Control of Autophagy in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> Is Mediated through Redox-Dependent Inactivation of the ATG4 Protease<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Autophagy is a major catabolic pathway by which eukaryotic cells deliver unnecessary or damaged cytoplasmic material to the vacuole for its degradation and recycling in order to maintain cellular homeostasis. Control of autophagy has been associated with the production of reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species in several organisms, including plants and algae, but the precise regulatory molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that the ATG4 protease, an essential protein for autophagosome biogenesis, plays a central role for the redox regulation of autophagy in the model green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>. Our results indicate that the activity of <i>C. reinhardtii</i> ATG4 is regulated by the formation of a single disulfide bond with a low redox potential that can be efficiently reduced by the NADPH/thioredoxin system. Moreover, we found that treatment of <i>C. reinhardtii</i> cells with norflurazon, an inhibitor of carotenoid biosynthesis that generates reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species and triggers autophagy in this alga, promotes the oxidation and aggregation of ATG4. We propose that the activity of the ATG4 protease is finely regulated by the intracellular redox state, and it is inhibited under stress conditions to ensure lipidation of ATG8 and thus autophagy progression in <i>C. reinhardtii</i>.</p>

Cell-Type-Specific H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase Activity in Root Tissues Enables K<sup>+</sup> Retention and Mediates Acclimation of Barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) to Salinity Stress
<p>While the importance of cell type specificity in plant adaptive responses is widely accepted, only a limited number of studies have addressed this issue at the functional level. We have combined electrophysiological, imaging, and biochemical techniques to reveal the physiological mechanisms conferring higher sensitivity of apical root cells to salinity in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>). We show that salinity application to the root apex arrests root growth in a highly tissue- and treatment-specific manner. Although salinity-induced transient net Na<sup>+</sup> uptake was about 4-fold higher in the root apex compared with the mature zone, mature root cells accumulated more cytosolic and vacuolar Na<sup>+</sup>, suggesting that the higher sensitivity of apical cells to salt is not related to either enhanced Na<sup>+</sup> exclusion or sequestration inside the root. Rather, the above differential sensitivity between the two zones originates from a 10-fold difference in K<sup>+</sup> efflux between the mature zone and the apical region (much poorer in the root apex) of the root. Major factors contributing to this poor K<sup>+</sup> retention ability are (1) an intrinsically lower H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity in the root apex, (2) greater salt-induced membrane depolarization, and (3) a higher reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species production under NaCl and a larger density of reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species-activated cation currents in the apex. Salinity treatment increased (2- to 5-fold) the content of 10 (out of 25 detected) amino acids in the root apex but not in the mature zone and changed the organic acid and sugar contents. The causal link between the observed changes in the root metabolic profile and the regulation of transporter activity is discussed.</p>

Oxidation of P700 in Photosystem I Is Essential for the Growth of Cyanobacteria
<p>The photoinhibition of photosystem I (PSI) is lethal to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ic phototrophs. Nevertheless, it is unclear how photodamage occurs or how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ic phototrophs prevent it. Here, we provide evidence that keeping P700 (the reaction center chlorophyll in PSI) oxidized protects PSI. Previous studies have suggested that PSI photoinhibition does not occur in the two model cyanobacteria, <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 and <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> PCC 7942, when photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> fixation was suppressed under low CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure even in mutants deficient in flavodiiron protein (FLV), which mediates alternative electron flow. The lack of FLV in <i>Synechococcus</i> sp. PCC 7002 (S. 7002), however, is linked directly to reduced growth and PSI photodamage under CO<sub>2</sub>-limiting conditions. Unlike <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 and <i>S. elongatus</i> PCC 7942, S. 7002 reduced P700 during CO<sub>2</sub>-limited illumination in the absence of FLV, resulting in decreases in both PSI and photosynthetic activities. Even at normal air CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, the growth of S. 7002 mutant was retarded relative to that of the wild type. Therefore, P700 oxidation is essential for protecting PSI against photoinhibition. Here, we present various strategies to alleviate PSI photoinhibition in cyanobacteria.</p>

Phytoglobins Improve Hypoxic Root Growth by Alleviating Apical Meristem Cell Death
<p>Hypoxic root growth in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) is influenced by the expression of phytoglobins (<i>ZmPgbs</i>). Relative to the wild type, suppression of <i>ZmPgb1.1</i> or <i>ZmPgb1.2</i> inhibits the growth of roots exposed to 4% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>, causing structural abnormalities in the root apical meristems. These effects were accompanied by increasing levels of reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species (ROS), possibly through the transcriptional induction of four <i>Respiratory Burst Oxidase Homologs</i>. TUNEL-positive nuclei in meristematic cells indicated the involvement of programmed cell death (PCD) in the process. These cells also accumulated nitric oxide and stained heavily for ethylene biosynthetic transcripts. A sharp increase in the expression level of several 1-aminocyclopropane synthase (<i>ZmAcs2</i>, <i>ZmAcs6</i>, and <i>ZmAcs7</i>), 1-aminocyclopropane oxidase (<i>Aco15</i>, <i>Aco20</i>, <i>Aco31</i>, and <i>Aco35</i>), and ethylene-responsive (<i>ZmErf2</i> and <i>ZmEbf1</i>) genes was observed in hypoxic <i>ZmPgb</i>-suppressing roots, which overproduced ethylene. Inhibiting ROS synthesis with diphenyleneiodonium or ethylene perception with 1-methylcyclopropene suppressed PCD, increased <i>BAX inhibitor-1</i>, an effective attenuator of the death programs in eukaryotes, and restored root growth. Hypoxic roots overexpressing <i>ZmPgbs</i> had the lowest level of ethylene and showed a reduction in ROS staining and TUNEL-positive nuclei in the meristematic cells. These roots retained functional meristems and exhibited the highest growth performance when subjected to hypoxic conditions. Collectively, these results suggest a novel function of Pgbs in protecting root apical meristems from hypoxia-induced PCD through mechanisms initiated by nitric oxide and mediated by ethylene via ROS.</p>

A NAC Transcription Factor Represses Putrescine Biosynthesis and Affects Drought Tolerance
<p>Arginine decarboxylase (ADC)-mediated putrescine biosynthesis plays an important role in plant stress responses, but the transcriptional regulation of <i>ADC</i> in response to abiotic stress is not well understood. We isolated a NAM, ATAF1/2, and CUC (NAC) domain-containing transcription factor, PtrNAC72, from trifoliate orange (<i>Poncirus trifoliata</i>) by yeast one-hybrid screening. PtrNAC72, localized to the nucleus, binds specifically to the promoter of <i>PtADC</i> and acts as a transcriptional repressor. <i>PtrNAC72</i> expression was induced by cold, drought, and abscisic acid. <i>ADC</i> messenger RNA abundance and putrescine levels were decreased in transgenic tobacco (<i>Nicotiana nudicaulis</i>) plants overexpressing <i>PtrNAC72</i> but increased, compared with the wild type, in an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) transfer DNA insertion mutant, <i>nac72</i>. While transgenic tobacco lines overexpressing <i>PtrNAC72</i> were more sensitive to drought, plants of the Arabidopsis <i>nac72</i> mutant exhibited enhanced drought tolerance, consistent with the accumulation of reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species in the tested genotypes. In addition, exogenous application of putrescine to the overexpression lines restored drought tolerance, while treatment with <sc>d</sc>-arginine, an ADC inhibitor, compromised the drought tolerance of <i>nac72</i>. Taken together, these results demonstrate that PtrNAC72 is a repressor of putrescine biosynthesis and may negatively regulate the drought stress response, at least in part, via the modulation of putrescine-associated reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species homeostasis.</p>

Unusual Diversity of Myoglobin Genes in the Lungfish
<p>Myoglobin is a respiratory protein that serves as a model system in a variety of biological fields. Its main function is to deliver and store O<sub>2</sub> in the heart and skeletal muscles, but myoglobin is also instrumental in homeostasis of nitric oxide (NO) and detoxification of reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species (ROS). Almost every vertebrate harbors a single myoglobin gene; only some cyprinid fishes have two recently duplicated myoglobin genes. Here we show that the West African lungfish <i>Protopterus annectens</i> has at least seven distinct myoglobin genes (<i>PanMb1–7</i>), which diverged early in the evolution of lungfish and showed an enhanced evolutionary rate. These myoglobins are lungfish specific, and no other globin gene was found amplified. The myoglobins are differentially expressed in various lungfish tissues, and the brain is the main site of myoglobin expression. The typical myoglobin-containing tissues, the skeletal muscle and the heart, have much lower myoglobin mRNA levels. Muscle and heart express distinct myoglobins (<i>PanMb1</i> and <i>PanMb3</i>, respectively). In cell culture, lungfish myoglobins improved cellular survival under hypoxia albeit with different efficiencies and reduced the production of reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species. Only <i>Mb2</i> and <i>Mb6</i> enhanced the energy status of the cells. The unexpected diversity of myoglobin hints to a functional diversification of this gene: some myoglobins may have adapted to the O<sub>2</sub> requirements of the specific tissue and help the lungfish to survive hypoxic periods; other myoglobins may have taken over the roles of neuroglobin and cytoglobin, which appear to be missing in the West African lungfish.</p>

Periodic heartbeat reversals cause cardiogenic inspiration and expiration with coupled spiracle leakage in resting blowflies, <i>Calliphora vicina</i>
<p>Respiration in insects is thought to be independent of the circulatory system because insects typically lack respiratory pigments and because <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> transport occurs in the gaseous phase through a ramified tracheal system by diffusion and convection directly to the tissues. In the blowfly, as in other insects with periodic heartbeat reversal, the haemolymph is periodically shifted between the anterior body and abdomen, exerting alternating pressure changes on the compliant tracheae in the thorax and in the abdomen. Simultaneous pressure and O<sub>2</sub> optode measurements show that, during negative pressure periods, the tracheal partial pressure of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> (<i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) increases by 0.5 kPa. In the quiescent fly, tracheal <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> is rather high (17.5–18.9 kPa), although the thoracic spiracles remain constricted. Microscopic video recordings and reflectance measurements revealed that the dorsal soft edges of the valve lips of the second spiracle leave a very small leak, which is passively widened during backward pulses of the heart. Thus, negative pressure, combined with increased leakage of the spiracle Sp2 valve enable inspiration in the thorax. The positive pressure periods are correlated with a new type of convective CO<sub>2</sub> micro-bursts as shown in flow-through measurements. The bulk of the CO<sub>2</sub> is, however, released after longer interbursts in macro-bursts with actively opening valves reminiscent of the open phase in a cyclic gas exchange. When the valves open, the <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> in the thoracic air sacs unexpectedly drops by a mean of 2.75±1.09 kPa, suggesting a displacement of O<sub>2</sub> by the transient accumulation of CO<sub>2</sub> in the tracheal system before its release.</p>

Reduction of blood oxygen levels enhances postprandial cardiac hypertrophy in Burmese python (<i>Python bivittatus</i>)
<p>Physiological cardiac hypertrophy is characterized by reversible enlargement of cardiomyocytes and changes in chamber architecture, which increase stroke volume and [Formula] via augmented convective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> transport. Cardiac hypertrophy is known to occur in response to repeated elevations of O<sub>2</sub> demand and/or reduced O<sub>2</sub> supply in several species of vertebrate ectotherms, including postprandial Burmese pythons (<i>Python bivittatus</i>). Recent data suggest postprandial cardiac hypertrophy in <i>P. bivittatus</i> is a facultative rather than obligatory response to digestion, though the triggers of this response are unknown. Here, we hypothesized that an O<sub>2</sub> supply–demand mismatch stimulates postprandial cardiac enlargement in Burmese pythons. To test this hypothesis, we rendered animals anemic prior to feeding, essentially halving blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> content during the postprandial period. Fed anemic animals had heart rates 126% higher than those of fasted controls, which, coupled with a 71% increase in mean arterial pressure, suggests fed anemic animals were experiencing significantly elevated cardiac work. We found significant cardiac hypertrophy in fed anemic animals, which exhibited ventricles 39% larger than those of fasted controls and 28% larger than in fed controls. These findings support our hypothesis that those animals with a greater magnitude of O<sub>2</sub> supply–demand mismatch exhibit the largest hearts. The ‘low O<sub>2</sub> signal’ stimulating postprandial cardiac hypertrophy is likely mediated by elevated ventricular wall stress associated with postprandial hemodynamics.</p>

Molecular and functional characterization of hemocyanin of the giant African millipede, <i>Archispirostreptus gigas</i>
<p>In contrast to other terrestrial arthropods, where gaseous O<sub>2</sub> that fuels aerobic metabolism diffuses to the tissues in tracheal tubes, and most other metazoans, where O<sub>2</sub> is transported to tissues by circulating respiratory proteins, the myriapods (millipedes and centipedes) strikingly have tracheal systems as well as circulating hemocyanin (Hc). In order to elucidate the evolutionary origin and biological significance of millipede Hc, we report the molecular structure (subunit composition and amino acid sequence) of multimeric (36-mer) Hc from the forest floor-dwelling giant African millipede <i>Archispirostreptus gigas</i> and its allosteric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>-binding properties under various physico-chemical conditions. <i>Archispirostreptus gigas</i> Hc consists of only a single subunit type with differential glycosylation. Phylogenic analysis revealed that millipede Hc is a sister group to centipede HcA, which supports an early divergence of distinct Hc subunits in myriapods and an ancient origin of multimeric Hcs. <i>Archispirostreptus gigas</i> Hc binds O<sub>2</sub> with a high affinity and shows a strong Bohr effect. O<sub>2</sub> binding is, moreover, modulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, which increase the O<sub>2</sub> affinity of the Hc in the tense (T; de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ated) as well as the relaxed (R; <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ated) states, and by (<sc>l</sc>)-lactate, which modulates Hc–O<sub>2</sub> affinity by changing the allosteric equilibrium constant, <i>L</i>. Cooperativity in O<sub>2</sub> binding at half O<sub>2</sub> saturation (<i>n</i><sub>50</sub>) is pH dependent and maximal at ~pH 7.4, and the number of interacting O<sub>2</sub>-binding sites (<i>q</i>) is markedly increased by binding Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The data are discussed in the light of the mutually supplementary roles of Hc and the tracheal system for tissue O<sub>2</sub> supply.</p>

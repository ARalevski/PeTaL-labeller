A MicroRNA93–Interferon Regulatory Factor-9–Immunoresponsive Gene-1–Itaconic Acid Pathway Modulates M2-Like Macrophage Polarization to Revascularize Ischemic Muscle
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Currently, no therapies exist for treating and improving outcomes in patients with severe peripheral artery disease (PAD). MicroRNA93 (miR93) has been shown to favorably modulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s and to reduce tissue loss in genetic PAD models. However, the cell-specific function, downstream mechanisms, or signaling involved in miR93-mediated ischemic muscle neovascularization is not clear. Macrophages were best known to modulate arteriogenic response in PAD, and the extent of arteriogenic response induced by macrophages is dependent on greater M2 to M1 activation/polarization state. In the present study, we identified a novel mechanism by which miR93 regulates macrophage polarization to promote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s and arteriogenesis to revascularize ischemic muscle in experimental PAD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In vitro (macrophages, endothelial cells, skeletal muscle cells under normal and hypoxia serum starvation conditions) and in vivo experiments in preclinical PAD models (unilateral femoral artery ligation and resection) were conducted to examine the role of miR93-interferon regulatory factor-9–immunoresponsive gene-1 (IRG1)–itaconic acid pathway in macrophage polarization, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s, arteriogenesis, and perfusion recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In vivo, compared with wild-type controls, miR106b-93-25 cluster–deficient mice (miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup>) showed decreased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s and arteriogenesis correlating with increased M1-like macrophages after experimental PAD. Intramuscular delivery of miR93 in miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup> PAD mice increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s, arteriogenesis, and the extent of perfusion, which correlated with more M2-like macrophages in the proximal and distal hind-limb muscles. In vitro, miR93 promotes and sustains M2-like polarization even under M1-like polarizing conditions (hypoxia serum starvation). Delivery of bone marrow–derived macrophages from miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup> to wild-type ischemic muscle decreased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s, arteriogenesis, and perfusion, whereas transfer of wild-type macrophages to miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup> had the opposite effect. Systematic analysis of top differentially upregulated genes from RNA sequencing between miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup> and wild-type ischemic muscle showed that miR93 regulates IRG1 function to modulate itaconic acid production and macrophage polarization. The 3′ untranslated region luciferase assays performed to determine whether IRG1 is a direct target of miR93 revealed that IRG1 is not an miR93 target but that interferon regulatory factor-9, which can regulate IRG1 expression, is an miR93 target. In vitro, increased expression of interferon regulatory factor-9 and IRG1 and itaconic acid treatment significantly decreased endothelial angiogenic potential.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>miR93 inhibits interferon regulatory factor-9 to decrease IRG1–itaconic acid production to induce M2-like polarization in ischemic muscle to enhance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s, arteriogenesis, and perfusion recovery in experimental PAD.</p></sec>

Vascular Endothelial Cell Growth–Activated XBP1 Splicing in Endothelial Cells Is Crucial for Angiogenesis
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Vascular endothelial cell growth factor plays a pivotal role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s via regulating endothelial cell proliferation. The X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) is believed to be a signal transducer in the endoplasmic reticulum stress response. It is unknown whether there is crosstalk between vascular endothelial cell growth factor signaling and XBP1 pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We found that vascular endothelial cell growth factor induced the kinase insert domain receptor internalization and interaction through C-terminal domain with the unspliced XBP1 and the inositol requiring enzyme 1 α in the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to inositol requiring enzyme 1 α phosphorylation and XBP1 mRNA splicing, which was abolished by siRNA-mediated knockdown of kinase insert domain receptor. Spliced XBP1 regulated endothelial cell proliferation in a PI3K/Akt/GSK3β/β-catenin/E2F2–dependent manner and modulated the cell size increase in a PI3K/Akt/GSK3β/β-catenin/E2F2–independent manner. Knockdown of XBP1 or inositol requiring enzyme 1 α decreased endothelial cell proliferation via suppression of Akt/GSK3β phosphorylation, β-catenin nuclear translocation, and E2F2 expression. Endothelial cell–specific knockout of XBP1 (<i>XBP1ecko</i>) in mice retarded the retinal vasculogenesis in the first 2 postnatal weeks and impaired the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s triggered by ischemia. Reconstitution of XBP1 by Ad-XBP1s gene transfer significantly improved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s in ischemic tissue in <i>XBP1ecko</i> mice. Transplantation of bone marrow from wild-type o <i>XBP1ecko</i> mice could also slightly improve the foot blood reperfusion in ischemic <i>XBP1ecko</i> mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>These results suggest that XBP1 can function via growth factor signaling pathways to regulate endothelial proliferation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s.</p></sec>

Phosphoproteomic Analysis Implicates the mTORC2-FoxO1 Axis in VEGF Signaling and Feedback Activation of Receptor Tyrosine Kinases
<sec><title>Combining Forces Against <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s</title><p>Pathological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s contributes to the growth of solid tumors, which has led to the development of several antiangiogenic therapies that target the VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) signaling pathway, which promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s. Zhuang <i>et al</i>. mapped the signaling networks activated in endothelial cells by VEGF through its receptor tyrosine kinases and found that VEGF promoted the survival of endothelial cells by stimulating the kinase activity of PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) and of mTORC2 (mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2). Because VEGF-activated endothelial cells exposed to mTOR kinase inhibitors exhibited increased activity of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases and PI3K, the cells were less susceptible to the toxic effects of mTOR inhibition. However, combining mTOR and PI3K inhibitors effectively reduced endothelial cell survival. Thus, understanding the signaling pathways that are activated by VEGF can identify potential therapeutic strategies to treat pathological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s.</p></sec>

Hypoxic cancer–associated fibroblasts increase NCBP2-AS2/HIAR to promote endothelial sprouting through enhanced VEGF signaling
<p>Intratumoral hypoxia causes the formation of dysfunctional blood vessels, which contribute to tumor metastasis and reduce the efficacy of therapeutic treatments. Blood vessels are embedded in the tumor stroma of which cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) constitute a prominent cellular component. We found that hypoxic human mammary CAFs promoted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s in CAF-endothelial cell cocultures in vitro. Mass spectrometry–based proteomic analysis of the CAF secretome unraveled that hypoxic CAFs contributed to blood vessel abnormalities by altering their secretion of various pro- and anti-angiogenic factors. Hypoxia induced pronounced remodeling of the CAF proteome, including proteins that have not been previously related to this process. Among those, the uncharacterized protein NCBP2-AS2 that we renamed HIAR (hypoxia-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s regulator) was the protein most increased in abundance in hypoxic CAFs. Silencing of HIAR abrogated the pro-angiogenic and pro-migratory function of hypoxic CAFs by decreasing secretion of the pro-angiogenic factor VEGFA and consequently reducing VEGF/VEGFR downstream signaling in the endothelial cells. Our study has identified a regulator of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s and provides a map of hypoxia-induced molecular alterations in mammary CAFs.</p>

Nrf2 inactivation enhances placental angiogenesis in a preeclampsia mouse model and improves maternal and fetal outcomes
<p>Placental activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a key role in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are thought to affect placental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s, which is critical for preventing preeclampsia pathology. We examined the role of ROS in preeclampsia by genetically modifying the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway, a cellular antioxidant defense system, in a mouse model of RAS-induced preeclampsia. Nrf2 deficiency would be expected to impair cellular antioxidant responses; however, Nrf2 deficiency in preeclamptic mice improved maternal and fetal survival, ameliorated intra-uterine growth retardation, and augmented oxidative DNA damage. Furthermore, the placentas of Nrf2-deficient mice had increased endothelial cell proliferation with dense vascular networks. In contrast, the placentas of preeclamptic mice with overactive Nrf2 showed repressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s, which was associated with decreased expression of genes encoding angiogenic chemokines and cytokines. Our findings support the notion that ROS-mediated signaling is essential for maintaining placental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s in preeclampsia and may provide mechanistic insight into the negative results of clinical trials for antioxidants in preeclampsia.</p>

Targeting angiogenic metabolism in disease
<p>Blood vessels, which are lined by endothelial cells (ECs), supply oxygen and nutrients to every cell in the body. When tissues (or tumors) grow, they stimulate ECs to form new blood vessels (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s), so that they become better nourished. Hence, inhibiting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s to starve tumors has become a clinically approved therapy. For more than 40 years, antiangiogenic medicine has focused on targeting angiogenic signaling proteins, such as vascular endothelial growth f actor (VEGF). However, the success of VEGF-targeted therapy for cancer and neovascular ocular diseases is limited by insufficient efficacy and/or drug resistance, necessitating a fundamentally different approach. Targeting EC metabolism is gaining increasing attention as a possible alternative for inhibiting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s.</p>

Inhibition of Endothelial Notch Signaling Impairs Fatty Acid Transport and Leads to Metabolic and Vascular Remodeling of the Adult Heart
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Nutrients are transported through endothelial cells before being metabolized in muscle cells. However, little is known about the regulation of endothelial transport processes. Notch signaling is a critical regulator of metabolism and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s during development. Here, we studied how genetic and pharmacological manipulation of endothelial Notch signaling in adult mice affects endothelial fatty acid transport, cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s, and heart function.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Endothelial-specific Notch inhibition was achieved by conditional genetic inactivation of Rbp-jκ in adult mice to analyze fatty acid metabolism and heart function. Wild-type mice were treated with neutralizing antibodies against the Notch ligand Delta-like 4. Fatty acid transport was studied in cultured endothelial cells and transgenic mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Treatment of wild-type mice with Delta-like 4 neutralizing antibodies for 8 weeks impaired fractional shortening and ejection fraction in the majority of mice. Inhibition of Notch signaling specifically in the endothelium of adult mice by genetic ablation of Rbp-jκ caused heart hypertrophy and failure. Impaired heart function was preceded by alterations in fatty acid metabolism and an increase in cardiac blood vessel density. Endothelial Notch signaling controlled the expression of endothelial lipase, Angptl4, CD36, and Fabp4, which are all needed for fatty acid transport across the vessel wall. In endothelial-specific Rbp-jκ–mutant mice, lipase activity and transendothelial transport of long-chain fatty acids to muscle cells were impaired. In turn, lipids accumulated in the plasma and liver. The attenuated supply of cardiomyocytes with long-chain fatty acids was accompanied by higher glucose uptake, increased concentration of glycolysis intermediates, and mTOR-S6K signaling. Treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin or displacing glucose as cardiac substrate by feeding a ketogenic diet prolonged the survival of endothelial-specific Rbp-jκ–deficient mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This study identifies Notch signaling as a novel regulator of fatty acid transport across the endothelium and as an essential repressor of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s in the adult heart.

Adrenergic nerves activate an angio-metabolic switch in prostate cancer
<p>Nerves closely associate with blood vessels and help to pattern the vasculature during development. Recent work suggests that newly formed nerve fibers may regulate the tumor microenvironment, but their exact functions are unclear. Studying mouse models of prostate cancer, we show that endothelial β-adrenergic receptor signaling via adrenergic nerve–derived noradrenaline in the prostate stroma is critical for activation of an angiogenic switch that fuels exponential tumor growth. Mechanistically, this occurs through alteration of endothelial cell metabolism. Endothelial cells typically rely on aerobic glycolysis for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s. We found that the loss of endothelial <i>Adrb2</i>, the gene encoding the β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor, leads to inhibition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s through enhancement of endothelial oxidative phosphorylation. Codeletion of <i>Adrb2</i> and <i>Cox10</i>, a gene encoding a cytochrome IV oxidase assembly factor, prevented the metabolic shift induced by <i>Adrb2</i> deletion and rescued prostate cancer progression. This cross-talk between nerves and endothelial metabolism could potentially be targeted as an anticancer therapy.</p>

Human Plasma Thioredoxin-80 Increases With Age and in ApoE<sup>−/−</sup> Mice Induces Inflammation, Angiogenesis, and Atherosclerosis

In contrast, the truncated form, called TRX80, produced by macrophages induces upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines. TRX80 also promotes the differentiation of mouse peritoneal and human macrophages toward a proinflammatory M1 phenotype.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>TRX1 and TRX80 plasma levels were determined with a specific ELISA. A disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein (ADAM)-10, ADAM-17, and ADAM-10 activities were measured with SensoLyte 520 ADAM10 Activity Assay Kit, Fluorimetric, and InnoZyme TACE Activity Kit, respectively. Western immunoblots were performed with specific antibodies to ADAM-10 or ADAM-17. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s study was evaluated in vitro with human microvascular endothelial cells-1 and in vivo with the Matrigel plug <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s assay in mice.

Phosphorylation of Akt, mechanistic target of rapamycin, and 70S6K was determined with specific antibodies. The effect of TRX80 on NLRP3 inflammasome activity was evaluated by measuring the level of interleukin-1β and -18 in the supernatants of activated macrophages with ELISA. Hearts were used for lesion surface evaluation and immunohistochemical studies, and whole descending aorta were stained with Oil Red O. For transgenic mice generation, the human scavenger receptor (SR-A) promoter/enhancer was used to drive macrophage-specific expression of human TRX80 in mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In this study, we observed a significant increase of plasma levels of TRX80 in old subjects compared with healthy young subjects.

Furthermore, TRX80 was found to colocalize with tumor necrosis factor-α, a macrophage M1 marker, in human atherosclerotic plaque. In addition, TRX80 induced the expression of murine M1 macrophage markers through Akt2/mechanistic target of rapamycin–C1/70S6K pathway and activated the inflammasome NLRP3, leading to the release of interleukin-1β and -18, potent atherogenic cytokines. Moreover, TRX80 exerts a powerful angiogenic effect in both in vitro and in vivo mouse studies. Finally, transgenic mice that overexpress human TRX80 specifically in macrophages of apoE<sup>−/−</sup> mice have a significant increase of aortic atherosclerotic lesions.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>TRX80 showed an age-dependent increase in human plasma.

Loss of Endothelial CXCR7 Impairs Vascular Homeostasis and Cardiac Remodeling After Myocardial Infarction

Unlike CXCR4, the classic receptor for CXCL12, the function of CXCR7 (the most recently identified receptor) in vascular responses to injury and in MI remains unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Tissue expression of CXCR7 was examined in arteries from mice and humans. Mice that harbored floxed <i>CXCR7</i> and <i>Cdh5</i>-promoter driven <i>CreERT2</i> were treated with tamoxifen to induce endothelium-restricted deletion of CXCR7.

The role of CXCR7 in endothelial cell proliferation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s was determined in vitro with cells from mice and humans. The effects of adenoviral delivery of <i>CXCR7</i> gene and pharmacological activation of CXCR7 were evaluated in mice subjected to MI.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Injured arteries from both humans and mice exhibited endothelial CXCR7 expression. Conditional endothelial CXCR7 deletion promoted neointimal formation without altering plasma lipid levels after endothelial injury and exacerbated heart functional impairment after MI, with increased both mortality and infarct sizes. Mechanistically, the exacerbated responses in vascular and cardiac remodeling are attributable to the key role of CXCR7 in promoting endothelial proliferation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s. Impressively, the impaired post-MI cardiac remodeling occurred with elevated levels of CXCL12, which was previously thought to mediate cardiac protection by exclusively engaging its cognate receptor, CXCR4.

Spatially structured cell populations process multiple sensory signals in parallel in intact vascular endothelium
<p>Blood flow, blood clotting, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s, vascular permeability, and vascular remodeling are each controlled by a large number of variable, noisy, and interacting chemical inputs to the vascular endothelium. The endothelium processes the entirety of the chemical composition to which the cardiovascular system is exposed, carrying out sophisticated computations that determine physiological output. Processing this enormous quantity of information is a major challenge facing the endothelium. We analyzed the responses of hundreds of endothelial cells to carbachol (CCh) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and found that the endothelium segregates the responses to these two distinct components of the chemical environment into separate streams of complementary information that are processed in parallel. Sensitivities to CCh and ATP mapped to different clusters of cells, and each agonist generated distinct signal patterns. The distinct signals were features of agonist activation rather than properties of the cells themselves. When there was more than one stimulus present, the cells communicated and combined inputs to generate new distinct signals that were nonlinear combinations of the inputs. Our results demonstrate that the endothelium is a structured, collaborative sensory network that simplifies the complex environment using separate cell clusters that are sensitive to distinct aspects of the overall biochemical environment and interactively compute signals from diverse but interrelated chemical inputs. These features enable the endothelium to selectively process separate signals and perform multiple computations in an environment that is noisy and variable.</p>

VEGF–neuropilin-2 signaling promotes stem-like traits in breast cancer cells by TAZ-mediated repression of the Rac GAP β2-chimaerin
<p>The role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling in cancer is not only well known in the context of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s but also important in the functional regulation of tumor cells. Autocrine VEGF signaling mediated by its co-receptors called neuropilins (NRPs) appears to be essential for sustaining the proliferation and survival of cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are implicated in mediating tumor growth, progression, and drug resistance. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms involved in VEGF-mediated support of CSCs is critical to successfully treating cancer patients. The expression of the Hippo effector TAZ is associated with breast CSCs and confers stem cell–like properties. We found that VEGF-NRP2 signaling contributed to the activation of TAZ in various breast cancer cells, which mediated a positive feedback loop that promoted mammosphere formation. VEGF-NRP2 signaling activated the GTPase Rac1, which inhibited the Hippo kinase LATS, thus leading to TAZ activity. In a complex with the transcription factor TEAD, TAZ then bound and repressed the promoter of the gene encoding the Rac GTPase-activating protein (Rac GAP) β2-chimaerin. By activating GTP hydrolysis, Rac GAPs effectively turn off Rac signaling; hence, the TAZ-mediated repression of β2-chimaerin resulted in sustained Rac1 activity in CSCs. Depletion of β2-chimaerin in non-CSCs increased Rac1 activity, TAZ abundance, and mammosphere formation. Analysis of a breast cancer patient database revealed an inverse correlation between β2-chimaerin and TAZ expression in tumors. Our findings highlight an unexpected role for β2-chimaerin in a feed-forward loop of TAZ activation and the acquisition of CSC properties.</p>

Inactivating mutations in Drosha mediate vascular abnormalities similar to hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia
<p>The transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family of cytokines critically regulates vascular morphogenesis and homeostasis. Impairment of TGF-β or BMP signaling leads to heritable vascular disorders, including hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Drosha, a key enzyme for microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis, also regulates the TGF-β and BMP pathway through interaction with Smads and their joint control of gene expression through miRNAs. We report that mice lacking <i>Drosha</i> in the vascular endothelium developed a vascular phenotype resembling HHT that included dilated and disorganized vasculature, arteriovenous fistulae, and hemorrhages. Exome sequencing of HHT patients who lacked known pathogenic mutations revealed an overrepresentation of rare nonsynonymous variants of <i>DROSHA</i>. Two of these DROSHA variants (P100L and R279L) did not interact with Smads and were partially catalytically active. In zebrafish, expression of these mutants or morpholino-directed knockdown of <i>Drosha</i> resulted in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s defects and abnormal vascular permeability. Together, our studies point to an essential role of Drosha in vascular development and the maintenance of vascular integrity, and reveal a previously unappreciated link between Drosha dysfunction and HHT.</p>

Vasohibins encode tubulin detyrosinating activity
<p>Tubulin is subjected to a number of posttranslational modifications to generate heterogeneous microtubules. The modifications include removal and ligation of the C-terminal tyrosine of -tubulin. The enzymes responsible for detyrosination, an activity first observed 40 years ago, have remained elusive. We applied a genetic screen in haploid human cells to find regulators of tubulin detyrosination. We identified SVBP, a peptide that regulates the abundance of vasohibins (VASH1 and VASH2). Vasohibins, but not SVBP alone, increased detyrosination of -tubulin, and purified vasohibins removed the C-terminal tyrosine of -tubulin. We found that vasohibins play a cell type–dependent role in detyrosination, although cells also contain an additional detyrosinating activity. Thus, vasohibins, hitherto studied as secreted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s regulators, constitute a long-sought missing link in the tubulin tyrosination cycle.</p>

Recently, it has been recognized that nerves play dominant roles in organogenesis and tissue regeneration (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). In addition, growing evidence suggests that cancer development in a variety of tissues is controlled by an assortment of nerve-mediated signals, including neurotransmitters and other molecules (<i>3</i>–<i>5</i>). The key molecules depend on the organ and the context, but the targets of neurotransmission appear to include both stem cells and the surrounding stromal cells. Both adrenergic and cholinergic nerves promote prostate cancer development, at least in part, by activating stromal cells (<i>4</i>). On page 321 of this issue, Zahalka <i>et al.</i> (<i>6</i>) expand on their previous findings (<i>3</i>) by elucidating the molecular mechanism of neurotransmission in prostate cancer, revealing that noradrenaline released from cancer-associated nerves triggers <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s and thus cancer progression.</p>

ELABELA deficiency promotes preeclampsia and cardiovascular malformations in mice
<p>Preeclampsia (PE) is a gestational hypertensive syndrome affecting between 5 and 8% of all pregnancies. Although PE is the leading cause of fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality, its molecular etiology is still unclear. Here, we show that ELABELA (ELA), an endogenous ligand of the apelin receptor (APLNR, or APJ), is a circulating hormone secreted by the placenta. <i>Elabela</i> but not <i>Apelin</i> knockout pregnant mice exhibit PE-like symptoms, including proteinuria and elevated blood pressure due to defective placental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s. In mice, infusion of exogenous ELA normalizes hypertension, proteinuria, and birth weight. ELA, which is abundant in human placentas, increases the invasiveness of trophoblast-like cells, suggesting that it enhances placental development to prevent PE. The ELA-APLNR signaling axis may offer a new paradigm for the treatment of common pregnancy-related complications, including PE.</p>

Laminins containing the β2 and γ3 chains regulate astrocyte migration and angiogenesis in the retina
<p>Pathologies of retinal blood vessels are among the major causes of blindness worldwide. A key cell type that regulates retinal vascular development is the astrocyte. Generated extrinsically to the retina, astrocytes migrate into the retina through the optic nerve head. Even though there is a strong correlation between astrocyte distribution and retinal vascular development, the factors that guide astrocytes into the retina remain unclear. In this study, we show that astrocytes migrate within a laminin-containing basement membrane - the inner limiting membrane. Genetic deletion of the laminin β2 and γ3 chains affects astrocyte migration and spatial distribution. We show that laminins act as haptotactic factors <i>in vitro</i> in an isoform-specific manner, inducing astrocyte migration and promoting astrocyte differentiation. The addition of exogenous laminins to laminin-null retinal explants rescues astrocyte migration and spatial patterning. Furthermore, we show that the loss of laminins reduces β1 integrin expression in astrocytes. Culturing laminin-null retinal astrocytes on laminin substrates restores focal localization of β1 integrin. Finally, we show that laminins containing β2 and γ3 chains regulate subsequent retinal blood vessel growth and maintain vascular integrity. These <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> studies demonstrate clearly that laminins containing β2 and γ3 chains are indispensable for migration and spatial organization of astrocytes and that they play a crucial role during retinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s <i>in vivo</i>.</p>

Cytosolic DNA Sensing Promotes Macrophage Transformation and Governs Myocardial Ischemic Injury
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Myocardium irreversibly injured by ischemic stress must be efficiently repaired to maintain tissue integrity and contractile performance. Macrophages play critical roles in this process. These cells transform across a spectrum of phenotypes to accomplish diverse functions ranging from mediating the initial inflammatory responses that clear damaged tissue to subsequent reparative functions that help rebuild replacement tissue. Although macrophage transformation is crucial to myocardial repair, events governing this transformation are poorly understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Here, we set out to determine whether innate immune responses triggered by cytoplasmic DNA play a role.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We report that ischemic myocardial injury, along with the resulting release of nucleic acids, activates the recently described cyclic GMP-AMP synthase–stimulator of interferon genes pathway. Animals lacking cyclic GMP-AMP synthase display significantly improved early survival after myocardial infarction and diminished pathological remodeling, including ventricular rupture, enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s, and preserved ventricular contractile function. Furthermore, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase loss of function abolishes the induction of key inflammatory programs such as inducible nitric oxide synthase and promotes the transformation of macrophages to a reparative phenotype, which results in enhanced repair and improved hemodynamic performance.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These results reveal, for the first time, that the cytosolic DNA receptor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase functions during cardiac ischemia as a pattern recognition receptor in the sterile immune response. Furthermore, we report that this pathway governs macrophage transformation, thereby regulating postinjury cardiac repair. Because modulators of this pathway are currently in clinical use, our findings raise the prospect of new treatment options to combat ischemic heart disease and its progression to heart failure.</p></sec>

A Novel α-Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide Analogue Protects Against End-Organ Damage in Experimental Hypertension, Cardiac Hypertrophy, and Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Research into the therapeutic potential of α-calcitonin gene–related peptide (α-CGRP) has been limited because of its peptide nature and short half-life. Here, we evaluate whether a novel potent and long-lasting (<i>t</i><sub>½</sub> ≥7 hours) acylated α-CGRP analogue (αAnalogue) could alleviate and reverse cardiovascular disease in 2 distinct murine models of hypertension and heart failure in vivo.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The ability of the αAnalogue to act selectively via the CGRP pathway was shown in skin by using a CGRP receptor antagonist. The effect of the αAnalogue on angiotensin II–induced hypertension was investigated over 14 days. Blood pressure was measured by radiotelemetry. The ability of the αAnalogue to modulate heart failure was studied in an abdominal aortic constriction model of murine cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure over 5 weeks. Extensive ex vivo analysis was performed via RNA analysis, Western blot, and histology.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The angiotensin II–induced hypertension was attenuated by cotreatment with the αAnalogue (50 nmol·kg<sup>–1</sup>·d<sup>–1</sup>, SC, at a dose selected for lack of long-term hypotensive effects at baseline). The αAnalogue protected against vascular, renal, and cardiac dysfunction, characterized by reduced hypertrophy and biomarkers of fibrosis, remodeling, inflammation, and oxidative stress. In a separate study, the αAnalogue reversed angiotensin II–induced hypertension and associated vascular and cardiac damage. The αAnalogue was effective over 5 weeks in a murine model of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. It preserved heart function, assessed by echocardiography, while protecting against adverse cardiac remodeling and apoptosis. Moreover, treatment with the αAnalogue was well tolerated with neither signs of desensitization nor behavioral changes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These findings, in 2 distinct models, provide the first evidence for the therapeutic potential of a stabilized αAnalogue, by mediating (1) antihypertensive effects, (2) attenuating cardiac remodeling, and (3) increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s and cell survival to protect against and limit damage associated with the progression of cardiovascular diseases. This indicates the therapeutic potential of the CGRP pathway and the possibility that this injectable CGRP analogue may be effective in cardiac disease.</p></sec>

Modulation of Endothelial Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptor Type 2 Activity by Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 3 in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling has multiple roles in the development and function of the blood vessels. In humans, mutations in BMP receptor type 2 (BMPR2), a key component of BMP signaling, have been identified in the majority of patients with familial pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). However, only a small subset of individuals with <i>BMPR2</i> mutation develops PAH, suggesting that additional modifiers of BMPR2 function play an important role in the onset and progression of PAH.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used a combination of studies in zebrafish embryos and genetically engineered mice lacking endothelial expression of <i>Vegfr3</i> to determine the interaction between vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR3) and BMPR2. Additional in vitro studies were performed by using human endothelial cells, including primary lung endothelial cells from subjects with PAH.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Attenuation of Vegfr3 in zebrafish embryos abrogated Bmp2b-induced ectopic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s. Endothelial cells with disrupted VEGFR3 expression failed to respond to exogenous BMP stimulation. Mechanistically, VEGFR3 is physically associated with BMPR2 and facilitates ligand-induced endocytosis of BMPR2 to promote phosphorylation of SMADs and transcription of <i>ID</i> genes. Conditional, endothelial-specific deletion of <i>Vegfr3</i> in mice resulted in impaired BMP signaling responses, and significantly worsened hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension. Consistent with these data, we found significant decrease in VEGFR3 expression in pulmonary arterial endothelial cells from human PAH subjects, and reconstitution of VEGFR3 expression in PAH pulmonary arterial endothelial cells restored BMP signaling responses.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings identify VEGFR3 as a key regulator of endothelial BMPR2 signaling and a potential determinant of PAH penetrance in humans.</p></sec>

Gene Expression Profiling for the Identification and Classification of Antibody-Mediated Heart Rejection

However, an important knowledge gap remains in terms of the pathophysiology of AMR and how detection of immune activity, injury degree, and stage could be improved by intragraft gene expression profiling.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We prospectively monitored 617 heart transplant recipients referred from 4 French transplant centers (January 1, 2006–January 1, 2011) for AMR. We compared patients with AMR (n=55) with a matched control group of 55 patients without AMR. We characterized all patients using histopathology (ISHLT [International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation] 2013 grades), immunostaining, and circulating anti-HLA donor-specific antibodies at the time of biopsy, together with systematic gene expression assessments of the allograft tissue, using microarrays. Effector cells were evaluated with in vitro human cell cultures. We studied a validation cohort of 98 heart recipients transplanted in Edmonton, AB, Canada, including 27 cases of AMR and 71 controls.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 240 heart transplant endomyocardial biopsies were assessed. AMR showed a distinct pattern of injury characterized by endothelial activation with microcirculatory inflammation by monocytes/macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells. We also observed selective changes in endothelial/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s and NK cell transcripts, including CD16A signaling and interferon-γ–inducible genes. The AMR-selective gene sets accurately discriminated patients with AMR from those without and included NK transcripts (area under the curve=0.87), endothelial activation transcripts (area under the curve=0.80), macrophage transcripts (area under the curve=0.86), and interferon-γ transcripts (area under the curve=0.84; <i>P</i><0.0001 for all comparisons). These 4 gene sets showed increased expression with increasing pathological AMR (pAMR) International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation grade (<i>P</i><0.001) and association with donor-specific antibody levels. The unsupervised principal components analysis demonstrated a high proportion of molecularly inactive pAMR1(I+), and there was significant molecular overlap between pAMR1(H<sup>+</sup>) and full-blown pAMR2/3 cases. Endothelial activation transcripts, interferon-γ, and NK transcripts showed association with chronic allograft vasculopathy. The molecular architecture and selective AMR transcripts, together with gene set discrimination capacity for AMR identified in the discovery set, were reproduced in the validation cohort.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Tissue-based measurements of specific pathogenesis-based transcripts reflecting NK burden, endothelial activation, macrophage burden, and interferon-γ effects accurately classify AMR and correlate with degree of injury and disease activity. This study illustrates the clinical potential of a tissue-based analysis of gene transcripts to refine diagnosis of heart transplant rejection.</p></sec>

c-Cbl Inhibition Improves Cardiac Function and Survival in Response to Myocardial Ischemia
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>The proto-oncogene Casitas b-lineage lymphoma (c-Cbl) is an adaptor protein with an intrinsic E3 ubiquitin ligase activity that targets receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, resulting in their ubiquitination and downregulation. However, the function of c-Cbl in the control of cardiac function is currently unknown. In this study, we examined the role of c-Cbl in myocyte death and cardiac function after myocardial ischemia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We show increased c-Cbl expression in human ischemic and dilated cardiomyopathy hearts and in response to pathological stress stimuli in mice. c-Cbl–deficient mice demonstrated a more robust functional recovery after myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury and significantly reduced myocyte apoptosis and improved cardiac function. Ubiquitination and downregulation of key survival c-Cbl targets, epidermal growth factor receptors and focal adhesion kinase, were significantly reduced in c-Cbl knockout mice. Inhibition of c-Cbl expression or its ubiquitin ligase activity in cardiac myocytes offered protection against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> stress. Interestingly, c-Cbl deletion reduced the risk of death and increased cardiac functional recovery after chronic myocardial ischemia.

Plasticity in the Neurotransmitter Repertoire
<p>In the earliest days of neuroscience, it was thought that a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> made and released only a single chemical, known as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>er, to send a signal across a synapse to an adjacent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> (<i>1</i>). At the same time, it was deeply mysterious why so many signaling molecules were used in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>ous systems. Subsequently, it became clear that many, if not most, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s (including those in mammals) make and release two or more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>ers including small-molecules and neuropeptides (<i>2</i>–<i>4</i>). As the list of these potential cotransmitters and their receptors has increased, we are faced with understanding the functional relevance of this embarrassment of riches for neural circuits and behavior. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>ers and neuromodulators (substances often released with small-molecule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>ers) can elicit a variety of different actions on their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> targets, including directly opening ion channels or acting through signal transduction pathways to alter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al excitability or synaptic transmission. Thus, characterizing the mixture of cotransmitters released by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> is important for understanding how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al circuits operate. The mechanisms that change the profile of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>er release provide opportunities for plastic changes in circuit function, and consequently in organism behavior. On page 449 of this issue, Dulcis <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) report changes in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>er profile of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s that underlie photoperiod-triggered changes in animal behavior. The findings argue that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>er switching is a new mechanism for neuroplasticity (<i>6</i>) in adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>ous systems.</p>

Synaptic transmission from subplate neurons controls radial migration of neocortical neurons
<p>The neocortex exhibits a six-layered structure that is formed by radial migration of excitatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s, for which the multipolar-to-bipolar transition of immature migrating multipolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s is required. Here, we report that subplate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s, one of the first <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> types born in the neocortex, manage the multipolar-to-bipolar transition of migrating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s. By histochemical, imaging, and microarray analyses on the mouse embryonic cortex, we found that subplate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s extend neurites toward the ventricular side of the subplate and form transient glutamatergic synapses on the multipolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s just below the subplate. NMDAR (<i>N</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate receptor)–mediated synaptic transmission from subplate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s to multipolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s induces the multipolar-to-bipolar transition, leading to a change in migration mode from slow multipolar migration to faster radial glial-guided locomotion. Our data suggested that transient synapses formed on early immature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s regulate radial migration.</p>

Whispering neurons fuel cortical highways
<p>The mammalian neocortex is one of the most intricate entities found in nature, both in terms of structure and function. It is the brain region responsible for the execution of high-order functions, including sensory perception, motor control, cognition, and speech. Its development is equally complex because it requires that millions to billions (depending on the species) of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s assemble in distinct layers and connect with exquisite precision to perform complicated information processing operations. During embryonic development, formation of the cerebral cortex involves the migration of excitatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s generated in the ventricular zone toward the cortical plate, where they establish their final position in six well-defined horizontal layers consisting of different types of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s and architecture. Along this migratory phase, developing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s undergo a morphological transition from multipolar shape to bipolar morphology. Bipolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s exhibit faster locomotion, quickly reaching their final destination. On page 313 of this issue, Ohtaka-Maruyama <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) reveal that this important switch to bipolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s is influenced by glutamate release from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s located at the subplate, just beneath the cortical plate. Subplate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s trigger this transformation by making transient synaptic contacts with multipolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s in transit to the cortical laminae. Understanding this process is important because disruption of neocortical migration results in several human neuro-developmental diseases.</p>

Niche-derived laminin-511 promotes midbrain dopaminergic neuron survival and differentiation through YAP
<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder in which the loss of dopaminergic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s in the midbrain (mDA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s) causes progressive loss of motor control and function. Using embryonic and mDA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s, midbrain tissue from mice, and differentiated human neural stem cells, we investigated the mechanisms controlling the survival of mDA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s. We found that the extracellular matrix protein laminin-511 (LM511) promoted the survival and differentiation of mDA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s. LM511 bound to integrin α<sub>3</sub>β<sub>1</sub> and activated the transcriptional cofactor YAP. LM511-YAP signaling enhanced cell survival by inducing the expression of the microRNA miR-130a, which suppressed the synthesis of the cell death–associated protein PTEN. In addition, LM511-YAP signaling increased the expression of transcription factors critical for mDA identity, such as LMX1A and PITX3, and prevented the loss of mDA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s in response to oxidative stress, a finding that warrants further investigation to assess therapeutic potential for PD patients. We propose that by enhancing LM511-YAP signaling, it may be possible to prevent mDA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> degeneration in PD or enhance the survival of mDA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s in cell replacement therapies.</p>

Wire together, fire apart
<p>The ability to learn and remember new experiences lies at the heart of our existence. After all, we are our memories. It has been widely accepted that memories are formed and stored via strengthening of neural connections due to the correlated activities of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s, where presumably one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> is causing or at least contributing to the activity of another connecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> and hence becomes associated with it. This principle is known as the Hebbian learning rule (<i>1</i>): i.e., if interconnected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s become active very close in time during a particular event, their connection strengthens and “a memory” of this event is formed (<i>1</i>). In other words, “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s wire together, if they fire together” (<i>2</i>). Thus, neural connection must show some sort of plasticity—i.e., an ability to be modified based on the mutual firing patterns of interconnected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s—in order to form memories and associations. Indeed, it has been shown that brief (hundreds of milliseconds) stimulations of interconnected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s significantly improve signal transmission between the two, a phenomenon known as long-term potentiation (LTP). On page 1033 of this issue, Bittner <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) describe a different learning mechanism called behavioral time scale synaptic plasticity (BTSP), which spans a considerably longer time course of several seconds, implying that no causal relationship of interconnected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s may be necessary to form long-lasting associations between them.</p>

Single-cell methylomes identify neuronal subtypes and regulatory elements in mammalian cortex
<p>The mammalian brain contains diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al types, yet we lack single-cell epigenomic assays that are able to identify and characterize them. DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic mark that distinguishes cell types and marks regulatory elements. We generated >6000 methylomes from single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al nuclei and used them to identify 16 mouse and 21 human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al subpopulations in the frontal cortex. CG and non-CG methylation exhibited cell type–specific distributions, and we identified regulatory elements with differential methylation across <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> types. Methylation signatures identified a layer 6 excitatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> subtype and a unique human parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> subtype. We observed stronger cross-species conservation of regulatory elements in inhibitory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s than in excitatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s. Single-nucleus methylomes expand the atlas of brain cell types and identify regulatory elements that drive conserved brain cell diversity.</p>

The phosphorylation status of Ascl1 is a key determinant of neuronal differentiation and maturation <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>
<p>Generation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s from patient fibroblasts using a combination of developmentally defined transcription factors has great potential in disease modelling, as well as ultimately for use in regeneration and repair. However, generation of physiologically mature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s <i>in vitro</i> remains problematic. Here we demonstrate the cell-cycle-dependent phosphorylation of a key reprogramming transcription factor, Ascl1, on multiple serine-proline sites. This multisite phosphorylation is a crucial regulator of the ability of Ascl1 to drive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al differentiation and maturation <i>in vivo</i> in the developing embryo; a phosphomutant form of Ascl1 shows substantially enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al induction activity in <i>Xenopus</i> embryos. Mechanistically, we see that this un(der)phosphorylated Ascl1 is resistant to inhibition by both cyclin-dependent kinase activity and Notch signalling, both of which normally limit its neurogenic potential. Ascl1 is a central component of reprogramming transcription factor cocktails to generate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s from human fibroblasts; the use of phosphomutant Ascl1 in place of the wild-type protein significantly promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al maturity after human fibroblast reprogramming <i>in vitro</i>. These results demonstrate that cell-cycle-dependent post-translational modification of proneural proteins directly regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al differentiation <i>in vivo</i> during development, and that this regulatory mechanism can be harnessed to promote maturation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s obtained by transdifferentiation of human cells <i>in vitro</i>.</p>

Midbrain dopamine neurons control judgment of time
<p>Our sense of time is far from constant. For instance, time flies when we are having fun, and it slows to a trickle when we are bored. Midbrain dopamine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s have been implicated in variable time estimation. However, a direct link between signals carried by dopamine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s and temporal judgments is lacking. We measured and manipulated the activity of dopamine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s as mice judged the duration of time intervals. We found that pharmacogenetic suppression of dopamine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s decreased behavioral sensitivity to time and that dopamine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s encoded information about trial-to-trial variability in time estimates. Last, we found that transient activation or inhibition of dopamine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s was sufficient to slow down or speed up time estimation, respectively. Dopamine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> activity thus reflects and can directly control the judgment of time.</p>

A New Wrap for Neuronal Activity?
<p>As we learn and experience the world around us, our brains are remodeling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al pathways. Is this remodeling only a property of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s, or are other brain cell types also adapting and contributing to learning? A substantial proportion of cells in the mammalian brain are oligodendrocytes and their precursors (collectively called oligodendroglia). Oligodendrocytes generate multiple myelin sheaths, lipid-rich extensions of specialized plasma membrane that spirally coat condensed layers around <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s. This insulation facilitates rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e conduction, increasing velocities of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> signals 10-fold (<i>1</i>) by restricting current flow to the small gaps between sheaths—the nodes of Ranvier. More than half of the human brain is composed of myelinated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>es (“white matter”). With such extensive myelinated neural networks, it raises the questions: Do the myelin-producing oligodendrocytes in the brain also adapt as neural circuits are modified in response to activity, and does adaptation of oligodendrocytes then affect the underlying neural circuits? On page 487 of this issue, Gibson <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) provide new evidence to address how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> activity may promote oligodendroglia changes.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
Motor neurons and glia exhibit specific individualized responses to TDP-43 expression in a <i>Drosophila</i> model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal disease characterized by complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al and glial phenotypes. Recently, RNA-based mechanisms have been linked to ALS via RNA-binding proteins such as TDP-43, which has been studied <i>in vivo</i> using models ranging from yeast to rodents. We have developed a <i>Drosophila</i> model of ALS based on TDP-43 that recapitulates several aspects of pathology, including motor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> loss, locomotor dysfunction and reduced survival. Here we report the phenotypic consequences of expressing wild-type and four different ALS-linked TDP-43 mutations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s and glia. We show that TDP-43-driven neurodegeneration phenotypes are dose- and age-dependent. In motor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s, TDP-43 appears restricted to nuclei, which are significantly misshapen due to mutant but not wild-type protein expression. In glia and in the developing neuroepithelium, TDP-43 associates with cytoplasmic puncta. TDP-43-containing RNA granules are motile in cultured motor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s, although wild-type and mutant variants exhibit different kinetic properties. At the neuromuscular junction, the expression of TDP-43 in motor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s versus glia leads to seemingly opposite synaptic phenotypes that, surprisingly, translate into comparable locomotor defects. Finally, we explore sleep as a behavioral readout of TDP-43 expression and find evidence of sleep fragmentation consistent with hyperexcitability, a suggested mechanism in ALS. These findings support the notion that although motor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s and glia are both involved in ALS pathology, at the cellular level they can exhibit different responses to TDP-43. In addition, our data suggest that individual TDP-43 alleles utilize distinct molecular mechanisms, which will be important for developing therapeutic strategies.</p>

Excitatory neuron–specific SHP2-ERK signaling network regulates synaptic plasticity and memory
<p>Mutations in RAS signaling pathway components cause diverse neurodevelopmental disorders, collectively called RASopathies. Previous studies have suggested that dysregulation in RAS–extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) activation is restricted to distinct cell types in different RASopathies. Some cases of Noonan syndrome (NS) are associated with gain-of-function mutations in the phosphatase SHP2 (encoded by <i>PTPN11</i>); however, SHP2 is abundant in multiple cell types, so it is unclear which cell type(s) contribute to NS phenotypes. Here, we found that expressing the NS-associated mutant SHP2<sup>D61G</sup> in excitatory, but not inhibitory, hippocampal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s increased ERK signaling and impaired both long-term potentiation (LTP) and spatial memory in mice, although endogenous SHP2 was expressed in both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al types. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that the genes encoding SHP2-interacting proteins that are critical for ERK activation, such as GAB1 and GRB2, were enriched in excitatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s. Accordingly, expressing a dominant-negative mutant of GAB1, which reduced its interaction with SHP2<sup>D61G</sup>, selectively in excitatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s, reversed SHP2<sup>D61G</sup>-mediated deficits. Moreover, ectopic expression of GAB1 and GRB2 together with SHP2<sup>D61G</sup> in inhibitory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s resulted in ERK activation. These results demonstrate that RAS-ERK signaling networks are notably different between excitatory and inhibitory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s, accounting for the cell type–specific pathophysiology of NS and perhaps other RASopathies.</p>

Proteomic analysis of S-nitrosylated nuclear proteins in rat cortical neurons
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s modulate gene expression in response to extrinsic signals to enable brain development, cognition, and learning and to process stimuli that regulate systemic physiological functions. This signal-to-gene communication is facilitated by posttranslational modifications such as S-nitrosylation, the covalent attachment of a nitric oxide (NO) moiety to cysteine thiols. In the cerebral cortex, S-nitrosylation of histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) is required for gene transcription during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al development, but few other nuclear targets of S-nitrosylation have been identified to date. We used S-nitrosothiol resin-assisted capture on NO donor-treated nuclear extracts from rat cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s and identified 614 S-nitrosylated nuclear proteins. Of these, 131 proteins have not previously been shown to be S-nitrosylated in any system, and 555 are previously unidentified targets of S-nitrosylation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s. The sites of S-nitrosylation were identified for 59% of the targets, and motifs containing single lysines were found at 33% of these sites. In addition, lysine motifs were necessary for promoting the S-nitrosylation of HDAC2 and methyl-CpG binding protein 3 (MBD3). Moreover, S-nitrosylation of the histone-binding protein RBBP7 was necessary for dendritogenesis of cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s in culture. Together, our findings characterize S-nitrosylated nuclear proteins in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s and identify S-nitrosylation motifs that may be shared with other targets of NO signaling.</p>

Inhibition of somatosensory mechanotransduction by annexin A6
<p>Mechanically activated, slowly adapting currents in sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s have been linked to noxious mechanosensation. The conotoxin NMB-1 (noxious mechanosensation blocker-1) blocks such currents and inhibits mechanical pain. Using a biotinylated form of NMB-1 in mass spectrometry analysis, we identified 67 binding proteins in sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s and a sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>–derived cell line, of which the top candidate was annexin A6, a membrane-associated calcium-binding protein.

Sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s from these mice showed increased activity of the cation channel Piezo2, which mediates a rapidly adapting mechano-gated current linked to proprioception and touch, and a decrease in mechanically activated, slowly adapting currents. Conversely, overexpression of annexin A6 in sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s inhibited rapidly adapting currents that were partially mediated by Piezo2. Furthermore, overexpression of annexin A6 in sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s attenuated mechanical pain in a mouse model of osteoarthritis, a disease in which mechanically evoked pain is particularly problematic.

Glia relay differentiation cues to coordinate neuronal development in <i>Drosophila</i>
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al birth and specification must be coordinated across the developing brain to generate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s that constitute neural circuits. We used the <i>Drosophila</i> visual system to investigate how development is coordinated to establish retinotopy, a feature of all visual systems. Photoreceptors achieve retinotopy by inducing their target field in the optic lobe, the lamina <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s, with a secreted differentiation cue, epidermal growth factor (EGF). We find that communication between photoreceptors and lamina cells requires a signaling relay through glia. In response to photoreceptor-EGF, glia produce insulin-like peptides, which induce lamina <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al differentiation. Our study identifies a role for glia in coordinating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al development across distinct brain regions, thus reconciling the timing of column assembly with that of delayed differentiation, as well as the spatiotemporal pattern of lamina <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> differentiation.</p>

Rapid binge-like eating and body weight gain driven by zona incerta GABA neuron activation
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al substrate for binge eating, which can at times lead to obesity, is not clear. We find that optogenetic stimulation of mouse zona incerta (ZI) γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s or their axonal projections to paraventricular thalamus (PVT) excitatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s immediately (in 2 to 3 seconds) evoked binge-like eating. Minimal intermittent stimulation led to body weight gain; ZI GABA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> ablation reduced weight. ZI stimulation generated 35% of normal 24-hour food intake in just 10 minutes. The ZI cells were excited by food deprivation and the gut hunger signal ghrelin. In contrast, stimulation of excitatory axons from the parasubthalamic nucleus to PVT or direct stimulation of PVT glutamate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s reduced food intake. These data suggest an unexpected robust orexigenic potential for the ZI GABA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s.</p>

Decreased abundance of TRESK two-pore domain potassium channels in sensory neurons underlies the pain associated with bone metastasis
<p>Cancer-associated pain is debilitating. Understanding the mechanisms that cause it can inform drug development that may improve quality of life in patients. Here, we found that the reduced abundance of potassium channels called TRESK in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s sensitized nociceptive sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s and cancer-associated pain. Overexpressing TRESK in DRG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s suppressed tumor-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al hyperexcitability and pain hypersensitivity in bone metastasis model rats, whereas knocking down TRESK increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al hyperexcitability and pain hypersensitivity in normal rats. Mechanistically, tumor-associated production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) activated the receptor VEGFR2 on DRGs, which increased the abundance of the calcineurin inhibitor DSCR1, which, in turn, decreased calcineurin-mediated activation of the transcription factor NFAT, thereby reducing the transcription of the gene encoding TRESK. Intrathecal application of exogenous calcineurin to tumor-bearing rats rescued TRESK abundance and abrogated both DRG hyperexcitability and pain hypersensitivity, whereas either inhibition or knockdown of calcineurin in normal rats reduced TRESK abundance and increased DRG excitability and pain sensitivity. These findings identify a potentially targetable mechanism that may cause bone metastasis–associated pain in cancer patients.</p>

A role for corticotropin-releasing factor signaling in the lateral habenula and its modulation by early-life stress
<p>Centrally released corticotropin-releasing factor or hormone (extrahypothalamic CRF or CRH) in the brain is involved in the behavioral and emotional responses to stress. The lateral habenula (LHb) is an epithalamic brain region involved in value-based decision-making and stress evasion. Through its inhibition of dopamine-mediated reward circuitry, the increased activity of the LHb is associated with addiction, depression, schizophrenia, and behavioral disorders. We found that extrahypothalamic CRF neurotransmission increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al excitability in the LHb. Through its receptor CRFR1 and subsequently protein kinase A (PKA), CRF application increased the intrinsic excitability of LHb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s by affecting changes in small-conductance SK-type and large-conductance BK-type K<sup>+</sup> channels. CRF also reduced inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid–containing (GABAergic) synaptic transmission onto LHb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s through endocannabinoid-mediated retrograde signaling. Maternal deprivation is a severe early-life stress that alters CRF neural circuitry and is likewise associated with abnormal mental health later in life. LHb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s from pups deprived of maternal care exhibited increased intrinsic excitability, reduced GABAergic transmission, decreased abundance of SK2 channel protein, and increased activity of PKA, without any substantial changes in <i>Crh</i> or <i>Crhr1</i> expression. Furthermore, maternal deprivation blunted the response of LHb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s to subsequent, acute CRF exposure. Activating SK channels or inhibiting postsynaptic PKA activity prevented the effects of both CRF and maternal deprivation on LHb intrinsic excitability, thus identifying potential pharmacological targets to reverse central CRF circuit dysregulation in patients with associated disorders.</p>

The amyloid-β oligomer Aβ*56 induces specific alterations in neuronal signaling that lead to tau phosphorylation and aggregation
<p>Oligomeric forms of amyloid-forming proteins are believed to be the principal initiating bioactive species in many neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Amyloid-β (Aβ) oligomers are implicated in AD-associated phosphorylation and aggregation of the microtubule-associated protein tau. To investigate the specific molecular pathways activated by different assemblies, we isolated various forms of Aβ from Tg2576 mice, which are a model for AD. We found that Aβ*56, a 56-kDa oligomer that is detected before patients develop overt signs of AD, induced specific changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al signaling. In primary cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s, Aβ*56 interacted with <i>N</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), increased NMDAR-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, and consequently increased intracellular calcium concentrations and the activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent calmodulin kinase IIα (CaMKIIα). In cultured <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s and in the brains of Tg2576 mice, activated CaMKIIα was associated with increased site-specific phosphorylation and missorting of tau, both of which are associated with AD pathology. In contrast, exposure of cultured primary cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s to other oligomeric Aβ forms (dimers and trimers) did not trigger these effects. Our results indicate that distinct Aβ assemblies activate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al signaling pathways in a selective manner and that dissecting the molecular events caused by each oligomer may inform more effective therapeutic strategies.</p>

Synergistic regulation of serotonin and opioid signaling contributes to pain insensitivity in Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 knockout mice
<p>Genetic loss of the voltage-gated sodium channel Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 (Na<sub>v</sub>1.7<sup>−/−</sup>) results in lifelong insensitivity to pain in mice and humans. One underlying cause is an increase in the production of endogenous opioids in sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s. We analyzed whether Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 deficiency altered nociceptive heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide–binding protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, such as initiated by GPCRs that respond to serotonin (pronociceptive) or opioids (antinociceptive), in sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s. We found that the nociceptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s of Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 knockout (Na<sub>v</sub>1.7<sup>−/−</sup>) mice, but not those of Na<sub>v</sub>1.8 knockout (Na<sub>v</sub>1.8<sup>−/−</sup>) mice, exhibited decreased pronociceptive serotonergic signaling through the 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptors, which are Gα<sub>s</sub>-coupled GPCRs that stimulate the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate resulting in protein kinase A (PKA) activity, as well as reduced abundance of the RIIβ regulatory subunit of PKA. Simultaneously, the efficacy of antinociceptive opioid signaling mediated by the Gα<sub>i</sub>-coupled mu opioid receptors was increased. Consequently, opioids inhibited more efficiently tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium currents, which are important for pain-initiating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al activity in nociceptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s. Thus, Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 controls the efficacy and balance of GPCR-mediated pro- and antinociceptive intracellular signaling, such that without Na<sub>v</sub>1.7, the balance is shifted toward antinociception, resulting in lifelong endogenous analgesia.</p>

The paraventricular thalamus is a critical thalamic area for wakefulness
<p>Clinical observations indicate that the paramedian region of the thalamus is a critical node for controlling wakefulness.

Suppression of PVT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al activity caused a reduction in wakefulness, whereas activation of PVT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s induced a transition from sleep to wakefulness and an acceleration of emergence from general anesthesia.

A gut feeling
<p>The anatomist Friedrich S. Merkel predicted in 1880 that sensory systems are composed of epithelial cells and sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>es, which together transform environmental cues into neural signals that trigger our rich sensory experiences (<i>1</i>). We now know that this hypothesis mostly holds true for the canonical senses of vision, hearing, taste, and touch. Perhaps surprisingly, the peripheral outposts of these classical sensory systems (eyes, ears, tongue, and skin) are dwarfed by the human body's largest sensory organ—the gut. Enteroendocrine cells, which are rare epithelial cells that decorate the gut lining, have long been suspected to be sensory receptor cells that inform the brain about ingested nutrients (<i>2</i>). Since their description, these cells were assumed to play a role in metabolism and gut physiology by releasing slow-acting peptide hormones that stimulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s throughout the gut and in the brain. On page 1219 of this issue, Kaelberer <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) challenge this view by demonstrating that gut enteroendocrine cells locally excite sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>es through release of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>er glutamate. A recent study of enterochromaffin cells, a subset of enteroendocrine cells, also found that gut signals are transmitted at epithelial-neural synapses through release of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>er serotonin (<i>4</i>). Together, these findings overturn a decades-old dogma that enteroendocrine cells signal exclusively through hormones.</p>

Regulation of feeding by somatostatin neurons in the tuberal nucleus

Dopamine oxidation mediates mitochondrial and lysosomal dysfunction in Parkinson’s disease
<p>Mitochondrial and lysosomal dysfunction have been implicated in substantia nigra dopaminergic neurodegeneration in Parkinson’s disease (PD), but how these pathways are linked in human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s remains unclear. Here we studied dopaminergic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s derived from patients with idiopathic and familial PD.

This toxic cascade was observed in human, but not in mouse, PD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s at least in part because of species-specific differences in dopamine metabolism. Increasing dopamine synthesis or α-synuclein amounts in mouse midbrain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s recapitulated pathological phenotypes observed in human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s.

Thirst-associated preoptic neurons encode an aversive motivational drive

Single-cell transcriptional profiling revealed that dehydration-activated MnPO <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s consist of a single excitatory cell type. After optogenetic activation of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s, mice drank water and performed an operant lever-pressing task for water reward with rates that scaled with stimulation frequency.

The sacral autonomic outflow is sympathetic
<p>A kinship between cranial and pelvic visceral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>es of vertebrates has been accepted for a century. Accordingly, sacral preganglionic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s are considered parasympathetic, as are their targets in the pelvic ganglia that prominently control rectal, bladder, and genital functions. Here, we uncover 15 phenotypic and ontogenetic features that distinguish pre- and postganglionic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s of the cranial parasympathetic outflow from those of the thoracolumbar sympathetic outflow in mice. By every single one, the sacral outflow is indistinguishable from the thoracolumbar outflow.

Heterochronic Genes Turn Back the Clock in Old Neurons
<p>Although some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> types regenerate better than others, all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s lose the ability to regenerate with age. This intrinsic decline is the primary cause of regeneration failure even in permissive environments. This was shown in 1995 by comparing the regeneration ability of retinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s from different aged retinas growing into tectums of different ages (<i>1</i>). Embryonic retinal axons regrew into tectum of any age, including older tectum with an inhibitory glial environment, whereas postnatal day 2 or older retinal axons failed to regrow even into embryonic tectum. This indicated a “programmed” loss of axon regeneration ability with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> age. Similarly, young hindbrain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s transplanted into older spinal cords could regenerate axons into a normally inhibitory myelinated environment (<i>2</i>). Despite the clear therapeutic implications of these observations, the underlying molecular mechanisms controlling age-dependent regenerative capacity were unclear. On page 372 in this issue, Zou <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) report that the highly conserved <i>let-7</i>–LIN-41 heterochronic signaling pathway is responsible for part of the age-related decline in axon regeneration in the worm <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>.</p>

Axon degeneration and PGC-1α-mediated protection in a zebrafish model of α-synuclein toxicity
<p>α-synuclein (aSyn) expression is implicated in neurodegenerative processes, including Parkinson’s disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). In animal models of these diseases, axon pathology often precedes cell death, raising the question of whether aSyn has compartment-specific toxic effects that could require early and/or independent therapeutic intervention. The relevance of axonal pathology to degeneration can only be addressed through longitudinal, <i>in vivo</i> monitoring of different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al compartments. With current imaging methods, dopaminergic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s do not readily lend themselves to such a task in any vertebrate system. We therefore expressed human wild-type aSyn in zebrafish peripheral sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s, which project elaborate superficial axons that can be continuously imaged <i>in vivo</i>. Axonal outgrowth was normal in these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s but, by 2 days post-fertilization (dpf), many aSyn-expressing axons became dystrophic, with focal varicosities or diffuse beading. Approximately 20% of aSyn-expressing cells died by 3 dpf. Time-lapse imaging revealed that focal axonal swelling, but not overt fragmentation, usually preceded cell death. Co-expressing aSyn with a mitochondrial reporter revealed deficits in mitochondrial transport and morphology even when axons appeared overtly normal. The axon-protective protein Wallerian degeneration slow (WldS) delayed axon degeneration but not cell death caused by aSyn. By contrast, the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α, which has roles in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and reactive-oxygen-species detoxification, abrogated aSyn toxicity in both the axon and the cell body. The rapid onset of axonal pathology in this system, and the relatively moderate degree of cell death, provide a new model for the study of aSyn toxicity and protection. Moreover, the accessibility of peripheral sensory axons will allow effects of aSyn to be studied in different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al compartments and might have utility in screening for novel disease-modifying compounds.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
Behavioral abnormalities and Parkinson’s-like histological changes resulting from <i>Id2</i> inactivation in mice
<p>Characterizing dopaminergic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al development and function in novel genetic animal models might uncover strategies for researchers to develop disease-modifying treatments for neurologic disorders. <i>Id2</i> is a transcription factor expressed in the developing central <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>ous system. <i>Id2</i><sup>−/−</sup> mice have fewer dopaminergic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s in the olfactory bulb and reduced olfactory discrimination, a pre-clinical marker of Parkinson’s disease. Here, we summarize behavioral, histological and <i>in vitro</i> molecular biological analyses to determine whether midbrain dopaminergic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s are affected by <i>Id2</i> loss. <i>Id2</i><sup>−/−</sup> mice were hyperactive at 1 and 3 months of age, but by 6 months showed reduced activity. <i>Id2</i><sup>−/−</sup> mice showed age-dependent histological alterations in dopaminergic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpC) associated with changes in locomotor activity. Reduced dopamine transporter (<i>DAT)</i> expression was observed at early ages in <i>Id2</i><sup>−/−</sup> mice and <i>DAT</i> expression was dependent on <i>Id2</i> expression in an <i>in vitro</i> dopaminergic differentiation model. Evidence of neurodegeneration, including activated caspase-3 and glial infiltration, were noted in the SNpC of older <i>Id2</i><sup>−/−</sup> mice. These findings document a novel role for <i>Id2</i> in the maintenance of midbrain dopamine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s. The <i>Id2</i><sup>−/−</sup> mouse should provide unique opportunities to study the progression of neurodegenerative disorders involving the dopamine system.</p>

Development
Zebrafish Foxi1 provides a neuronal ground state during inner ear induction preceding the Dlx3b/4b-regulated sensory lineage
<p>Vertebrate inner ear development is a complex process that involves the induction of a common territory for otic and epibranchial precursors and their subsequent segregation into otic and epibranchial cell fates. In zebrafish, the otic-epibranchial progenitor domain (OEPD) is induced by Fgf signaling in a Foxi1- and Dlx3b/4b-dependent manner, but the functional differences of Foxi1 and Dlx3b/4b in subsequent cell fate specifications within the developing inner ear are poorly understood. Based on pioneer tracking (PioTrack), a novel Cre-dependent genetic lineage tracing method, and genetic data, we show that the competence to embark on a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al or sensory fate is provided sequentially and very early during otic placode induction. Loss of Foxi1 prevents <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al precursor formation without affecting hair cell specification, whereas loss of Dlx3b/4b inhibits hair cell but not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al precursor formation. Consistently, in Dlx3b/4b- and Sox9a-deficient <i>b380</i> mutants almost all otic epithelial fates are absent, including sensory hair cells, and the remaining otic cells adopt a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al fate. Furthermore, the progenitors of the anterior lateral line ganglia also arise from the OEPD in a Foxi1-dependent manner but are unaffected in the absence of Dlx3b/4b or in <i>b380</i> mutants. Thus, in addition to otic fate Foxi1 provides <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al competence during OEPD induction prior to and independently of the Dlx3b/4b-mediated sensory fate of the developing inner ear.</p>

The hippocampal engram maps experience but not place
<p>Episodic memories are encoded by a sparse population of hippocampal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s. In mice, optogenetic manipulation of this memory engram established that these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s are indispensable and inducing for memory recall. However, little is known about their in vivo activity or precise role in memory. We found that during memory encoding, only a fraction of CA1 place cells function as engram <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s, distinguished by firing repetitive bursts paced at the theta frequency. During memory recall, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s remained highly context specific, yet demonstrated preferential remapping of their place fields. These data demonstrate a dissociation of precise spatial coding and contextual indexing by distinct hippocampal ensembles and suggest that the hippocampal engram serves as an index of memory content.</p>

Evolution of pallium, hippocampus, and cortical cell types revealed by single-cell transcriptomics in reptiles
<p>Computations in the mammalian cortex are carried out by glutamatergic and γ-aminobutyric acid–releasing (GABAergic) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s forming specialized circuits and areas. Here we asked how these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s and areas evolved in amniotes. We built a gene expression atlas of the pallium of two reptilian species using large-scale single-cell messenger RNA sequencing. The transcriptomic signature of glutamatergic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s in reptilian cortex suggests that mammalian neocortical layers are made of new cell types generated by diversification of ancestral gene-regulatory programs. By contrast, the diversity of reptilian cortical GABAergic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s indicates that the inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> classes known in mammals already existed in the common ancestor of all amniotes.</p>

Locally translated mTOR controls axonal local translation in nerve injury
<p>How is protein synthesis initiated locally in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s? We found that mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) was activated and then up-regulated in injured axons, owing to local translation of mTOR messenger RNA (mRNA). This mRNA was transported into axons by the cell size–regulating RNA-binding protein nucleolin. Furthermore, mTOR controlled local translation in injured axons. This included regulation of its own translation and that of retrograde injury signaling molecules such as importin β1 and STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3). Deletion of the mTOR 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) in mice reduced mTOR in axons and decreased local translation after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e injury. Both pharmacological inhibition of mTOR in axons and deletion of the mTOR 3′UTR decreased proprioceptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al survival after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e injury. Thus, mRNA localization enables spatiotemporal control of mTOR pathways regulating local translation and long-range intracellular signaling.</p>

Near-infrared deep brain stimulation via upconversion nanoparticle–mediated optogenetics
<p>Optogenetics has revolutionized the experimental interrogation of neural circuits and holds promise for the treatment of neurological disorders. It is limited, however, because visible light cannot penetrate deep inside brain tissue. Upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) absorb tissue-penetrating near-infrared (NIR) light and emit wavelength-specific visible light. Here, we demonstrate that molecularly tailored UCNPs can serve as optogenetic actuators of transcranial NIR light to stimulate deep brain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s. Transcranial NIR UCNP-mediated optogenetics evoked dopamine release from genetically tagged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s in the ventral tegmental area, induced brain oscillations through activation of inhibitory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s in the medial septum, silenced seizure by inhibition of hippocampal excitatory cells, and triggered memory recall. UCNP technology will enable less-invasive optical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al activity manipulation with the potential for remote therapy.</p>

Social place-cells in the bat hippocampus
<p>Social animals have to know the spatial positions of conspecifics. However, it is unknown how the position of others is represented in the brain. We designed a spatial observational-learning task, in which an observer bat mimicked a demonstrator bat while we recorded hippocampal dorsal-CA1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s from the observer bat. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al subpopulation represented the position of the other bat, in allocentric coordinates. About half of these “social place-cells” represented also the observer’s own position—that is, were place cells. The representation of the demonstrator bat did not reflect self-movement or trajectory planning by the observer. Some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s represented also the position of inanimate moving objects; however, their representation differed from the representation of the demonstrator bat. This suggests a role for hippocampal CA1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s in social-spatial cognition.</p>

Adrenergic nerves activate an angio-metabolic switch in prostate cancer
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>es closely associate with blood vessels and help to pattern the vasculature during development. Recent work suggests that newly formed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e fibers may regulate the tumor microenvironment, but their exact functions are unclear. Studying mouse models of prostate cancer, we show that endothelial β-adrenergic receptor signaling via adrenergic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e–derived noradrenaline in the prostate stroma is critical for activation of an angiogenic switch that fuels exponential tumor growth. Mechanistically, this occurs through alteration of endothelial cell metabolism. Endothelial cells typically rely on aerobic glycolysis for angiogenesis. We found that the loss of endothelial <i>Adrb2</i>, the gene encoding the β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor, leads to inhibition of angiogenesis through enhancement of endothelial oxidative phosphorylation. Codeletion of <i>Adrb2</i> and <i>Cox10</i>, a gene encoding a cytochrome IV oxidase assembly factor, prevented the metabolic shift induced by <i>Adrb2</i> deletion and rescued prostate cancer progression. This cross-talk between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>es and endothelial metabolism could potentially be targeted as an anticancer therapy.</p>

Gating of social reward by oxytocin in the ventral tegmental area
<p>The reward generated by social interactions is critical for promoting prosocial behaviors. Here we present evidence that oxytocin (OXT) release in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a key node of the brain’s reward circuitry, is necessary to elicit social reward. During social interactions, activity in paraventricular nucleus (PVN) OXT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s increased. Direct activation of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s in the PVN or their terminals in the VTA enhanced prosocial behaviors. Conversely, inhibition of PVN OXT axon terminals in the VTA decreased social interactions. OXT increased excitatory drive onto reward-specific VTA dopamine (DA) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s. These results demonstrate that OXT promotes prosocial behavior through direct effects on VTA DA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s, thus providing mechanistic insight into how social interactions can generate rewarding experiences.</p>

Glia put visual map in sync
<p>Watching a fireworks display is a breathtaking experience. As explosions pattern the sky, the visual system must capture information about the time-varying positions, colors, and contrasts of myriad spots of light. This testament to high-acuity vision necessitates the development of neural circuits that map visual space. To generate this retinotopy (visual mapping), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s must differentiate and connect to their synaptic targets with both spatial and temporal precision. How is this achieved? The molecules that regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al differentiation have been described in detail, as have the cues that allow differentiated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s to reach and choose their synaptic partners (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). However, the mechanisms that coordinate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al specification with the development of retinotopic circuit wiring have remained elusive. On page 886 of this issue, Fernandes <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) demonstrate that in the visual system of flies (<i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>), photoreceptors use glial cells as intermediaries to communicate with their neural targets to generate retinotopic circuits.</p>

Conversion of object identity to object-general semantic value in the primate temporal cortex
<p>At the final stage of the ventral visual stream, perirhinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s encode the identity of memorized objects through learning. However, it remains elusive whether and how object percepts alone, or concomitantly a nonphysical attribute of the objects (“learned”), are decoded from perirhinal activities. By combining monkey psychophysics with optogenetic and electrical stimulations, we found a focal spot of memory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s where both stimulations led monkeys to preferentially judge presented objects as “already seen.” In an adjacent fringe area, where <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s did not exhibit selective responses to the learned objects, electrical stimulation induced the opposite behavioral bias toward “never seen before,” whereas optogenetic stimulation still induced bias toward “already seen.” These results suggest that mnemonic judgment of objects emerges via the decoding of their nonphysical attributes encoded by perirhinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s.</p>

A global brain state underlies <i>C. elegans</i> sleep behavior
<p>How the brain effectively switches between and maintains global states, such as sleep and wakefulness, is not yet understood. We used brainwide functional imaging at single-cell resolution to show that during the developmental stage of lethargus, the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> brain is predisposed to global quiescence, characterized by systemic down-regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al activity. Only a few specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s are exempt from this effect. In the absence of external arousing cues, this quiescent brain state arises by the convergence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al activities toward a fixed-point attractor embedded in an otherwise dynamic neural state space. We observed efficient spontaneous and sensory-evoked exits from quiescence. Our data support the hypothesis that during global states such as sleep, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al networks are drawn to a baseline mode and can be effectively reactivated by signaling from arousing circuits.</p>

Pcdhαc2 is required for axonal tiling and assembly of serotonergic circuitries in mice
<p>Serotonergic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s project their axons pervasively throughout the brain and in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>ate various target fields in a space-filling manner, leading to tiled arrangements of their axon terminals to allow optimal allocation of serotonin among target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s. Here we show that conditional deletion of the mouse protocadherin α (<i>Pcdh</i>α) gene cluster in serotonergic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s disrupts local axonal tiling and global assembly of serotonergic circuitries and results in depression-like behaviors. Genetic dissection and expression profiling revealed that this role is specifically mediated by Pcdhαc2, which is the only Pcdhα isoform expressed in serotonergic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s. We conclude that, in contrast to neurite self-avoidance, which requires single-cell identity mediated by Pcdh diversity, a single cell-type identity mediated by the common C-type Pcdh isoform is required for axonal tiling and assembly of serotonergic circuitries.</p>

Breathing control center neurons that promote arousal in mice
<p>Slow, controlled breathing has been used for centuries to promote mental calming, and it is used clinically to suppress excessive arousal such as panic attacks.

We found a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al subpopulation in the mouse preBotzinger complex (preBotC), the primary breathing rhythm generator, which regulates the balance between calm and arousal behaviors. Conditional, bilateral genetic ablation of the ~175 <i>Cdh9</i>/<i>Dbx1</i> double-positive preBotC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s in adult mice left breathing intact but increased calm behaviors and decreased time in aroused states.

Molecular and neural basis of contagious itch behavior in mice
<p>Socially contagious itch is ubiquitous in human society, but whether it exists in rodents is unclear. Using a behavioral paradigm that does not entail prior training or reward, we found that mice scratched after observing a conspecific scratching. Molecular mapping showed increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al activity in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus of mice that displayed contagious scratching. Ablation of gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) or GRPR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s in the SCN abolished contagious scratching behavior, which was recapitulated by chemogenetic inhibition of SCN GRP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s. Activation of SCN GRP/GRPR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s evoked scratching behavior. These data demonstrate that GRP-GRPR signaling is necessary and sufficient for transmitting contagious itch information in the SCN. The findings may have implications for our understanding of neural circuits that control socially contagious behaviors.</p>

The cost of muscle power production: muscle oxygen consumption per unit work increases at low temperatures in <i>Xenopus laevis</i>
<p>Metabolic energy (ATP) supply to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e is essential to support activity and behaviour. It is expected, therefore, that there is strong selection to maximise <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e power output for a given rate of ATP use. However, the viscosity and stiffness of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e increases with a decrease in temperature, which means that more ATP may be required to achieve a given work output. Here, we tested the hypothesis that ATP use increases at lower temperatures for a given power output in <i>Xenopus laevis.</i> To account for temperature variation at different time scales, we considered the interaction between acclimation for 4 weeks (to 15 or 25°C) and acute exposure to these temperatures. Cold-acclimated frogs had greater sprint speed at 15°C than warm-acclimated animals. However, acclimation temperature did not affect isolated gastrocnemius <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e biomechanics. Isolated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e produced greater tetanus force, and faster isometric force generation and relaxation, and generated more work loop power at 25°C than at 15°C acute test temperature. Oxygen consumption of isolated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e at rest did not change with test temperature, but oxygen consumption while <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e was performing work was significantly higher at 15°C than at 25°C, regardless of acclimation conditions. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e therefore consumed significantly more oxygen at 15°C for a given work output than at 25°C, and plastic responses did not modify this thermodynamic effect. The metabolic cost of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e performance and activity therefore increased with a decrease in temperature. To maintain activity across a range of temperature, animals must increase ATP production or face an allocation trade-off at lower temperatures. Our data demonstrate the potential energetic benefits of warming up <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e before activity, which is seen in diverse groups of animals such as bees, which warm flight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e before take-off, and humans performing warm ups before exercise.</p>

BAG3 (Bcl-2–Associated Athanogene-3) Coding Variant in Mice Determines Susceptibility to Ischemic Limb Muscle Myopathy by Directing Autophagy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Critical limb ischemia is a manifestation of peripheral artery disease that carries significant mortality and morbidity risk in humans, although its genetic determinants remain largely unknown. We previously discovered 2 overlapping quantitative trait loci in mice, <i>Lsq-1</i> and <i>Civq-1</i>, that affected limb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e survival and stroke volume after femoral artery or middle cerebral artery ligation, respectively. Here, we report that a <i>Bag3</i> variant (Ile81Met) segregates with tissue protection from hind-limb ischemia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We treated mice with either adeno-associated viruses encoding a control (green fluorescent protein) or 2 BAG3 (Bcl-2–associated athanogene-3) variants, namely Met81 or Ile81, and subjected the mice to hind-limb ischemia.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We found that the BAG3 Ile81Met variant in the C57BL/6 (BL6) mouse background segregates with protection from tissue necrosis in a shorter congenic fragment of <i>Lsq-1</i> (C.B6–<i>Lsq1-3</i>). BALB/c mice treated with adeno-associated virus encoding the BL6 BAG3 variant (Ile81; n=25) displayed reduced limb-tissue necrosis and increased limb tissue perfusion compared with Met81- (n=25) or green fluorescent protein– (n=29) expressing animals.

Voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into smooth muscle during contraction promotes endothelium-mediated feedback vasodilation in arterioles
<p>Vascular smooth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e contraction is suppressed by feedback dilation mediated by the endothelium. In skeletal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e arterioles, this feedback can be activated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals passing from smooth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e through gap junctions to endothelial cells, which protrude through holes in the internal elastic lamina to make contact with vascular smooth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e cells. Although hypothetically either Ca<sup>2+</sup> or inositol trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) may provide the intercellular signal, it is generally thought that IP<sub>3</sub> diffusion is responsible. We provide evidence that Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through L-type voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VDCCs) in vascular smooth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e can pass to the endothelium through positions aligned with holes in the internal elastic lamina in amounts sufficient to activate endothelial cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. In endothelial cells in which IP<sub>3</sub> receptors (IP<sub>3</sub>Rs) were blocked, VDCC-driven Ca<sup>2+</sup> events were transient and localized to the endothelium that protrudes through the internal elastic lamina to contact vascular smooth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e cells. In endothelial cells in which IP<sub>3</sub>Rs were not blocked, VDCC-driven Ca<sup>2+</sup> events in endothelial cells were amplified to form propagating waves. These waves activated voltage-insensitive, intermediate-conductance, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> (IK<sub>Ca</sub>) channels, thereby providing feedback that effectively suppressed vasoconstriction and enabled cycles of constriction and dilation called vasomotion. Thus, agonists that stimulate vascular smooth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e depolarization provide Ca<sup>2+</sup> to endothelial cells to activate a feedback circuit that protects tissue blood flow.</p>

Development
The development of zebrafish tendon and ligament progenitors
<p>Despite the importance of tendons and ligaments for transmitting movement and providing stability to the musculoskeletal system, their development is considerably less well understood than that of the tissues they serve to connect. Zebrafish have been widely used to address questions in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e and skeletal development, yet few studies describe their tendon and ligament tissues. We have analyzed in zebrafish the expression of several genes known to be enriched in mammalian tendons and ligaments, including <i>scleraxis</i> (<i>scx</i>), <i>collagen 1a2</i> (<i>col1a2</i>) and <i>tenomodulin</i> (<i>tnmd</i>), or in the tendon-like myosepta of the zebrafish (<i>xirp2a</i>). Co-expression studies with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e and cartilage markers demonstrate the presence of <i>scxa</i>, <i>col1a2</i> and <i>tnmd</i> at sites between the developing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e and cartilage, and <i>xirp2a</i> at the myotendinous junctions. We determined that the zebrafish craniofacial tendon and ligament progenitors are neural crest derived, as in mammals. Cranial and fin tendon progenitors can be induced in the absence of differentiated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e or cartilage, although neighboring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e and cartilage are required for tendon cell maintenance and organization, respectively. By contrast, myoseptal <i>scxa</i> expression requires <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e for its initiation. Together, these data suggest a conserved role for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e in tendon development. Based on the similarities in gene expression, morphology, collagen ultrastructural arrangement and developmental regulation with that of mammalian tendons, we conclude that the zebrafish tendon populations are homologous to their force-transmitting counterparts in higher vertebrates. Within this context, the zebrafish model can be used to provide new avenues for studying tendon biology in a vertebrate genetic system.</p>

A MicroRNA93–Interferon Regulatory Factor-9–Immunoresponsive Gene-1–Itaconic Acid Pathway Modulates M2-Like Macrophage Polarization to Revascularize Ischemic Muscle
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Currently, no therapies exist for treating and improving outcomes in patients with severe peripheral artery disease (PAD). MicroRNA93 (miR93) has been shown to favorably modulate angiogenesis and to reduce tissue loss in genetic PAD models. However, the cell-specific function, downstream mechanisms, or signaling involved in miR93-mediated ischemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e neovascularization is not clear. Macrophages were best known to modulate arteriogenic response in PAD, and the extent of arteriogenic response induced by macrophages is dependent on greater M2 to M1 activation/polarization state. In the present study, we identified a novel mechanism by which miR93 regulates macrophage polarization to promote angiogenesis and arteriogenesis to revascularize ischemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e in experimental PAD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In vitro (macrophages, endothelial cells, skeletal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e cells under normal and hypoxia serum starvation conditions) and in vivo experiments in preclinical PAD models (unilateral femoral artery ligation and resection) were conducted to examine the role of miR93-interferon regulatory factor-9–immunoresponsive gene-1 (IRG1)–itaconic acid pathway in macrophage polarization, angiogenesis, arteriogenesis, and perfusion recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In vivo, compared with wild-type controls, miR106b-93-25 cluster–deficient mice (miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup>) showed decreased angiogenesis and arteriogenesis correlating with increased M1-like macrophages after experimental PAD. Intramuscular delivery of miR93 in miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup> PAD mice increased angiogenesis, arteriogenesis, and the extent of perfusion, which correlated with more M2-like macrophages in the proximal and distal hind-limb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>es. In vitro, miR93 promotes and sustains M2-like polarization even under M1-like polarizing conditions (hypoxia serum starvation). Delivery of bone marrow–derived macrophages from miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup> to wild-type ischemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e decreased angiogenesis, arteriogenesis, and perfusion, whereas transfer of wild-type macrophages to miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup> had the opposite effect. Systematic analysis of top differentially upregulated genes from RNA sequencing between miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup> and wild-type ischemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e showed that miR93 regulates IRG1 function to modulate itaconic acid production and macrophage polarization. The 3′ untranslated region luciferase assays performed to determine whether IRG1 is a direct target of miR93 revealed that IRG1 is not an miR93 target but that interferon regulatory factor-9, which can regulate IRG1 expression, is an miR93 target. In vitro, increased expression of interferon regulatory factor-9 and IRG1 and itaconic acid treatment significantly decreased endothelial angiogenic potential.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>miR93 inhibits interferon regulatory factor-9 to decrease IRG1–itaconic acid production to induce M2-like polarization in ischemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e to enhance angiogenesis, arteriogenesis, and perfusion recovery in experimental PAD.</p></sec>

Augmentation of Muscle Blood Flow by Ultrasound Cavitation Is Mediated by ATP and Purinergic Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Augmentation of tissue blood flow by therapeutic ultrasound is thought to rely on convective shear. Microbubble contrast agents that undergo ultrasound-mediated cavitation markedly amplify these effects. We hypothesized that purinergic signaling is responsible for shear-dependent increases in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e perfusion during therapeutic cavitation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Unilateral exposure of the proximal hindlimb of mice (with or without ischemia produced by iliac ligation) to therapeutic ultrasound (1.3 MHz, mechanical index 1.3) was performed for 10 minutes after intravenous injection of 2×10<sup>8</sup> lipid microbubbles. Microvascular perfusion was evaluated by low-power contrast ultrasound perfusion imaging. In vivo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e ATP release and in vitro ATP release from endothelial cells or erythrocytes were assessed by a luciferin-luciferase assay. Purinergic signaling pathways were assessed by studying interventions that (1) accelerated ATP degradation; (2) inhibited P2Y receptors, adenosine receptors, or K<sub>ATP</sub> channels; or (3) inhibited downstream signaling pathways involving endothelial nitric oxide synthase or prostanoid production (indomethacin). Augmentation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e perfusion by ultrasound cavitation was assessed in a proof-of-concept clinical trial in 12 subjects with stable sickle cell disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Therapeutic ultrasound cavitation increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e perfusion by 7-fold in normal mice, reversed tissue ischemia for up to 24 hours in the murine model of peripheral artery disease, and doubled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e perfusion in patients with sickle cell disease. Augmentation in flow extended well beyond the region of ultrasound exposure. Ultrasound cavitation produced an ≈40-fold focal and sustained increase in ATP, the source of which included both endothelial cells and erythrocytes. Inhibitory studies indicated that ATP was a critical mediator of flow augmentation that acts primarily through either P2Y receptors or adenosine produced by ectonucleotidase activity. Combined indomethacin and inhibition of endothelial nitric oxide synthase abolished the effects of therapeutic ultrasound, indicating downstream signaling through both nitric oxide and prostaglandins.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Therapeutic ultrasound using microbubble cavitation to increase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e perfusion relies on shear-dependent increases in ATP, which can act through a diverse portfolio of purinergic signaling pathways.

Vocal production complexity correlates with neural instructions in the oyster toadfish (<i>Opsanus tau</i>)
<p>Sound communication is fundamental to many social interactions and essential to courtship and agonistic behaviours in many vertebrates. The swimbladder and associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>es in batrachoidid fishes (midshipman and toadfish) is a unique vertebrate sound production system, wherein fundamental frequencies are determined directly by the firing rate of a vocal-acoustic neural network that drives the contraction frequency of superfast swimbladder <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>es. The oyster toadfish boatwhistle call starts with an irregular sound waveform that could be an emergent property of the peripheral nonlinear sound-producing system or reflect complex encoding in the central nervous system. Here, we demonstrate that the start of the boatwhistle is indicative of a chaotic strange attractor, and tested whether its origin lies in the peripheral sound-producing system or in the vocal motor network. We recorded sound and swimbladder <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e activity in awake, freely behaving toadfish during motor nerve stimulation, and recorded sound, motor nerve and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e activity during spontaneous grunts. The results show that rhythmic motor volleys do not cause complex sound signals. However, arrhythmic recruitment of swimbladder <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e during spontaneous grunts correlates with complex sounds. This supports the hypothesis that the irregular start of the boatwhistle is encoded in the vocal pre-motor neural network, and not caused by peripheral interactions with the sound-producing system. We suggest that sound production system demands across vocal tetrapods have selected for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>es and motorneurons adapted for speed, which can execute complex neural instructions into equivalently complex vocalisations.</p>

Fueling the engine: induction of AMP-activated protein kinase in trout skeletal muscle by swimming
<p>AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is well known to be induced by exercise and to mediate important metabolic changes in the skeletal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e of mammals. Despite the physiological importance of exercise as a modulator of energy use by locomotory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e, the regulation of this enzyme by swimming has not been investigated in fish. We found that sustained swimming (40 days at 0.75 body lengths s<sup>−1</sup>) increased AMPK activity in red and white trout skeletal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e (3.9- and 2.2-fold, respectively) as well as the expression of AMPK target genes involved in energy use: lipoprotein lipase and citrate synthase in red and white <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e and CPT1β1b and PGC-1α in red <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e. Furthermore, electrical pulse stimulation of cultured trout myotubes increased AMPK activity and glucose uptake (1.9- and 1.2-fold, respectively) in an AMPK-dependent manner.

Disease Models & Mechanisms
The fraction of strongly bound cross-bridges is increased in mice that carry the myopathy-linked myosin heavy chain mutation MYH4<sup>L342Q</sup>
<p>Myosinopathies have emerged as a new group of diseases and are caused by mutations in genes encoding myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms. One major hallmark of these diseases is skeletal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e weakness or paralysis, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we have undertaken a detailed functional study of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e fibers from <i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i> mice, which carry a mutation that provokes an L342Q change within the catalytic domain of the type IIb skeletal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e myosin protein MYH4. Because homozygous animals develop rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e-structure disruption and lower-limb paralysis, they must be killed by postnatal day 13, so all experiments were performed using skeletal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>es from adult heterozygous animals (<i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i>/+). <i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i>/+ mice contain MYH4<sup>L342Q</sup> expressed at 7% of the levels of the wild-type (WT) protein, and are overtly and histologically normal. However, mechanical and X-ray diffraction pattern analyses of single membrane-permeabilized fibers revealed, upon maximal Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation, higher stiffness as well as altered meridional and equatorial reflections in <i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i>/+ mice when compared with age-matched WT animals. Under rigor conditions, by contrast, no difference was observed between <i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i>/+ and WT mice. Altogether, these findings prove that, in adult <i>MYH4<sup>L342Q</sup></i> heterozygous mice, the transition from weak to strong myosin cross-bridge binding is facilitated, increasing the number of strongly attached myosin heads, thus enhancing force production. These changes are predictably exacerbated in the type IIb fibers of homozygous mice, in which the embryonic myosin isoform is fully replaced by MYH4<sup>L342Q</sup>, leading to a hypercontraction, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e-structure disruption and lower-limb paralysis. Overall, these findings provide important insights into the molecular pathogenesis of skeletal myosinopathies.</p>

NMDA-Type Glutamate Receptor Activation Promotes Vascular Remodeling and Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Excessive proliferation and apoptosis resistance in pulmonary vascular cells underlie vascular remodeling in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Specific treatments for PAH exist, mostly targeting endothelial dysfunction, but high pulmonary arterial pressure still causes heart failure and death. Pulmonary vascular remodeling may be driven by metabolic reprogramming of vascular cells to increase glutaminolysis and glutamate production. The <i>N</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), a major neuronal glutamate receptor, is also expressed on vascular cells, but its role in PAH is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We assessed the status of the glutamate-NMDAR axis in the pulmonary arteries of patients with PAH and controls through mass spectrometry imaging, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry.

The effect of NMDAR blockade on human pulmonary arterial smooth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e cell proliferation was determined using a BrdU incorporation assay. We assessed the role of NMDARs in vascular remodeling associated to pulmonary hypertension, in both smooth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e-specific NMDAR knockout mice exposed to chronic hypoxia and the monocrotaline rat model of pulmonary hypertension using NMDAR blockers.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We report glutamate accumulation, upregulation of the NMDAR, and NMDAR engagement reflected by increases in GluN1-subunit phosphorylation in the pulmonary arteries of human patients with PAH. K<sub>v</sub> channel inhibition and type A-selective endothelin receptor activation amplified calcium-dependent glutamate release from human pulmonary arterial smooth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e cell, and type A-selective endothelin receptor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor activation led to NMDAR engagement, highlighting crosstalk between the glutamate-NMDAR axis and major PAH-associated pathways. The platelet-derived growth factor-BB-induced proliferation of human pulmonary arterial smooth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e cells involved NMDAR activation and phosphorylated GluN1 subunit localization to cell-cell contacts, consistent with glutamatergic communication between proliferating human pulmonary arterial smooth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e cells via NMDARs.

Although plaque macrophages express EphA2, EphA2 deletion does not affect macrophage phenotype, inflammatory responses, and lipid uptake, and bone marrow chimeras suggest that hematopoietic EphA2 deletion does not affect plaque formation.

Widespread control of calcium signaling by a family of SERCA-inhibiting micropeptides
<p>Micropeptides function as master regulators of calcium-dependent signaling in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e. Sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase (SERCA), the membrane pump that promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e relaxation by taking up Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, is directly inhibited by three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e-specific micropeptides: myoregulin (MLN), phospholamban (PLN), and sarcolipin (SLN). The widespread and essential function of SERCA across diverse cell types has raised questions as to how SERCA is regulated in cells that lack MLN, PLN, and SLN. We identified two transmembrane micropeptides, endoregulin (ELN) and another-regulin (ALN), that share key amino acids with their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e-specific counterparts and function as direct inhibitors of SERCA pump activity. The distribution of transcripts encoding ELN and ALN mirrored that of SERCA isoform-encoding transcripts in non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e cell types.

Using live-cell confocal and superresolution microscopy, we found that the tight interactions between the SR and the plasma membrane in these cells relied on arching microtubule structures present at the periphery of smooth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e cells and were independent of the actin cytoskeleton. Loss of peripheral coupling associated with microtubule depolymerization altered the spatiotemporal properties of localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks generated by the release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> through type 2 RyRs (RyR2s) on the SR and decreased the number of sites of colocalization between RyR2s and large-conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> (BK) channels. The reduced BK channel activity associated with the loss of SR–plasma membrane interactions was accompanied by increased pressure–induced constriction of cerebral resistance arteries. We conclude that microtubule structures maintain peripheral coupling in contractile smooth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e cells, which is crucial for the regulation of contractility and cerebral vascular tone.</p>

Gene editing restores dystrophin expression in a canine model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy
<p>Mutations in the gene encoding dystrophin, a protein that maintains <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e integrity and function, cause Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The deltaE50-MD dog model of DMD harbors a mutation corresponding to a mutational “hotspot” in the human <i>DMD</i> gene. We used adeno-associated viruses to deliver CRISPR gene editing components to four dogs and examined dystrophin protein expression 6 weeks after intramuscular delivery (<i>n</i> = 2) or 8 weeks after systemic delivery (<i>n</i> = 2). After systemic delivery in skeletal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e, dystrophin was restored to levels ranging from 3 to 90% of normal, depending on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e type. In cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e, dystrophin levels in the dog receiving the highest dose reached 92% of normal. The treated dogs also showed improved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e histology. These large-animal data support the concept that, with further development, gene editing approaches may prove clinically useful for the treatment of DMD.</p>

Functional and histopathological identification of the respiratory failure in a DMSXL transgenic mouse model of myotonic dystrophy
<p>Acute and chronic respiratory failure is one of the major and potentially life-threatening features in individuals with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). Despite several clinical demonstrations showing respiratory problems in DM1 patients, the mechanisms are still not completely understood. This study was designed to investigate whether the DMSXL transgenic mouse model for DM1 exhibits respiratory disorders and, if so, to identify the pathological changes underlying these respiratory problems. Using pressure plethysmography, we assessed the breathing function in control mice and DMSXL mice generated after large expansions of the CTG repeat in successive generations of DM1 transgenic mice. Statistical analysis of breathing function measurements revealed a significant decrease in the most relevant respiratory parameters in DMSXL mice, indicating impaired respiratory function. Histological and morphometric analysis showed pathological changes in diaphragmatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e of DMSXL mice, characterized by an increase in the percentage of type I <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e fibers, the presence of central nuclei, partial denervation of end-plates (EPs) and a significant reduction in their size, shape complexity and density of acetylcholine receptors, all of which reflect a possible breakdown in communication between the diaphragmatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>es fibers and the nerve terminals. Diaphragm <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e abnormalities were accompanied by an accumulation of mutant DMPK RNA foci in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e fiber nuclei. Moreover, in DMSXL mice, the unmyelinated phrenic afferents are significantly lower. Also in these mice, significant neuronopathy was not detected in either cervical phrenic motor neurons or brainstem respiratory neurons. Because EPs are involved in the transmission of action potentials and the unmyelinated phrenic afferents exert a modulating influence on the respiratory drive, the pathological alterations affecting these structures might underlie the respiratory impairment detected in DMSXL mice. Understanding mechanisms of respiratory deficiency should guide pharmaceutical and clinical research towards better therapy for the respiratory deficits associated with DM1.</p>

A DGKζ-FoxO-ubiquitin proteolytic axis controls fiber size during skeletal muscle remodeling
<p>Skeletal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e rapidly remodels in response to various stresses, and the resulting changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e mass profoundly influence our health and quality of life. We identified a diacylglycerol kinase ζ (DGKζ)–mediated pathway that regulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e mass during remodeling. During mechanical overload, DGKζ abundance was increased and required for effective hypertrophy. DGKζ not only augmented anabolic responses but also suppressed ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS)–dependent proteolysis. We found that DGKζ inhibited the transcription factor FoxO that promotes the induction of the UPS. This function was mediated through a mechanism that was independent of kinase activity but dependent on the nuclear localization of DGKζ. During denervation, DGKζ abundance was also increased and was required for mitigating the activation of FoxO-UPS and the induction of atrophy. Conversely, overexpression of DGKζ prevented fasting-induced atrophy. Therefore, DGKζ is an inhibitor of the FoxO-UPS pathway, and interventions that increase its abundance could prevent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e wasting.</p>

Targeting an energy sensor to treat diabetes
<p>Obesity occurs when whole-body energy intake exceeds energy expenditure for prolonged periods. This is a major public health issue because obesity increases the risk of disorders such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The liver and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e store excess energy in the form of fat, leading to resistance to the hormone insulin. Released when blood glucose rises after meals, insulin normally promotes glucose uptake by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e and represses glucose production by the liver, thus rapidly returning blood glucose to normal. However, this process is impaired in insulin-resistant individuals, who may eventually develop persistently elevated blood glucose (i.e., T2DM), which can cause debilitating or life-threatening complications. Because the energy sensor AMPK (adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase) promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e glucose uptake by insulin-independent mechanisms, it was proposed in 1999 that AMPK-activating drugs might represent a novel approach to treating T2DM (<i>1</i>). Representing the culmination of more than 15 years of developing this concept, a study by Myers <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) on page 507 of this issue and a study by Cokorinos <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) show that compounds that bind to a unique site on AMPK can promote glucose uptake by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e, and hence reverse elevated blood glucose in animal models of T2DM.</p>

Control of muscle formation by the fusogenic micropeptide myomixer
<p>Skeletal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e formation occurs through fusion of myoblasts to form multinucleated myofibers. From a genome-wide clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) loss-of-function screen for genes required for myoblast fusion and myogenesis, we discovered an 84–amino acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e-specific peptide that we call Myomixer. Myomixer expression coincides with myoblast differentiation and is essential for fusion and skeletal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e formation during embryogenesis. Myomixer localizes to the plasma membrane, where it promotes myoblast fusion and associates with Myomaker, a fusogenic membrane protein. Myomixer together with Myomaker can also induce fibroblast-fibroblast fusion and fibroblast-myoblast fusion. We conclude that the Myomixer-Myomaker pair controls the critical step in myofiber formation during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e development.</p>

Mode of action of a <i>Drosophila</i> FMRFamide in inducing muscle contraction
<p><i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> is a model system for examining the mechanisms of action of neuropeptides. DPKQDFMRFamide was previously shown to induce contractions in <i>Drosophila</i> body wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e fibres in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner. The present study examined the possible involvement of a G-protein-coupled receptor and second messengers in mediating this myotropic effect after removal of the central nervous system. DPKQDFMRFamide-induced contractions were reduced by 70% and 90%, respectively, in larvae with reduced expression of the <i>Drosophila Fmrf</i> receptor (FR) either ubiquitously or specifically in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e tissue, compared with the response in control larvae in which expression was not manipulated. No such effect occurred in larvae with reduced expression of this gene only in neurons. The myogenic effects of DPKQDFMRFamide do not appear to be mediated through either of the two <i>Drosophila</i> myosuppressin receptors (<i>DmsR-1</i> and <i>DmsR-2</i>). DPKQDFMRFamide-induced contractions were not reduced in Ala1 transgenic flies lacking activity of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CamKII), and were not affected by the CaMKII inhibitor KN-93. Peptide-induced contractions in the mutants of the phospholipase C-β (<i>PLC</i>β) gene (<i>norpA</i> larvae) and in IP<sub>3</sub> receptor mutants were similar to contractions elicited in control larvae. The peptide failed to increase cAMP and cGMP levels in <i>Drosophila</i> body wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>es. Peptide-induced contractions were not potentiated by 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, and were not antagonized by inhibitors of cAMP-dependent or cGMP-dependent protein kinases. Additionally, exogenous application of arachidonic acid failed to induce myogenic contractions. Thus, DPKQDFMRFamide induces contractions via a G-protein coupled FMRFamide receptor in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e cells but does not appear to act via cAMP, cGMP, IP<sub>3</sub>, PLC, CaMKII or arachidonic acid.</p>

RSK2 contributes to myogenic vasoconstriction of resistance arteries by activating smooth muscle myosin and the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger
<p>Smooth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e contraction is triggered when Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) phosphorylates the regulatory light chain of myosin (RLC<sub>20</sub>). However, blood vessels from <i>Mlck</i>-deficient mouse embryos retain the ability to contract, suggesting the existence of additional regulatory mechanisms. We showed that the p90 ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (RSK2) also phosphorylated RLC<sub>20</sub> to promote smooth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e contractility. Active, phosphorylated RSK2 was present in mouse resistance arteries under normal basal tone, and phosphorylation of RSK2 increased with myogenic vasoconstriction or agonist stimulation. Resistance arteries from <i>Rsk2</i>-deficient mice were dilated and showed reduced myogenic tone and RLC<sub>20</sub> phosphorylation. RSK2 phosphorylated Ser<sup>19</sup> in RLC in vitro. In addition, RSK2 phosphorylated an activating site in the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger (NHE-1), resulting in cytosolic alkalinization and an increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> that promotes vasoconstriction. NHE-1 activity increased upon myogenic constriction, and the increase in intracellular pH was suppressed in <i>Rsk2</i>-deficient mice. In pressured arteries, RSK2-dependent activation of NHE-1 was associated with increased intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, which would be expected to increase MLCK activity, thereby contributing to basal tone and myogenic responses. Accordingly, <i>Rsk2</i>-deficient mice had lower blood pressure than normal littermates. Thus, RSK2 mediates a procontractile signaling pathway that contributes to the regulation of basal vascular tone, myogenic vasoconstriction, and blood pressure and may be a potential therapeutic target in smooth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e contractility disorders.</p>

Enhancing natriuretic peptide signaling in adipose tissue, but not in muscle, protects against diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance
<p>In addition to controlling blood pressure, cardiac natriuretic peptides (NPs) can stimulate lipolysis in adipocytes and promote the “browning” of white adipose tissue. NPs may also increase the oxidative capacity of skeletal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e. To unravel the contribution of NP-stimulated metabolism in adipose tissue compared to that in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e in vivo, we generated mice with tissue-specific deletion of the NP clearance receptor, NPRC, in adipose tissue (<i>Nprc</i><sup><i>AKO</i></sup>) or in skeletal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e (<i>Nprc</i><sup><i>MKO</i></sup>). We showed that, similar to <i>Nprc</i> null mice, <i>Nprc</i><sup><i>AKO</i></sup> mice, but not <i>Nprc</i><sup><i>MKO</i></sup> mice, were resistant to obesity induced by a high-fat diet. <i>Nprc</i><sup><i>AKO</i></sup> mice exhibited increased energy expenditure, improved insulin sensitivity, and increased glucose uptake into brown fat. These mice were also protected from diet-induced hepatic steatosis and visceral fat inflammation. These findings support the conclusion that NPRC in adipose tissue is a critical regulator of energy metabolism and suggest that inhibiting this receptor may be an important avenue to explore for combating metabolic disease.</p>

A cryo-EM–based model of phosphorylation- and FKBP12.6-mediated allosterism of the cardiac ryanodine receptor
<p>Type 2 ryanodine receptors (RyR2s) are calcium channels that play a vital role in triggering cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e contraction by releasing calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytoplasm. Several cardiomyopathies are associated with the abnormal functioning of RyR2. We determined the three-dimensional structure of rabbit RyR2 in complex with the regulatory protein FKBP12.6 in the closed state at 11.8 óÅÅ resolution using cryo-electron microscopy and built an atomic model of RyR2. The heterogeneity in the data set revealed two RyR2 conformations that we proposed to be related to the extent of phosphorylation of the P2 domain. Because the more flexible conformation may correspond to RyR2 with a phosphorylated P2 domain, we suggest that phosphorylation may set RyR2 in a conformation that needs less energy to transition to the open state. Comparison of RyR2 from cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e and RyR1 from skeletal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e showed substantial structural differences between the two, especially in the helical domain 2 (HD2) structure forming the Clamp domain, which participates in quaternary interactions with the dihydropyridine receptor and neighboring RyRs in RyR1 but not in RyR2. Rigidity of the HD2 domain of RyR2 was enhanced by binding of FKBP12.6, a ligand that stabilizes RyR2 in the closed state. These results help to decipher the molecular basis of the different mechanisms of activation and oligomerization of the RyR isoforms and could be extended to RyR complexes in other tissues.</p>

Hawkmoths use nectar sugar to reduce oxidative damage from flight
<p>Nectar-feeding animals have among the highest recorded metabolic rates. High aerobic performance is linked to oxidative damage in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>es. Antioxidants in nectar are scarce to nonexistent. We propose that nectarivores use nectar sugar to mitigate the oxidative damage caused by the muscular demands of flight. We found that sugar-fed moths had lower oxidative damage to their flight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e membranes than unfed moths. Using respirometry coupled with δ<sup>13</sup>C analyses, we showed that moths generate antioxidant potential by shunting nectar glucose to the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), resulting in a reduction in oxidative damage to the flight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>es. We suggest that nectar feeding, the use of PPP, and intense exercise are causally linked and have allowed the evolution of powerful fliers that feed on nectar.</p>

Unusual Diversity of Myoglobin Genes in the Lungfish
<p>Myoglobin is a respiratory protein that serves as a model system in a variety of biological fields. Its main function is to deliver and store O<sub>2</sub> in the heart and skeletal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>es, but myoglobin is also instrumental in homeostasis of nitric oxide (NO) and detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Almost every vertebrate harbors a single myoglobin gene; only some cyprinid fishes have two recently duplicated myoglobin genes. Here we show that the West African lungfish <i>Protopterus annectens</i> has at least seven distinct myoglobin genes (<i>PanMb1–7</i>), which diverged early in the evolution of lungfish and showed an enhanced evolutionary rate. These myoglobins are lungfish specific, and no other globin gene was found amplified. The myoglobins are differentially expressed in various lungfish tissues, and the brain is the main site of myoglobin expression. The typical myoglobin-containing tissues, the skeletal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e and the heart, have much lower myoglobin mRNA levels. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e and heart express distinct myoglobins (<i>PanMb1</i> and <i>PanMb3</i>, respectively). In cell culture, lungfish myoglobins improved cellular survival under hypoxia albeit with different efficiencies and reduced the production of reactive oxygen species. Only <i>Mb2</i> and <i>Mb6</i> enhanced the energy status of the cells. The unexpected diversity of myoglobin hints to a functional diversification of this gene: some myoglobins may have adapted to the O<sub>2</sub> requirements of the specific tissue and help the lungfish to survive hypoxic periods; other myoglobins may have taken over the roles of neuroglobin and cytoglobin, which appear to be missing in the West African lungfish.</p>

Skeletal muscle fuel selection occurs at the mitochondrial level
<p>Mammals exponentially increase the rate of carbohydrate oxidation as exercise intensity rises, while birds combust lipid almost exclusively while flying at high percentages of aerobic capacity. The fuel oxidized by contracting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e depends on many factors: whole-body fuel storage mass, mobilization, blood transport, cellular uptake, and substrate selection at the level of the mitochondrion. We examined the fuel preferences of mitochondria isolated from mammalian and avian locomotory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>es using two approaches. First, the influence of substrates on the kinetics of respiration (<i>K</i><sub>m,ADP</sub> and <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>) was evaluated. For all substrates and combinations, <i>K</i><sub>m,ADP</sub> was generally twofold higher in avian mitochondria. Second, fuel competition between pyruvate, glutamate and/or palmitoyl-<sc>l</sc>-carnitine at three levels of ATP free energy was determined using the principle of mass balance and the measured rates of O<sub>2</sub> consumption and metabolite accumulation/utilization. Avian mitochondria strongly spared pyruvate from oxidation when another substrate was available and fatty acid was the dominant substrate, regardless of energy state. Mammalian mitochondria exhibited some preference for fatty acid over pyruvate at lower flux (higher energy state), but exhibited a much greater tendency to select pyruvate and glutamate when available. Studies in sonicated mitochondria revealed twofold higher electron transport chain electron conductance in avian mitochondria. We conclude that substantial fuel selection occurs at the level of the mitochondrial matrix and that avian flight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e mitochondria are particularly biased toward the selection of fatty acid, possibly by facilitating high β-oxidation flux by maintaining a more oxidized matrix.</p>

Convergence in morphology and masticatory function between the pharyngeal jaws of grass carp, <i>Ctenopharyngodon idella</i>, and oral jaws of amniote herbivores
<p>The cellulose-rich walls that protect plant cells are difficult to digest, and therefore mechanical food processing is a key aspect of herbivory across vertebrates. Cell walls are typically broken down by translation of flattened teeth in the occlusal plane (i.e. grinding) as part of a complex, rhythmic chewing stroke. The grass carp, <i>Ctenopharyngodon idella</i>, is a voracious, invasive herbivorous fish that relies solely on its pharyngeal teeth, located in the back of the throat, for mechanical processing of plant material. Here, we describe the musculoskeletal anatomy of the pharyngeal jaws of grass carp and use XROMM to quantify chewing kinematics and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e strain. The pharyngeal jaws are suspended in a sling of 11 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>es and maintain no bony articulation with any other skeletal elements in the head. The jaws bear long, serrated teeth that are worn during use into flattened tooth cusps. Our kinematic data show that this wear is the result of the teeth being elevated into occlusion against the basioccipital process and keratinous chewing pad, not tooth-on-tooth occlusion. Pharyngeal jaw elevation results from large strains in the jaw elevator <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e, the levator arcus branchialis V, to drive a pulley-like mechanism that rotates the jaws about a pivot point at the symphysis between the left and right pharyngeal jaws. These complex, rhythmic jaw rotations translate the teeth laterally across the chewing surface throughout the occlusion phase. The grass carp chewing system is strikingly similar in gross morphology and masticatory function to herbivorous chewing strategies in other vertebrates.</p>

Satellite cell activation and populations on single muscle-fiber cultures from adult zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>)
<p>Satellite cells (SCs), stem cells in skeletal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e, are mitotically quiescent in adult mammals until activated for growth or regeneration. In mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e, SCs are activated by nitric oxide (NO), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and the mechanically induced NO–HGF signaling cascade. Here, the SC population on fibers from the adult, ectothermic zebrafish and SC responsiveness to activating stimuli were assessed using the model system of isolated fibers cultured at 27 and 21°C. SCs were identified by immunostaining for the HGF receptor, c-met, and activation was determined using bromodeoxyuridine uptake in culture or <i>in vivo</i>. In dose–response studies, SC activation was increased by treatment with the NO-donor drug isosorbide dinitrate (1 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>) or HGF (10 ng ml<sup>−1</sup>) to maximum activation at lower concentrations of both than in previous studies of mouse fibers. HGF-induced activation was blocked by anti-c-met antibody, and reduced by culture at 21°C. The effect of cyclical stretch (3 h at 4 cycles per minute) increased activation and was blocked by nitric oxide synthase inhibition and reduced by culture at 21°C. The number of c-met+ SCs per fiber increased rapidly (by 3 h) after stretching. The character of signaling in SC activation on zebrafish fibers, in particular temperature-dependent responses to HGF and stretch, gives new insights into the influence of ectothermy on regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e growth in teleosts and suggests the use of the single-fiber model system to explore the basis of fiber hyperplasia and the conservation of regulatory pathways between species.</p>

Regulation of succinate-fuelled mitochondrial respiration in liver and skeletal muscle of hibernating thirteen-lined ground squirrels
<p>Hibernating ground squirrels (<i>Ictidomys tridecemlineatus</i>) alternate between two distinct metabolic states throughout winter: torpor, during which metabolic rate (MR) and body temperature (<i>T</i><sub>b</sub>) are considerably suppressed, and interbout euthermia (IBE), during which MR and <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> briefly return to euthermic levels. Previous studies showed suppression of succinate-fuelled respiration during torpor in liver and skeletal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e mitochondria; however, these studies used only a single, saturating succinate concentration. Therefore, they could not address whether mitochondrial metabolic suppression occurs under physiological substrate concentrations or whether differences in the kinetics of mitochondrial responses to changing substrate concentration might also contribute to mitochondrial metabolic regulation during torpor. The present study confirmed that succinate oxidation is reduced during torpor in liver and skeletal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e at 37 and 10°C over a 100-fold range of succinate concentrations. At 37°C, this suppression resulted from inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), which had a greater affinity for oxaloacetate (an SDH inhibitor) during torpor. At 10°C, SDH was not inhibited, suggesting that SDH inhibition initiates but does not maintain mitochondrial suppression during torpor. Moreover, in both liver and skeletal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e, mitochondria from torpid animals maintained relatively higher respiration rates at low succinate concentrations, which reduces the extent of energy savings that can be achieved during torpor, but may also maintain mitochondrial oxidative capacity above some lower critical threshold, thereby preventing cellular and/or mitochondrial injury during torpor and facilitating rapid recruitment of oxidative capacity during arousal.</p>

Ontogenetic expression of metabolic genes and microRNAs in rainbow trout alevins during the transition from the endogenous to the exogenous feeding period
<p>As oviparous fish, rainbow trout change their nutritional strategy during ontogenesis. This change is divided into the exclusive utilization of yolk-sac reserves (endogenous feeding), the concurrent utilization of yolk reserves and exogenous feeds (mixed feeding) and the complete dependence on external feeds (exogenous feeding). The change in food source is accompanied by well-characterized morphological changes, including the development of adipose tissue as an energy storage site, and continuous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e development to improve foraging. The aim of this study was to investigate underlying molecular mechanisms that contribute to these ontogenetic changes between the nutritional phenotypes in rainbow trout alevins. We therefore analyzed the expression of marker genes of metabolic pathways and microRNAs (miRNAs) important in the differentiation and/or maintenance of metabolic tissues. In exogenously feeding alevins, the last enzyme involved in glucose production (<i>g6pca</i> and <i>g6pcb</i>) and lipolytic gene expression (<i>cpt1a</i> and <i>cpt1b</i>) decreased, while that of <i>gk</i>, involved in hepatic glucose use, was induced. This pattern is consistent with a progressive switch from the utilization of stored (gluconeogenic) amino acids and lipids in endogenously feeding alevins to a utilization of exogenous feeds <i>via</i> the glycolytic pathway. A shift towards the utilization of external feeds is further evidenced by the increased expression of <i>omy-miRNA-143</i>, a homologue of the mammalian marker of adipogenesis. The expression of its predicted target gene <i>abhd5</i>, a factor in triglyceride hydrolysis, decreased concurrently, suggesting a potential mechanism in the onset of lipid deposition. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e-specific <i>omy-miRNA-1/133</i> and <i>myod1</i> expression decreased in exogenously feeding alevins, a molecular signature consistent with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e hypertrophy, which may be linked to nutritional cues or increased foraging.</p>

Epigenetic Dysregulation of the Dynamin-Related Protein 1 Binding Partners MiD49 and MiD51 Increases Mitotic Mitochondrial Fission and Promotes Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Mitotic fission is increased in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a hyperproliferative, apoptosis-resistant disease. The fission mediator dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) must complex with adaptor proteins to cause fission. Drp1-induced fission has been therapeutically targeted in experimental PAH. Here, we examine the role of 2 recently discovered, poorly understood Drp1 adapter proteins, mitochondrial dynamics protein of 49 and 51 kDa (MiD49 and MiD51), in normal vascular cells and explore their dysregulation in PAH.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Immunoblots of pulmonary artery smooth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e cells (control, n=6; PAH, n=8) and immunohistochemistry of lung sections (control, n=6; PAH, n=6) were used to assess the expression of MiD49 and MiD51. The effects of manipulating MiDs on cell proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis were assessed in human and rodent PAH pulmonary artery smooth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e cells with flow cytometry. Mitochondrial fission was studied by confocal imaging. A microRNA (miR) involved in the regulation of MiD expression was identified using microarray techniques and in silico analyses. The expression of circulatory miR was assessed with quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction in healthy volunteers (HVs) versus patients with PAH from Sheffield, UK (plasma: HV, n=29, PAH, n=27; whole blood: HV, n=11, PAH, n=14) and then confirmed in a cohort from Beijing, China (plasma: HV, n=19, PAH, n=36; whole blood: HV, n=20, PAH, n=39). This work was replicated in monocrotaline and Sugen 5416-hypoxia, preclinical PAH models. Small interfering RNAs targeting MiDs or an miR mimic were nebulized to rats with monocrotaline-induced PAH (n=4–10).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>MiD expression is increased in PAH pulmonary artery smooth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e cells, which accelerates Drp1-mediated mitotic fission, increases cell proliferation, and decreases apoptosis. Silencing MiDs (but not other Drp1 binding partners, fission 1 or mitochondrial fission factor) promotes mitochondrial fusion and causes G1-phase cell cycle arrest through extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2– and cyclin-dependent kinase 4–dependent mechanisms. Augmenting MiDs in normal cells causes fission and recapitulates the PAH phenotype. MiD upregulation results from decreased miR-34a-3p expression. Circulatory miR-34a-3p expression is decreased in both patients with PAH and preclinical models of PAH. Silencing MiDs or augmenting miR-34a-3p regresses experimental PAH.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In health, MiDs regulate Drp1-mediated fission, whereas in disease, epigenetic upregulation of MiDs increases mitotic fission, which drives pathological proliferation and apoptosis resistance. The miR-34a-3p-MiD pathway offers new therapeutic targets for PAH.</p></sec>

Novel Adipokine, FAM19A5, Inhibits Neointima Formation After Injury Through Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptor 2
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Obesity plays crucial roles in the development of cardiovascular diseases. However, the mechanisms that link obesity and cardiovascular diseases remain elusive. Compelling evidence indicates that adipokines play an important role in obesity-related cardiovascular diseases. Here, we found a new adipokine-named family with sequence similarity 19, member A5 (FAM19A5), a protein with unknown function that was predicted to be distantly related to the CC-chemokine family. We aimed to test whether adipose-derived FAM19A5 regulates vascular pathology on injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>DNA cloning, protein expression, purification, and N-terminal sequencing were applied to characterize FAM19A5. Adenovirus infection and siRNA transfection were performed to regulate FAM19A5 expression. Balloon and wire injury were performed in vivo on the rat carotid arteries and mouse femoral arteries, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis, radioactive ligand-receptor binding assays, receptor internalization, and calcium mobilization assays were used to identify the functional receptor for FAM19A5.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We first characterized FAM19A5 as a secreted protein, and the first 43 N-terminal amino acids were the signal peptides. Both FAM19A5 mRNA and protein were abundantly expressed in the adipose tissue but were downregulated in obese mice. Overexpression of FAM19A5 markedly inhibited vascular smooth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e cell proliferation and migration and neointima formation in the carotid arteries of balloon-injured rats. Accordingly, FAM19A5 silencing in adipocytes significantly promoted vascular smooth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e cell activation. Adipose-specific FAM19A5 transgenic mice showed greater attenuation of neointima formation compared with wild-type littermates fed with or without Western-style diet. We further revealed that sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 was the functional receptor for FAM19A5, with a dissociation constant (<i>K</i><sub>d</sub>) of 0.634 nmol/L. Inhibition of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 or its downstream G12/13-RhoA signaling circumvented the suppressive effects of FAM19A5 on vascular smooth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e cell proliferation and migration.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We revealed that a novel adipokine, FAM19A5, was capable of inhibiting postinjury neointima formation via sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2-G12/13-RhoA signaling. Downregulation of FAM19A5 during obesity may trigger cardiometabolic diseases.</p></sec>

Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase Promotes Pulmonary Vascular Remodeling and Is a Therapeutic Target in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a severe and progressive disease, a hallmark of which is pulmonary vascular remodeling. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is a cytozyme that regulates intracellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide levels and cellular redox state, regulates histone deacetylases, promotes cell proliferation, and inhibits apoptosis. We hypothesized that NAMPT promotes pulmonary vascular remodeling and that inhibition of NAMPT could attenuate pulmonary hypertension.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Plasma, mRNA, and protein levels of NAMPT were measured in the lungs and isolated pulmonary artery endothelial cells from patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension and in the lungs of rodent models of pulmonary hypertension. <i>Nampt</i><sup>+/−</sup> mice were exposed to 10% hypoxia and room air for 4 weeks, and the preventive and therapeutic effects of NAMPT inhibition were tested in the monocrotaline and Sugen hypoxia models of pulmonary hypertension. The effects of NAMPT activity on proliferation, migration, apoptosis, and calcium signaling were tested in human pulmonary artery smooth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Plasma and mRNA and protein levels of NAMPT were increased in the lungs and isolated pulmonary artery endothelial cells from patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, as well as in lungs of rodent models of pulmonary hypertension. <i>Nampt</i><sup>+/−</sup> mice were protected from hypoxia-mediated pulmonary hypertension. NAMPT activity promoted human pulmonary artery smooth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e cell proliferation via a paracrine effect. In addition, recombinant NAMPT stimulated human pulmonary artery smooth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e cell proliferation via enhancement of store-operated calcium entry by enhancing expression of Orai2 and STIM2. Last, inhibition of NAMPT activity attenuated monocrotaline and Sugen hypoxia–induced pulmonary hypertension in rats.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our data provide evidence that NAMPT plays a role in pulmonary vascular remodeling and that its inhibition could be a potential therapeutic target for pulmonary arterial hypertension.</p></sec>

Scaling of the hydrostatic skeleton in the earthworm <i>Lumbricus terrestris</i>
<p>The structural and functional consequences of changes in size or scale have been well studied in animals with rigid skeletons, but relatively little is known about scale effects in animals with hydrostatic skeletons. We used glycol methacrylate histology and microscopy to examine the scaling of mechanically important morphological features of the earthworm <i>Lumbricus terrestris</i> over an ontogenetic size range from 0.03 to 12.89 g. We found that <i>L. terrestris</i> becomes disproportionately longer and thinner as it grows. This increase in the length to diameter ratio with size means that, when normalized for mass, adult worms gain ~117% mechanical advantage during radial expansion, compared with hatchling worms. We also found that the cross-sectional area of the longitudinal musculature scales as body mass to the ~0.6 power across segments, which is significantly lower than the 0.66 power predicted by isometry. The cross-sectional area of the circular musculature, however, scales as body mass to the ~0.8 power across segments, which is significantly higher than predicted by isometry. By modeling the interaction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e cross-sectional area and mechanical advantage, we calculate that the force output generated during both circular and longitudinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e contraction scales near isometry. We hypothesize that the allometric scaling of earthworms may reflect changes in soil properties and burrowing mechanics with size.</p>

A necrotic stimulus is required to maximize matrix-mediated myogenesis in mice
<p>Biomaterials that are similar to skeletal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e extracellular matrix have been shown to augment regeneration in ischemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">muscl</span></strong>e. In this study, treatment with a collagen-based matrix stimulated molecular myogenesis in an <i>mdx</i> murine model of necrosis. Matrix-treated animals ran ≥40% further, demonstrating functional regeneration, and expressed increased levels of myogenic transcripts. By contrast, matrix treatment was unable to induce transcriptional or functional changes in an <i>MLC/SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></i> atrophic mouse model. <i>In vitro</i>, satellite cells were cultured under standard conditions, on matrix, in the presence of myocyte debris (to simulate a necrotic-like environment) or with both matrix and necrotic stimuli. Exposure to both matrix and necrotic stimuli induced the greatest increases in <i>mef2c</i>, <i>myf5</i>, <i>myoD</i> and myogenin transcripts. Furthermore, conditioned medium collected from satellite cells cultured with both stimuli contained elevated levels of factors that modulate satellite cell activation and proliferation, such as FGF-2, HGF and SDF-1. Application of the conditioned medium to C2C12 myoblasts accelerated maturation, as demonstrated by increased <i>mef2c</i>, <i>myf5</i> and myogenin transcripts and fusion indexes. In summary, the collagen matrix required a necrotic stimulus to enhance the maturation of satellite cells and their secretion of a myogenic cocktail. Considering that matrix treatment supports myogenesis only in <i>in vivo</i> models that exhibit necrosis, this study demonstrates that a necrotic environment is required to maximize matrix-mediated myogenesis.</p>

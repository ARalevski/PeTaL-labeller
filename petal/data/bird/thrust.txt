Profiling the origin, dynamics, and function of traction force in B cell activation
<p>B lymphocytes use B cell receptors (BCRs) to recognize membrane-bound antigens to further initiate cell spreading and contraction responses during B cell activation. We combined traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e microscopy and live-cell imaging to profile the origin, dynamics, and function of traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e generation in these responses. We showed that B cell activation required the generation of 10 to 20 nN of traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e when encountering antigens presented by substrates with stiffness values from 0.5 to 1 kPa, which mimic the rigidity of antigen-presenting cells in vivo. Perturbation experiments revealed that F-actin remodeling and myosin- and dynein-mediated contractility contributed to traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e generation and B cell activation. Moreover, membrane-proximal BCR signaling molecules (including Lyn, Syk, Btk, PLC-γ2, BLNK, and Vav3) and adaptor molecules (Grb2, Cbl, and Dok-3) linking BCR microclusters and motor proteins were also required for the sustained generation of these traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es. We found a positive correlation between the strength of the traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e and the mean fluorescence intensity of the BCR microclusters. Furthermore, we demonstrated that isotype-switched memory B cells expressing immunoglobulin G (IgG)–BCRs generated greater traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es than did mature naive B cells expressing IgM-BCRs during B cell activation. Last, we observed that primary B cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis generated greater traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es than did B cells from healthy donors in response to antigen stimulation. Together, these data delineate the origin, dynamics, and function of traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e during B cell activation.</p>

Mediolateral force distribution at the knee joint shifts across activities and is driven by tibiofemoral alignment
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Tibiofemoral alignment is important to determine the rate of   progression of osteoarthritis and implant survival after total knee   arthroplasty (TKA). Normally, surgeons aim for neutral tibiofemoral   alignment following TKA, but this has been questioned in recent   years. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether varus or valgus   alignment indeed leads to increased medial or lateral tibiofemoral   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es during static and dynamic weight-bearing activities.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Tibiofemoral contact <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es and moments were measured in nine   patients with instrumented knee implants. Medial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e ratios were   analysed during nine daily activities, including activities with   single-limb support (e.g. walking) and double-limb support (e.g.   knee bend). Hip-knee-ankle angles in the frontal plane were analysed   using full-leg coronal radiographs. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The medial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e ratio strongly correlated with the tibiofemoral   alignment in the static condition of one-legged stance (R² = 0.88)   and dynamic single-limb loading (R² = 0.59) with varus malalignment   leading to increased medial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e ratios of up to 88%. In contrast,   the correlation between leg alignment and magnitude of medial compartment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e   was much less pronounced. A lateral shift of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e occurred during   activities with double-limb support and higher knee flexion angles. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The medial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e ratio depends on both the tibiofemoral alignment   and the nature of the activity involved. It cannot be generalised   to a single value. Higher medial ratios during single-limb loading   are associated with varus malalignment in TKA. The current trend   towards a ‘constitutional varus’ after joint replacement, in terms   of overall tibiofemoral alignment, should be considered carefully   with respect to the increased medial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e ratio.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:779–87.</p></sec>

Do varus or valgus outliers have higher forces in the medial or lateral compartments than those which are in-range after a kinematically aligned total knee arthroplasty?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of this study were to determine the proportion of patients   with outlier varus or valgus alignment in kinematically aligned   total knee arthroplasty (TKA), whether those with outlier varus   or valgus alignment have higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es in the medial or lateral   compartments of the knee than those with in-range alignment and   whether measurements of the alignment of the limb, knee and components   predict compartment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The intra-operative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es in the medial and lateral compartments   were measured with an instrumented tibial insert in 67 patients   who underwent a kinematically aligned TKA during passive movement.

Myosin IIA deficient cells migrate efficiently despite reduced traction forces at cell periphery
<p>Cell motility is a cornerstone of embryogenesis, tissue remodeling and repair, and cancer cell invasion. It is generally thought that migrating cells grab and exert traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e onto the extracellular matrix in order to pull the cell body forward. While previous studies have shown that myosin II deficient cells migrate efficiently, whether these cells exert traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es during cell migration in the absence of the major contractile machinery is currently unknown. Using an array of micron-sized pillars as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e sensor and shRNA specific to each myosin II isoform (A and B), we analyzed how myosin IIA and IIB individually regulate cell migration and traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e generation. Myosin IIA and IIB localized preferentially to the leading edge where traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e was greatest, and the trailing edge, respectively. When individual myosin II isoforms were depleted by shRNA, myosin IIA deficient cells lost actin stress fibers and focal adhesions, whereas myosin IIB deficient cells maintained similar actin organization and focal adhesions as wild-type cells. Interestingly, myosin IIA deficient cells migrated faster than wild-type or myosin IIB deficient cells on both a rigid surface and a pillar array, yet myosin IIA deficient cells exerted significantly less traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e at the leading edge than wild-type or myosin IIB deficient cells. These results suggest that, in the absence of myosin IIA mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e-generating machinery, cells move with minimal traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es at the cell periphery, thus demonstrating the remarkable ability of cells to adapt and migrate.</p>

The principles of cascading power limits in small, fast biological and engineered systems
<p>Mechanical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">power</span></strong> limitations emerge from the physical trade-off between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e and velocity. Many biological systems incorporate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">power</span></strong>-enhancing mechanisms enabling extraordinary accelerations at small sizes. We establish how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">power</span></strong> enhancement emerges through the dynamic coupling of motors, springs, and latches and reveal how each displays its own <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e-velocity behavior. We mathematically demonstrate a tunable performance space for spring-actuated movement that is applicable to biological and synthetic systems. Incorporating nonideal spring behavior and parameterizing latch dynamics allows the identification of critical transitions in mass and trade-offs in spring scaling, both of which offer explanations for long-observed scaling patterns in biological systems. This analysis defines the cascading challenges of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">power</span></strong> enhancement, explores their emergent effects in biological and engineered systems, and charts a pathway for higher-level analysis and synthesis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">power</span></strong>-amplified systems.</p>

The functional role of caudal and anal/dorsal fins during the C-start of a bluegill sunfish
<p>Fast starts are crucial in the survival of aquatic swimmers to capture prey or avoid predators. Currently, it is widely accepted that during C-starts: (1) the caudal fin generates a considerable hydrodynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e; and (2) anal/dorsal fins are erected to significantly increase the hydrodynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e. In this work, the above hypotheses on the role of fins during C-starts are studied using experimentally guided numerical simulations of four bluegill sunfish, whose fins are removed or erected. The amount of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e created by the body and fins at each time instant was not constant and varied during the C-start. Nevertheless, in agreement with hypothesis (1), up to 70% of the instantaneous hydrodynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e was generated by the tail during Stage 2 of the C-start, when the sunfish rapidly bends out of the C-shape. Additionally, the contribution in Stage 1, when the sunfish bends into a C-shape, is less than 20% at each instant. Most of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e in Stage 1 was produced by the body of the sunfish. In contrast to hypothesis (2), the effect of erection/removal of the fins was less than 5% of the instantaneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e in both Stages 1 and 2, except for a short period of time (2 ms) just before Stage 2. However, it is known that the anal/dorsal fins are actively controlled during the C-start from muscle activity measurements. Based on the results presented here, it is suggested that the active control of the anal/dorsal fins can be related to retaining the stability of the sunfish against roll and pitch movements during the C-start. Furthermore, the erection of the fins increases the moment of inertia to make the roll and pitch movements more difficult.</p>

Teaching an old carbocation new tricks: Intermolecular C–H insertion reactions of vinyl cations
<p>Vinyl carbocations have been the subject of extensive experimental and theoretical studies over the past five decades. Despite this long history in chemistry, the utility of vinyl cations in chemical synthesis has been limited, with most reactivity studies focusing on solvolysis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong>s or intramolecular processes. Here we report synthetic and mechanistic studies of vinyl cations generated through silylium–weakly coordinating anion catalysis. We find that these reactive intermediates undergo mild intermolecular carbon-carbon bond–forming <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong>s, including carbon-hydrogen (C–H) insertion into unactivated sp<sup>3</sup> C–H bonds and reductive Friedel-Crafts <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong>s with arenes. Moreover, we conducted computational studies of these alkane C–H functionalization <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong>s and discovered that they proceed through nonclassical, ambimodal transition structures. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong> manifold provides a framework for the catalytic functionalization of hydrocarbons using simple ketone derivatives.</p>

Real-space and real-time observation of a plasmon-induced chemical reaction of a single molecule
<p>Plasmon-induced chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong>s of molecules adsorbed on metal nanostructures are attracting increased attention for photocatalytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong>s. However, the mechanism remains controversial because of the difficulty of direct observation of the chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong>s in the plasmonic field, which is strongly localized near the metal surface. We used a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to achieve real-space and real-time observation of a plasmon-induced chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong> at the single-molecule level. A single dimethyl disulfide molecule on silver and copper surfaces was dissociated by the optically excited plasmon at the STM junction. The STM study combined with theoretical calculations shows that this plasmon-induced chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong> occurred by a direct intramolecular excitation mechanism.</p>

Molecular mechanism of extreme mechanostability in a pathogen adhesin
<p>High resilience to mechanical stress is key when pathogens adhere to their target and initiate infection. Using atomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e microscopy–based single-molecule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e spectroscopy, we explored the mechanical stability of the prototypical staphylococcal adhesin SdrG, which targets a short peptide from human fibrinogen β. Steered molecular dynamics simulations revealed, and single-molecule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e spectroscopy experiments confirmed, the mechanism by which this complex withstands <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es of over 2 nanonewtons, a regime previously associated with the strength of a covalent bond. The target peptide, confined in a screwlike manner in the binding pocket of SdrG, distributes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es mainly toward the peptide backbone through an intricate hydrogen bond network. Thus, these adhesins can attach to their target with exceptionally resilient mechanostability, virtually independent of peptide side chains.</p>

We report here the development of an automated flow-based synthesis platform, designed from commercially available components, that integrates both rapid nanomole-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong> screening and micromole-scale synthesis into a single modular unit.

Through multiple injections of the same segment, the system directly produced micromole quantities of desired material. The optimal conditions were also replicated in traditional flow and batch mode at 50- to 200-milligram scale to provide good to excellent yields.</p>

Structure of a symmetric photosynthetic reaction center–photosystem
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong> centers are pigment-protein complexes that drive photosynthesis by converting light into chemical energy. It is believed that they arose once from a homodimeric protein. The symmetry of a homodimer is broken in heterodimeric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong>-center structures, such as those reported previously. The 2.2-angstrom resolution x-ray structure of the homodimeric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong> center–photosystem from the phototroph <i>Heliobacterium modesticaldum</i> exhibits perfect <i>C</i><sub>2</sub> symmetry. The core polypeptide dimer and two small subunits coordinate 54 bacteriochlorophylls and 2 carotenoids that capture and transfer energy to the electron transfer chain at the center, which performs charge separation and consists of 6 (bacterio)chlorophylls and an iron-sulfur cluster; unlike other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong> centers, it lacks a bound quinone. This structure preserves characteristics of the ancestral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong> center, providing insight into the evolution of photosynthesis.</p>

Vinculin forms a directionally asymmetric catch bond with F-actin
<p>Vinculin is an actin-binding protein thought to rein<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions. However, how mechanical load affects the vinculin–F-actin bond is unclear. Using a single-molecule optical trap assay, we found that vinculin forms a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e-dependent catch bond with F-actin through its tail domain, but with lifetimes that depend strongly on the direction of the applied <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e toward the pointed (–) end of the actin filament resulted in a bond that was maximally stable at 8 piconewtons, with a mean lifetime (12 seconds) 10 times as long as the mean lifetime when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e was applied toward the barbed (+) end. A computational model of lamellipodial actin dynamics suggests that the directionality of the vinculin–F-actin bond could establish long-range order in the actin cytoskeleton. The directional and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e-stabilized binding of vinculin to F-actin may be a mechanism by which adhesion complexes maintain front-rear asymmetry in migrating cells.</p>

Direct frequency comb measurement of OD + CO → DOCO kinetics
<p>The kinetics of the hydroxyl radical (OH) + carbon monoxide (CO) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong>, which is fundamental to both atmospheric and combustion chemistry, are complex because of the formation of the hydrocarboxyl radical (HOCO) intermediate. Despite extensive studies of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong>, HOCO has not been observed under thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong> conditions. Exploiting the sensitive, broadband, and high-resolution capabilities of time-resolved cavity-enhanced direct frequency comb spectroscopy, we observed deuteroxyl radical (OD) + CO <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong> kinetics and detected stabilized <i>trans</i>-DOCO, the deuterated analog of <i>trans</i>-HOCO.

The cost of muscle power production: muscle oxygen consumption per unit work increases at low temperatures in <i>Xenopus laevis</i>
<p>Metabolic energy (ATP) supply to muscle is essential to support activity and behaviour. It is expected, therefore, that there is strong selection to maximise muscle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">power</span></strong> output for a given rate of ATP use. However, the viscosity and stiffness of muscle increases with a decrease in temperature, which means that more ATP may be required to achieve a given work output. Here, we tested the hypothesis that ATP use increases at lower temperatures for a given <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">power</span></strong> output in <i>Xenopus laevis.</i> To account for temperature variation at different time scales, we considered the interaction between acclimation for 4 weeks (to 15 or 25°C) and acute exposure to these temperatures. Cold-acclimated frogs had greater sprint speed at 15°C than warm-acclimated animals. However, acclimation temperature did not affect isolated gastrocnemius muscle biomechanics. Isolated muscle produced greater tetanus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e, and faster isometric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e generation and relaxation, and generated more work loop <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">power</span></strong> at 25°C than at 15°C acute test temperature. Oxygen consumption of isolated muscle at rest did not change with test temperature, but oxygen consumption while muscle was performing work was significantly higher at 15°C than at 25°C, regardless of acclimation conditions. Muscle therefore consumed significantly more oxygen at 15°C for a given work output than at 25°C, and plastic responses did not modify this thermodynamic effect. The metabolic cost of muscle performance and activity therefore increased with a decrease in temperature. To maintain activity across a range of temperature, animals must increase ATP production or face an allocation trade-off at lower temperatures. Our data demonstrate the potential energetic benefits of warming up muscle before activity, which is seen in diverse groups of animals such as bees, which warm flight muscle before take-off, and humans performing warm ups before exercise.</p>

Harvesting electrical energy from carbon nanotube yarn twist

Snap deconvolution: An informatics approach to high-throughput discovery of catalytic reactions
<p>We present an approach to multidimensional high-throughput discovery of catalytic coupling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong>s that integrates molecular design with automated analysis and interpretation of mass spectral data. We simultaneously assessed the reactivity of three pools of compounds that shared the same functional groups (halides, boronic acids, alkenes, and alkynes, among other groups) but carried inactive substituents having specifically designed differences in masses. The substituents were chosen such that the products from any class of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong> in multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong> sets would have unique differences in masses, thus allowing simultaneous identification of the products of all transformations in a set of reactants. In this way, we easily distinguished the products of new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong>s from noise and known couplings. Using this method, we discovered an alkyne hydroallylation and a nickel-catalyzed variant of alkyne diarylation.</p>

Experimental measurement of binding energy, selectivity, and allostery using fluctuation theorems
<p>Thermodynamic bulk measurements of binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong>s rely on the validity of the law of mass action and the assumption of a dilute solution. Yet, important biological systems such as allosteric ligand-receptor binding, macromolecular crowding, or misfolded molecules may not follow these assumptions and may require a particular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong> model. Here we introduce a fluctuation theorem for ligand binding and an experimental approach using single-molecule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e spectroscopy to determine binding energies, selectivity, and allostery of nucleic acids and peptides in a model-independent fashion. A similar approach could be used for proteins. This work extends the use of fluctuation theorems beyond unimolecular folding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong>s, bridging the thermodynamics of small systems and the basic laws of chemical equilibrium.</p>

Genome-Scale Fluxome of <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973 Using Transient <sup>13</sup>C-Labeling Data
<p><i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973 (<i>Synechococcus</i> 2973) has the shortest reported doubling time (2.1 h) among cyanobacteria, making it a promising platform for the solar-based production of biochemicals. In this meta-analysis, its intracellular flux distribution was recomputed using genome-scale isotopic nonstationary <sup>13</sup>C-metabolic flux analysis given the labeling dynamics of 13 metabolites reported in an earlier study. To achieve this, a genome-scale mapping model, namely <i>i</i>mSyu593, was constructed using the <i>i</i>mSyn617 mapping model for <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 (<i>Synechocystis</i> 6803) as the starting point encompassing 593 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong>s. The flux elucidation revealed nearly complete conversion (greater than 96%) of the assimilated carbon into biomass in <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973. In contrast, <i>Synechocystis</i> 6803 achieves complete conversion of only 86% of the assimilated carbon. This high biomass yield was enabled by the reincorporation of the fixed carbons lost in anabolic and photorespiratory pathways in conjunction with flux rerouting through a nondecarboxylating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong> such as phosphoketolase. This reincorporation of lost CO<sub>2</sub> sustains a higher flux through the photorespiratory C2 cycle that fully meets the glycine and serine demands for growth. In accordance with the high carbon efficiency drive, acetyl-coenzyme A was entirely produced using the carbon-efficient phosphoketolase pathway. Comparison of the <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973 flux map with that of <i>Synechocystis</i> 6803 revealed differences in the use of Calvin cycle and photorespiratory pathway <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong>s. The two species used different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong>s for the synthesis of metabolites such as fructose-6-phosphate, glycine, sedoheptulose-7-phosphate, and Ser. These findings allude to a highly carbon-efficient metabolism alongside the fast carbon uptake rate in <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973, which explains its faster growth rate.</p>

In Silico Analysis of the Regulation of the Photosynthetic Electron Transport Chain in C3 Plants<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>We present a new simulation model of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong>s in the photosynthetic electron transport chain of C3 species. We show that including recent insights about the regulation of the thylakoid proton motive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e, ATP/NADPH balancing mechanisms (cyclic and noncyclic alternative electron transport), and regulation of Rubisco activity leads to emergent behaviors that may affect the operation and regulation of photosynthesis under different dynamic environmental conditions. The model was parameterized with experimental results in the literature, with a focus on Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). A dataset was constructed from multiple sources, including measurements of steady-state and dynamic gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, and absorbance spectroscopy under different light intensities and CO<sub>2</sub>, to test predictions of the model under different experimental conditions. Simulations suggested that there are strong interactions between cyclic and noncyclic alternative electron transport and that an excess capacity for alternative electron transport is required to ensure adequate redox state and lumen pH. Furthermore, the model predicted that, under specific conditions, reduction of ferredoxin by plastoquinol is possible after a rapid increase in light intensity. Further analysis also revealed that the relationship between ATP synthesis and proton motive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e was highly regulated by the concentrations of ATP, ADP, and inorganic phosphate, and this facilitated an increase in nonphotochemical quenching and proton motive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e under conditions where metabolism was limiting, such as low CO<sub>2</sub>, high light intensity, or combined high CO<sub>2</sub> and high light intensity. The model may be used as an in silico platform for future research on the regulation of photosynthetic electron transport.</p>

Dirigent Protein Mode of Action Revealed by the Crystal Structure of AtDIR6
<p>Dirigent proteins impart stereoselectivity to phenoxy radical coupling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong>s in plants and, thus, play an essential role in the biosynthesis of biologically active natural products. This includes the regioselective and enantioselective coupling and subsequent cyclization of two coniferyl alcohol radicals to pinoresinol as the committed step of lignan biosynthesis. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong> is controlled by dirigent proteins, which, depending on the species and protein, direct the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong> to either (+)- or (−)-pinoresinol. We present the crystal structure of the (−)-pinoresinol forming DIRIGENT PROTEIN6 (AtDIR6) from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) with data to 1.4 Å resolution. The structure shows AtDIR6 as an eight-stranded antiparallel β-barrel that forms a trimer with spatially well-separated cavities for substrate binding. The binding cavities are two lobed, exhibiting two opposing pockets, each lined with a set of hydrophilic and potentially catalytic residues, including essential aspartic acids. These residues are conserved between (+) and (−)-pinoresinol-forming DIRs and required for activity. The structure supports a model in which two substrate radicals bind to each of the DIR monomers. With the aromatic rings fixed in the two pockets, the propionyl side chains face each other for radical-radical coupling, and stereoselectivity is determined by the exact positioning of the side chains. Extensive mutational analysis supports a previously unrecognized function for DIRs in catalyzing the cyclization of the bis-quinone methide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong> intermediate to yield (+)- or (−)-pinoresinol.</p>

Scaling of the hydrostatic skeleton in the earthworm <i>Lumbricus terrestris</i>
<p>The structural and functional consequences of changes in size or scale have been well studied in animals with rigid skeletons, but relatively little is known about scale effects in animals with hydrostatic skeletons. We used glycol methacrylate histology and microscopy to examine the scaling of mechanically important morphological features of the earthworm <i>Lumbricus terrestris</i> over an ontogenetic size range from 0.03 to 12.89 g. We found that <i>L. terrestris</i> becomes disproportionately longer and thinner as it grows. This increase in the length to diameter ratio with size means that, when normalized for mass, adult worms gain ~117% mechanical advantage during radial expansion, compared with hatchling worms. We also found that the cross-sectional area of the longitudinal musculature scales as body mass to the ~0.6 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">power</span></strong> across segments, which is significantly lower than the 0.66 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">power</span></strong> predicted by isometry. The cross-sectional area of the circular musculature, however, scales as body mass to the ~0.8 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">power</span></strong> across segments, which is significantly higher than predicted by isometry. By modeling the interaction of muscle cross-sectional area and mechanical advantage, we calculate that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e output generated during both circular and longitudinal muscle contraction scales near isometry. We hypothesize that the allometric scaling of earthworms may reflect changes in soil properties and burrowing mechanics with size.</p>

Pharmacodynamic Effects of Switching From Ticagrelor to Clopidogrel in Patients With Coronary Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Switching between different classes of P2Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitors, including de-escalation from ticagrelor to clopidogrel, commonly occurs in clinical practice. However, the pharmacodynamic profiles of this strategy have been poorly explored.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This was a prospective, randomized, open-label study conducted in patients on maintenance dosing (MD) of aspirin (81 mg/d) and clopidogrel (75 mg/d). After a 7-day run-in with ticagrelor (180 mg loading dose [LD] followed by 90 mg twice daily MD), patients (n=80) were randomized into 1 of 4 groups: group A, clopidogrel 600 mg LD 24 hours after the last MD of ticagrelor (C-600 mg-24h); group B, clopidogrel 600 mg LD 12 hours after the last MD of ticagrelor (C-600 mg-12h); group C, clopidogrel 75 mg/d MD 24 hours after the last MD of ticagrelor (C-75 mg-24h); and group D, ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily MD (T-90 mg twice daily). MD of the randomized treatment was maintained for 10±3 days. Pharmacodynamic assessments were performed at baseline, after run-in, and at 2, 24, 48, and 72 hours and 10 days with P2Y<sub>12</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong> units by VerifyNow; platelet reactivity index was assessed by vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein; and maximal platelet aggregation was determined by light transmittance aggregometry.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>T-90 mg twice daily led to lower platelet reactivity than any clopidogrel regimen using all assays at all time points. P2Y<sub>12</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong> unit levels were similar between the C-600 mg-24h (group A) and the C-75 mg-24h (group C) (<i>P</i>=0.29), including at 48 hours (primary end point; least mean difference, −6.9; 95% confidence interval, −38.1 to 24.3; <i>P</i>=0.66). P2Y<sub>12</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong> unit levels were lower with C-600 mg-12h (group B) than with C-75 mg-24h (group C; <i>P</i>=0.024). Maximal platelet aggregation over time was lower with both C-600 mg-24h (group A; <i>P</i>=0.041) and C-600 mg-12h (group B; <i>P</i>=0.028) compared with C-75 mg-24h (group C). Platelet reactivity index profiles paralleled those observed with P2Y<sub>12</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong> units. There were no pharmacodynamic differences for all tests between C-600 mg-24h (group A) and C-600 mg-12h (group B). In group C (C-75 mg-24h), platelet reactivity increased compared with baseline as early as 24 hours, reaching statistical significance at 48 and 72 hours and up to 10 days. These pharmacodynamic findings were delayed and blunted in magnitude with the administration of an LD, regardless of the timing of administration.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>De-escalation from ticagrelor to clopidogrel therapy is associated with an increase in platelet reactivity. The use of an LD before the initiation of an MD regimen of clopidogrel mitigates these observations, although this is not affected by the timing of its administration after ticagrelor discontinuation.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes provide a cell source for cardiac tissue engineering; however, their immaturity limits their potential applications. Here we sought to study the effect of mechanical conditioning and electric pacing on the maturation of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac tissues.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Cardiomyocytes derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells were used to generate collagen-based bioengineered human cardiac tissue. Engineered tissue constructs were subjected to different mechanical stress and electric pacing conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The engineered human myocardium exhibits Frank-Starling–type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e-length relationships. After 2 weeks of static stress conditioning, the engineered myocardium demonstrated increases in contractility (0.63±0.10 mN/mm<sup>2</sup> vs 0.055±0.009 mN/mm<sup>2</sup> for no stress), tensile stiffness, construct alignment, and cell size. Stress conditioning also increased SERCA2 (Sarco/Endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium ATPase 2) expression, which correlated with a less negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e-frequency relationship. When electric pacing was combined with static stress conditioning, the tissues showed an additional increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e production (1.34±0.19 mN/mm<sup>2</sup>), with no change in construct alignment or cell size, suggesting maturation of excitation-contraction coupling.

A designed heme-[4Fe-4S] metalloenzyme catalyzes sulfite reduction like the native enzyme

By offering insight into the requirements for a demanding six-electron, seven-proton <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong> that has so far eluded synthetic catalysts, this study provides strategies for designing highly functional multicofactor artificial enzymes.</p>

Resonance-stabilized hydrocarbon-radical chain reactions may explain soot inception and growth
<p>Mystery surrounds the transition from gas-phase hydrocarbon precursors to terrestrial soot and interstellar dust, which are carbonaceous particles formed under similar conditions. Although polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are known precursors to high-temperature carbonaceous-particle formation, the molecular pathways that initiate particle formation are unknown. We present experimental and theoretical evidence for rapid molecular clustering–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong> pathways involving radicals with extended conjugation. These radicals react with other hydrocarbon species to form covalently bound complexes that promote further growth and clustering by regenerating resonance-stabilized radicals through low-barrier hydrogen-abstraction and hydrogen-ejection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong>s. Such radical–chain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong> pathways may lead to covalently bound clusters of PAHs and other hydrocarbons that would otherwise be too small to condense at high temperatures, thus providing the key mechanistic steps for rapid particle formation and surface growth by hydrocarbon chemisorption.</p>

Enhanced photovoltage for inverted planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells
<p>The highest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">power</span></strong> conversion efficiencies (PCEs) reported for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with inverted planar structures are still inferior to those of PSCs with regular structures, mainly because of lower open-circuit voltages (<i>V</i><sub>oc</sub>). Here we report a strategy to reduce nonradiative recombination for the inverted devices, based on a simple solution-processed secondary growth technique. This approach produces a wider bandgap top layer and a more n-type perovskite film, which mitigates nonradiative recombination, leading to an increase in <i>V</i><sub>oc</sub> by up to 100 millivolts. We achieved a high <i>V</i><sub>oc</sub> of 1.21 volts without sacrificing photocurrent, corresponding to a voltage deficit of 0.41 volts at a bandgap of 1.62 electron volts.

Direction-specific van der Waals attraction between rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> nanocrystals
<p>Mutual lattice orientations dictate the types and magnitudes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es between crystalline particles. When lattice polarizability is anisotropic, the van der Waals dispersion attraction can, in principle, contribute to this direction dependence. We report measurement of this attraction between rutile nanocrystals, as a function of their mutual orientation and surface hydration extent. At tens of nanometers of separation, the attraction is weak and shows no dependence on azimuthal alignment or surface hydration. At separations of approximately one hydration layer, the attraction is strongly dependent on azimuthal alignment and systematically decreases as intervening water density increases. Measured <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es closely agree with predictions from Lifshitz theory and show that dispersion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es can generate a torque between particles interacting in solution and between grains in materials.</p>

Femtosecond x-ray spectroscopy of an electrocyclic ring-opening reaction
<p>The ultrafast light-activated electrocyclic ring-opening <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong> of 1,3-cyclohexadiene is a fundamental prototype of photochemical pericyclic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong>s. Generally, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong>s are thought to proceed through an intermediate excited-state minimum (the so-called pericyclic minimum), which leads to isomerization via nonadiabatic relaxation to the ground state of the photoproduct. Here, we used femtosecond (fs) soft x-ray spectroscopy near the carbon K-edge (~284 electron volts) on a table-top apparatus to directly reveal the valence electronic structure of this transient intermediate state. The core-to-valence spectroscopic signature of the pericyclic minimum observed in the experiment was characterized, in combination with time-dependent density functional theory calculations, to reveal overlap and mixing of the frontier valence orbital energy levels. We show that this transient valence electronic structure arises within 60 ± 20 fs after ultraviolet photoexcitation and decays with a time constant of 110 ± 60 fs.</p>

Arylation of hydrocarbons enabled by organosilicon reagents and weakly coordinating anions
<p>Over the past 80 years, phenyl cation intermediates have been implicated in a variety of C–H arylation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong>s. Although these examples have inspired several theoretical and mechanistic studies, aryl cation equivalents have received limited attention in organic methodology. Their high-energy, promiscuous reactivity profiles have hampered applications in selective intermolecular processes. We report a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong> design that overcomes these challenges. Specifically, we found that β-silicon–stabilized aryl cation equivalents, generated via silylium-mediated fluoride activation, undergo insertion into sp<sup>3</sup> and sp<sup>2</sup> C–H bonds. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong> manifold provides a framework for the catalytic arylation of hydrocarbons, including simple alkanes such as methane. This process uses low loadings of Earth-abundant initiators (1 to 5 mole percent) and occurs under mild conditions (30° to 100°C).</p>

Notch-Jagged complex structure implicates a catch bond in tuning ligand sensitivity
<p>Notch receptor activation initiates cell fate decisions and is distinctive in its reliance on mechanical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e and protein glycosylation. The 2.5-angstrom-resolution crystal structure of the extracellular interacting region of Notch1 complexed with an engineered, high-affinity variant of Jagged1 (Jag1) reveals a binding interface that extends ~120 angstroms along five consecutive domains of each protein. <i>O</i>-Linked fucose modifications on Notch1 epidermal growth factor–like (EGF) domains 8 and 12 engage the EGF3 and C2 domains of Jag1, respectively, and different Notch1 domains are favored in binding to Jag1 than those that bind to the Delta-like 4 ligand. Jag1 undergoes conformational changes upon Notch binding, exhibiting catch bond behavior that prolongs interactions in the range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es required for Notch activation. This mechanism enables cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es to regulate binding, discriminate among Notch ligands, and potentiate Notch signaling.</p>

“Ab initio” synthesis of zeolites for preestablished catalytic reactions
<p>Unlike homogeneous catalysts that are often designed for particular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong>s, zeolites are heterogeneous catalysts that are explored and optimized in a heuristic fashion. We present a methodology for synthesizing active and selective zeolites by using organic structure-directing agents that mimic the transition state (TS) of preestablished <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong>s to be catalyzed. In these zeolites, the pores and cavities could be generated approaching a molecular-recognition pattern. For disproportionation of toluene and isomerization of ethylbenzene into xylenes, the TSs are larger than the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong> products. Zeolite ITQ-27 showed high disproportionation activity, and ITQ-64 showed high selectivity for the desired para and ortho isomers. For the case of a product and TS of similar size, we synthesized a catalyst, MIT-1, for the isomerization of <i>endo</i>-dicyclopentane into adamantane.</p>

Super-dry reforming of methane intensifies CO<sub>2</sub> utilization via Le Chatelier’s principle
<p>Efficient CO<sub>2</sub> transformation from a waste product to a carbon source for chemicals and fuels will require <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong> conditions that effect its reduction. We developed a “super-dry” CH<sub>4</sub> reforming <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong> for enhanced CO production from CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>. We used Ni/MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> as a CH<sub>4</sub>-reforming catalyst, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> as a solid oxygen carrier, and CaO/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> as a CO<sub>2</sub> sorbent. The isothermal coupling of these three different processes resulted in higher CO production as compared with that of conventional dry reforming, by avoiding back <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong>s with water. The reduction of iron oxide was intensified through CH<sub>4</sub> conversion to syngas over Ni and CO<sub>2</sub> extraction and storage as CaCO<sub>3</sub>. CO<sub>2</sub> is then used for iron reoxidation and CO production, exploiting equilibrium shifts effected with inert gas sweeping (Le Chatelier’s principle). Super-dry reforming uses up to three CO<sub>2</sub> molecules per CH<sub>4</sub> and offers a high CO space-time yield of 7.5 millimole CO per second per kilogram of iron at 1023 kelvin.</p>

Molecular force spectroscopy with a DNA origami–based nanoscopic force clamp
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es in biological systems are typically investigated at the single-molecule level with atomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e microscopy or optical and magnetic tweezers, but these techniques suffer from limited data throughput and their requirement for a physical connection to the macroscopic world. We introduce a self-assembled nanoscopic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e clamp built from DNA that operates autonomously and allows massive parallelization. Single-stranded DNA sections of an origami structure acted as entropic springs and exerted controlled tension in the low piconewton range on a molecular system, whose conformational transitions were monitored by single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer. We used the conformer switching of a Holliday junction as a benchmark and studied the TATA-binding protein–induced bending of a DNA duplex under tension. The observed suppression of bending above 10 piconewtons provides further evidence of mechanosensitivity in gene regulation.</p>

Vibrationally Promoted Dissociation of Water on Ni(111)
<sec><title>Vibrating Water Apart</title><p>The main route for producing hydrogen for industrial chemical synthesis is steam reforming, in which water and methane react at high temperatures on nickel catalysts to produce hydrogen and carbon dioxide. For both water and methane, the initial dissociation step can be promoted by the translational energy of a molecule as well as its internal vibrational energy, and fundamental studies of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong>s try to determine the relative contributions of these pathways. Although the methane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong> has been well studied, only recently have lasers been available to excite the higher stretching vibrations of water. <bold>Hundt <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 504) now report a joint experimental and theoretical study of D<sub>2</sub>O dissociation on the Ni(111) surface. For a given input of energy, vibrational energy was more effective for surmounting the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong> barrier than translational energy.</p></sec>

Mitochondria Affect Photosynthetic Electron Transport and Photosensitivity in a Green Alga
<p>Photosynthetic organisms use sunlight as the primary source of energy to support their metabolism. In eukaryotes, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong>s responsible of the conversion of light into chemical energy occur in specific organelles, the chloroplasts. In this study, we showed that mitochondria also have a seminal influence on cells’ energy metabolism and on photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong>s. This is illustrated by the observation that the strong photosensitivity of <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> cells depleted of the chloroplast protein PGRL1 was rescued by the introduction of a mitochondrial mutation affecting respiratory complex I. Functional analysis showed that such a reduced respiratory activity influenced chloroplast electron transport with consequent overreduction of plastoquinone and donor-side limitation of photosystem I (PSI). As a consequence, damage due to excess light affected more photosystem II (PSII) rather than PSI. Double mutant cells are able to grow under excess illumination, while single <i>pgrl1</i> are not, thanks to the presence of an efficient repair mechanism of PSII. These results also underline the seminal biological relevance of the regulation of electron transport <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong>s within the photosynthetic complexes. Photosynthetic organisms evolved a strategy to respond to excess light where damage is targeting preferentially to a specific complex, PSII. Cells are able to endure extensive damage targeting this complex thanks to an efficient repair mechanisms, while if PSI is affected, there are drastic consequences on growth.</p>

Predicting Dynamic Metabolic Demands in the Photosynthetic Eukaryote <i>Chlorella vulgaris</i>
<p>Phototrophic organisms exhibit a highly dynamic proteome, adapting their biomass composition in response to diurnal light/dark cycles and nutrient availability. Here, we used experimentally determined biomass compositions over the course of growth to determine and constrain the biomass objective function (BOF) in a genome-scale metabolic model of <i>Chlorella vulgaris</i> UTEX 395 over time. Changes in the BOF, which encompasses all metabolites necessary to produce biomass, influence the state of the metabolic network thus directly affecting predictions. Simulations using dynamic BOFs predicted distinct proteome demands during heterotrophic or photoautotrophic growth. Model-driven analysis of extracellular nitrogen concentrations and predicted nitrogen uptake rates revealed an intracellular nitrogen pool, which contains 38% of the total nitrogen provided in the medium for photoautotrophic and 13% for heterotrophic growth. Agreement between flux and gene expression trends was determined by statistical comparison. Accordance between predicted flux trends and gene expression trends was found for 65% of multisubunit enzymes and 75% of allosteric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong>s. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong>s with the highest agreement between simulations and experimental data were associated with energy metabolism, terpenoid biosynthesis, fatty acids, nucleotides, and amino acid metabolism. Furthermore, predicted flux distributions at each time point were compared with gene expression data to gain new insights into intracellular compartmentalization, specifically for transporters. A total of 103 genes related to internal transport <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reaction</span></strong>s were identified and added to the updated model of <i>C. vulgaris</i>, <i>i</i>CZ946, thus increasing our knowledgebase by 10% for this model green alga.</p>

Partitioning of vessel resistivity in three liana species
<p>Vessels with simple perforation plates, found in the majority of angiosperms, are considered the evolutionarily most advanced conduits, least impeding the xylem sap flow. Nevertheless, when measured, their hydraulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ivity (<i>R</i>, i.e., inverse value of hydraulic conductivity) is significantly higher than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ivity predicted using Hagen–Poiseuille equation (<i>R</i><sub>HP</sub>). In our study we aimed (i) to quantify two basic components of the total vessel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ivity – vessel lumen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ivity and end wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ivity, and (ii) to analyze how the variable inner diameter of the vessel along its longitudinal axis affects <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ivity. We measured flow rates through progressively shortened stems of hop (<i>Humulus lupulus</i> L.), grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i> L.), and clematis (<i>Clematis vitalba</i> L.) and used elastomer injection for identification of open vessels and for measurement of changing vessel inner diameters along its axis. The relative contribution of end wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ivity to total vessel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ivity was 0.46 for hop, 0.55 for grapevine, and 0.30 for clematis. Vessel lumen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ivity calculated from our measurements was substantially higher than theoretical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ivity – about 43% for hop, 58% for grapevine, and 52% for clematis. We identified variation in the vessel inner diameter as an important source of vessel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ivity. The coefficient of variation of vessel inner diameter was a good predictor for the increase of the ratio of integral <i>R</i><sub>HP</sub> to <i>R</i><sub>HP</sub> calculated from the mean value of inner vessel diameter. We discuss the fact that we dealt with the longest vessels in a given stem sample, which may lead to the overestimation of vessel lumen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ivity, which consequently precludes decision whether the variable vessel inner diameter explains fully the difference between vessel lumen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ivity and <i>R</i><sub>HP</sub> we observed.</p>

Systematic Mutagenesis of Serine Hydroxymethyltransferase Reveals an Essential Role in Nematode Resistance
<p><i>Rhg4</i> is a major genetic locus that contributes to soybean cyst nematode (SCN) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in the Peking-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance of soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>), which also requires the <i>rhg1</i> gene. By map-based cloning and functional genomic approaches, we previously showed that the <i>Rhg4</i> gene encodes a predicted cytosolic serine hydroxymethyltransferase (GmSHMT08); however, the novel gain of function of <i>GmSHMT08</i> in SCN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance remains to be characterized. Using a forward genetic screen, we identified an allelic series of <i>GmSHMT08</i> mutants that shed new light on the mechanistic aspects of <i>GmSHMT08</i>-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. The new mutants provide compelling genetic evidence that Peking-type <i>rhg1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in cv Forrest is fully dependent on the <i>GmSHMT08</i> gene and demonstrates that this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance is mechanistically different from the PI 88788-type of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance that only requires <i>rhg1</i>. We also demonstrated that <i>rhg1-a</i> from cv Forrest, although required, does not exert selection pressure on the nematode to shift from HG type 7, which further validates the bigenic nature of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. Mapping of the identified mutations onto the SHMT structural model uncovered key residues for structural stability, ligand binding, enzyme activity, and protein interactions, suggesting that GmSHMT08 has additional functions aside from its main enzymatic role in SCN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. Lastly, we demonstrate the functionality of the <i>GmSHMT08</i> SCN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance gene in a transgenic soybean plant.</p>

OsSYP121 Accumulates at Fungal Penetration Sites and Mediates Host Resistance to Rice Blast
<p><i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> is a fungal pathogen that causes rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) blast. SNAREs (soluble <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) are key components in vesicle trafficking in eukaryotic cells and are known to contribute to fungal pathogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. Syntaxin of Plants121 (SYP121), a Qa-SNARE, has been reported to function in nonhost <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). However, the functions of SYP121 in host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to rice blast are largely unknown. Here, we report that the rice SYP121 protein, OsSYP121, accumulates at fungal penetration sites and mediates host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to rice blast. OsSYP121 is plasma membrane localized and its expression was obviously induced by the rice blast in both the blast-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant rice landrace Heikezijing and the blast-susceptible landrace Suyunuo (Su). Overexpression of <i>OsSYP121</i> in Su resulted in enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to blast. Knockdown of <i>OsSYP121</i> expression in Su resulted in a more susceptible phenotype. However, knockdown of <i>OsSYP121</i> expression in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant landrace Heikezijing resulted in susceptibility to the blast fungus. The <i>P<sub>OsSYP121</sub></i>::GFP-OsSYP121 accumulated at rice blast penetration sites in transgenic rice, as observed by confocal microscopy. Yeast two-hybrid results showed that OsSYP121 can interact with OsSNAP32 (Synaptosome-associated protein of 32 kD) and Vesicle-associated membrane protein714/724. The interaction between OsSYP121 and OsSNAP32 may contribute to host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to rice blast. Our study reveals that OsSYP121 plays an important role in rice blast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance as it is a key component in vesicle trafficking.</p>

The Wheat <i>Lr67</i> Gene from the Sugar Transport Protein 13 Family Confers Multipathogen Resistance in Barley
<p>Fungal pathogens are a major constraint to global crop production; hence, plant genes encoding pathogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance are important tools for combating disease. A few <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance genes identified to date provide partial, durable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to multiple pathogens and the wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) Lr67 hexose transporter variant (Lr67res) fits into this category. Two amino acids differ between the wild-type and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant alleles – G144R and V387L. Exome sequence data from 267 barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) landraces and wild accessions was screened and neither of the Lr67res mutations was detected. The barley ortholog of Lr67, HvSTP13, was functionally characterized in yeast as a high affinity hexose transporter. The G144R mutation was introduced into HvSTP13 and abolished Glc uptake, whereas the V387L mutation reduced Glc uptake by ∼ 50%. Glc transport by HvSTP13 heterologously expressed in yeast was reduced when coexpressed with <i>Lr67res</i>. Stable transgenic <i>Lr67res</i> barley lines exhibited seedling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to the barley-specific pathogens <i>Puccinia hordei</i> and <i>Blumeria graminis</i> f. sp. <i>hordei</i>, which cause leaf rust and powdery mildew, respectively. Barley plants expressing <i>Lr67res</i> exhibited early senescence and higher pathogenesis-related (<i>PR</i>) gene expression. Unlike previous observations implicating flavonoids in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance of transgenic sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>) expressing <i>Lr34res</i>, another wheat multipathogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance gene, barley flavonoids are unlikely to have a role in Lr67res-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. Similar to observations made in yeast, Lr67res reduced Glc uptake <i>in planta</i>. These results confirm that the pathway by which <i>Lr67res</i> confers <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to fungal pathogens is conserved between wheat and barley.</p>

Sequence Exchange between Homologous NB-LRR Genes Converts Virus Resistance into Nematode Resistance, and Vice Versa
<p>Plants have evolved a limited repertoire of NB-LRR disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance (<i>R</i>) genes to protect themselves against myriad pathogens. This limitation is thought to be counterbalanced by the rapid evolution of NB-LRR proteins, as only a few sequence changes have been shown to be sufficient to alter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance specificities toward novel strains of a pathogen. However, little is known about the flexibility of NB-LRR <i>R</i> genes to switch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance specificities between phylogenetically unrelated pathogens. To investigate this, we created domain swaps between the close homologs <i>Gpa2</i> and <i>Rx1</i>, which confer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>) to the cyst nematode <i>Globodera pallida</i> and <i>Potato virus X</i>, respectively. The genetic fusion of the CC-NB-ARC of Gpa2 with the LRR of Rx1 (Gpa2<sub>CN</sub>/Rx1<sub>L</sub>) results in autoactivity, but lowering the protein levels restored its specific activation response, including extreme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to <i>Potato virus X</i> in potato shoots. The reciprocal chimera (Rx1<sub>CN</sub>/Gpa2<sub>L</sub>) shows a loss-of-function phenotype, but exchange of the first three LRRs of Gpa2 by the corresponding region of Rx1 was sufficient to regain a wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance response to <i>G. pallida</i> in the roots. These data demonstrate that exchanging the recognition moiety in the LRR is sufficient to convert extreme virus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in the leaves into mild nematode <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in the roots, and vice versa. In addition, we show that the CC-NB-ARC can operate independently of the recognition specificities defined by the LRR domain, either aboveground or belowground. These data show the versatility of NB-LRR genes to generate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to unrelated pathogens with completely different lifestyles and routes of invasion.</p>

Reversion of antibiotic resistance in <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> by spiroisoxazoline SMARt-420
<p>Antibiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance is one of the biggest threats to human health globally. Alarmingly, multidrug-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant and extensively drug-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> have now spread worldwide. Some key antituberculosis antibiotics are prodrugs, for which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance mechanisms are mainly driven by mutations in the bacterial enzymatic pathway required for their bioactivation. We have developed drug-like molecules that activate a cryptic alternative bioactivation pathway of ethionamide in <i>M. tuberculosis</i>, circumventing the classic activation pathway in which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance mutations have now been observed. The first-of-its-kind molecule, named SMARt-420 (Small Molecule Aborting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance), not only fully reverses ethionamide-acquired <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance and clears ethionamide-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant infection in mice, it also increases the basal sensitivity of bacteria to ethionamide.</p>

Epigenetic regulation of antagonistic receptors confers rice blast resistance with yield balance
<p>Crop breeding aims to balance disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance with yield; however, single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance (R) genes can lead to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance breakdown, and R gene pyramiding may affect growth fitness. Here we report that the rice <i>Pigm</i> locus contains a cluster of genes encoding nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptors that confer durable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to the fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> without yield penalty. Among these NLR receptors, PigmR confers broad-spectrum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance, whereas PigmS competitively attenuates PigmR homodimerization to suppress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. <i>PigmS</i> expression, and thus <i>PigmR</i>-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance, are subjected to tight epigenetic regulation. <i>PigmS</i> increases seed production to counteract the yield cost induced by <i>PigmR</i>. Therefore, our study reveals a mechanism balancing high disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance and yield through epigenetic regulation of paired antagonistic NLR receptors, providing a tool to develop elite crop varieties.</p>

A Cytosolic Triosephosphate Isomerase Is a Key Component in XA3/XA26-Mediated Resistance
<p>Bacterial blight caused by <i>Xanthomonas oryzae</i> pv <i>oryzae</i> (<i>Xoo</i>) causes severe damage to rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) production worldwide. The major disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance gene, <i>Xa3/Xa26</i>, confers broad-spectrum and durable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to <i>Xoo</i> at both seedling and adult stages. However, the molecular mechanism of the <i>Xa3/Xa26</i>-initiated defense pathway against <i>Xoo</i> is still largely unknown. Here, we show that a triosephosphate isomerase (TPI), OsTPI1.1, is a key component in XA3/XA26-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to <i>Xoo</i>. OsTPI1.1 is a glycolytic enzyme that catalyzes the reversible interconversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. Transcriptional suppression of <i>OsTPI1.1</i> in plants harboring <i>Xa3/Xa26</i> largely impaired the XA3/XA26-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to <i>Xoo</i>, and constitutive overexpression of <i>OsTPI1.1</i> in susceptible rice plants without <i>Xa3/Xa26</i> only slightly decreased the susceptibility to <i>Xoo</i>. Therefore, both XA3/XA26 and OsTPI1.1 are required in XA3/XA26-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. We show that OsTPI1.1 participates in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance through its enzymatic activity, which was enhanced significantly by its binding with XA3/XA26. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), especially hydrogen peroxide, accumulated in the OsTPI1.1-overexpressing plants, and suppression of <i>OsTPI1.1</i> decreased ROS accumulation. The changes in ROS are associated with the reduction of NADP<sup>+</sup> to NADPH, which may act as a redox cofactor to scavenge ROS, leading to reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to <i>Xoo</i>. These results suggest that OsTPI1.1 modulates ROS production as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance mechanism against <i>Xoo</i>.</p>

Abscisic Acid Induces Resistance against <i>Bamboo Mosaic Virus</i> through <i>Argonaute</i> <i>2</i> and <i>3</i>
<p>Plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to pathogens is tuned by defense-related hormones. Of these, abscisic acid (ABA) is well documented to moderate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance against fungi and bacteria. However, ABA’s contribution to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance against viruses is pleiotropic. ABA affects callose deposition at plasmodesmata (therefore hindering the viral cell-to-cell movement), but here, we show that when callose synthase is down-regulated, ABA still induces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance against infection with <i>Bamboo mosaic virus</i> (BaMV). By examining the potential connections between the ABA and RNA-silencing pathways in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), we showed that ABA regulates the expression of almost the whole ARGONAUTE (AGO) gene family, of which some are required for plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance against BaMV. Our data show that BaMV infection and ABA treatment regulate the same set of AGOs, with positive effects on <i>AGO1</i>, <i>AGO2</i>, and <i>AGO3</i>, no effect on <i>AGO7</i>, and negative effects on <i>AGO4</i> and <i>AGO10</i>. The BaMV-mediated regulation of <i>AGO1</i>, <i>AGO2</i>, and <i>AGO3</i> is ABA dependent, because the accumulation of these <i>AGOs</i> in BaMV-infected ABA mutants did not reach the levels observed in infected wild-type plants. In addition, the <i>AGO1</i>-<i>miR168a</i> complex is dispensable for BaMV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance, while <i>AGO2</i> and <i>AGO3</i> were important for ABA-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. While most <i>ago</i> mutants showed increased susceptibility to BaMV infection (except <i>ago10</i>), <i>ago1-27</i> showed reduced BaMV titers, which was attributed to the up-regulated levels of <i>AGO2</i>, <i>AGO3</i>, and <i>AGO4</i>. We have established that ABA regulates the expression of several members of the AGO family, and this regulation partially contributes to ABA-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance against BaMV. These findings reveal another role for ABA in plants.</p>

Antibiotic tolerance facilitates the evolution of resistance
<p>Controlled experimental evolution during antibiotic treatment can help to explain the processes leading to antibiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in bacteria. Recently, intermittent antibiotic exposures have been shown to lead rapidly to the evolution of tolerance—that is, the ability to survive under treatment without developing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. However, whether tolerance delays or promotes the eventual emergence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance is unclear. Here we used in vitro evolution experiments to explore this question. We found that in all cases, tolerance preceded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. A mathematical population-genetics model showed how tolerance boosts the chances for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance mutations to spread in the population. Thus, tolerance mutations pave the way for the rapid subsequent evolution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. Preventing the evolution of tolerance may offer a new strategy for delaying the emergence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance.</p>

12-Oxo-Phytodienoic Acid Acts as a Regulator of Maize Defense against Corn Leaf Aphid
<p>The corn leaf aphid (CLA; <i>Rhopalosiphum maidis</i>) is a phloem sap-sucking insect that attacks many cereal crops, including maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). We previously showed that the maize inbred line Mp708, which was developed by classical plant breeding, provides enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to CLA. Here, using electrophysiological monitoring of aphid feeding behavior, we demonstrate that Mp708 provides phloem-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to CLA. Furthermore, feeding by CLA on Mp708 plants enhanced callose deposition, a potential defense mechanism utilized by plants to limit aphid feeding and subsequent colonization. In maize, benzoxazinoids (BX) or BX-derived metabolites contribute to enhanced callose deposition by providing heightened <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to CLA. However, BX and BX-derived metabolites were not significantly altered in CLA-infested Mp708 plants, indicating BX-independent defense against CLA. Evidence presented here suggests that the constitutively higher levels of 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA) in Mp708 plants contributed to enhanced callose accumulation and heightened CLA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. OPDA enhanced the expression of ethylene biosynthesis and receptor genes, and the synergistic interactions of OPDA and CLA feeding significantly induced the expression of the transcripts encoding Maize insect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance1-Cysteine Protease, a key defensive protein against insect pests, in Mp708 plants. Furthermore, exogenous application of OPDA on maize jasmonic acid-deficient plants caused enhanced callose accumulation and heightened <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to CLA, suggesting that the OPDA-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to CLA is independent of the jasmonic acid pathway. We further demonstrate that the signaling function of OPDA, rather than a direct toxic effect, contributes to enhanced CLA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in Mp708.</p>

Comparison of Micropore Distribution in Cell Walls of Softwood and Hardwood Xylem
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">poros</span></strong>ity of wood cell walls is of interest for both understanding xylem functionality and from a wood materials perspective. The movement of water in xylem generally occurs through the macroporous networks formed in softwood by bordered pits and in hardwood by the intervessel pits and open conduits created by vessels and perforation plates. In some situations, such as cavitated xylem, water can only move through the micropores that occur in lignified tracheid and fiber cell walls; however, these micropore networks are poorly understood. Here, we used molecular microscopy analysis of radiata pine (<i>Pinus radiata</i>) and red beech (<i>Nothofagus fusca</i>) to determine the distribution of micropores in the secondary walls and middle lamellae of tracheids and fibers in relation to cell wall composition. Using two different types of probe, we identified a greater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">poros</span></strong>ity of secondary cell walls and a reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">poros</span></strong>ity of the middle lamella. Areas of reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">poros</span></strong>ity were observed in the outer regions of the secondary cell wall of both tracheids and fibers that appear unrelated to lignification or the distribution of cellulose, mannan, and xylan. Hardwood fiber cell walls were less lignified than those of softwood tracheids and showed greater accessibility to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">poros</span></strong>ity probes. Vessel cell walls were comparable to those of fibers in terms of both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">poros</span></strong>ity and lignification. Lignification is probably the primary determinant of cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">poros</span></strong>ity in xylem. The highly lignified middle lamella, and lumen surface, act as a barrier to probe movement and, therefore, water movement in both softwood and hardwood.</p>

<p>A major limitation of targeted cancer therapy is the rapid emergence of drug <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance, which often arises through mutations at or downstream of the drug target or through intrinsic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance of subpopulations of tumor cells. Medulloblastoma (MB), the most common pediatric brain tumor, is no exception, and MBs that are driven by sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling are particularly aggressive and drug-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant. To find new drug targets and therapeutics for MB that may be less susceptible to common <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance mechanisms, we used a developmental phosphoproteomics approach in murine granule neuron precursors (GNPs), the developmental cell of origin of MB. The protein kinase CK2 emerged as a driver of hundreds of phosphorylation events during the proliferative, MB-like stage of GNP growth, including the phosphorylation of three of the eight proteins commonly amplified in MB. CK2 was critical to the stabilization and activity of the transcription factor GLI2, a late downstream effector in SHH signaling. CK2 inhibitors decreased the viability of primary SHH-type MB patient cells in culture and blocked the growth of murine MB tumors that were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant to currently available Hh inhibitors, thereby extending the survival of tumor-bearing mice. Because of structural interactions, one CK2 inhibitor (CX-4945) inhibited both wild-type and mutant CK2, indicating that this drug may avoid at least one common mode of acquired <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. These findings suggest that CK2 inhibitors may be effective for treating patients with MB and show how phosphoproteomics may be used to gain insight into developmental biology and pathology.</p>

Mapping the malaria parasite druggable genome by using in vitro evolution and chemogenomics
<p>Chemogenetic characterization through in vitro evolution combined with whole-genome analysis can identify antimalarial drug targets and drug-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance genes. We performed a genome analysis of 262 <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> parasites <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant to 37 diverse compounds. We found 159 gene amplifications and 148 nonsynonymous changes in 83 genes associated with drug-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance acquisition, where gene amplifications contributed to one-third of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance acquisition events. Beyond confirming previously identified multidrug-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance mechanisms, we discovered hitherto unrecognized drug target–inhibitor pairs, including thymidylate synthase and a benzoquinazolinone, farnesyltransferase and a pyrimidinedione, and a dipeptidylpeptidase and an arylurea. This exploration of the <i>P. falciparum</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ome and druggable genome will likely guide drug discovery and structural biology efforts, while also advancing our understanding of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance mechanisms available to the malaria parasite.</p>

<i>MYB52</i> Negatively Regulates Pectin Demethylesterification in Seed Coat Mucilage
<p>Pectin, which is a major component of the plant primary cell walls, is synthesized and methyl-esterified in the Golgi apparatus and then demethylesterified by pectin methylesterases (PMEs) located in the cell wall. The degree of methylesterification affects the functional properties of pectin, and thereby influences plant growth, development and defense. However, little is known about the mechanisms that regulate pectin demethylesterification. Here, we show that in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> mucilage, the absence of the <i>MYB52</i> transcription factor is correlated with an increase in PME activity and a decrease in the degree of pectin methylesterification. Decreased methylesterification in the <i>myb52</i> mutant is also correlated with an increase in the calcium content of the seed mucilage. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis and molecular genetic studies suggest that <i>MYB52</i> transcriptionally activates <i>PECTIN METHYLESTERASE INHIBITOR6</i> (<i>PMEI6</i>), <i>PMEI14</i>, and <i>SUBTILISIN-LIKE SER PROTEASE1.7</i> (<i>SBT1.7</i>) by binding to their promoters. <i>PMEI6</i> and <i>SBT1.7</i> have previously been shown to be involved in seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> mucilage demethylesterification. Our characterization of two <i>PMEI14</i> mutants suggests that PMEI14 has a role in seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> mucilage demethylesterification, although its activity may be confined to the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> in contrast to PMEI6, which functions in the whole seed. Our demonstration that <i>MYB52</i> negatively regulates pectin demethylesterification in seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> mucilage, and the identification of components of the molecular network involved, provides new insight into the regulatory mechanism controlling pectin demethylesterification and increases our understanding of the transcriptional regulation network involved in seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> mucilage formation.</p>

The MYB107 Transcription Factor Positively Regulates Suberin Biosynthesis
<p>Suberin, a lipophilic polymer deposited in the outer integument of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>, represents an essential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seal</span></strong>ing component controlling water and solute movement and protecting seed from pathogenic infection. Although many genes responsible for suberin synthesis are identified, the regulatory components controlling its biosynthesis have not been definitively determined. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis MYB107 transcription factor acts as a positive regulator controlling suberin biosynthetic gene expression in the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>. <i>MYB107</i> coexpresses with suberin biosynthetic genes in a temporal manner during seed development. Disrupting <i>MYB107</i> particularly suppresses the expression of genes involved in suberin but not cutin biosynthesis, lowers seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> suberin accumulation, alters suberin lamellar structure, and consequently renders higher seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> permeability and susceptibility to abiotic stresses. Furthermore, MYB107 directly binds to the promoters of suberin biosynthetic genes, verifying its primary role in regulating their expression. Identifying MYB107 as a positive regulator for seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> suberin synthesis offers a basis for discovering the potential transcriptional network behind one of the most abundant lipid-based polymers in nature.</p>

Xylem Surfactants Introduce a New Element to the Cohesion-Tension Theory
<p>Vascular plants transport water under negative pressure without constantly creating gas bubbles that would disable their hydraulic systems. Attempts to replicate this feat in artificial systems almost invariably result in bubble formation, except under highly controlled conditions with pure water and only hydrophilic surfaces present. In theory, conditions in the xylem should favor bubble nucleation even more: there are millions of conduits with at least some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrophob</span></strong>ic surfaces, and xylem sap is saturated or sometimes supersaturated with atmospheric gas and may contain surface-active molecules that can lower surface tension. So how do plants transport water under negative pressure? Here, we show that angiosperm xylem contains abundant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrophob</span></strong>ic surfaces as well as insoluble lipid surfactants, including phospholipids, and proteins, a composition similar to pulmonary surfactants. Lipid surfactants were found in xylem sap and as nanoparticles under transmission electron microscopy in pores of intervessel pit membranes and deposited on vessel wall surfaces. Nanoparticles observed in xylem sap via nanoparticle-tracking analysis included surfactant-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed nanobubbles when examined by freeze-fracture electron microscopy. Based on their fracture behavior, this technique is able to distinguish between dense-core particles, liquid-filled, bilayer-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed vesicles/liposomes, and gas-filled bubbles. Xylem surfactants showed strong surface activity that reduces surface tension to low values when concentrated as they are in pit membrane pores. We hypothesize that xylem surfactants support water transport under negative pressure as explained by the cohesion-tension theory by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrophob</span></strong>ic surfaces and nanobubbles, thereby keeping the latter below the critical size at which bubbles would expand to form embolisms.</p>

Recovery performance in xylem hydraulic conductivity is correlated with cavitation resistance for temperate deciduous tree species
<p>Woody species hydraulically vulnerable to xylem cavitation may experience daily xylem embolism. How such species cope with the possibility of accumulated embolism is unclear. In this study, we examined seven temperate woody species to assess the hypothesis that low cavitation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance (high vulnerability to cavitation) is compensated by high recovery performance via vessel refilling. We also evaluated leaf functional and xylem structural traits. The xylem recovery index (XRI), defined as the ratio of xylem hydraulic conductivity in plants rewatered after soil drought to that in plants under moist conditions, varied among species. The xylem water potential causing 50% loss of hydraulic conductivity (Ψ<sub>50</sub>) varied among the species studied, whereas only a slight difference was detected with respect to midday xylem water potential (Ψ<sub>min</sub>), indicating smaller hydraulic safety margins (Ψ<sub>min</sub> − Ψ<sub>50</sub>) for species more vulnerable to cavitation. Cavitation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance (|Ψ<sub>50</sub>|) was negatively correlated with XRI across species, with cavitation-vulnerable species showing a higher performance in xylem recovery. Wood density was positively correlated with cavitation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance and was negatively correlated with XRI. These novel results reveal that coordination exists between cavitation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance and xylem recovery performance, in association with wood functional traits such as denser wood for cavitation-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant xylem and less-dense but water-storable wood for refillable xylem. These findings provide insights into long-term maintenance of water transport in tree species growing under variable environmental conditions.</p>

Skp2-dependent reactivation of AKT drives resistance to PI3K inhibitors
<p>The PI3K-AKT kinase signaling pathway is frequently deregulated in human cancers, particularly breast cancer, where amplification and somatic mutations of <i>PIK3CA</i> occur with high frequency in patients. Numerous small-molecule inhibitors targeting both PI3K and AKT are under clinical evaluation, but dose-limiting toxicities and the emergence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance limit therapeutic efficacy. Various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance mechanisms to PI3K inhibitors have been identified, including de novo mutations, feedback activation of AKT, or cross-talk pathways. We found a previously unknown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance mechanism to PI3K pathway inhibition that results in AKT rebound activation. In a subset of triple-negative breast cancer cell lines, treatment with a PI3K inhibitor or depletion of <i>PIK3CA</i> expression ultimately promoted AKT reactivation in a manner dependent on the E3 ubiquitin ligase Skp2, the kinases IGF-1R (insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor) and PDK-1 (phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1), and the cell growth and metabolism-regulating complex mTORC2 (mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2), but was independent of PI3K activity or PIP<sub>3</sub> production. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to PI3K inhibitors correlated with the increased abundance of Skp2, ubiquitylation of AKT, cell proliferation in culture, and xenograft tumor growth in mice. These findings reveal a ubiquitin signaling feedback mechanism by which PI3K inhibitor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance may emerge in aggressive breast cancer cells.</p>

The receptor tyrosine kinase AXL mediates nuclear translocation of the epidermal growth factor receptor
<p>The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a therapeutic target in patients with various cancers. Unfortunately, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to EGFR-targeted therapeutics is common. Previous studies identified two mechanisms of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to the EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab. Nuclear translocation of EGFR bypasses the inhibitory effects of cetuximab, and the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL mediates cetuximab <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance by maintaining EGFR activation and downstream signaling. Thus, we hypothesized that AXL mediated the nuclear translocation of EGFR in the setting of cetuximab <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. Cetuximab-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant clones of non–small cell lung cancer in culture and patient-derived xenografts in mice had increased abundance of AXL and nuclear EGFR (nEGFR). Cellular fractionation analysis, super-resolution microscopy, and electron microscopy revealed that genetic loss of AXL reduced the accumulation of nEGFR. SRC family kinases (SFKs) and HER family ligands promote the nuclear translocation of EGFR. We found that AXL knockdown reduced the expression of the genes encoding the SFK family members YES and LYN and the ligand neuregulin-1 (NRG1). AXL knockdown also decreased the interaction between EGFR and the related receptor HER3 and accumulation of HER3 in the nucleus. Overexpression of LYN and NRG1 in cells depleted of AXL resulted in accumulation of nEGFR, rescuing the deficit induced by lack of AXL. Collectively, these data uncover a previously unrecognized role for AXL in regulating the nuclear translocation of EGFR and suggest that AXL-mediated SFK and <i>NRG1</i> expression promote this process.</p>

Digital Imaging Combined with Genome-Wide Association Mapping Links Loci to Plant-Pathogen Interaction Traits
<p>Plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to generalist pathogens with broad host ranges, such as <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> (<i>Botrytis</i>), is typically quantitative and highly polygenic. Recent studies have begun to elucidate the molecular genetic basis of plant-pathogen interactions using commonly measured traits, including lesion size and/or pathogen biomass. However, with the advent of digital imaging and high-throughput phenomics, there are a large number of additional traits available to study quantitative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. In this study, we used high-throughput digital imaging analysis to investigate previously poorly characterized visual traits of plant-pathogen interactions related to disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance using the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>)/<i>Botrytis</i> pathosystem. From a large collection of visual lesion trait measurements, we focused on color, shape, and size to test how these aspects of the Arabidopsis/<i>Botrytis</i> interaction are genetically related. Through genome-wide association mapping in Arabidopsis, we show that lesion color and shape are genetically separable traits associated with plant disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. Moreover, by employing defined mutants in 23 candidate genes identified from the genome-wide association mapping, we demonstrate links between loci and each of the different plant-pathogen interaction traits. These results expand our understanding of the functional mechanisms driving plant disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance.</p>

Distinct Roles of Non-Overlapping Surface Regions of the Coiled-Coil Domain in the Potato Immune Receptor Rx1
<p>The intracellular immune receptor Rx1 of potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>), which confers effector-triggered immunity to <i>Potato virus X</i>, consists of a central nucleotide-binding domain (NB-ARC) flanked by a carboxyl-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain and an amino-terminal coiled-coil (CC) domain. Rx1 activity is strictly regulated by interdomain interactions between the NB-ARC and LRR, but the contribution of the CC domain in regulating Rx1 activity or immune signaling is not fully understood. Therefore, we used a structure-informed approach to investigate the role of the CC domain in Rx1 functionality. Targeted mutagenesis of CC surface residues revealed separate regions required for the intramolecular and intermolecular interaction of the CC with the NB-ARC-LRR and the cofactor Ran GTPase-activating protein2 (RanGAP2), respectively. None of the mutant Rx1 proteins was constitutively active, indicating that the CC does not contribute to the autoinhibition of Rx1 activity. Instead, the CC domain acted as a modulator of downstream responses involved in effector-triggered immunity. Systematic disruption of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrophob</span></strong>ic interface between the four helices of the CC enabled the uncoupling of cell death and disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance responses. Moreover, a strong dominant negative effect on Rx1-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance and cell death was observed upon coexpression of the CC alone with full-length Rx1 protein, which depended on the RanGAP2-binding surface of the CC. Surprisingly, coexpression of the N-terminal half of the CC enhanced Rx1-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance, which further indicated that the CC functions as a scaffold for downstream components involved in the modulation of disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance or cell death signaling.</p>

Short-Term Exposure to Nitrogen Dioxide Provides Basal Pathogen Resistance
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) forms in plants under stress conditions, but little is known about its physiological functions. Here, we explored the physiological functions of NO<sub>2</sub> in plant cells using short-term fumigation of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) for 1 h with 10 µL L<sup>−1</sup> NO<sub>2.</sub> Although leaf symptoms were absent, the expression of genes related to pathogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance was induced. Fumigated plants developed basal disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance, or pattern-triggered immunity, against the necrotrophic fungus <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> and the hemibiotrophic bacterium <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i>. Functional salicylic acid and jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathways were both required for the full expression of NO<sub>2</sub>-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance against <i>B. cinerea</i>. An early peak of salicylic acid accumulation immediately after NO<sub>2</sub> exposure was followed by a transient accumulation of oxophytodienoic acid. The simultaneous NO<sub>2</sub>-induced expression of genes involved in jasmonate biosynthesis and jasmonate catabolism resulted in the complete suppression of JA and JA-isoleucine (JA-Ile) accumulation, which was accompanied by a rise in the levels of their catabolic intermediates 12-OH-JA, 12-OH-JA-Ile, and 12-COOH-JA-Ile. NO<sub>2</sub>-treated plants emitted the volatile monoterpene α-pinene and the sesquiterpene longifolene (syn. junipene), which could function in signaling or direct defense against pathogens. NO<sub>2</sub>-triggered <i>B. cinerea</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance was dependent on enhanced early callose deposition and <i>CYTOCHROME P450 79B2</i> (<i>CYP79B2</i>), <i>CYP79B3</i>, and <i>PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT3</i> gene functions but independent of camalexin, <i>CYP81F2</i>, and 4-OH-indol-3-ylmethylglucosinolate derivatives. In sum, exogenous NO<sub>2</sub> triggers basal pathogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance, pointing to a possible role for endogenous NO<sub>2</sub> in defense signaling. Additionally, this study revealed the involvement of jasmonate catabolism and volatiles in pathogen immunity.</p>

A Maternally Deposited Endosperm Cuticle Contributes to the Physiological Defects of <i>transparent testa</i> Seeds
<p>Mature dry seeds are highly resilient plant structures where the encapsulated embryo is kept protected and dormant to facilitate its ultimate dispersion. Seed viability is heavily dependent on the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>’s capacity to shield living tissues from mechanical and oxidative stress. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>, also called the testa, arises after the differentiation of maternal ovular integuments during seed development. We recently described a thick cuticle tightly embedded in the mature seed’s endosperm cell wall. We show here that it is produced by the maternal inner integument 1 layer and, remarkably, transferred to the developing endosperm. Arabidopsis <i>transparent testa</i> (<i>tt</i>) mutations cause maternally derived seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> pigmentation defects. <i>TT</i> gene products encode proteins involved in flavonoid metabolism and regulators of seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> development. <i>tt</i> mutants have abnormally high seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> permeability, resulting in lower seed viability and dormancy. However, the biochemical basis of this high permeability is not fully understood. We show that the cuticles of developing <i>tt</i> mutant integuments have profound structural defects, which are associated with enhanced cuticle permeability. Genetic analysis indicates that a functional proanthocyanidin synthesis pathway is required to limit cuticle permeability, and our results suggest that proanthocyanidins could be intrinsic components of the cuticle. Together, these results show that the formation of a maternal cuticle is an intrinsic part of the normal integumental differentiation program leading to testa formation and is essential for the seed’s physiological properties.</p>

Gene Duplication and Aneuploidy Trigger Rapid Evolution of Herbicide Resistance in Common Waterhemp<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>An increase in gene copy number is often associated with changes in the number and structure of chromosomes, as has been widely observed in yeast and eukaryotic tumors, yet little is known about stress-induced chromosomal changes in plants. Previously, we reported that the <i>EPSPS</i> (5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase) gene, the molecular target of glyphosate, was amplified at the native locus and on an extra chromosome in glyphosate-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant <i>Amaranthus tuberculatus</i>. Here, we report that the extra chromosome is a ring chromosome termed extra circular chromosome carrying amplified <i>EPSPS</i> (ECCAE). The ECCAE is heterochromatic, harbors four major <i>EPSPS</i> amplified foci, and is sexually transmitted to 35% of the progeny. Two highly glyphosate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant (HGR) <i>A. tuberculatus</i> plants with a chromosome constitution of 2n = 32+1 ECCAE displayed soma cell heterogeneity. Some cells had secondary ECCAEs, which displayed size polymorphisms and produced novel chromosomal variants with multiple gene amplification foci. We hypothesize that the ECCAE in the soma cells of HGR <i>A. tuberculatus</i> plants underwent breakage-fusion-bridge cycles to generate the observed soma cell heterogeneity, including de novo <i>EPSPS</i> gene integration into chromosomes. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant soma cells with stable <i>EPSPS</i> amplification events as de novo insertions into chromosomes may survive glyphosate selection pressure during the sporophytic phase and are plausibly transmitted to germ cells leading to durable glyphosate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in <i>A. tuberculatus</i>. This is the first report of early events in aneuploidy-triggered de novo chromosome integration by an as yet unknown mechanism, which may drive rapid adaptive evolution of herbicide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in common waterhemp.</p>

Heat Shock Factor HsfA1a Is Essential for <i>R</i> Gene-Mediated Nematode Resistance and Triggers H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> Production<sup>1</sup>
<p>Plants generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the apoplast in response to pathogen attack, especially following <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance (<i>R</i>) gene-mediated pathogen recognition; however, the mechanisms activating ROS generation remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that RKN (<i>Meloidogyne incognita</i>) infection rapidly induces ROS accumulation in the roots of tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) plants that contain the <i>R</i> gene <i>Mi-1.2</i> but rarely induces ROS accumulation in the susceptible or <i>Mi-1.2</i>-silenced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant genotypes. RNK also induces the hypersensitive response, a form of programmed cell death, in <i>Mi-1.2</i> plants. RKN induces the expression of numerous class-A heat shock factor (HsfA) genes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant tomato plants. Silencing <i>HsfA1a</i> compromises <i>Mi-1.2</i>-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance, apoplastic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation, and the transcription of <i>whitefly induced 1</i> (<i>Wfi1</i>), which encodes a respiratory burst oxidase homolog.

HsfA1a and Wfi1 are involved in Mi-1.2-triggered Hsp90 accumulation and basal defense in susceptible tomato. Thus, HsfA–1aWfi1-dependent ROS signaling functions as a crucial regulator of plant defense responses.</p>

Homologues of the RPW8 Resistance Protein Are Localized to the Extrahaustorial Membrane that Is Likely Synthesized De Novo
<p>Upon penetration of the host cell wall, the powdery mildew fungus develops a feeding structure named the haustorium in the invaded host cell. Concomitant with haustorial biogenesis, the extrahaustorial membrane (EHM) is formed to separate the haustorium from the host cell cytoplasm. The Arabidopsis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance protein RPW8.2 is specifically targeted to the EHM where it activates haustorium-targeted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance against powdery mildew. RPW8.2 belongs to a small family with six members in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Whether Homologs of RPW8 (HR) 1 to HR4 are also localized to the EHM and contribute to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance has not been determined. Here, we report that overexpression of <i>HR1</i>, <i>HR2</i>, or <i>HR3</i> led to enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to powdery mildew, while genetic depletion of <i>HR2</i> or <i>HR3</i> resulted in enhanced susceptibility, indicating that these <i>RPW8</i> homologs contribute to basal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. Interestingly, we found that N-terminally YFP-tagged HR1 to HR3 are also EHM-localized. This suggests that EHM-targeting is an ancestral feature of the RPW8 family. Indeed, two RPW8 homologs from <i>Brassica oleracea</i> tested also exhibit EHM-localization. Domain swapping analysis between HR3 and RPW8.2 suggests that sequence diversification in the N-terminal 146 amino acids of RPW8.2 probably functionally distinguishes it from other family members. Moreover, we found that N-terminally YFP-tagged HR3 is also localized to the plasma membrane and the fungal penetration site (the papilla) in addition to the EHM. Using this unique feature of YFP-HR3, we obtained preliminary evidence to suggest that the EHM is unlikely derived from invagination of the plasma membrane, rather it may be mainly synthesized de novo.</p>

Two Chloroplast Proteins Suppress Drought Resistance by Affecting ROS Production in Guard Cells
<p>Chloroplast as the site for photosynthesis is an essential organelle in plants, but little is known about its role in stomatal regulation and drought <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. In this study, we show that two chloroplastic proteins essential for thylakoid formation negatively regulate drought <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). By screening a mutant pool with T-DNA insertions in nuclear genes encoding chloroplastic proteins, we identified an <i>HCF106</i> knockdown mutant exhibiting increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to drought stress. The <i>hcf106</i> mutant displayed elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in guard cells, improved stomatal closure, and reduced water loss under drought conditions. The HCF106 protein was found to physically interact with THF1, a previously identified chloroplastic protein crucial for thylakoid formation. The <i>thf1</i> mutant phenotypically resembled the <i>hcf106</i> mutant and displayed more ROS accumulation in guard cells, increased stomatal closure, reduced water loss, and drought <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant phenotypes compared to the wild type. The <i>hcf106thf1</i> double mutant behaved similarly as the <i>thf1</i> single mutant. These results suggest that HCF106 and THF1 form a complex to modulate chloroplast function and that the complex is important for ROS production in guard cells and stomatal control in response to environmental stresses. Our results also suggest that modulating chloroplastic proteins could be a way for improving drought <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in crops.</p>

Gall induction may benefit host plant: a case of a gall wasp and eucalyptus tree
<p>Gall-inducing insects display intimate interactions with their host plants, usually described as parasitic relationships; the galls seem to favor the galler alone. We report on a case in which the presence of the galls induced by <i>Leptocybe invasa</i> Fisher & LaSalle (Hymenoptera; Eulophidae) benefit its host plant, the river red gum <i>Eucalyptus camaldulensis</i> Dehnh. Field observations showed that <i>E. camaldulensis</i> plants infected by this gall wasp were less susceptible to cold injury than neighboring conspecific plants without galls. In the laboratory, frost <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance was compared between galled and non-galled plants which were both divided into two subgroups: cold-acclimated plants and plants that were non-acclimated. Galled plants displayed higher frost <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance than the non-galled ones, and the differences were higher in non-acclimated plants compared with acclimated ones. Physiological changes in host plant were determined by chemical analyses of chlorophylls, proteins, soluble sugars and anthocyanin contents. The results showed higher values of all physiological parameters in the galled plants, supporting the hypothesis that the presence of the gall wasp induces physiological changes on the plant foliage, which may in turn increase plant defense mechanisms against cold. Therefore, the toll of galling by the herbivore may pay off by the host plant acquiring increased frost <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. This work provides evidence for physiological changes induced by a herbivore which might have a positive indirect effect on the host plant, promoting frost <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance such as cold acclimation.</p>

Role of AcrAB-TolC multidrug efflux pump in drug-resistance acquisition by plasmid transfer
<p>Drug-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance dissemination by horizontal gene transfer remains poorly understood at the cellular scale. Using live-cell microscopy, we reveal the dynamics of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance acquisition by transfer of the <i>Escherichia coli</i> fertility factor–conjugation plasmid encoding the tetracycline-efflux pump TetA. The entry of the single-stranded DNA plasmid into the recipient cell is rapidly followed by complementary-strand synthesis, plasmid-gene expression, and production of TetA. In the presence of translation-inhibiting antibiotics, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance acquisition depends on the AcrAB-TolC multidrug efflux pump, because it reduces tetracycline concentrations in the cell. Protein synthesis can thus persist and TetA expression can be initiated immediately after plasmid acquisition. AcrAB-TolC efflux activity can also preserve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance acquisition by plasmid transfer in the presence of antibiotics with other modes of action.</p>

Spin coating epitaxial films
<p>Spin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed films, such as photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>s for lithography or perovskite films for solar cells, are either amorphous or polycrystalline. We show that epitaxial films of inorganic materials such as cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr<sub>3</sub>), lead(II) iodide (PbI<sub>2</sub>), zinc oxide (ZnO), and sodium chloride (NaCl) can be deposited onto a variety of single-crystal and single-crystal–like substrates by simply spin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ing either solutions of the material or precursors to the material. The out-of-plane and in-plane orientations of the spin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed films are determined by the substrate. The thin stagnant layer of supersaturated solution produced during spin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ing promotes heterogeneous nucleation of the material onto the single-crystal substrate over homogeneous nucleation in the bulk solution, and ordered anion adlayers may lower the activation energy for nucleation on the surface. The method can be used to produce functional materials such as inorganic semiconductors or to deposit water-soluble materials such as NaCl that can serve as growth templates.</p>

Heterogeneity in efflux pump expression predisposes antibiotic-resistant cells to mutation
<p>Antibiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance is often the result of mutations that block drug activity; however, bacteria also evade antibiotics by transiently expressing genes such as multidrug efflux pumps. A crucial question is whether transient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance can promote permanent genetic changes. Previous studies have established that antibiotic treatment can select tolerant cells that then mutate to achieve permanent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. Whether these mutations result from antibiotic stress or preexist within the population is unclear. To address this question, we focused on the multidrug pump AcrAB-TolC. Using time-lapse microscopy, we found that cells with higher <i>acrAB</i> expression have lower expression of the DNA mismatch repair gene <i>mutS</i>, lower growth rates, and higher mutation frequencies. Thus, transient antibiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance from elevated <i>acrAB</i> expression can promote spontaneous mutations within single cells.</p>

‘Frightening’ typhoid fever outbreak spreads in Pakistan
<p>A strain of the bacterium that causes typhoid fever has become <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant to most every drug and is spreading through Pakistan, causing at least 2000 confirmed cases. The so-called extensively drug <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant (XDR) strain of <i>Salmonella typhi</i> remains susceptible to one oral antibiotic, azithromycin, but the only other options are expensive intravenous drugs that most people in Pakistan and other resource-strapped countries cannot afford. The fear is that if <i>S. typhi</i> develops <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to azithromycin, many people will die from the disease, which leads to bowl perforation and other life-threatening complications in about 15% of untreated people. A new vaccine that for the first time works in young children and has long-lasting immunity is now being rolled out in Pakistan. But antibiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance and spread are a result of poor sanitation and contaminated water supplies, which reflect the serious infrastructure problems in Hyderabad and Karachi, the two main cities affected by XDR <i>S. typhi. </i>Public health officials worry that the XDR <i>S. typhi</i> will also jump borders and soon start spreading outside of Pakistan.</p>

Bone-like crack resistance in hierarchical metastable nanolaminate steels
<p>Fatigue failures create enormous risks for all engineered structures, as well as for human lives, motivating large safety factors in design and, thus, inefficient use of resources. Inspired by the excellent fracture toughness of bone, we explored the fatigue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in metastability-assisted multiphase steels. We show here that when steel microstructures are hierarchical and laminated, similar to the substructure of bone, superior crack <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance can be realized. Our results reveal that tuning the interface structure, distribution, and phase stability to simultaneously activate multiple micromechanisms that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong> crack propagation is key for the observed leap in mechanical response.

The Structural Integrity of Lignin Is Crucial for Resistance against <i>Striga hermonthica</i> Parasitism in Rice
<p><i>Striga</i> species are parasitic weeds that seriously constrain the productivity of food staples, including cereals and legumes, in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. In eastern and central Africa, <i>Striga</i> spp. infest as much as 40 million hectares of smallholder farmland causing total crop failure during severe infestation. As the molecular mechanisms underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance are yet to be elucidated, we undertook a comparative metabolome study using the <i>Striga</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) cultivar ‘Nipponbare’ and the susceptible cultivar ‘Koshihikari’. We found that a number of metabolites accumulated preferentially in the <i>Striga</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant cultivar upon <i>Striga hermonthica</i> infection. Most apparent was increased deposition of lignin, a phenylpropanoid polymer mainly composed of <i>p</i>-hydroxyphenyl (H), guaiacyl (G), and syringyl (S) aromatic units, around the site of interaction in Nipponbare. The increased deposition of lignin was accompanied by induction of the expression of corresponding enzyme-encoding genes in the phenylpropanoid pathway. In addition, perturbing normal lignin composition by knocking down or overexpressing the genes that regulate lignin composition, i.e. <i>p</i>-COUMARATE 3-HYDROXYLASE or FERULATE 5-HYDROXYLASE, enhanced susceptibility of Nipponbare to <i>S</i>. <i>hermonthica</i> infection. These results demonstrate that enhanced lignin deposition and maintenance of the structural integrity of lignin polymers deposited at the infection site are crucial for postattachment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance against <i>S</i>. <i>hermonthica</i>.</p>

The Coiled-Coil NLR <i>Rph1</i>, Confers Leaf Rust Resistance in Barley Cultivar Sudan
<p>Unraveling and exploiting mechanisms of disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in cereal crops is currently limited by their large repeat-rich genomes and the lack of genetic recombination or cultivar (cv)-specific sequence information. We cloned the first leaf rust <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance gene <i>Rph1</i> (<i>Rph1</i>.<i>a</i>) from cultivated barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) using “MutChromSeq,” a recently developed molecular genomics tool for the rapid cloning of genes in plants. Marker-trait association in the CI 9214/Stirling doubled haploid population mapped <i>Rph1</i> to the short arm of chromosome 2H in a physical region of 1.3 megabases relative to the barley cv Morex reference assembly. A sodium azide mutant population in cv Sudan was generated and 10 mutants were confirmed by progeny-testing. Flow-sorted 2H chromosomes from Sudan (wild type) and six of the mutants were sequenced and compared to identify candidate genes for the <i>Rph1</i> locus. MutChromSeq identified a single gene candidate encoding a coiled-coil nucleotide binding site Leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptor protein that was altered in three different mutants. Further Sanger sequencing confirmed all three mutations and identified an additional two independent mutations within the same candidate gene. Phylogenetic analysis determined that <i>Rph1</i> clustered separately from all previously cloned NLRs from the Triticeae and displayed highest sequence similarity (89%) with a homolog of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance protein 1 protein in <i>Triticum urartu</i>.

<i>NLR</i> Mutations Suppressing Immune Hybrid Incompatibility and Their Effects on Disease Resistance
<p>Genetic divergence between populations can lead to reproductive isolation. Hybrid incompatibilities (HI) represent intermediate points along a continuum toward speciation. In plants, genetic variation in disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance (<i>R</i>) genes underlies several cases of HI. The progeny of a cross between Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) accessions Landsberg <i>erecta</i> (L<i>er</i>, Poland) and Kashmir2 (Kas2, central Asia) exhibits immune-related HI. This incompatibility is due to a genetic interaction between a cluster of eight <i>TNL (TOLL/INTERLEUKIN1 RECEPTOR-NUCLEOTIDE BINDING-LEU RICH REPEAT</i>) <i>RPP1</i> (<i>RECOGNITION OF PERONOSPORA PARASITICA1)</i>-<i>like</i> genes (<i>R1</i>–<i>R8</i>) from L<i>er</i> and central Asian alleles of a <i>Strubbelig</i>-family receptor-like kinase (<i>SRF3</i>) from Kas2. In characterizing mutants altered in L<i>er</i>/Kas2 HI, we mapped multiple mutations to the <i>RPP1</i>-like L<i>er</i> locus. Analysis of these <i>suppressor of Ler/Kas2 incompatibility</i> (<i>sulki</i>) mutants reveals complex, additive and epistatic interactions underlying <i>RPP1</i>-<i>like</i> L<i>er</i> locus activity. The effects of these mutations were measured on basal defense, global gene expression, primary metabolism, and disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to a local <i>Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis</i> isolate (<i>Hpa</i> Gw) collected from Gorzéáéáów (Gw), where the Landsberg accession originated. Gene expression sectors and metabolic hallmarks identified for HI are both dependent and independent of <i>RPP1</i>-<i>like</i> L<i>er</i> members. We establish that mutations suppressing immune-related L<i>er</i>/Kas2 HI do not compromise <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to <i>Hpa</i> Gw. QTL mapping analysis of <i>Hpa</i> Gw <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance point to <i>RPP7</i> as the causal locus. This work provides insight into the complex genetic architecture of the <i>RPP1</i>-<i>like</i> L<i>er</i> locus and immune-related HI in Arabidopsis and into the contributions of <i>RPP1</i>-<i>like</i> genes to HI and defense.</p>

Knockdown of Rice MicroRNA166 Confers Drought Resistance by Causing Leaf Rolling and Altering Stem Xylem Development
<p>MicroRNAs are 19- to 22-nucleotide small noncoding RNAs that have been implicated in abiotic stress responses. In this study, we found that knockdown of microRNA166, using the Short Tandem Target Mimic (STTM) system, resulted in morphological changes that confer drought <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). From a large-scale screen for miRNA knockdown lines in rice, we identified miR166 knockdown lines (STTM166); these plants exhibit a rolled-leaf phenotype, which is normally displayed by rice plants under drought stress. The leaves of STTM166 rice plants had smaller bulliform cells and abnormal sclerenchymatous cells, likely causing the rolled-leaf phenotype. The STTM166 plants had reduced stomatal conductance and showed decreased transpiration rates. The STTM166 lines also exhibited altered stem xylem and decreased hydraulic conductivity, likely due to the reduced diameter of the xylem vessels. Molecular analyses identified rice <i>HOMEODOMAIN CONTAINING PROTEIN4</i> (<i>OsHB4</i>), a member of HD-Zip III gene family, as a major target of miR166; moreover, rice plants overexpressing a miR166-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant form of <i>OsHB4</i> resembled the STTM166 plants, including leaf rolling and higher drought <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. The genes downstream of miR166-<i>OsHB4</i> consisted of polysaccharide synthesis-related genes that may contribute to cell wall formation and vascular development. Our results suggest that drought <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in rice can be increased by manipulating miRNAs, which leads to developmental changes, such as leaf rolling and reduced diameter of the xylem, that mimic plants’ natural responses to water-deficit stress.</p>

BcXYG1, a Secreted Xyloglucanase from <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>, Triggers Both Cell Death and Plant Immune Responses
<p>In search of <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> cell death-inducing proteins, we found a xyloglucanase (BcXYG1) that induced strong necrosis and a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance response in dicot plants. Expression of the <i>BcXYG1</i> gene was strongly induced during the first 12 h post inoculation, and analysis of disease dynamics using PathTrack showed that a <i>B. cinerea</i> strain overexpressing <i>BcXYG1</i> produced early local necrosis, supporting a role of BcXYG1 as an early cell death-inducing factor. The xyloglucanase activity of BcXYG1 was not necessary for the induction of necrosis and plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance, as a mutant of BcXYG1 lacking the xyloglucanase enzymatic activity retained both functions. Residues in two exposed loops on the surface of BcXYG1 were found to be necessary for the induction of cell death but not to induce plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. Further analyses showed that BcXYG1 is apoplastic and possibly interacts with the proteins of the plant cell membrane and also that the BcXYG1 cell death-promoting signal is mediated by the leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases BAK1 and SOBIR1. Our findings support the role of cell death-inducing proteins in establishing the infection of necrotrophic pathogens and highlight the recognition of fungal apoplastic proteins by the plant immune system as an important mechanism of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance against this class of pathogens.</p>

Biochemical Principles and Functional Aspects of Pipecolic Acid Biosynthesis in Plant Immunity
<p>The nonprotein amino acid pipecolic acid (Pip) regulates plant systemic acquired <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance and basal immunity to bacterial pathogen infection. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the lysine (Lys) aminotransferase AGD2-LIKE DEFENSE RESPONSE PROTEIN1 (ALD1) mediates the pathogen-induced accumulation of Pip in inoculated and distal leaf tissue. Here, we show that ALD1 transfers the α-amino group of <sc>l</sc>-Lys to acceptor oxoacids. Combined mass spectrometric and infrared spectroscopic analyses of in vitro assays and plant extracts indicate that the final product of the ALD1-catalyzed reaction is enaminic 2,3-dehydropipecolic acid (DP), whose formation involves consecutive transamination, cyclization, and isomerization steps. Besides <sc>l</sc>-Lys, recombinant ALD1 transaminates <sc>l</sc>-methionine, <sc>l</sc>-leucine, diaminopimelate, and several other amino acids to generate oxoacids or derived products in vitro. However, detailed in planta analyses suggest that the biosynthesis of 2,3-DP from <sc>l</sc>-Lys is the major in vivo function of ALD1. Since <i>ald1</i> mutant plants are able to convert exogenous 2,3-DP into Pip, their Pip deficiency relies on the inability to form the 2,3-DP intermediate. The Arabidopsis reductase ornithine cyclodeaminase/μ-crystallin, alias SYSTEMIC ACQUIRED <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ANCE-DEFICIENT4 (SARD4), converts ALD1-generated 2,3-DP into Pip in vitro. SARD4 significantly contributes to the production of Pip in pathogen-inoculated leaves but is not the exclusive reducing enzyme involved in Pip biosynthesis. Functional <i>SARD4</i> is required for proper basal immunity to the bacterial pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i>. Although <i>SARD4</i> knockout plants show greatly reduced accumulation of Pip in leaves distal to <i>P. syringae</i> inoculation, they display a considerable systemic acquired <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance response. This suggests a triggering function of locally accumulating Pip for systemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance induction.</p>

Identification and Characterization of Arabidopsis Seed Coat Mucilage Proteins
<p>Plant cell wall proteins are important regulators of cell wall architecture and function. However, because cell wall proteins are difficult to extract and analyze, they are generally poorly understood. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of proteins integral to the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> mucilage, a specialized layer of the extracellular matrix composed of plant cell wall carbohydrates that is used as a model for cell wall research. The proteins identified in mucilage include those previously identified by genetic analysis, and several mucilage proteins are reduced in mucilage-deficient mutant seeds, suggesting that these proteins are genuinely associated with the mucilage. Arabidopsis mucilage has both nonadherent and adherent layers. Both layers have similar protein profiles except for proteins involved in lipid metabolism, which are present exclusively in the adherent mucilage. The most abundant mucilage proteins include a family of proteins named TESTA ABUNDANT1 (TBA1) to TBA3; a less abundant fourth homolog was named TBA-LIKE (TBAL). <i>TBA</i> and <i>TBAL</i> transcripts and promoter activities were detected in developing seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>s, and their expression requires seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> differentiation regulators. TBA proteins are secreted to the mucilage pocket during differentiation. Although reverse genetics failed to identify a function for TBAs/TBAL, the <i>TBA</i> promoters are highly expressed and cell type specific and so should be very useful tools for targeting proteins to the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> epidermis. Altogether, these results highlight the mucilage proteome as a model for cell walls in general, as it shares similarities with other cell wall proteomes while also containing mucilage-specific features.</p>

Physical Mapping of Amplified Copies of the 5-Enolpyruvylshikimate-3-Phosphate Synthase Gene in Glyphosate-Resistant <i>Amaranthus tuberculatus</i><xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Recent and rapid evolution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to glyphosate, the most widely used herbicides, in several weed species, including common waterhemp (<i>Amaranthus tuberculatus</i>), poses a serious threat to sustained crop production. We report that glyphosate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in <i>A</i>. <i>tuberculatus</i> was due to amplification of the 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-P synthase (<i>EPSPS</i>) gene, which encodes the molecular target of glyphosate. There was a positive correlation between <i>EPSPS</i> gene copies and its transcript expression. We analyzed the distribution of <i>EPSPS</i> copies in the genome of <i>A</i>. <i>tuberculatus</i> using fluorescence in situ hybridization on mitotic metaphase chromosomes and interphase nuclei. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis mapped the <i>EPSPS</i> gene to pericentromeric regions of two homologous chromosomes in glyphosate sensitive <i>A</i>. <i>tuberculatus</i>. In glyphosate-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant plants, a cluster of <i>EPSPS</i> genes on the pericentromeric region on one pair of homologous chromosomes was detected. Intriguingly, two highly glyphosate-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant plants harbored an additional chromosome with several <i>EPSPS</i> copies besides the native chromosome pair with <i>EPSPS</i> copies. These results suggest that the initial event of <i>EPSPS</i> gene duplication may have occurred because of unequal recombination mediated by repetitive DNA. Subsequently, gene amplification may have resulted via several other mechanisms, such as chromosomal rearrangements, deletion/insertion, transposon-mediated dispersion, or possibly by interspecific hybridization. This report illustrates the physical mapping of amplified <i>EPSPS</i> copies in <i>A</i>. <i>tuberculatus</i>.</p>

Two Different Transcripts of a LAMMER Kinase Gene Play Opposite Roles in Disease Resistance
<p>Alternative splicing of genes can increase protein diversity and affect mRNA stability. Genome-wide transcriptome sequencing has demonstrated that alternative splicing occurs in a large number of intron-containing genes of different species. However, despite the phenomenon having been known for decades, it is largely unknown how the alternatively spliced transcripts function differently. Here, we report that two alternatively spliced transcripts of the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) LAMMER kinase gene <i>OsDR11</i>, long <i>OsDR11L</i> and short <i>OsDR11S</i>, play opposite roles in rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance against <i>Xanthomonas oryzae</i> pv <i>oryzae</i> (<i>Xoo</i>), which causes the most damaging bacterial disease in rice worldwide. Overexpressing <i>OsDR11S</i> or suppressing <i>OsDR11L</i> in rice enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to <i>Xoo</i>, which was accompanied by an accumulation of jasmonic acid (JA) and induced expression of JA signaling genes. In contrast, suppressing <i>OsDR11S</i> was associated with increased susceptibility to <i>Xoo</i>, along with decreased levels of JA and expression of JA signaling genes. The OsDR11S and OsDR11L proteins colocalized in the nucleus. OsDR11L showed autophosphorylation activity in vitro, while OsDR11S did not. In the presence of OsDR11S, autophosphorylation of OsDR11L was inhibited, and overexpression of <i>OsDR11S</i> suppressed <i>OsDR11L</i> expression. <i>OsDR11</i> appeared to contribute to a minor quantitative trait locus against <i>Xoo</i>. These results suggest that OsDR11L is a negative regulator in rice disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance, which may be associated with suppression of JA signaling. The results also suggest that OsDR11S may inhibit the function of OsDR11L at both the transcription and protein kinase activity levels, leading to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance against <i>Xoo</i>.</p>

The Genetics of Leaf Flecking in Maize and Its Relationship to Plant Defense and Disease Resistance
<p>Physiological leaf spotting, or flecking, is a mild-lesion phenotype observed on the leaves of several commonly used maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) inbred lines and has been anecdotally linked to enhanced broad-spectrum disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. Flecking was assessed in the maize nested association mapping (NAM) population, comprising 4,998 recombinant inbred lines from 25 biparental families, and in an association population, comprising 279 diverse maize inbreds. Joint family linkage analysis was conducted with 7,386 markers in the NAM population. Genome-wide association tests were performed with 26.5 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the NAM population and with 246,497 SNPs in the association population, resulting in the identification of 18 and three loci associated with variation in flecking, respectively. Many of the candidate genes colocalizing with associated SNPs are similar to genes that function in plant defense response via cell wall modification, salicylic acid- and jasmonic acid-dependent pathways, redox homeostasis, stress response, and vesicle trafficking/remodeling. Significant positive correlations were found between increased flecking, stronger defense response, increased disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance, and increased pest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. A nonlinear relationship with total kernel weight also was observed whereby lines with relatively high levels of flecking had, on average, lower total kernel weight. We present evidence suggesting that mild flecking could be used as a selection criterion for breeding programs trying to incorporate broad-spectrum disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance.</p>

Elevated carboxyhemoglobin in a marine mammal, the northern elephant seal
<p>Low concentrations of endogenous carbon monoxide (CO), generated primarily through degradation of heme from heme-proteins, have been shown to maintain physiological function of organs and to exert cytoprotective effects. However, high concentrations of carboxyhemoglobin (COHb), formed by CO binding to hemoglobin, potentially prevent adequate O<sub>2</sub> delivery to tissues by lowering arterial O<sub>2</sub> content. Elevated heme-protein concentrations, as found in marine mammals, are likely associated with greater heme degradation, more endogenous CO production and, consequently, elevated COHb concentrations. Therefore, we measured COHb in elephant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seal</span></strong>s, a species with large blood volumes and elevated hemoglobin and myoglobin concentrations. The levels of COHb were positively related to the total hemoglobin concentration. The maximum COHb value was 10.4% of total hemoglobin concentration. The mean (±s.e.m.) value in adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seal</span></strong>s was 8.7±0.3% (<i>N</i>=6), while juveniles and pups (with lower heme-protein contents) had lower mean COHb values of 7.6±0.2% and 7.1±0.3%, respectively (<i>N</i>=9 and <i>N</i>=9, respectively). Serial samples over several hours revealed little to no fluctuation in COHb values. This consistent elevation in COHb suggests that the magnitude and/or rate of heme-protein turnover is much higher than in terrestrial mammals. The maximum COHb values from this study decrease total body O<sub>2</sub> stores by 7%, thereby reducing the calculated aerobic dive limit for this species. However, the constant presence of elevated CO in blood may also protect against potential ischemia–reperfusion injury associated with the extreme breath-holds of elephant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seal</span></strong>s. We suggest the elephant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seal</span></strong> represents an ideal model for understanding the potential cytoprotective effects, mechanisms of action and evolutionary adaptation associated with chronically elevated concentrations of endogenously produced CO.</p>

Stellarex Drug-Coated Balloon for Treatment of Femoropopliteal Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Drug-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed balloons (DCBs) are a predominant revascularization therapy for symptomatic femoropopliteal artery disease. Because of the differences in excipients, paclitaxel dose, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ing morphologies, varying clinical outcomes have been observed with different DCBs. We report the results of 2 studies investigating the pharmacokinetic and clinical outcomes of a new DCB to treat femoropopliteal disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In the ILLUMENATE Pivotal Study (Prospective, Randomized, Single-Blind, U.S. Multi-Center Study to Evaluate Treatment of Obstructive Superficial Femoral Artery or Popliteal Lesions With A Novel Paclitaxel-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed Percutaneous Angioplasty Balloon), 300 symptomatic patients (Rutherford class 2–4) were randomly assigned to DCB (n=200) or standard angioplasty (percutaneous transluminal angioplasty [PTA]) (n=100). The primary safety end point was freedom from device- and procedure-related death through 30 days, and freedom from target limb major amputation and clinically driven target lesion revascularization through 12 months. The primary effectiveness end point was primary patency through 12 months. In the ILLUMENATE PK study (Pharmacokinetic Study of the Stellarex Drug-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed Angioplasty Balloon), paclitaxel plasma concentrations were measured after last DCB deployment and at prespecified times (at 1, 4, 24 hours and at 7 and 14 days postprocedure) until no longer detectable.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In the ILLUMENATE Pivotal Study, baseline characteristics were similar between groups: 50% had diabetes mellitus, 41% were women, mean lesion length was 8.3 cm, and 44% were severely calcified. The primary safety end point was met (92.1% for DCB versus 83.2% for PTA, <i>P</i>=0.025 for superiority) and the primary patency rate was significantly higher with DCB (76.3% for DCB versus 57.6% for PTA, <i>P</i>=0.003). Primary patency per Kaplan-Meier estimates at day 365 was 82.3% for DCB versus 70.9% for PTA (<i>P</i>=0.002). The rate of clinically driven target lesion revascularization was significantly lower in the DCB cohort (7.9% versus 16.8%, <i>P</i>=0.023). Improvements in ankle-brachial index, Rutherford class, and quality of life were comparable, but the PTA cohort required twice as many revascularizations. Pharmacokinetic outcomes showed that all patients had detectable paclitaxel levels after DCB deployment that declined within the first hour (54.4±116.9 ng/mL to 1.4±1.0 ng/mL).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The data demonstrate superior safety and effectiveness of the Stellarex DCB in comparison with PTA, and plasma levels of paclitaxel fall to low levels within 1 hour.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Rewritable multi-event analog recording in bacterial and mammalian cells
<p>We present two CRISPR-mediated analog multi-event <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ing apparatus (CAMERA) systems that use base editors and Cas9 nucleases to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong> cellular events in bacteria and mammalian cells. The devices <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong> signal amplitude or duration as changes in the ratio of mutually exclusive DNA sequences (CAMERA 1) or as single-base modifications (CAMERA 2). We achieved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ing of multiple stimuli in bacteria or mammalian cells, including exposure to antibiotics, nutrients, viruses, light, and changes in Wnt signaling. When <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ing to multicopy plasmids, reliable readout requires as few as 10 to 100 cells. The order of stimuli can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ed through an overlapping guide RNA design, and memories can be erased and re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ed over multiple cycles. CAMERA systems serve as “cell data <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ers” that write a history of endogenous or exogenous signaling events into permanent DNA sequence modifications in living cells.</p>

‘CAMERA’ records cell action with new CRISPR tricks
<p>Biologists long have devised ways to track the inner working of cells, tagging genes with fluorescent proteins and the like to better understand diseases, embryology, and environmental impacts. With the advent of CRISPR, best known as a genome editing tool, many groups have tried to fashion novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ing devices. In a proof-of-concept study published in this week's issue of <i>Science</i>, Harvard University's David Liu and Weixin Tang exploit the components of CRISPR to create two new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ing systems that they call a CRISPR-mediated analog multievent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ing apparatus, or CAMERA for short. One CAMERA system <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>s with the help of plasmids, circular pieces of DNA that float around bacterial cell cytoplasms. In this scheme, CRISPR kicks into action in response to a stimulus like light, an antibiotic, or a virus, directing the destruction of one of two nearly identical "<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>er" plasmids. A tilt in the ratio of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>er one to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>er two captures the exposure to the stimulus, even offering details about the duration and intensity of the exposure. The second CAMERA, which works in mammalian cells as well, uses a CRISPR variant called a base editor to alter the DNA in a "safe harbor" gene that can change its sequence without harming the cell. They show how the changes in the safe harbor gene's sequence can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong> signals from the cellular processes that a stimulus triggers, such as turning on a cancer-causing biochemical pathway.</p>

Improving 1-Year Outcomes of Infrainguinal Limb Revascularization
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The availability and diversity of lower limb revascularization procedures have increased in England in the past decade. We investigated whether these developments in care have translated to improvements in patient pathways and outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Individual-patient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>s from Hospital Episode Statistics were used to identify 103 934 patients who underwent endovascular (angioplasty) or surgical (endarterectomy, profundaplasty, or bypass) lower limb revascularization for infrainguinal peripheral artery disease in England between January 2006 and December 2015. Major lower limb amputations and deaths within 1 year after revascularization were ascertained from Hospital Episode Statistics and Office for National Statistics mortality <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>s. Competing risks regression was used to estimate the cumulative incidence of major amputation and death, adjusted for patient age, sex, comorbidity score, indication for the intervention (intermittent claudication, severe limb ischemia without <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong> of tissue loss, severe limb ischemia with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong> of ulceration, severe limb ischemia with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong> of gangrene/osteomyelitis), and comorbid diabetes mellitus.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The estimated 1-year risk of major amputation decreased from 5.7% (in 2006–2007) to 3.9% (in 2014–2015) following endovascular revascularization, and from 11.2% (2006–2007) to 6.6% (2014–2015) following surgical procedures. The risk of death after both types of revascularization also decreased. These trends were observed for all indication categories, with the largest reductions found in patients with severe limb ischemia with ulceration or gangrene. Overall, morbidity increased over the study period, and a larger proportion of patients was treated for the severe end of the peripheral artery disease spectrum using less invasive procedures.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings show that from 2006 to 2015, the overall survival increased and the risk of major lower limb amputation decreased following revascularization.

Multiplex recording of cellular events over time on CRISPR biological tape
<p>Although dynamics underlie many biological processes, our ability to robustly and accurately profile time-varying biological signals and regulatory programs remains limited. Here we describe a framework for storing temporal biological information directly in the genomes of a cell population. We developed a “biological tape <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>er” in which biological signals trigger intracellular DNA production that is then <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ed by the CRISPR-Cas adaptation system. This approach enables stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ing over multiple days and accurate reconstruction of temporal and lineage information by sequencing CRISPR arrays. We further demonstrate a multiplexing strategy to simultaneously <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong> the temporal availability of three metabolites (copper, trehalose, and fucose) in the environment of a cell population over time. This work enables the temporal measurement of dynamic cellular states and environmental changes and suggests new applications for chronicling biological events on a large scale.</p>

East Asian hydroclimate modulated by the position of the westerlies during Termination I
<p>Speleothem oxygen isotope <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>s have revolutionized our understanding of the paleo East Asian monsoon, yet there is fundamental disagreement on what they represent in terms of the hydroclimate changes. We report a multiproxy speleothem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong> of monsoon evolution during the last deglaciation from the middle Yangtze region, which indicates a wetter central eastern China during North Atlantic cooling episodes, despite the oxygen isotopic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong> suggesting a weaker monsoon. We show that this apparent contradiction can be resolved if the changes are interpreted as a lengthening of the Meiyu rains and shortened post-Meiyu stage, in accordance with a recent hypothesis. Model simulations support this interpretation and further reveal the role of the westerlies in communicating the North Atlantic influence to the East Asian climate.</p>

A Pleistocene ice core record of atmospheric O<sub>2</sub> concentrations

Simultaneous high-resolution pH and spectrophotometric recordings of oxygen binding in blood microvolumes
<p>Oxygen equilibrium curves have been widely used to understand oxygen transport in numerous organisms. A major challenge has been to monitor oxygen binding characteristics and concomitant pH changes as they occur <i>in vivo</i>, in limited sample volumes. Here we report a technique allowing highly resolved and simultaneous monitoring of pH and blood pigment saturation in minute blood volumes. We equipped a gas diffusion chamber with a broad-range fibre-optic spectrophotometer and a micro-pH optode and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ed changes of pigment oxygenation along oxygen partial pressure (<i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) and pH gradients to test the setup. Oxygen binding parameters derived from measurements in only 15 μl of haemolymph from the cephalopod <i>Octopus vulgaris</i> showed low instrumental error (0.93%) and good agreement with published data. Broad-range spectra, each resolving 2048 data points, provided detailed insight into the complex absorbance characteristics of diverse blood types. After consideration of photobleaching and intrinsic fluorescence, pH optodes yielded accurate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ings and resolved a sigmoidal shift of 0.03 pH units in response to changing <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> from 0 to 21 kPa. Highly resolved continuous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ings along pH gradients conformed to stepwise measurements at low rates of pH changes. In this study we showed that a diffusion chamber upgraded with a broad-range spectrophotometer and an optical pH sensor accurately characterizes oxygen binding with minimal sample consumption and manipulation. We conclude that the modified diffusion chamber is highly suitable for experimental biologists who demand high flexibility, detailed insight into oxygen binding as well as experimental and biological accuracy combined in a single setup.</p>

<i>In vivo</i> cranial bone strain and bite force in the agamid lizard <i>Uromastyx geyri</i>
<p><i>In vivo</i> bone strain data are the most direct evidence of deformation and strain regimes in the vertebrate cranium during feeding and can provide important insights into skull morphology. Strain data have been collected during feeding across a wide range of mammals; in contrast, <i>in vivo</i> cranial bone strain data have been collected from few sauropsid taxa. Here we present bone strain data <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ed from the jugal of the herbivorous agamid lizard <i>Uromastyx geyri</i> along with simultaneously <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ed bite force. Principal and shear strain magnitudes in <i>Uromastyx geyri</i> were lower than cranial bone strains <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ed in <i>Alligator mississippiensis</i>, but higher than those reported from herbivorous mammals. Our results suggest that variations in principal strain orientations in the facial skeleton are largely due to differences in feeding behavior and bite location, whereas food type has little impact on strain orientations. Furthermore, mean principal strain orientations differ between male and female <i>Uromastyx</i> during feeding, potentially because of sexual dimorphism in skull morphology.</p>

Prospective Countywide Surveillance and Autopsy Characterization of Sudden Cardiac Death
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Studies of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death (SCD) use emergency medical services <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>s, death certificates, or definitions that infer cause of death; thus, the true incidence of SCD is unknown. Over 90% of SCDs occur out-of-hospital; nonforensic autopsies are rarely performed, and therefore causes of death are presumed. We conducted a medical examiner–based investigation to determine the precise incidence and autopsy-defined causes of all SCDs in an entire metropolitan area. We hypothesized that postmortem investigation would identify actual sudden arrhythmic deaths among presumed SCDs.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Between February 1, 2011, and March 1, 2014, we prospectively identified all incident deaths attributed to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (emergency medical services primary impression, cardiac arrest) between 18 to 90 years of age in San Francisco County for autopsy, toxicology, and histology via medical examiner surveillance of consecutive out-of-hospital deaths, all reported by law. We obtained comprehensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>s to determine whether out-of-hospital cardiac arrest deaths met World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for SCD. We reviewed death certificates filed quarterly for missed SCDs. Autopsy-defined sudden arrhythmic deaths had no extracardiac cause of death or acute heart failure. A multidisciplinary committee adjudicated final cause.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>All 20 440 deaths were reviewed; 12 671 were unattended and reported to the medical examiner. From these, we identified 912 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest deaths; 541 (59%) met WHO SCD criteria (mean 62.8 years, 69% male) and 525 (97%) were autopsied. Eighty-nine additional WHO-defined SCDs occurred within 3 weeks of active medical care with the death certificate signed by the attending physician, ineligible for autopsy but included in the countywide WHO-defined SCD incidence of 29.6/100 000 person-years, highest in black men (<i>P</i><0.0001). Of 525 WHO-defined SCDs, 301 (57%) had no cardiac history.

Genome- and Phenome-Wide Analyses of Cardiac Conduction Identifies Markers of Arrhythmia Risk
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>ECG QRS duration, a measure of cardiac intraventricular conduction, varies ≈2-fold in individuals without cardiac disease.

The most significant loci were evaluated within the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium QRS genome-wide association study meta-analysis. Twenty-three single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 5 loci, previously described by CHARGE, were replicated in the eMERGE samples; 18 single-nucleotide polymorphisms were in the chromosome 3 <i>SCN5A</i> and <i>SCN10A</i> loci, where the most significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms were rs1805126 in <i>SCN5A</i> with <i>P</i>=1.2×10<sup>−8</sup> (eMERGE) and <i>P</i>=2.5×10<sup>−20</sup> (CHARGE) and rs6795970 in <i>SCN10A</i> with <i>P</i>=6×10<sup>−6</sup> (eMERGE) and <i>P</i>=5×10<sup>−27</sup> (CHARGE).

Geometric Morphometric Character Suites as Phylogenetic Data: Extracting Phylogenetic Signal from Gastropod Shells
<p>Despite being the objects of numerous macroevolutionary studies, many of the best represented constituents of the fossil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>—including diverse examples such as foraminifera, brachiopods, and mollusks—have mineralized skeletons with limited discrete characteristics, making morphological phylogenies difficult to construct. In contrast to their paucity of phylogenetic characters, the mineralized structures (tests and shells) of these fossil groups frequently have distinctive shapes that have long proved useful for their classification. The recent introduction of methodologies for including continuous data directly in a phylogenetic analysis has increased the number of available characters, making it possible to produce phylogenies based, in whole or part, on continuous character data collected from such taxa. Geometric morphometric methods provide tools for accurately characterizing shape variation and can produce quantitative data that can therefore now be included in a phylogenetic matrix in a nonarbitrary manner. Here, the marine gastropod genus <i>Conus</i> is used to evaluate the ability of continuous characters—generated from a geometric morphometric analysis of shell shape—to contribute to a total evidence phylogenetic hypothesis constructed using molecular and morphological data. Furthermore, the ability of continuous characters derived from geometric morphometric analyses to place fossil taxa with limited discrete characters into a phylogeny with their extant relatives was tested by simulating the inclusion of fossil taxa. This was done by removing the molecular partition of individual extant species to produce a “cladistic pseudofossil” with only the geometric morphometric derived characters coded. The phylogenetic position of each cladistic pseudofossil taxon was then compared with its placement in the total evidence tree and a symmetric resampling tree to evaluate the degree to which morphometric characters alone can correctly place simulated fossil species. In 33–45% of the test cases (depending upon the approach used for measuring success), it was possible to place the pseudofossil taxon into the correct regions of the phylogeny using only the morphometric characters. This suggests that the incorporation of extinct <i>Conus</i> taxa into phylogenetic hypotheses will be possible, permitting a wide range of macroevolutionary questions to be addressed within this genus. This methodology also has potential to contribute to phylogenetic reconstructions for other major components of the fossil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong> that lack numerous discrete characters.

Sulfur isotopes in diamonds reveal differences in continent construction
<p>Neoproterozoic West African diamonds contain sulfide inclusions with mass-independently fractionated (MIF) sulfur isotopes that trace Archean surficial signatures into the mantle. Two episodes of subduction are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ed in these West African sulfide inclusions: thickening of the continental lithosphere through horizontal processes around 3 billion years ago and reworking and diamond growth around 650 million years ago. We find that the sulfur isotope <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong> in worldwide diamond inclusions is consistent with changes in tectonic processes that formed the continental lithosphere in the Archean. Slave craton diamonds that formed 3.5 billion years ago do not contain any MIF sulfur. Younger diamonds from the Kaapvaal, Zimbabwe, and West African cratons do contain MIF sulfur, which suggests craton construction by advective thickening of mantle lithosphere through conventional subduction-style horizontal tectonics.</p>

Earth and Moon impact flux increased at the end of the Paleozoic
<p>The terrestrial impact crater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong> is commonly assumed to be biased, with erosion thought to eliminate older craters, even on stable terrains. Given that the same projectile population strikes Earth and the Moon, terrestrial selection effects can be quantified by using a method to date lunar craters with diameters greater than 10 kilometers and younger than 1 billion years. We found that the impact rate increased by a factor of 2.6 about 290 million years ago. The terrestrial crater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong> shows similar results, suggesting that the deficit of large terrestrial craters between 300 million and 650 million years ago relative to more recent times stems from a lower impact flux, not preservation bias. The almost complete absence of terrestrial craters older than 650 million years may indicate a massive global-scale erosion event near that time.</p>

A 90,000-year record of Afromontane forest responses to climate change
<p>Pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>s from African highlands are scarce; hence, the paleoecology of the Afromontane forest and its responses to glacial cycles are poorly known.

Pollen data and biome reconstructions show a diverging response of forests to climate changes; the upper tree line was extremely unstable, shifting substantially in response to glacial-interglacial climate alternation, whereas the transition between the montane and lowland forests remained remarkably stable. Such ecological instability may have had a critical influence on species richness in the Afromontane forests.</p>

The effect of these changes on animal survival is evaluated using the Metabolic Index (Φ), a measure of scope for aerobic activity governed by organismal traits sampled in diverse modern species. Modeled loss of aerobic habitat predicts lower extinction intensity in the tropics, a pattern confirmed with a spatially explicit analysis of the marine fossil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>. The combined physiological stresses of ocean warming and O<sub>2</sub> loss can account for more than half the magnitude of the “Great Dying.”</p>

Efficient cortical coding of 3D posture in freely behaving rats

Ancient steroids establish the Ediacaran fossil <i>Dickinsonia</i> as one of the earliest animals

Large-scale ocean deoxygenation during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum

Using this proxy, we derived a 550,000-year-long <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong> of East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) rainfall from Chinese loess. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong> is forced at orbital precession frequencies, with higher rainfall observed during Northern Hemisphere summer insolation maxima, although this response is damped during cold interstadials. The <sup>10</sup>Be monsoon rainfall proxy is also highly correlated with global ice-volume variations, which differs from Chinese cave δ<sup>18</sup>O, which is only weakly correlated. We argue that both EASM intensity and Chinese cave δ<sup>18</sup>O are not governed by high-northern-latitude insolation, as suggested by others, but rather by low-latitude interhemispheric insolation gradients, which may also strongly influence global ice volume via monsoon dynamics.</p>

Learning-enhanced coupling between ripple oscillations in association cortices and hippocampus
<p>Consolidation of declarative memories requires hippocampal-neocortical communication. Although experimental evidence supports the role of sharp-wave ripples in transferring hippocampal information to the neocortex, the exact cortical destinations and the physiological mechanisms of such transfer are not known. We used a conducting polymer-based conformable microelectrode array (NeuroGrid) to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong> local field potentials and neural spiking across the dorsal cortical surface of the rat brain, combined with silicon probe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ings in the hippocampus, to identify candidate physiological patterns. Parietal, midline, and prefrontal, but not primary cortical areas, displayed localized ripple (100 to 150 hertz) oscillations during sleep, concurrent with hippocampal ripples. Coupling between hippocampal and neocortical ripples was strengthened during sleep following learning. These findings suggest that ripple-ripple coupling supports hippocampal-association cortical transfer of memory traces.</p>

The Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 early science investigations of regional carbon dioxide fluxes
<p>NASA’s Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) mission was motivated by the need to diagnose how the increasing concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is altering the productivity of the biosphere and the uptake of CO<sub>2</sub> by the oceans. Launched on 2 July 2014, OCO-2 provides retrievals of the column-averaged CO<sub>2</sub> dry-air mole fraction ([Formula]) as well as the fluorescence from chlorophyll in terrestrial plants. The seasonal pattern of uptake by the terrestrial biosphere is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ed in fluorescence and the drawdown of [Formula] during summer.

Structure Annotation and Quantification of Wheat Seed Oxidized Lipids by High-Resolution LC-MS/MS
<p>Lipid oxidation is a process ubiquitous in life, but the direct and comprehensive analysis of oxidized lipids has been limited by available analytical methods. We applied high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to quantify oxidized lipids (glycerides, fatty acids, phospholipids, lysophospholipids, and galactolipids) and implemented a platform-independent high-throughput-amenable analysis pipeline for the high-confidence annotation and acyl composition analysis of oxidized lipids. Lipid contents of 90 different naturally aged wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) seed stocks were quantified in an untargeted high-resolution LC-MS experiment, resulting in 18,556 quantitative mass-to-charge ratio features. In a posthoc liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry experiment, high-resolution MS/MS spectra (5 mD accuracy) were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ed for 8,957 out of 12,080 putatively monoisotopic features of the LC-MS data set. A total of 353 nonoxidized and 559 oxidized lipids with up to four additional oxygen atoms were annotated based on the accurate mass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ings (1.5 ppm tolerance) of the LC-MS data set and filtering procedures. MS/MS spectra available for 828 of these annotations were analyzed by translating experimentally known fragmentation rules of lipids into the fragmentation of oxidized lipids. This led to the identification of 259 nonoxidized and 365 oxidized lipids by both accurate mass and MS/MS spectra and to the determination of acyl compositions for 221 nonoxidized and 295 oxidized lipids. Analysis of 15-year aged wheat seeds revealed increased lipid oxidation and hydrolysis in seeds stored in ambient versus cold conditions.</p>

Vocal production complexity correlates with neural instructions in the oyster toadfish (<i>Opsanus tau</i>)
<p>Sound communication is fundamental to many social interactions and essential to courtship and agonistic behaviours in many vertebrates. The swimbladder and associated muscles in batrachoidid fishes (midshipman and toadfish) is a unique vertebrate sound production system, wherein fundamental frequencies are determined directly by the firing rate of a vocal-acoustic neural network that drives the contraction frequency of superfast swimbladder muscles. The oyster toadfish boatwhistle call starts with an irregular sound waveform that could be an emergent property of the peripheral nonlinear sound-producing system or reflect complex encoding in the central nervous system. Here, we demonstrate that the start of the boatwhistle is indicative of a chaotic strange attractor, and tested whether its origin lies in the peripheral sound-producing system or in the vocal motor network. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ed sound and swimbladder muscle activity in awake, freely behaving toadfish during motor nerve stimulation, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ed sound, motor nerve and muscle activity during spontaneous grunts. The results show that rhythmic motor volleys do not cause complex sound signals. However, arrhythmic recruitment of swimbladder muscle during spontaneous grunts correlates with complex sounds. This supports the hypothesis that the irregular start of the boatwhistle is encoded in the vocal pre-motor neural network, and not caused by peripheral interactions with the sound-producing system. We suggest that sound production system demands across vocal tetrapods have selected for muscles and motorneurons adapted for speed, which can execute complex neural instructions into equivalently complex vocalisations.</p>

Multimodal infiltration of local anaesthetic in total knee arthroplasty; is posterior capsular infiltration worth the risk?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Multimodal infiltration of local anaesthetic provides effective   control of pain in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA).   There is little information about the added benefits of posterior   capsular infiltration (PCI) using different combinations of local   anaesthetic agents. Our aim was to investigate the effectiveness   of the control of pain using multimodal infiltration with and without   infiltration of the posterior capsule of the knee.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>In a double-blind, randomised controlled trial of patients scheduled   for unilateral primary TKA, 86 were assigned to be treated with   multimodal infiltration with (Group I) or without (Group II) PCI.   Routine associated analgesia included the use of bupivacaine, morphine,   ketorolac and epinephrine. All patients had spinal anaesthesia and patient-controlled   analgesia (PCA) post-operatively. A visual analogue scale (VAS)   for pain and the use of morphine were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ed 24 hours post-operatively.

Atrial Fibrillation Burden in Young Patients With Congenital Heart Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) are assumed to be vulnerable to atrial fibrillation (AF) as a result of residual shunts, anomalous vessel anatomy, progressive valvulopathy, hypertension, and atrial scars from previous heart surgery. However, the risk of developing AF and the complications associated with AF in children and young adults with CHD have not been compared with those in control subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data from the Swedish Patient and Cause of Death registers were used to identify all patients with a diagnosis of CHD who were born from 1970 to 1993. Each patient with CHD was matched by birth year, sex, and county with 10 control subjects from the Total Population Register in Sweden. Follow-up data were collected until 2011.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 21 982 patients (51.6% men) with CHD and 219 816 matched control subjects, 654 and 328 developed AF, respectively.

Risk Factors of Sudden Cardiac Death in the Young
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Prevention of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) in the young remains a largely unsolved public health problem, and sports activity is an established trigger. Although the presence of standard cardiovascular risk factors in the young can link to future morbidity and mortality in adulthood, the potential contribution of these risk factors to SCA in the young has not been evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We prospectively ascertained subjects who experienced SCA between the ages of 5 and 34 years in the Portland, Oregon, metropolitan area (2002–2015, catchment population ≈1 million). We assessed the circumstances, resuscitation outcomes, and clinical profile of subjects who had SCA by a detailed evaluation of emergency response <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>s, lifetime clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>s, and autopsy examinations. We specifically evaluated the association of standard cardiovascular risk factors and SCA, and sports as a trigger for SCA in the young.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 3775 SCAs in all age groups, 186 (5%) occurred in the young (mean age 25.9±6.8, 67% male). In SCA in the young, overall prevalence of warning signs before SCA was low (29%), and 26 (14%) were associated with sports as a trigger. The remainder (n=160) occurred in other settings categorized as nonsports. Sports-related SCAs accounted for 39% of SCAs in patients aged ≤18, 13% of SCAs in patients aged 19 to 25, and 7% of SCAs in patients aged 25 to 34. Sports-related SCA cases were more likely to present with shockable rhythms, and survival from cardiac arrest was 2.5-fold higher in sports-related versus nonsports SCA (28% versus 11%; <i>P</i>=0.05). Overall, the most common SCA-related conditions were sudden arrhythmic death syndrome (31%), coronary artery disease (22%), and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (14%). There was an unexpectedly high overall prevalence of established cardiovascular risk factors (obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking) with ≥1 risk factors in 58% of SCA cases.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Sports was a trigger of SCA in a minority of cases, and, in most patients, SCA occurred without warning symptoms.

Systolic Blood Pressure Trajectory, Frailty, and All-Cause Mortality >80 Years of Age
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Clinical trials show benefit from lowering systolic blood pressure (SBP) in people ≥80 years of age, but nonrandomized epidemiological studies suggest lower SBP may be associated with higher mortality. This study aimed to evaluate associations of SBP with all-cause mortality by frailty category >80 years of age and to evaluate SBP trajectories before death.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A population-based cohort study was conducted using electronic health <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>s of 144 403 participants ≥80 years of age registered with family practices in the United Kingdom from 2001 to 2014. Participants were followed for ≤5 years. Clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>s of SBP were analyzed. Frailty status was classified using the e-Frailty Index into the categories of fit, mild, moderate, and severe. All-cause mortality was evaluated by frailty status and mean SBP in Cox proportional-hazards models. SBP trajectories were evaluated using person months as observations, with mean SBP and antihypertensive treatment status estimated for each person month. Fractional polynomial models were used to estimate SBP trajectories over 5 years before death.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>During follow-up, 51 808 deaths occurred. Mortality rates increased with frailty level and were greatest at SBP <110 mm Hg. In fit women, mortality was 7.7 per 100 person years at SBP 120 to 139 mm Hg, 15.2 at SBP 110 to 119 mm Hg, and 22.7 at SBP <110 mm Hg. For women with severe frailty, rates were 16.8, 25.2, and 39.6, respectively. SBP trajectories showed an accelerated decline in the last 2 years of life. The relative odds of SBP <120 mm Hg were higher in the last 3 months of life than 5 years previously in both treated (odds ratio, 6.06; 95% confidence interval, 5.40–6.81) and untreated (odds ratio, 6.31; 95% confidence interval, 5.30–7.52) patients. There was no evidence of intensification of antihypertensive therapy in the final 2 years of life.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>A terminal decline of SBP in the final 2 years of life suggests that nonrandomized epidemiological associations of low SBP with higher mortality may be accounted for by reverse causation if participants with lower blood pressure values are closer, on average, to the end of life.</p></sec>

Clinical Implications of Brief Device-Detected Atrial Tachyarrhythmias in a Cardiac Rhythm Management Device Population
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The RATE Registry (Registry of Atrial Tachycardia and Atrial Fibrillation Episodes) is a prospective, outcomes-oriented registry designed to document the prevalence of atrial tachycardia and/or fibrillation (AT/AF) of any duration in patients with pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) and evaluate associations between rigorously adjudicated AT/AF and predefined clinical events, including stroke. The appropriate clinical response to brief episodes of AT/AF remains unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Rigorously adjudicated electrogram (EGM) data were correlated with adjudicated clinical events with logistic regression and Cox models. <i>Long episodes of AT/AF</i> were defined as episodes in which the onset and/or offset of AT/AF was not present within a single EGM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ing. <i>Short episodes of AT/AF</i> were defined as episodes in which both the onset and offset of AT/AF were present within a single EGM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ing.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We enrolled 5379 patients with pacemakers (N=3141) or ICDs (N=2238) at 225 US sites (median follow-up 22.9 months). There were 359 deaths. There were 478 hospitalizations among 342 patients for clinical events. We adjudicated 37 531 EGMs; 50% of patients had at least one episode of AT/AF. Patients with clinical events were more likely than those without to have long AT/AF (31.9% vs. 22.1% for pacemaker patients and 28.7% vs. 20.2% for ICD patients; <i>P</i><0.05 for both groups). Only short episodes of AT/AF were documented in 9% of pacemaker patients and 16% of ICD patients.

Duration of Ventilations During Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation by Lay Rescuers and First Responders
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>The 2010 guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation allow 5 seconds to give 2 breaths to deliver sufficient chest compressions and to keep perfusion pressure high. This study aims to determine whether the recommended short interruption for ventilations by trained lay rescuers and first responders can be achieved and to evaluate its consequence for chest compressions and survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>From a prospective data collection of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, we used automatic external defibrillator <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ings of cardiopulmonary resuscitation by rescuers who had received a standard European Resuscitation Council basic life support and automatic external defibrillator course. Ventilation periods and total compressions delivered per minute during each 2 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation cycle were measured, and the chest compression fraction was calculated. Neurological intact survival to discharge was studied in relation to these factors and covariates. We included 199 automatic external defibrillator <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ings. The median interruption time for 2 ventilations was 7 seconds (25th–75th percentile, 6–9 seconds). Of all rescuers, 21% took <5 seconds and 83% took <10 seconds for a ventilation period; 97%, 88%, and 63% of rescuers were able to deliver >60, >70, and >80 chest compressions per minute, respectively. The median chest compression fraction was 65% (25th–75th percentile, 59%–71%). Survival was 25% (49 of 199), not associated with long or short ventilation pauses when controlled for covariates.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>The great majority of rescuers can give 2 rescue breaths in <10 seconds and deliver at least 70 compressions in a minute. Longer pauses for ventilations are not associated with worse outcome. Guidelines may allow longer pauses for ventilations with no detriment to survival.</p></sec>

Long-Term Survival of Patients With Radiation Heart Disease Undergoing Cardiac Surgery
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Thoracic radiation results in radiation-associated heart disease (RAHD), often requiring cardiothoracic surgery (CTS). We sought to measure long-term survival in RAHD patients undergoing CTS, to compare them with a matched control population undergoing similar surgical procedures, and to identify potential predictors of long-term survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>In this retrospective observational cohort study of patients undergoing CTS, matched on the basis of age, sex, and type/time of CTS, 173 RAHD patients (75% women; age, 63±14 years) and 305 comparison patients (74% women; age, 63±4 years) were included. The vast majority of RAHD patients had prior breast cancer (53%) and Hodgkin lymphoma (27%), and the mean time from radiation was 18±12 years. Clinical and surgical parameters were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ed. The preoperative EuroSCORE and all-cause mortality were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ed. The mean EuroSCOREs were similar in the RAHD and comparison groups (7.8±3 versus 7.4±3, respectively; <i>P</i>=0.1). Proximal coronary artery disease was higher in patients with RAHD versus the comparison patients (45% versus 38%; <i>P</i>=0.09), whereas redo CTS was lower in the RACD versus the comparison group (20% versus 29%; <i>P</i>=0.02). About two thirds of patients in either group had combination surgical procedures. During a mean follow-up of 7.6±3 years, a significantly higher proportion of patients died in the RAHD group than in the comparison group (55% versus 28%; <i>P</i><0.001). On multivariable Cox proportional hazard analysis, RAHD (2.47; 95% confidence interval, 1.82–3.36), increasing EuroSCORE (1.22; 95% confidence interval, 1.16–1.29), and lack of β-blockers (0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.47–0.93) were associated with increased mortality (all <i>P</i><0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>In patients undergoing CTS, RAHD portends increased long-term mortality. Alternative treatment strategies may be required in RAHD to improve long-term survival.</p></sec>

Post-operative outcomes of atypical femoral subtrochanteric fracture in patients on bisphosphonate therapy
<p>Management of bisphosphonate-associated subtrochanteric   fractures remains opinion- or consensus-based. There are limited   data regarding the outcomes of this fracture.</p><p>We retrospectively reviewed 33 consecutive female patients with   a mean age of 67.5 years (47 to 91) who were treated surgically   between May 2004 and October 2009. The mean follow-up was 21.7 months   (0 to 53). Medical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>s and radiographs were reviewed to determine   the post-operative ambulatory status, time to clinical and radiological   union and post-fixation complications such as implant failure and   need for second surgery. </p><p>The predominant fixation method was with an extramedullary device   in 23 patients. 25 (75%) patients were placed on wheelchair mobilisation   or no weight-bearing initially. The mean time to full weight-bearing   was 7.1 months (2.2 to 29.7). The mean time for fracture site pain   to cease was 6.2 months (1.2 to 17.1). The mean time to radiological   union was 10.0 months (2.2 to 27.5). Implant failure was seen in   seven patients (23%, 95 confidence interval (CI) 11.8 to 40.9).

A new morphological classification for greater tuberosity fractures of the proximal humerus
<p>In this study, we describe a morphological classification   for greater tuberosity fractures of the proximal humerus. We divided   these fractures into three types: avulsion, split and depression.   We retrospectively reviewed all shoulder radiographs showing isolated   greater tuberosity fractures in a Level I trauma centre between   July 2007 and July 2012. We identified 199 cases where <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>s and   radiographs were reviewed and included 79 men and 120 women with   a mean age of 58 years (23 to 96). The morphological classification   was applied to the first 139 cases by three reviewers on two occasions   using the Kappa statistic and compared with the AO and Neer classifications.   The inter- and intra-observer reliability of the morphological classification   was 0.73 to 0.77 and 0.69 to 0.86, respectively. This was superior   to the Neer (0.31 to 0.35/0.54 to 0.63) and AO (0.30 to 0.32/0.59   to 0.65) classifications. The distribution of avulsion, split and   depression type fractures was 39%, 41%, and 20%, respectively. This   classification of greater tuberosity fractures is more reliable   than the Neer or AO classifications. These distinct fracture morphologies   are likely to have implications in terms of pathophysiology and   surgical technique.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014;96-B:646–51.</p>

Does a less intensive surveillance protocol affect the survival of patients after treatment of a sarcoma of the limb?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>A single-centre prospective randomized trial was conducted to   investigate whether a less intensive follow-up protocol would not   be inferior to a conventional follow-up protocol, in terms of overall   survival, in patients who have undergone surgery for sarcoma of   the limb. Initial short-term results were published in 2014.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The primary objective was to show non-inferiority of a chest   radiograph (CXR) group compared with a CT scan group, and of a less   frequent (six-monthly) group than a more frequent (three-monthly)   group, in two-by-two comparison. The primary outcome was overall   survival and the secondary outcome was a recurrence-free survival.   Five-year survival was compared between the CXR and CT scan groups   and between the three-monthly and six-monthly groups. Of 500 patients   who were enrolled, 476 were available for follow-up. Survival analyses   were performed on a per-protocol basis (n = 412).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The updated results <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ed 12 (2.4%) local recurrences, 182   (36.8%) metastases, and 56 (11.3%) combined (local + metastases)   recurrence at a median follow-up of 81 months (60 to 118). Of 68   local recurrences, 60 (88%) were identified by the patients themselves.   The six-monthly regime (overall survival (OS) 54%, recurrence-free   survival (RFS) 46%) did not lead to a worse survival and was not   inferior to the three-monthly regime (OS 55%, RFS 47%) in terms   of detecting recurrence. Although CT scans (OS 53%, RFS 54%) detected   pulmonary metastasis earlier, it did not lead to a better survival   compared with CXR (OS 56%, RFS 59%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The overall survival of patients who are treated for a sarcoma   of the limb is not inferior to those followed up with a less intensive   regimen than a more intensive protocol, in terms of frequency of   visits and mode of imaging. CXR at six-monthly intervals and patient   education about examination of the site of the surgery will detect   most recurrences without deleterious effects on the eventual outcome.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:262–8.</p></sec>

The outpatient total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To examine incidence of complications associated with outpatient   total hip arthroplasty (THA), and to see if medical comorbidities   are associated with complications or extended length of stay.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>From June 2013 to December 2016, 1279 patients underwent 1472   outpatient THAs at our free-standing ambulatory surgery centre.   Records were reviewed to determine frequency of pre-operative medical   comorbidities and post-operative need for overnight stay and complications   which arose.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In 87 procedures, the patient stayed overnight for 23-hour observation,   with 39 for convenience reasons and 48 (3.3%) for medical observation,   most frequently urinary retention (13), obstructive sleep apnoea   (nine), emesis (four), hypoxia (four), and pain management (six).   Five patients (0.3%) experienced major complications within 48 hours,   including three transferred to an acute facility; there was one   death. Overall complication rate requiring unplanned care was 2.2%   (32/1472). One or more major comorbidities were present in 647 patients   (44%), including previous coronary artery disease (CAD; 50), valvular   disease (nine), arrhythmia (219), thromboembolism history (28), obstructive   sleep apnoea (171), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD;   124), asthma (118), frequent urination or benign prostatic hypertrophy   (BPH; 217), or mild chronic renal insufficiency (11).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The presence of these comorbidities was not associated with medical   or surgical complications. However, presence of one or more major   comorbidity was associated with an increased risk of overnight observation.   Specific comorbidities associated with increased risk were CAD,   COPD, and frequent urination/BPH.

Delays in the diagnosis and treatment of bone and joint tuberculosis in the United Kingdom
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Tuberculosis (TB) infection of bones and joints accounts for   6.7% of TB cases in England, and is associated with significant   morbidity and disability. Public Health England reports that patients   with TB experience delays in diagnosis and treatment. Our aims were   to determine the demographics, presentation and investigation of   patients with a TB infection of bones and joints, to help doctors   assessing potential cases and to identify avoidable delays.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This was a retrospective observational study of all adults with   positive TB cultures on specimens taken at a tertiary orthopaedic   centre between June 2012 and May 2014. A laboratory information   system search identified the patients. The demographics, clinical presentation,   radiology, histopathology and key clinical dates were obtained from   medical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 31 adult patients were identified. Their median age   was 37 years (interquartile range (IQR): 29 to 53); 21 (68%) were   male; 89% were migrants. The main sites affected were joints (10,   32%), the spine (8, 26%) and long bones (6, 19%); 8 (26%) had multifocal   disease. The most common presenting symptoms were pain (29/31, 94%)   and swelling (26/28, 93%). ‘Typical’ symptoms of TB, such as fever,   sweats and weight loss, were uncommon. Patients waited a median   of seven months (IQR 3 to 13.5) between the onset of symptoms and referral   to the tertiary centre and 2.3 months (IQR 1.6 to 3.4.)) between   referral and starting treatment. Radiology suggested TB in 26 (84%),   but in seven patients (23%) the initial biopsy specimens were not   sent for mycobacterial culture, necessitating a second biopsy. Rapid   Polymerase Chain Reaction-based testing for TB using Xpert MTB/RIF   was performed in five patients; 4 (80%) tested positive for TB.   These patients had a reduced time between the diagnostic biopsy and   starting treatment than those whose samples were not tested (median   eight days <i>versus</i> 36 days, p = 0.016).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Patients with bone and joint TB experience delays in diagnosis   and treatment, some of which are avoidable. Maintaining a high index   of clinical suspicion and sending specimens for mycobacterial culture   are crucial to avoid missing cases.

Evaluation of Codon Biology in <i>Citrus</i> and <i>Poncirus trifoliata</i> Based on Genomic Features and Frame Corrected Expressed Sequence Tags
<p><i>Citrus</i>, as one of the globally important fruit trees, has been an object of interest for understanding genetics and evolutionary process in fruit crops. Meta-analyses of 19 <i>Citrus</i> species, including 4 globally and economically important <i>Citrus sinensis</i>, <i>Citrus clementina</i>, <i>Citrus reticulata</i>, and 1 <i>Citrus</i> relative <i>Poncirus trifoliata</i>, were performed. We observed that codons ending with A- or T- at the wobble position were preferred in contrast to C- or G- ending codons, indicating a close association with AT richness of <i>Citrus</i> species and <i>P. trifoliata</i>. The present study postulates a large repertoire of a set of optimal codons for the <i>Citrus</i> genus and <i>P. trifoliata</i> and demonstrates that GCT and GGT are evolutionary conserved optimal codons. Our observation suggested that mutational bias is the dominating force in shaping the codon usage bias (CUB) in <i>Citrus</i> and <i>P. trifoliata</i>. Correspondence analysis (COA) revealed that the principal axis [axis 1; COA/relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU)] contributes only a minor portion (∼10.96%) of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong>ed variance. In all analysed species, except <i>P. trifoliata</i>, Gravy and aromaticity played minor roles in resolving CUB. Compositional constraints were found to be strongly associated with the amino acid signatures in <i>Citrus</i> species and <i>P. trifoliata</i>. Our present analysis postulates compositional constraints in <i>Citrus</i> species and <i>P. trifoliata</i> and plausible role of the stress with GC<sub>3</sub> and coevolution pattern of amino acid.</p>

ChloroMitoSSRDB: Open Source Repository of Perfect and Imperfect Repeats in Organelle Genomes for Evolutionary Genomics
<p>Microsatellites or simple sequence repeats (SSRs) are repetitive stretches of nucleotides (A, T, G, C) that are distributed either as single base pair stretches or as a combination of two- to six-nucleotides units that are non-randomly distributed within coding and in non-coding regions of the genome. ChloroMitoSSRDB is a complete curated web-oriented relational database of perfect and imperfect repeats in organelle genomes. The present version of the database contains perfect and imperfect SSRs of 2161 organelle genomes (1982 mitochondrial and 179 chloroplast genomes). We detected a total of 5838 chloroplast perfect SSRs, 37 297 chloroplast imperfect SSRs, 5898 mitochondrial perfect SSRs and 50 355 mitochondrial imperfect SSRs across these genomes. The repeats have been further hyperlinked to the annotated gene regions (coding or non-coding) and a link to the corresponding gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">record</span></strong> in National Center for Biotechnology Information(<ext-link>www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link>) to identify and understand the positional relationship of the repetitive tracts. ChloroMitoSSRDB is connected to a user-friendly web interface that provides useful information associated with the location of the repeats (coding and non-coding), size of repeat, motif and length polymorphism, etc. ChloroMitoSSRDB will serve as a repository for developing functional markers for molecular phylogenetics, estimating molecular variation across species. Database URL: ChloroMitoSSRDB can be accessed as an open source repository at <ext-link>www.mcr.org.in/chloromitossrdb</ext-link>.</p>

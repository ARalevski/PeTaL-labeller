Carbon dynamics of <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> seedlings under drought and complete darkness
<p>Carbon (C) storage is considered a key component to plant survival under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> and shade, although the combined effects of these factors on survival remain poorly understood. We investigated how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> and shade alter the C dynamics and survival of tree seedlings, and whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> limits the access to or usage of stored C. We experimentally applied two levels of soil humidity (well-watered versus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>, the latter induced by dry-down) and light availability (light versus complete darkness) on 1-year-old seedlings of <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> L. for 3 months. We quantified the survival, biomass, growth rate and non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) of seedlings at their time of death or at the end of the experiment for those that survived. We found that the soil dried out faster when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> was combined with light than when it was combined with complete darkness. Seedlings subjected to both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> and light showed reduced growth and reached 100% mortality earlier than any other treatment, with the highest NSC concentrations at the time of death. Seedlings exposed to both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> and complete darkness died significantly earlier than seedlings exposed to complete darkness only, but had similar NSC concentrations at time of their death, suggesting that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> accelerated the use of stored C under complete darkness. Complete darkness significantly reduced seedling growth and whole-plant NSC concentrations regardless of soil humidity, while root NSC concentrations were significantly more reduced when complete darkness was combined with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> conditions. Thus, the C dynamics in <i>A. pseudoplatanus</i> seedlings under complete darkness was not hindered by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>, i.e., the access and use of stored C was not limited by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>. The contrasting growth and C storage responses driven by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> under light versus complete darkness are consistent with a key role of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> progression in the C dynamics of trees.</p>

Natural Variation in <i>OsLG3</i> Increases Drought Tolerance in Rice by Inducing ROS Scavenging
<p>Improving the performance of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress has the potential to significantly affect rice productivity. Here, we report that the ERF family transcription factor OsLG3 positively regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerance in rice. In our previous work, we found that <i>OsLG3</i> has a positive effect on rice grain length without affecting grain quality. In this study, we found that <i>OsLG3</i> was more strongly expressed in upland rice than in lowland rice under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress conditions. By performing candidate gene association analysis, we found that natural variation in the promoter of <i>OsLG3</i> is associated with tolerance to osmotic stress in germinating rice seeds. Overexpression of <i>OsLG3</i> significantly improved the tolerance of rice plants to simulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>, whereas suppression of <i>OsLG3</i> resulted in greater susceptibility. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the tolerant allele of <i>OsLG3</i> may improve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerance in cultivated <i>japonica</i> rice. Introgression lines and complementation transgenic lines containing the elite allele of <i>OsLG3</i><sup>IRAT109</sup> showed increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerance, demonstrating that natural variation in <i>OsLG3</i> contributes to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerance in rice. Further investigation suggested that <i>OsLG3</i> plays a positive role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress tolerance in rice by inducing reactive oxygen species scavenging. Collectively, our findings reveal that natural variation in <i>OsLG3</i> contributes to rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerance and that the elite allele of <i>OsLG3</i> is a promising genetic resource for the development of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-tolerant rice varieties.</p>

The Arabidopsis DNA Methylome Is Stable under Transgenerational Drought Stress
<p>Improving the responsiveness, acclimation, and memory of plants to abiotic stress holds substantive potential for improving agriculture. An unresolved question is the involvement of chromatin marks in the memory of agriculturally relevant stresses. Such potential has spurred numerous investigations yielding both promising and conflicting results. Consequently, it remains unclear to what extent robust stress-induced DNA methylation variation can underpin stress memory. Using a slow-onset water deprivation treatment in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), we investigated the malleability of the DNA methylome to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress within a generation and under repeated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress over five successive generations. While <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-associated epi-alleles in the methylome were detected within a generation, they did not correlate with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-responsive gene expression. Six traits were analyzed for transgenerational stress memory, and the descendants of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-stressed lineages showed one case of memory in the form of increased seed dormancy, and that persisted one generation removed from stress. With respect to transgenerational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress, there were negligible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed differentially methylated regions in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-exposed lineages compared with unstressed lineages. Instead, the majority of observed variation was tied to stochastic or preexisting differences in the epigenome occurring at repetitive regions of the Arabidopsis genome. Furthermore, the experience of repeated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress was not observed to influence transgenerational epi-allele accumulation. Our findings demonstrate that, while transgenerational memory is observed in one of six traits examined, they are not associated with causative changes in the DNA methylome, which appears relatively impervious to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress.</p>

The Accumulation of miRNAs Differentially Modulated by Drought Stress Is Affected by Grafting in Grapevine
<p>Grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) is routinely grafted, and rootstocks inducing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerance represent a source for adapting vineyards to climate change in temperate areas. Our goal was to investigate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress effects on microRNA (miRNA) abundance in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-resistant grapevine rootstock, M4 (<i>Vitis vinifera</i> Ã— <i>Vitis berlandieri</i>), compared with a commercial cultivar, Cabernet Sauvignon, using their autografts and reciprocal grafts. RNA extracted from roots and leaves of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>ed and irrigated plants of different graft combinations was used to prepare cDNA libraries for small RNA sequencing and to analyze miRNAs by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Measurements of leaf water potential, leaf gas exchange, and root hydraulic conductance attested that, under irrigation, M4 reduced water loss in comparison with cultivar Cabernet Sauvignon mostly through nonhydraulic, root-specific mechanisms. Under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>, stomatal conductance decreased at similar levels in the two genotypes. Small RNA sequencing allowed the identification of 70 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed miRNAs and the prediction of 28 novel miRNAs. Different accumulation trends of miRNAs, observed upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> and in different genotypes and organs, were confirmed by RT-qPCR. Corresponding target transcripts, predicted in silico and validated by RT-qPCR, often showed opposite expression profiles than the related miRNAs. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> effects on miRNA abundance differed between the two genotypes. Furthermore, the concentration of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-responsive miRNAs in each genotype was affected by reciprocal grafting, suggesting either the movement of signals inducing miRNA expression in the graft partner or, possibly, miRNA transport between scion and rootstock. These results open new perspectives in the selection of rootstocks for improving grapevine adaptation to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>.</p>

Dead or Alive? Using Membrane Failure and Chlorophyll <i>a</i> Fluorescence to Predict Plant Mortality from Drought
<p>Climate models predict widespread increases in both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> intensity and duration in the next decades. Although water deficiency is a significant determinant of plant survival, limited understanding of plant responses to extreme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> impedes forecasts of both forest and crop productivity under increasing aridity. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> induces a suite of physiological responses; however, we lack an accurate mechanistic description of plant response to lethal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> that would improve predictive understanding of mortality under altered climate conditions. Here, proxies for leaf cellular damage, chlorophyll <i>a</i> fluorescence, and electrolyte leakage were directly associated with failure to recover from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> upon rewatering in <i>Brassica</i> <i>rapa</i> (genotype R500) and thus define the exact timing of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-induced death. We validated our results using a second genotype (imb211) that differs substantially in life history traits. Our study demonstrates that whereas changes in carbon dynamics and water transport are critical indicators of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress, they can be unrelated to visible metrics of mortality, i.e. lack of meristematic activity and regrowth. In contrast, membrane failure at the cellular scale is the most proximate cause of death. This hypothesis was corroborated in two gymnosperms (<i>Picea engelmannii</i> and <i>Pinus contorta</i>) that experienced lethal water stress in the field and in laboratory conditions. We suggest that measurement of chlorophyll <i>a</i> fluorescence can be used to operationally define plant death arising from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>, and improved plant characterization can enhance surface model predictions of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> mortality and its consequences to ecosystem services at a global scale.</p>

MdMYB88 and MdMYB124 Enhance Drought Tolerance by Modulating Root Vessels and Cell Walls in Apple
<p>Water deficit is one of the main limiting factors in apple (<i>Malus</i> Ã— <i>domestica</i> Borkh.) cultivation. Root architecture plays an important role in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerance of plants; however, research efforts to improve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerance of apple trees have focused on aboveground targets. Due to the difficulties associated with visualization and data analysis, there is currently a poor understanding of the genetic players and molecular mechanisms involved in the root architecture of apple trees under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> conditions. We previously observed that MdMYB88 and its paralog MdMYB124 regulate apple tree root morphology. In this study, we found that MdMYB88 and MdMYB124 play important roles in maintaining root hydraulic conductivity under long-term <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> conditions and therefore contribute toward adaptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerance. Further investigation revealed that MdMYB88 and MdMYB124 regulate root xylem development by directly binding <i>MdVND6</i> and <i>MdMYB46</i> promoters and thus influence expression of their target genes under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> conditions. In addition, MdMYB88 and MdMYB124 were shown to regulate the deposition of cellulose and lignin root cell walls in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>. Taken together, our results provide novel insights into the importance of MdMYB88 and MdMYB124 in root architecture, root xylem development, and secondary cell wall deposition in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> in apple trees.</p>

Giberellic Acid-Stimulated Transcript Proteins Evolved through Successive Conjugation of Novel Motifs and Their Subfunctionalization
<p><i>Gibberellic Acid Stimulated Transcript</i> (<i>GAST</i>)-like genes encode small polypeptides, some of which have been implicated in diverse biological processes regulating plant growth and development. However, the occurrence of GASTs among plants, their protein structures, and the mechanisms by which they evolved remain elusive. Here, using a customized workflow, we report genes encoding GAST proteins, identify novel motifs and evolutionary patterns contributing to the subfunctionalization of GAST domains, and explore functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation across diverse plant groups. We show that <i>GAST</i>-like sequences evolved initially in the vascular plant <i>Selaginella moellendorffii</i>, after the divergence from bryophytes, and later emerged in gymnosperms and angiosperms. GASTs in angiosperms are characterized by four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed novel motifs; however, relatively fewer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed motifs exist in pteridophytes and gymnosperms. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the GAST-Cysteine Rich1 motif evolved early in the <i>S. moellendorffii</i> GAST, which further acquired subfunctionalization through successive conjugation of other motifs and remained <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed across plants, as supported by their collinearity. Functional characterization of two orthologs from the dicot Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>; <i>Gibberellic Acid-Stimulated Arabidopsis 10</i>) and the monocot rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>; <i>Gibberellic Acid Stimulated Transcript-Related 9</i>) suggests hormonal regulation, novel roles in seed germination, and functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation among diverse plant groups. Computational modeling predicts that these <i>GAST</i> genes are regulated by several factors, including the phytohormones gibberellin and abscisic acid, through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed cis-motifs present in their promoters, and that they might act as signaling molecules in a complex feedback loop. Thus, our study identifies <i>GAST</i>s and their encoded proteins, uncovers their structure, novel motifs, and evolutionary pattern among plants, and suggests their functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation.</p>

SIAMESE-RELATED1 Is Regulated Posttranslationally and Participates in Repression of Leaf Growth under Moderate Drought
<p>The plant cell cycle is tightly regulated by factors that integrate endogenous cues and environmental signals to adapt plant growth to changing conditions. Under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>, cell division in young leaves is blocked by an active mechanism, reducing the evaporative surface and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ing energy resources. The molecular function of cyclin-dependent kinase-inhibitory proteins (CKIs) in regulating the cell cycle has already been well studied, but little is known about their involvement in cell cycle regulation under adverse growth conditions. In this study, we show that the transcript of the CKI gene <i>SIAMESE-RELATED1</i> (<i>SMR1</i>) is quickly induced under moderate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> in young Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves. Functional characterization further revealed that SMR1 inhibits cell division and affects meristem activity, thereby restricting the growth of leaves and roots. Moreover, we demonstrate that SMR1 is a short-lived protein that is degraded by the 26S proteasome after being ubiquitinated by a Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase. Consequently, overexpression of a more stable variant of the SMR1 protein leads to a much stronger phenotype than overexpression of the native SMR1. Under moderate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>, both the <i>SMR1</i> transcript and SMR1 protein accumulate. Despite this induction, <i>smr1</i> mutants do not show overall tolerance to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress but do show less growth inhibition of young leaves under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>. Surprisingly, the growth-repressive hormone ethylene promotes <i>SMR1</i> induction, but the classical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> hormone abscisic acid does not.</p>

Mechanical Failure of Fine Root Cortical Cells Initiates Plant Hydraulic Decline during Drought
<p>Root systems perform the crucial task of absorbing water from the soil to meet the demands of a transpiring canopy. Roots are thought to operate like electrical fuses, which break when carrying an excessive load under conditions of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress. Yet the exact site and sequence of this dysfunction in roots remain elusive. Using in vivo x-ray computed microtomography, we found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-induced mechanical failure (i.e. lacunae formation) in fine root cortical cells is the initial and primary driver of reduced fine root hydraulic conductivity (Lp<sub>r</sub>) under mild to moderate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress. Cortical lacunae started forming under mild <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress (âˆ’0.6 MPa Î¨<sub>stem</sub>), coincided with a dramatic reduction in Lp<sub>r</sub>, and preceded root shrinkage or significant xylem embolism. Only under increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress was embolism formation observed in the root xylem, and it appeared first in the fine roots (50% loss of hydraulic conductivity [P<sub>50</sub>] reached at âˆ’1.8 MPa) and then in older, coarse roots (P<sub>50</sub> = âˆ’3.5 MPa). These results suggest that cortical cells in fine roots function like hydraulic fuses that decouple plants from drying soil, thus preserving the hydraulic integrity of the plantâ€™s vascular system under early stages of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress. Cortical lacunae formation led to permanent structural damage of the root cortex and nonrecoverable Lp<sub>r</sub>, pointing to a role in fine root mortality and turnover under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress.</p>

Limited acclimation in leaf anatomy to experimental drought in tropical rainforest trees
<p>Dry periods are predicted to become more frequent and severe in the future in some parts of the tropics, including Amazonia, potentially causing reduced productivity, higher tree mortality and increased emissions of stored carbon. Using a long-term (12 year) through-fall exclusion (TFE) experiment in the tropics, we test the hypothesis that trees produce leaves adapted to cope with higher levels of water stress, by examining the following leaf characteristics: area, thickness, leaf mass per area, vein density, stomatal density, the thickness of palisade mesophyll, spongy mesophyll and both of the epidermal layers, internal cavity volume and the average cell sizes of the palisade and spongy mesophyll. We also test whether differences in leaf anatomy are consistent with observed differential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-induced mortality responses among taxa, and look for relationships between leaf anatomy, and leaf water relations and gas exchange parameters. Our data show that trees do not produce leaves that are more xeromorphic in response to 12 years of soil moisture deficit. However, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> treatment did result in increases in the thickness of the adaxial epidermis (TFE: 20.5Â Â±Â 1.5 Âµm, control: 16.7Â Â±Â 1.0 Âµm) and the internal cavity volume (TFE: 2.43Â Â±Â 0.50 mm<sup>3</sup> cm<sup>âˆ’2</sup>, control: 1.77Â Â±Â 0.30 mm<sup>3 </sup>cm<sup>âˆ’2</sup>). No consistent differences were detected between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-resistant and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-sensitive taxa, although interactions occurred between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-sensitivity status and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> treatment for the palisade mesophyll thickness (<i>P</i>Â =Â 0.034) and the cavity volume of the leaves (<i>P</i>Â =Â 0.025). The limited response to water deficit probably reflects a tight co-ordination between leaf morphology, water relations and photosynthetic properties. This suggests that there is little plasticity in these aspects of plant anatomy in these taxa, and that phenotypic plasticity in leaf traits may not facilitate the acclimation of Amazonian trees to the predicted future reductions in dry season water availability.</p>

Impact of summer drought on isoprenoid emissions and carbon sink of three Scots pine provenances
<p>Scots pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i> L.) provenances cover broad ecological amplitudes. In a greenhouse study, we investigated the impact of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress and rewetting on gas exchange for three provenances (Italy: Emilia Romagna; Spain: Alto Ebro; Germany: East-German lowlands) of 2-year old Scots pine seedlings. CO<sub>2</sub>, water vapour and isoprenoid exchange of stressed and control trees were quantified with a four-chamber dynamic-enclosure system in the controlled environment of a climate chamber. The three provenances showed distinct isoprenoid emission patterns and were classified into a non-Î”<sup>3</sup>-carene, with either high Î±-/Î²-pinene or Î²-myrcene fraction, and a Î”<sup>3</sup>-carene dominated type. Isoprenoid emission rates, net-photosynthesis and transpiration were reduced during summer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress and significantly recovered after rewetting. A seasonal increase of isoprenoid emission rates towards autumn was observed for all control groups. Compared with the German provenance, the Spanish and Italian provenances revealed higher isoprenoid emission rates and more plastic responses to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress and seasonal development, which points to a local adaptation to climate. As a result of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>, net carbon uptake and transpiration of trees was reduced, but recovered after rewetting. We conclude from our study that Scots pine isoprenoid emission is more variable than expected and sensitive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> periods, likely impacting regional air chemistry. Thus, a provenance-specific emission assessment accounting for reduced emission during prolonged (summer) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> is recommend for setting up biogenic volatile organic compound emission inventories used in air quality models.</p>

Differential radial growth patterns between beech (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i> L.) and oak (<i>Quercus robur</i> L.) on periodically waterlogged soils
<p>Climate scenarios for northern Central Europe project rising temperatures and increasing frequency and intensity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>s but also a shift in precipitation pattern with more humid winters. This in turn may result in soil waterlogging during the following spring, leading to increasing stress for trees growing on hydric sites. The influence of waterlogging on growth of common beech and pedunculate oak has been studied intensively on seedlings under experimental conditions. However, the question remains whether results of these studies can be transferred to mature trees growing under natural conditions. To test this, we investigated general growth patterns and climateâ€“growth relationships in four mature stands of beech and oak growing on hydromorphic soils (Stagnosols) in northeast Germany using dendrochronological methods. Our results confirmed the expected tolerance of oak to strong water-level fluctuations. Neither extremely wet conditions during spring nor summer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>s significantly affected its radial growth. Oak growth responded positively to warmer temperatures during previous year October and March of the current year of ring formation. Contrary to our expectations, also beech showed relatively low sensitivity to periods of high soil water saturation. Instead, summer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> turned out to be the main climatic factor influencing ring width of beech even under the specific periodically wet soil conditions of our study. This became evident from general climateâ€“growth correlations over the last century as well as from discontinuous (pointer year) analysis with summer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> being significantly correlated to the occurrence of growth depressions. As ring width of the two species is affected by differing climate parameters, species-specific chronologies show no coherence in high-frequency variations even for trees growing in close proximity. We assume differences in rooting depth as the main reason for the differing growth patterns and climate correlations of the two species under study. Our results indicate that under the projected future climate scenarios, beech may suffer from increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress even on hydromorphic soils. Oak might be able to maintain a sufficient hydraulic status during summer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>s by reaching water in deeper soil strata with its root system. Wet phases with waterlogged soil conditions during spring or summer appear to have only a little direct influence on radial growth of both species.</p>

BES/BZR Transcription Factor TaBZR2 Positively Regulates Drought Responses by Activation of <i>TaGST1</i>
<p>BRI1-EMS suppressor (BES)/brassinazole-resistant (BZR) family transcription factors are involved in a variety of physiological processes, but the biological functions of some BES/BZR transcription factors remain unknown; moreover, it is not clear if any of these proteins function in the regulation of plant stress responses. Here, wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) brassinazole-resistant 2 (<i>TaBZR2</i>)-overexpressing plants exhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerant phenotypes, whereas downregulation of <i>TaBZR2</i> in wheat by RNA interference resulted in elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> sensitivity. electrophoretic mobility shift assay and luciferase reporter analysis illustrate that TaBZR2 directly interacts with the gene promoter to activate the expression of <i>T. aestivum</i> glutathione s-transferase-1 (<i>TaGST1</i>), which functions positively in scavenging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-induced superoxide anions (O<sub>2</sub><sup>âˆ’</sup>). Moreover, TaBZR2 acts as a positive regulator in brassinosteroid (BR) signaling. Exogenous BR treatment enhanced TaBZR2-mediated O<sub>2</sub><sup>âˆ’</sup> scavenging and antioxidant enzyme gene expression. Taken together, we demonstrate that a BES/BZR family transcription factor, TaBZR2, functions positively in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> responses by activating <i>TaGST1</i> and mediates the crosstalk between BR and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> signaling pathways. Our results thus provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying how BES/BZR family transcription factors contribute to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerance in wheat.</p>

VAMP711 Is Required for Abscisic Acid-Mediated Inhibition of Plasma Membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase Activity
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress is a limiting environmental factor that affects plant growth and development. The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays an important role in plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> responses. Previous studies have indicated that ABA inhibits plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase) activity, and the decrease in PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity promotes stomatal closure under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress, thereby reducing water loss. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not well understood. In this study, we found that in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), ABA induces an <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor protein, namely, VESICLE-ASSOCIATED MEMBRANE PROTEIN 711 (VAMP711), to interact with the Arabidopsis PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases AHA1 and AHA2. The interaction occurs at their C-termini and inhibits PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity. Deletion of <i>VAMP711</i> in Arabidopsis results in a higher PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity and slower stomatal closure in response to ABA and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> treatments. In addition, overexpression of <i>VAMP711</i> partially rescues the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-sensitive phenotype of <i>ost2-2D</i>, a mutation in <i>AHA1</i> resulting in a constitutive activated PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase.

An Ancestral Allele of <i>Pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase1</i> Promotes Proline Accumulation and Drought Adaptation in Cultivated Barley
<p>Water scarcity is a critical threat to global crop production. Here, we used the natural diversity of barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) to dissect the genetic control of proline (Pro) mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress adaptation. Genetic mapping and positional cloning of a major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-inducible quantitative trait locus (<i>QPro.S42-1H</i>) revealed unique allelic variation in <i>pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase</i> (<i>P5cs1</i>) between the cultivated cultivar Scarlett (ssp. <i>vulgare</i>) and the wild barley accession ISR42-8 (ssp. <i>spontaneum</i>). The putative causative mutations were located in the promoter of <i>P5cs1</i> across the DNA binding motifs for abscisic acid-responsive element binding transcription factors. Introgression line (IL) S42IL-143 carrying the wild allele of <i>P5cs1</i> showed significant up-regulation of <i>P5cs1</i> expression compared to Scarlett, which was consistent with variation in Pro accumulation under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>. Next, we transiently expressed promoter::reporter constructs of ISR42-8 and Scarlett alleles in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mesophyll protoplasts. GUS expression analysis showed a significantly higher activation of the ISR42-8 promoter compared to Scarlett upon abscisic acid treatment. Notably, the ISR42-8 promoter activity was impaired in protoplasts isolated from the loss-of-function <i>abf1abf2abf3abf4</i> quadruple mutant. A series of phenotypic evaluations demonstrated that S42IL-143 maintained leaf water content and photosynthetic activity longer than Scarlett under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>. These findings suggest that the ancestral variant of <i>P5cs1</i> has the potential for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerance and understanding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> physiology of barley and related crops.</p>

The E3 Ligase TaSAP5 Alters Drought Stress Responses by Promoting the Degradation of DRIP Proteins
<p>In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants growing under normal conditions, DEHYDRATION-RESPONSIVE ELEMENT BINDING PROTEIN2A (DREB2A) is present at low levels because it is ubiquitinated and destabilized by DREB2A INTERACTING PROTEIN1 (DRIP1) and DRIP2 through 26S proteasome-mediated proteolysis. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress counteracts the ubiquitination and proteolysis of DREB2A, thus allowing the accumulation of sufficient amounts of DREB2A protein to activate downstream gene expression. The mechanisms leading to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress-mediated DREB2A accumulation are still unclear. Here, we report that the wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) TaSAP5 protein, which contains an A20/AN1 domain, acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to mediate DRIP degradation and thus increase DREB2A protein levels. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> induces <i>TaSAP5</i> expression in wheat, and <i>TaSAP5</i> overexpression in Arabidopsis and wheat seedlings increased their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerance, as measured by survival rate and grain yield under severe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress. TaSAP5 can interact with and ubiquitinate TaDRIP, as well as AtDRIP1 and AtDRIP2, leading to their subsequent degradation through the 26S proteasome pathway. Consistent with this, <i>TaSAP5</i> overexpression enhances DRIP degradation and increases the levels of DREB2A protein and its downstream targets. These results suggest that TaSAP5 acts to link <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> with DREB2A accumulation and illustrate the molecular mechanisms involved in this process.</p>

Two Chloroplast Proteins Suppress Drought Resistance by Affecting ROS Production in Guard Cells
<p>Chloroplast as the site for photosynthesis is an essential organelle in plants, but little is known about its role in stomatal regulation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> resistance. In this study, we show that two chloroplastic proteins essential for thylakoid formation negatively regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> resistance in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). By screening a mutant pool with T-DNA insertions in nuclear genes encoding chloroplastic proteins, we identified an <i>HCF106</i> knockdown mutant exhibiting increased resistance to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress. The <i>hcf106</i> mutant displayed elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in guard cells, improved stomatal closure, and reduced water loss under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> conditions. The HCF106 protein was found to physically interact with THF1, a previously identified chloroplastic protein crucial for thylakoid formation. The <i>thf1</i> mutant phenotypically resembled the <i>hcf106</i> mutant and displayed more ROS accumulation in guard cells, increased stomatal closure, reduced water loss, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> resistant phenotypes compared to the wild type. The <i>hcf106thf1</i> double mutant behaved similarly as the <i>thf1</i> single mutant. These results suggest that HCF106 and THF1 form a complex to modulate chloroplast function and that the complex is important for ROS production in guard cells and stomatal control in response to environmental stresses. Our results also suggest that modulating chloroplastic proteins could be a way for improving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> resistance in crops.</p>

A NAC Transcription Factor Represses Putrescine Biosynthesis and Affects Drought Tolerance
<p>Arginine decarboxylase (ADC)-mediated putrescine biosynthesis plays an important role in plant stress responses, but the transcriptional regulation of <i>ADC</i> in response to abiotic stress is not well understood. We isolated a NAM, ATAF1/2, and CUC (NAC) domain-containing transcription factor, PtrNAC72, from trifoliate orange (<i>Poncirus trifoliata</i>) by yeast one-hybrid screening. PtrNAC72, localized to the nucleus, binds specifically to the promoter of <i>PtADC</i> and acts as a transcriptional repressor. <i>PtrNAC72</i> expression was induced by cold, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>, and abscisic acid. <i>ADC</i> messenger RNA abundance and putrescine levels were decreased in transgenic tobacco (<i>Nicotiana nudicaulis</i>) plants overexpressing <i>PtrNAC72</i> but increased, compared with the wild type, in an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) transfer DNA insertion mutant, <i>nac72</i>. While transgenic tobacco lines overexpressing <i>PtrNAC72</i> were more sensitive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>, plants of the Arabidopsis <i>nac72</i> mutant exhibited enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerance, consistent with the accumulation of reactive oxygen species in the tested genotypes. In addition, exogenous application of putrescine to the overexpression lines restored <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerance, while treatment with <sc>d</sc>-arginine, an ADC inhibitor, compromised the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerance of <i>nac72</i>. Taken together, these results demonstrate that PtrNAC72 is a repressor of putrescine biosynthesis and may negatively regulate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress response, at least in part, via the modulation of putrescine-associated reactive oxygen species homeostasis.</p>

Spatiotemporal Coupling of Vessel Cavitation and Discharge of Stored Xylem Water in a Tree Sapling
<p>Water discharge from stem internal storage compartments is thought to minimize the risk of vessel cavitation. Based on this concept, one would expect that water storage compartments involved in the buffering of xylem tensions empty before the onset of vessel cavitation under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress, and potentially refill after soil saturation. However, scant in vivo data exist that elucidate this localized spatiotemporal coupling. In this study on intact saplings of American chestnut (<i>Castanea dentata</i>), x-ray computed microtomography (microCT) showed that the xylem matrix surrounding vessels releases stored water and becomes air-filled either concurrent to or after vessel cavitation under progressive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress. Among annual growth rings, the xylem matrix of the current year remained largely water-filled even under severe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress. In comparison, microtomography images collected on excised stems showed that applied pressures of much greater than 0 MPa were required to induce water release from the xylem matrix. Viability staining highlighted that water release from the xylem matrix was associated primarily with emptying of dead fibers. Refilling of the xylem matrix and vessels was detected in intact saplings when the canopy was bagged and stem water potential was close to 0 MPa, and in leafless saplings over the winter period. In conclusion, this study indicates that the bulk of water stored in the xylem matrix is released after the onset of vessel cavitation, and suggests that capillary water contributes to overall stem water storage under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> but is not used primarily for the prevention of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-induced vessel cavitation in this species.</p>

Overexpression of RING Domain E3 Ligase ZmXerico1 Confers Drought Tolerance through Regulation of ABA Homeostasis
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress is one of the main environmental problems encountered by crop growers. Reduction in arable land area and reduced water availability make it paramount to identify and develop strategies to allow crops to be more resilient in water-limiting environments. The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays an important role in the plantsâ€™ response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress through its control of stomatal aperture and water transpiration, and transgenic modulation of ABA levels therefore represents an attractive avenue to improve the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerance of crops. Several steps in the ABA-signaling pathway are controlled by ubiquitination involving really interesting new genes (RING) domain-containing proteins. We characterized the maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) RING protein family and identified two novel RING-H2 genes called <i>ZmXerico1</i> and <i>ZmXerico2</i>. Expression of <i>ZmXerico</i> genes is induced by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress, and we show that overexpression of <i>ZmXerico1</i> and <i>ZmXerico2</i> in Arabidopsis and maize confers ABA hypersensitivity and improved water use efficiency, which can lead to enhanced maize yield performance in a controlled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-stress environment. Overexpression of <i>ZmXerico1</i> and <i>ZmXerico2</i> in maize results in increased ABA levels and decreased levels of ABA degradation products diphaseic acid and phaseic acid. We show that ZmXerico1 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, where ABA 8â€²-hydroxylases have been shown to be localized, and that it functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. We demonstrate that ZmXerico1 plays a role in the control of ABA homeostasis through regulation of ABA 8â€²-hydroxylase protein stability, representing a novel control point in the regulation of the ABA pathway.</p>

A Nucleus-Localized Long Non-Coding RNA Enhances Drought and Salt Stress Tolerance
<p>Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) affect gene expression through a wide range of mechanisms and are considered as important regulators in many essential biological processes. A large number of lncRNA transcripts have been predicted or identified in plants in recent years. However, the biological functions for most of them are still unknown. In this study, we identified an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) lncRNA, <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> INDUCED lncRNA</i> (<i>DRIR</i>), as a novel positive regulator of the plant response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> and salt stress. <i>DRIR</i> was expressed at a low level under nonstress conditions but can be significantly activated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> and salt stress as well as by abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. We identified a T-DNA insertion mutant, <i>drir<sup>D</sup></i>, which had higher expression of the <i>DRIR</i> gene than the wild-type plants. The <i>drir<sup>D</sup></i> mutant exhibits increased tolerance to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> and salt stress. Overexpressing <i>DRIR</i> in Arabidopsis also increased tolerance to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> and salt stress of the transgenic plants. The <i>drir<sup>D</sup></i> mutant and the overexpressing seedlings are more sensitive to ABA than the wild type in stomata closure and seedling growth. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis demonstrated that the expression of a large number of genes was altered in <i>drir<sup>D</sup></i> and the overexpressing plants. These include genes involved in ABA signaling, water transport, and other stress-relief processes. Our study reveals a mechanism whereby <i>DRIR</i> regulates the plant response to abiotic stress by modulating the expression of a series of genes involved in the stress response.</p>

SENSITIVE TO FREEZING2 Aides in Resilience to Salt and Drought in Freezing-Sensitive Tomato
<p>SENSITIVE TO FREEZING2 (SFR2) is crucial for protecting chloroplast membranes following freezing in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). It has been shown that SFR2 homologs are present in all land plants, including freezing-sensitive species, raising the question of SFR2 function beyond freezing tolerance. Similar to freezing, salt and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> can cause dehydration. Thus, it is hypothesized that in freezing-sensitive plants SFR2 may play roles in their resilience to salt or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>. To test this hypothesis, <i>SlSFR2</i> RNAi lines were generated in the cold/freezing-sensitive species tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i> [M82 <i>cv</i>]). Hypersensitivity to salt and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> of <i>SlSFR2</i>-RNAi lines was observed. Higher tolerance of wild-type tomatoes was correlated with the production of trigalactosyldiacylglycerol, a product of SFR2 activity. Tomato SFR2 in vitro activity is Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and its optimal pH is 7.5, similar to that of Arabidopsis SFR2, but the specific activity of tomato SFR2 in vitro is almost double that of Arabidopsis SFR2. When salt and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress were applied to Arabidopsis, no conditions could be identified at which SFR2 was induced prior to irreversibly impacting plant growth, suggesting that SFR2 protects Arabidopsis primarily against freezing. Discovery of tomato SFR2 function in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> and salt resilience provides further insights into general membrane lipid remodeling-based stress tolerance mechanisms and together with protection against freezing in freezing-resistant plants such as Arabidopsis, it adds lipid remodeling as a possible target for the engineering of abiotic stress-resilient crops.</p>

Termites mitigate the effects of drought in tropical rainforest
<p>Termites perform key ecological functions in tropical ecosystems, are strongly affected by variation in rainfall, and respond negatively to habitat disturbance. However, it is not known how the projected increase in frequency and severity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>s in tropical rainforests will alter termite communities and the maintenance of ecosystem processes. Using a large-scale termite suppression experiment, we found that termite activity and abundance increased during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> in a Bornean forest. This increase resulted in accelerated litter decomposition, elevated soil moisture, greater soil nutrient heterogeneity, and higher seedling survival rates during the extreme El NinÌƒo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> of 2015â€“2016. Our work shows how an invertebrate group enhances ecosystem resistance to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>, providing evidence that the dual stressors of climate change and anthropogenic shifts in biotic communities will have various negative consequences for the maintenance of rainforest ecosystems.</p>

Low Vulnerability to Xylem Embolism in Leaves and Stems of North American Oaks
<p>Although recent findings suggest that xylem embolism represents a significant, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-induced damaging process in land plants, substantial debate surrounds the capacity of long-vesseled, ring-porous species to resist embolism. We investigated whether recent methodological developments could help resolve this controversy within <i>Quercus</i>, a long-vesseled, ring-porous temperate angiosperm genus, and shed further light on the importance of xylem vulnerability to embolism as an indicator of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerance. We used the optical technique to quantify leaf and stem xylem vulnerability to embolism of eight <i>Quercus</i> species from the Mediterranean-type climate region of California to examine absolute measures of resistance to embolism as well as any potential hydraulic segmentation between tissue types. We demonstrated that our optical assessment reflected flow impairment for a subset of our sample species by quantifying changes in leaf hydraulic conductance in dehydrating branches. Air-entry water potential varied 2-fold in leaves, ranging from âˆ’1.7 Â± 0.25 MPa to âˆ’3.74 Â± 0.23 MPa, and 4-fold in stems, ranging from âˆ’1.17 Â± 0.04 MPa to âˆ’4.91 Â± 0.3 MPa. Embolism occurred earlier in leaves than in stems in only one out of eight sample species, and plants always lost turgor before experiencing stem embolism. Our results show that long-vesseled North American <i>Quercus</i> species are more resistant to embolism than previously thought and support the hypothesis that avoiding stem embolism is a critical component of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerance in woody trees. Accurately quantifying xylem vulnerability to embolism is essential for understanding species distributions along aridity gradients and predicting plant mortality during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>.</p>

Knockdown of Rice MicroRNA166 Confers Drought Resistance by Causing Leaf Rolling and Altering Stem Xylem Development
<p>MicroRNAs are 19- to 22-nucleotide small noncoding RNAs that have been implicated in abiotic stress responses. In this study, we found that knockdown of microRNA166, using the Short Tandem Target Mimic (STTM) system, resulted in morphological changes that confer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> resistance in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). From a large-scale screen for miRNA knockdown lines in rice, we identified miR166 knockdown lines (STTM166); these plants exhibit a rolled-leaf phenotype, which is normally displayed by rice plants under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress. The leaves of STTM166 rice plants had smaller bulliform cells and abnormal sclerenchymatous cells, likely causing the rolled-leaf phenotype. The STTM166 plants had reduced stomatal conductance and showed decreased transpiration rates. The STTM166 lines also exhibited altered stem xylem and decreased hydraulic conductivity, likely due to the reduced diameter of the xylem vessels. Molecular analyses identified rice <i>HOMEODOMAIN CONTAINING PROTEIN4</i> (<i>OsHB4</i>), a member of HD-Zip III gene family, as a major target of miR166; moreover, rice plants overexpressing a miR166-resistant form of <i>OsHB4</i> resembled the STTM166 plants, including leaf rolling and higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> resistance. The genes downstream of miR166-<i>OsHB4</i> consisted of polysaccharide synthesis-related genes that may contribute to cell wall formation and vascular development. Our results suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> resistance in rice can be increased by manipulating miRNAs, which leads to developmental changes, such as leaf rolling and reduced diameter of the xylem, that mimic plantsâ€™ natural responses to water-deficit stress.</p>

Arabidopsis Î²-Amylase2 Is a K<sup>+</sup>-Requiring, Catalytic Tetramer with Sigmoidal Kinetics
<p>The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) genome contains nine Î²-amylase (<i>BAM</i>) genes, some of which play important roles in starch hydrolysis. However, little is known about BAM2, a plastid-localized enzyme reported to have extremely low catalytic activity. Using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation of intron positions, we determined that the nine Arabidopsis <i>BAM</i> genes fall into two distinct subfamilies. A similar pattern was found in each major lineage of land plants, suggesting that these subfamilies diverged prior to the origin of land plants. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis indicated that <i>BAM2</i> is the ancestral member of one of these subfamilies. This finding, along with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation of amino acids in the active site of BAM2, suggested that it might be catalytically active. We then identified KCl as necessary for BAM2 activity. Unlike BAM1, BAM3, and BAM5, three Arabidopsis BAMs that all exhibited hyperbolic kinetics, BAM2 exhibited sigmoidal kinetics with a Hill coefficient of over 3. Using multi-angle light scattering, we determined that BAM2 was a tetramer, whereas BAM5 was a monomer. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed residues from a diverse set of BAM2 orthologs were mapped onto a homology model of the protein, revealing a large, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed surface away from the active site that we hypothesize is a secondary carbohydrate-binding site. Introduction of bulky methionine for glycine at two points on this surface reduced catalytic activity significantly without disrupting the tetrameric structure. Expression analysis indicated that BAM2 is more closely coexpressed with other starch degradation enzymes than any other BAM, suggesting that BAM2 may play an important role in starch degradation in plants.</p>

Loss and Gain of Human Acidic Mammalian Chitinase Activity by Nonsynonymous SNPs
<p>Acidic mammalian chitinase (AMCase) is implicated in asthma, allergic inflammation, and food processing. Little is known about genetic and evolutional regulation of chitinolytic activity of AMCase. Here, we relate human AMCase polymorphisms to the mouse AMCase, and show that the highly active variants encoded by nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) are consistent with the mouse AMCase sequence. The chitinolytic activity of the recombinant human AMCase was significantly lower than that of the mouse counterpart. By creating mouse-human chimeric AMCase protein we found that the presence of the N-terminal region of human AMCase containing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed active site residues reduced the enzymatic activity of the molecule. We were able to significantly increase the activity of human AMCase by amino acid substitutions encoded by nsSNPs (N45, D47, and R61) with those <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed in the mouse homologue (D45, N47, and M61). For abolition of the mouse AMCase activity, introduction of M61R mutation was sufficient. M61 is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed in most of primates other than human and orangutan as well as in other mammals. Orangutan has I61 substitution, which also markedly reduced the activity of the mouse AMCase, indicating that the M61 is a crucial residue for the chitinolytic activity. Altogether, our data suggest that human AMCase has lost its chitinolytic activity by integration of nsSNPs during evolution and that the enzyme can be reactivated by introducing amino acids <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed in the mouse counterpart.</p>

Winter drought impairs xylem phenology, anatomy and growth in Mediterranean Scots pine forests
<p>Continental Mediterranean forests face <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> but also cold spells and both climate extremes can impair the resilience capacity of these forests. Climate warming could amplify the negative effects of cold spells by inducing premature dehardening. Here we capitalize on a winter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-induced dieback triggered by a cold spell which occurred in December 2001 affecting Scots pine forests in eastern Spain. We assessed post-dieback recovery by quantifying and comparing radial growth and xylem anatomy of non-declining (ND, crown coverÂ >50%) and declining (D, crown coverÂ â‰¤50%) trees in two sites (VP, Villarroya de los Pinares; TO, Torrijas). We also characterized xylogenesis in both sites and aboveground productivity in site VP. Dieback caused legacy effects since needle loss, a 60% reduction in litter fall and radial-growth decline characterized D-trees 3 years after dieback symptoms started appearing in spring 2002. D-trees formed collapsed tracheids in the 2002-ring, particularly in the most affected VP site where xylogenesis differences between ND and D trees were most noticeable. The lower growth rates of D-trees were caused by a shorter duration of their major xylogenesis phases. In site VP the radial-enlargement and wall-thickening of tracheids were significantly reduced in D-trees as compared to ND-trees because these xylogenesis phases tended to start earlier and end later in ND-trees. Gompertz models fitted to tracheid production predicted that maximum growth rates occurred 11â€“12 days earlier in ND than in D-trees.

The pseudokinase domains of guanylyl cyclaseâ€“A and â€“B allosterically increase the affinity of their catalytic domains for substrate
<p>Natriuretic peptides regulate multiple physiologic systems by activating transmembrane receptors containing intracellular guanylyl cyclase domains, such as GC-A and GC-B, also known as Npr1 and Npr2, respectively. Both enzymes contain an intracellular, phosphorylated pseudokinase domain (PKD) critical for activation of the C-terminal cGMP-synthesizing guanylyl cyclase domain. Because ATP allosterically activates GC-A and GC-B, we investigated how ATP binding to the PKD influenced guanylyl cyclase activity. Molecular modeling indicated that all the residues of the ATP-binding site of the prototypical kinase PKA, except the catalytic aspartate, are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed in the PKDs of GC-A and GC-B. Kinase-inactivating alanine substitutions for the invariant lysine in subdomain II or the aspartate in the DYG-loop of GC-A and GC-B failed to decrease enzyme phosphate content, consistent with the PKDs lacking kinase activity. In contrast, both mutations reduced enzyme activation by blocking the ability of ATP to decrease the Michaelis constant without affecting peptide-dependent activation. The analogous lysine-to-alanine substitution in a glutamate-substituted phosphomimetic mutant form of GC-B also reduced enzyme activity, consistent with ATP stimulating guanylyl cyclase activity through an allosteric, phosphorylation-independent mechanism. Mutations designed to rigidify the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed regulatory or catalytic spines within the PKDs increased guanylyl cyclase activity, increased sensitivity to natriuretic peptide, or reduced the Michaelis constant in the absence of ATP, consistent with ATP binding stabilizing the PKD in a conformation analogous to that of catalytically active kinases. We conclude that allosteric mechanisms evolutionarily <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed in the PKDs promote the catalytic activation of transmembrane guanylyl cyclases.</p>

Elevated trawling inside protected areas undermines conservation outcomes in a global fishing hot spot
<p>Marine protected areas (MPAs) are increasingly used as a primary tool to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>e biodiversity. This is particularly relevant in heavily exploited fisheries hot spots such as Europe, where MPAs now cover 29% of territorial waters, with unknown effects on fishing pressure and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation outcomes. We investigated industrial trawl fishing and sensitive indicator species in and around 727 MPAs designated by the European Union. We found that 59% of MPAs are commercially trawled, and average trawling intensity across MPAs is at least 1.4-fold higher as compared with nonprotected areas. Abundance of sensitive species (sharks, rays, and skates) decreased by 69% in heavily trawled areas. The widespread industrial exploitation of MPAs undermines global biodiversity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation targets, elevating recent concerns about growing human pressures on protected areas worldwide.</p>

The South Asian monsoonâ€”pollution pump and purifier
<p>Air <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollut</span></strong>ion is growing fastest in monsoon-affected South Asia. During the dry winter monsoon, the fumes disperse toward the Indian Ocean, creating a vast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollut</span></strong>ion haze, but their fate during the wet summer monsoon has been unclear. We performed atmospheric chemistry measurements by aircraft in the Oxidation Mechanism Observations campaign, sampling the summer monsoon outflow in the upper troposphere between the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean. The measurements, supported by model calculations, show that the monsoon sustains a remarkably efficient cleansing mechanism by which contaminants are rapidly oxidized and deposited to Earthâ€™s surface. However, some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollut</span></strong>ants are lofted above the monsoon clouds and chemically processed in a reactive reservoir before being redistributed globally, including to the stratosphere.</p>

Airborne laser-guided imaging spectroscopy to map forest trait diversity and guide conservation

Positive biodiversity-productivity relationship predominant in global forests
<p>The biodiversity-productivity relationship (BPR) is foundational to our understanding of the global extinction crisis and its impacts on ecosystem functioning. Understanding BPR is critical for the accurate valuation and effective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation of biodiversity. Using ground-sourced data from 777,126 permanent plots, spanning 44 countries and most terrestrial biomes, we reveal a globally consistent positive concave-down BPR, showing that continued biodiversity loss would result in an accelerating decline in forest productivity worldwide. The value of biodiversity in maintaining commercial forest productivity aloneâ€”US$166 billion to 490 billion per year according to our estimationâ€”is more than twice what it would cost to implement effective global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation.

Root Engineering in Barley: Increasing Cytokinin Degradation Produces a Larger Root System, Mineral Enrichment in the Shoot and Improved Drought Tolerance
<p>Root size and architecture are important crop plant traits, as they determine access to water and soil nutrients. The plant hormone cytokinin is a negative regulator of root growth and branching. Here, we generated transgenic barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) plants with an enlarged root system by enhancing cytokinin degradation in roots to explore the potential of cytokinin modulations in improving root functions. This was achieved through root-specific expression of a <i>CYTOKININ OXIDASE/DEHYDROGENASE</i> gene. Enhanced biomass allocation to roots did not penalize shoot growth or seed yield, indicating that these plants were not source limited. In leaves of transgenic lines, the concentrations of several macroelements and microelements were increased, particularly those with low soil mobility (phosphorus, manganese, and zinc). Importantly, seeds contained up to 44% more zinc, which is beneficial for human nutrition. Transgenic lines also demonstrated dampened stress responses to long-term <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> conditions, indicating lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> sensitivity. Taken together, this work demonstrates that root engineering of cereals is a promising strategy to improve nutrient efficiency, biofortification, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerance.</p>

The Transcriptional Coactivator ADA2b Recruits a Structural Maintenance Protein to Double-Strand Breaks during DNA Repair in Plants
<p>DNA damage occurs in all cells and can hinder chromosome stability and cell viability. Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes5/6 (SMC5/6) is a protein complex that functions as an evolutionarily <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed chromosomal ATPase critical for repairing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). However, the mechanisms regulating this complex in plants are poorly understood. Here, we identified the transcriptional coactivator ALTERATION/DEFICIENCY IN ACTIVATION2B (ADA2b) as an interactor of SMC5 in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). ADA2b is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed component of the Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase complex, which functions in transcriptional regulation. Characterization of mutant and knockdown Arabidopsis lines showed that disruption of either <i>SMC5</i> or <i>ADA2b</i> resulted in enhanced DNA damage. Both SMC5 and ADA2b were associated with Î³-H2AX, a marker of DSBs, and the recruitment of SMC5 onto DSBs was dependent on ADA2b. In addition, overexpression of <i>SMC5</i> in the <i>ada2b</i> mutant background stimulated cell death. Collectively, our results show that the interaction between ADA2b and SMC5 mediates DNA repair in plant cells, suggesting a functional association between these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed proteins and further elucidating mechanisms of DNA damage repair in plants.</p>

Potato Mop-Top Virus Co-Opts the Stress Sensor HIPP26 for Long-Distance Movement
<p>Virus movement proteins facilitate virus entry into the vascular system to initiate systemic infection. The potato mop-top virus (PMTV) movement protein, TGB1, is involved in long-distance movement of both viral ribonucleoprotein complexes and virions. Here, our analysis of TGB1 interactions with host <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> proteins revealed an interaction with a member of the heavy metal-associated isoprenylated plant protein family, HIPP26, which acts as a plasma membrane-to-nucleus signal during abiotic stress. We found that knockdown of <i>NbHIPP26</i> expression inhibited virus long-distance movement but did not affect cell-to-cell movement. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> and PMTV infection up-regulated <i>NbHIPP26</i> gene expression, and PMTV infection protected plants from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>. In addition, <i>NbHIPP26</i> promoter-reporter fusions revealed vascular tissue-specific expression. Mutational and biochemical analyses indicated that NbHIPP26 subcellular localization at the plasma membrane and plasmodesmata was mediated by lipidation (<i>S</i>-acylation and prenylation), as nonlipidated NbHIPP26 was predominantly in the nucleus. Notably, coexpression of NbHIPP26 with TGB1 resulted in a similar nuclear accumulation of NbHIPP26. TGB1 interacted with the carboxyl-terminal CVVM (prenyl) domain of NbHIPP26, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation revealed that the TGB1-HIPP26 complex localized to microtubules and accumulated in the nucleolus, with little signal at the plasma membrane or plasmodesmata. These data support a mechanism where interaction with TGB1 negates or reverses NbHIPP26 lipidation, thus releasing membrane-associated NbHIPP26 and redirecting it via microtubules to the nucleus, thereby activating the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> stress response and facilitating virus long-distance movement.</p>

Loss of LOFSEP Transcription Factor Function Converts Spikelet to Leaf-Like Structures in Rice
<p><i>SEPALLATA</i> (<i>SEP</i>)-like genes, which encode a subfamily of MADS-box transcription factors, are essential for specifying floral organ and meristem identity in angiosperms. Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) has five <i>SEP</i>-like genes with partial redundancy and overlapping expression domains, yet their functions and evolutionary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation are only partially known. Here, we describe the biological role of one of the <i>SEP</i> genes of rice, <i>OsMADS5</i>, in redundantly controlling spikelet morphogenesis. <i>OsMADS5</i> belongs to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed <i>LOFSEP</i> subgroup along with <i>OsMADS1</i> and <i>OsMADS34</i>. <i>OsMADS5</i> was expressed strongly across a broad range of reproductive stages and tissues. No obvious phenotype was observed in the <i>osmads5</i> single mutants when compared with the wild type, which was largely due to the functional redundancy among the three <i>LOFSEP</i> genes. Genetic and molecular analyses demonstrated that <i>OsMADS1</i>, <i>OsMADS5</i>, and <i>OsMADS34</i> together regulate floral meristem determinacy and specify the identities of spikelet organs by positively regulating the other MADS-box floral homeotic genes. Experiments conducted in yeast also suggested that OsMADS1, OsMADS5, and OsMADS34 form protein-protein interactions with other MADS-box floral homeotic members, which seems to be a typical, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed feature of plant SEP proteins.</p>

Quantifying Wheat Sensitivities to Environmental Constraints to Dissect Genotype Ã— Environment Interactions in the Field
<p>Yield is subject to strong genotype-by-environment (G Ã— E) interactions in the field, especially under abiotic constraints such as soil water deficit (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> [D]) and high temperature (heat [H]). Since environmental conditions show strong fluctuations during the whole crop cycle, geneticists usually do not consider environmental measures as quantitative variables but rather as factors in multienvironment analyses. Based on 11 experiments in a field platform with contrasting temperature and soil water deficit, we determined the periods of sensitivity to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> and heat constraints in wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) and determined the average sensitivities for major yield components. G Ã— E interactions were separated into their underlying components, constitutive genotypic effect (G), G Ã— D, G Ã— H, and G Ã— H Ã— D, and were analyzed for two genotypes, highlighting contrasting responses to heat and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> constraints. We then tested the constitutive and responsive behaviors of two strong quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated previously with yield components. This analysis confirmed the constitutive effect of the chromosome 1B QTL and explained the G Ã— E interaction of the chromosome 3B QTL by a benefit of one allele when temperature rises. In addition to the method itself, which can be applied to other data sets and populations, this study will support the cloning of a major yield QTL on chromosome 3B that is highly dependent on environmental conditions and for which the climatic interaction is now quantified.</p>

Stearoyl-Acyl Carrier Protein Desaturase Mutations Uncover an Impact of Stearic Acid in Leaf and Nodule Structure
<p>Stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturase (SACPD-C) has been reported to control the accumulation of seed stearic acid; however, no study has previously reported its involvement in leaf stearic acid content and impact on leaf structure and morphology. A subset of an ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenized population of soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) â€˜Forrestâ€™ was screened to identify mutants within the <i>GmSACPD-C</i> gene. Using a forward genetics approach, one nonsense and four missense <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutants were identified to have high levels of seed, nodule, and leaf stearic acid content. Homology modeling and in silico analysis of the GmSACPD-C enzyme revealed that most of these mutations were localized near or at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed residues essential for diiron ion coordination. Soybeans carrying <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutations at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed residues showed the highest stearic acid content, and these mutations were found to have deleterious effects on nodule development and function. Interestingly, mutations at non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed residues show an increase in stearic acid content yet retain healthy nodules. Thus, random mutagenesis and mutational analysis allows for the achievement of high seed stearic acid content with no associated negative agronomic characteristics. Additionally, expression analysis demonstrates that nodule leghemoglobin transcripts were significantly more abundant in soybeans with deleterious mutations at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed residues of GmSACPD-C. Finally, we report that <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutations cause an increase in leaf stearic acid content and an alteration of leaf structure and morphology in addition to differences in nitrogen-fixing nodule structure.</p>

Drought-Enhanced Xylem Sap Sulfate Closes Stomata by Affecting ALMT12 and Guard Cell ABA Synthesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Water limitation of plants causes stomatal closure to prevent water loss by transpiration. For this purpose, progressing soil water deficit is communicated from roots to shoots. Abscisic acid (ABA) is the key signal in stress-induced stomatal closure, but ABA as an early xylem-delivered signal is still a matter of debate. In this study, poplar plants (<i>Populus Ã— canescens</i>) were exposed to water stress to investigate xylem sap sulfate and ABA, stomatal conductance, and sulfate transporter (<i>SULTR</i>) expression. In addition, stomatal behavior and expression of ABA receptors, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-responsive genes, transcription factors, and <i>NCED3</i> were studied after feeding sulfate and ABA to detached poplar leaves and epidermal peels of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The results show that increased xylem sap sulfate is achieved upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> by reduced xylem unloading by PtaSULTR3;3a and PtaSULTR1;1, and by enhanced loading from parenchyma cells into the xylem via PtaALMT3b. Sulfate application caused stomatal closure in excised leaves and peeled epidermis. In the loss of sulfate-channel function mutant, At<i>almt12</i>, sulfate-triggered stomatal closure was impaired. The QUAC1/ALMT12 anion channel heterologous expressed in oocytes was gated open by extracellular sulfate. Sulfate up-regulated the expression of <i>NCED3</i>, a key step of ABA synthesis, in guard cells. In conclusion, xylem-derived sulfate seems to be a chemical signal of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> that induces stomatal closure via QUAC1/ALMT12 and/or guard cell ABA synthesis.</p>

The Pepper RING-Type E3 Ligase CaAIRF1 Regulates ABA and Drought Signaling via CaADIP1 Protein Phosphatase Degradation
<p>Ubiquitin-mediated protein modification occurs at multiple steps of abscisic acid (ABA) signaling. Here, we sought proteins responsible for degradation of the pepper (<i>Capsicum annuum</i>) type 2C protein phosphatase CaADIP1 via the 26S proteasome system. We showed that the RING-type E3 ligase CaAIRF1 (<i>Capsicum annuum</i> ADIP1 Interacting RING Finger Protein 1) interacts with and ubiquitinates CaADIP1. CaADIP1 degradation was slower in crude proteins from <i>CaAIRF1</i>-silenced peppers than in those from control plants. <i>CaAIRF1</i>-silenced pepper plants displayed reduced ABA sensitivity and decreased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> tolerance characterized by delayed stomatal closure and suppressed induction of ABA- and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-responsive marker genes. In contrast, <i>CaAIRF1</i>-overexpressing Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants exhibited ABA-hypersensitive and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-tolerant phenotypes. Moreover, in these plants, CaADIP1-induced ABA hyposensitivity was strongly suppressed by <i>CaAIRF1</i> overexpression. Our findings highlight a potential new route for fine-tune regulation of ABA signaling in pepper via CaAIRF1 and CaADIP1.</p>

Outside-Xylem Vulnerability, Not Xylem Embolism, Controls Leaf Hydraulic Decline during Dehydration<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[CC-BY]</sup></xref>
<p>Leaf hydraulic supply is crucial to maintaining open stomata for CO<sub>2</sub> capture and plant growth. During <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>-induced dehydration, the leaf hydraulic conductance (<i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub>) declines, which contributes to stomatal closure and, eventually, to leaf death. Previous studies have tended to attribute the decline of <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> to embolism in the leaf vein xylem. We visualized at high resolution and quantified experimentally the hydraulic vulnerability of xylem and outside-xylem pathways and modeled their respective influences on plant water transport. Evidence from all approaches indicated that the decline of <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> during dehydration arose first and foremost due to the vulnerability of outside-xylem tissues. In vivo x-ray microcomputed tomography of dehydrating leaves of four diverse angiosperm species showed that, at the turgor loss point, only small fractions of leaf vein xylem conduits were embolized, and substantial xylem embolism arose only under severe dehydration. Experiments on an expanded set of eight angiosperm species showed that outside-xylem hydraulic vulnerability explained 75% to 100% of <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> decline across the range of dehydration from mild water stress to beyond turgor loss point. Spatially explicit modeling of leaf water transport pointed to a role for reduced membrane conductivity consistent with published data for cells and tissues. Plant-scale modeling suggested that outside-xylem hydraulic vulnerability can protect the xylem from tensions that would induce embolism and disruption of water transport under mild to moderate soil and atmospheric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>s. These findings pinpoint outside-xylem tissues as a central locus for the control of leaf and plant water transport during progressive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>.</p>

A Conserved cis-Regulatory Module Determines Germline Fate through Activation of the Transcription Factor DUO1 Promoter
<p>The development of the male germline within pollen relies upon the activation of numerous target genes by the transcription factor DUO POLLEN1 (DUO1). The expression of DUO1 is restricted to the male germline and is first detected shortly after the asymmetric division that segregates the germ cell lineage. Transcriptional regulation is critical in controlling DUO1 expression, since transcriptional and translational fusions show similar expression patterns. Here, we identify key promoter sequences required for the germline-specific regulation of <i>DUO1</i> transcription. Combining promoter deletion analyses with phylogenetic footprinting in eudicots and in Arabidopsis accessions, we identify a cis-regulatory module, <i>Regulatory region of DUO1</i> (<i>ROD1</i>), which replicates the expression pattern of <i>DUO1</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We show that <i>ROD1</i> from the legume <i>Medicago truncatula</i> directs male germline-specific expression in Arabidopsis, demonstrating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation of DUO1 regulation among eudicots. <i>ROD1</i> contains several short <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed cis-regulatory elements, including three copies of the motif DNGTGGV, required for germline expression and tandem repeats of the motif YAACYGY, which enhance <i>DUO1</i> transcription in a positive feedback loop. We conclude that a cis-regulatory module <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed in eudicots directs the spatial and temporal expression of the transcription factor DUO1 to specify male germline fate and sperm cell differentiation.</p>

Trehalose 6-Phosphate Regulates Photosynthesis and Assimilate Partitioning in Reproductive Tissue<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Transgenic maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) that expresses rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) <i>TREHALOSE PHOSPHATE PHOSPHATASE1</i> (<i>TPP1</i>) from the rice <i>MADS6</i> promoter, which is active over the flowering period, produces higher yields than wild type. This yield increase occurs with or without <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong> conditions during flowering. To understand the mechanistic basis of the increased yield, we characterized gene expression and metabolite profiles in leaves and developing female reproductive tissue, comprising florets, node, pith, and shank, over the flowering period with and without <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drought</span></strong>. The <i>MADS6</i> promoter was most active in the vasculature, particularly phloem companion cells in florets and pith, consistent with the largest decreases in trehalose 6-phosphate (T6P) levels (2- to 3-fold) being found in pith and florets. Low T6P led to decreased gene expression for primary metabolism and increased gene expression for secondary metabolism, particularly lipid-related pathways. Despite similar changes in gene expression, the pith and floret displayed opposing assimilate profiles: sugars, sugar phosphates, amino acids, and lipids increased in florets, but decreased in pith. Possibly explaining this assimilate distribution, seven <i>SWEET</i> genes were found to be up-regulated in the transgenic plants. SnRK1 activity and the expression of the gene for the SnRK1 beta subunit, expression of SnRK1 marker genes, and endogenous trehalose pathway genes were also altered. Furthermore, leaves of the transgenic maize maintained a higher photosynthetic rate for a longer period compared to wild type. In conclusion, we found that decreasing T6P in reproductive tissues down-regulates primary metabolism and up-regulates secondary metabolism, resulting in different metabolite profiles in component tissues. Our data implicate T6P/ SnRK1 as a major regulator of whole-plant resource allocation for crop yield improvement.</p>

Lipopolysaccharides Trigger Two Successive Bursts of Reactive Oxygen Species at Distinct Cellular Locations
<p>Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are major components of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria and are an important microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP) that triggers immune responses in plants and animals. A previous genetic screen in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) identified LIPOOLIGOSACCHARIDE-SPECIFIC REDUCED ELICITATION (LORE), a B-type lectin <i>S</i>-domain receptor kinase, as a sensor of LPS. However, the LPS-activated LORE signaling pathway and associated immune responses remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that LPS trigger biphasic production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in Arabidopsis. The first transient ROS burst was similar to that induced by another MAMP, flagellin, whereas the second long-lasting burst was induced only by LPS. The LPS-triggered second ROS burst was found to be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed in a variety of plant species. Microscopic observation of the generation of ROS revealed that the LPS-triggered second ROS burst was largely associated with chloroplasts, and functional chloroplasts were indispensable for this response. The lipid A moiety, the most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed portion of LPS, appears to be responsible for the second ROS burst. Surprisingly, the LPS- and lipid A-triggered second ROS burst was only partially dependent on LORE. Together, our findings provide insight on the LPS-triggered ROS production and the associated signaling pathway.</p>

Pausing of Chloroplast Ribosomes Is Induced by Multiple Features and Is Linked to the Assembly of Photosynthetic Complexes<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Many mRNAs contain pause sites that briefly interrupt the progress of translation. Specific features that induce ribosome pausing have been described; however, their individual contributions to pause-site formation, and the overall biological significance of ribosome pausing, remain largely unclear. We have taken advantage of the compact genome of chloroplasts to carry out a plastid genome-wide survey of pause sites, as a basis for studying the impact of pausing on posttranslational processes. Based on ribosomal profiling of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) chloroplast mRNAs, we demonstrate that a combination of factorsâ€”mRNA secondary structure, internal Shine-Dalgarno sequences, and positively charged amino acids in the nascent peptide chainâ€”explains 95% of the major pause sites on plastid mRNAs, whereas codon usage has little impact. The distribution of the pause sites is nonrandom and conforms to distinct patterns in the vicinity of sequences coding for transmembrane domains, which depend on their orientation within the membrane as well as being next to sequences coding for cofactor binding sites. We found strong indications that the mechanisms causing ribosomal pausing and at least some of the ribosomes pause sites are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed between distantly related plant species. In addition, the positions of features that cause pausing are well <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed in photoautotrophic plants, but less so in their nonphotosynthetic, parasitic relatives, implying that the synthesis and assembly of photosynthetic multiprotein complexes requires localized ribosome pausing.</p>

Control of Adventitious Root Architecture in Rice by Darkness, Light, and Gravity
<p>Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) is a semiaquatic plant that is well adapted to partial flooding. Rice stems develop adventitious root (AR) primordia at each node that slowly mature but emerge only when the plant gets flooded, leading to the formation of a whole new secondary root system upon flooding. AR growth is induced by ethylene that accumulates in submerged plant tissues due to its lowered diffusion rate in water. Here, we report that the architecture of the secondary root system in flooded rice plants is controlled not only by altered gas diffusion but also by gravity and light. While ethylene promotes the emergence and growth of ARs, gravity and light determine their gravitropic setpoint angle (i.e. the deviation of growth direction relative to vertical). ARs grow upward at about 120Â° in the dark and downward at 54Â° in the light. The upward growth direction is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed in <i>indica</i> and <i>japonica</i> rice varieties, suggestive of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed trait in rice. Experiments with a klinostat and with inverted stem orientation revealed that gravity promotes upward growth by about 10Â°. Red, far-red, and blue light lead to negative phototropism in a dose-dependent manner, with blue light being most effective, indicating that phytochrome and blue light signaling control AR system architecture. The <i>cpt1</i> (<i>coleoptile phototropism1</i>) mutant, which lacks one of the phototropin-interacting CPT proteins, shows reduced sensitivity to blue light. Hence, the gravitropic setpoint angle of rice ARs is controlled by genetic and environmental factors that likely balance the need for oxygen supply (upward growth) with avoidance of root desiccation (downward growth).</p>

Turnip Mosaic Virus Counteracts Selective Autophagy of the Viral Silencing Suppressor HCpro<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Autophagy is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed intracellular degradation pathway and has emerged as a key mechanism of antiviral immunity in metazoans, including the selective elimination of viral components. In turn, some animal viruses are able to escape and modulate autophagy for enhanced pathogenicity. Whether host autophagic responses and viral countermeasures play similar roles in plant-virus interactions is not well understood. Here, we have identified selective autophagy as antiviral pathway during plant infection with turnip mosaic virus (TuMV), a positive-stranded RNA potyvirus. We show that the autophagy cargo receptor NBR1 suppresses viral accumulation by targeting the viral RNA silencing suppressor helper-component proteinase (HCpro), presumably in association with virus-induced RNA granules. Intriguingly, TuMV seems to antagonize NBR1-dependent autophagy during infection by the activity of distinct viral proteins, thereby limiting its antiviral capacity. We also found that NBR1-independent bulk autophagy prevents premature plant death, thus extending the lifespan of virus reservoirs and particle production. Together, our study highlights a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed role of selective autophagy in antiviral immunity and suggests the evolvement of viral protein functions to inhibit autophagy processes, despite a potential trade-off in host survival.</p>

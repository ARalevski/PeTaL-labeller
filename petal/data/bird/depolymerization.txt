The Non-Mendelian Green Cotyledon Gene in Soybean Encodes a Small Subunit of Photosystem II
<p>Chlorophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation plays important roles in leaf senescence including regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of chlorophyll-binding proteins. Although most genes encoding enzymes of the chlorophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation pathway have been identified, the regulation of their activity has not been fully understood. Green cotyledon mutants in legume are stay-green mutants, in which chlorophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation is impaired during leaf senescence and seed maturation. Among them, the soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) green cotyledon gene <i>cytG</i> is unique because it is maternally inherited. To isolate <i>cytG</i>, we extensively sequenced the soybean chloroplast genome, and detected a 5-bp insertion causing a frame-shift in <i>psbM</i>, which encodes one of the small subunits of photosystem II. Mutant tobacco plants (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) with a disrupted <i>psbM</i> generated using a chloroplast transformation technique had green senescent leaves, confirming that <i>cytG</i> encodes PsbM. The phenotype of <i>cytG</i> was very similar to that of mutant of chlorophyll <i>b</i> reductase catalyzing the first step of chlorophyll <i>b</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation. In fact, chlorophyll <i>b</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ing activity in dark-grown <i>cytG</i> and <i>psbM</i>-knockout seedlings was significantly lower than that of wild-type plants. Our results suggest that PsbM is a unique protein linking photosynthesis in presenescent leaves with chlorophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation during leaf senescence and seed maturation. Additionally, we discuss the origin of <i>cytG</i>, which may have been selected during domestication of soybean.</p>

Tuberculosis of the spine with severe angular kyphosis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To address the natural history of severe post-tuberculous (TB)   kyphosis, with focus upon the long-term neurological outcome, occurrence   of restrictive lung disease, and the effect on life expectancy. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This is a retrospective clinical review of prospectively collected   imaging data based at a single institute. A total of 24 patients   of Southern Chinese origin who presented with spinal TB with a mean   of 113° of kyphosis (65° to 159°) who fulfilled inclusion criteria   were reviewed. Plain radiographs were used to assess the degree   of spinal deformity. Myelography, CT and MRI were used when available   to assess the integrity of the spinal cord and canal. Patient demographics,   age of onset of spinal TB and interventions, types of surgical procedure,   intra- and post-operative complications, and neurological status   were assessed. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>All except one of the 24 patients were treated with anti-TB chemotherapy   when they were first diagnosed with spinal TB. They subsequently   received surgery either for neurological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deterior</span></strong>ation, or deformity   correction in later life. The mean follow-up was 34 years (11 to   59) since these surgical interventions. Some 16 patients (66.7%) suffered   from late neurological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deterior</span></strong>ation at a mean of 26 years (8 to   49) after the initial drug treatment. The causes of neurological   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deterior</span></strong>ation were healed disease in nine patients (56.2%),    re-activation in six patients (37.5%) and adjacent level spinal   stenosis in one patient (6.3%). The result of surgery was worse   in healed disease. Eight patients without neurological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deterior</span></strong>ation   received surgery to correct the kyphosis. The mean correction ranged   from 97° to 72°. Three patients who were clinically quiescent with   no neurological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deterior</span></strong>ation were found to have active TB of the   spine. Solid fusion was achieved in all cases and no patient suffered   from neurological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deterior</span></strong>ation after 42 years of follow-up. On   final follow-up, six patients were noted to have deceased (age range:   47 years to 75 years).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study presents one of the longest assessments of spinal TB   with severe kyphosis. Severe post-TB kyphosis may lead to significant   health problems many years following the initial drug treatment.   Early surgical correction of the kyphosis, solid fusion and regular   surveillance may avoid late complications. Paraplegia, restrictive   lung disease and early onset kyphosis might relate to early death.   Clinically quiescent disease does not mean cure. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1381–8.</p></sec>

Distinct control of PERIOD2 degradation and circadian rhythms by the oncoprotein and ubiquitin ligase MDM2
<p>The circadian clock relies on posttranslational modifications to set the timing for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of core regulatory components, which drives clock progression. Ubiquitin-modifying enzymes that target clock components for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation mainly recognize phosphorylated substrates. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of the circadian clock component PERIOD 2 (PER2) is mediated by its phospho-specific recognition by β-transducin repeat–containing proteins (β-TrCPs), which are F-box–containing proteins that function as substrate recognition subunits of the SCF<sup>β-TRCP</sup> ubiquitin ligase complex. However, this mode of regulating PER2 stability falls short of explaining the persistent oscillatory phenotypes reported in biological systems lacking functional elements of the phospho-dependent PER2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation machinery. We identified PER2 as a previously uncharacterized substrate for the ubiquitin ligase mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2) and found that MDM2 targeted PER2 for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation in a manner independent of PER2 phosphorylation. Deregulation of MDM2 plays a major role in oncogenesis by contributing to the accumulation of genomic and epigenomic alterations that favor tumor development. MDM2-mediated PER2 turnover was important for defining the circadian period length in mammalian cells, a finding that emphasizes the connection between the circadian clock and cancer. Our results not only broaden the range of specific substrates of MDM2 beyond the cell cycle to include circadian components but also identify a previously unknown regulator of the clock as a druggable node that is often found to be deregulated during tumorigenesis.</p>

Transcriptome Analysis Identifies a Zinc Finger Protein Regulating Starch Degradation in Kiwifruit
<p>Ripening, including softening, is a critical factor in determining the postharvest shelf-life of fruit and is controlled by enzymes involved in cell wall metabolism, starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation, and hormone metabolism. Here, we used a transcriptomics-based approach to identify transcriptional regulatory components associated with texture, ethylene, and starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation in ripening kiwifruit (<i>Actinidia deliciosa</i>). Twelve differentially expressed structural genes, including seven involved in cell wall metabolism, four in ethylene biosynthesis, and one in starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation, and 14 transcription factors (TFs) induced by exogenous ethylene treatment and inhibited by the ethylene signaling inhibitor 1-methylcyclopropene were identified as changing in transcript levels during ripening. Moreover, analysis of the regulatory effects of differentially expressed genes identified a zinc finger TF, DNA BINDING WITH ONE FINGER (AdDof3), which showed significant transactivation on the <i>AdBAM3L</i> (β-amylase) promoter. AdDof3 interacted physically with the <i>AdBAM3L</i> promoter, and stable overexpression of <i>AdBAM3L</i> resulted in lower starch content in transgenic kiwifruit leaves, suggesting that <i>AdBAM3L</i> is a key gene for starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation. Moreover, transient overexpression analysis showed that AdDof3 up-regulated <i>AdBAM3L</i> expression in kiwifruit. Thus, transcriptomics analysis not only allowed the prediction of some ripening-regulating genes but also facilitated the characterization of a TF, AdDof3, and a key structural gene, <i>AdBAM3L</i>, in starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation.</p>

The Ubiquitin E3 Ligase RHA2b Promotes Degradation of MYB30 in Abscisic Acid Signaling
<p>The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) is critical for plants encountering abiotic stress. We reported previously that the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) transcription factor MYB30 participates in ABA responses via SUMO ligase SAP-MIZ Domain-Containing SIZ1-mediated sumoylation. Here, we show that the RING-type ubiquitin E3 ligase RHA2b, which positively regulates ABA signaling, interacted with and ubiquitinated MYB30 to modulate MYB30 stability through the 26S proteasome pathway. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation rate of MYB30 was repressed significantly in the <i>rha2b-1</i> mutant. Phenotypic analyses showed that <i>MYB30</i> acts genetically downstream of <i>RHA2b</i> in ABA signaling. Substitutions of lysine-283 (K283) and K165 blocked ubiquitination, suggesting that these residues are sites of ubiquitination. K283 residue substitution significantly inhibited the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of MYB30 induced by ABA. The K165 site functioned additively with K283 in ABA-induced MYB30 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation and ABA responses. At the same time, sumoylation protected MYB30 from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation under cycloheximide and ABA treatment. Compared with MYB30, overexpression of MYB30-SUMO1 partially recovered the ABA sensitivity of <i>siz1-2</i>. But MYB30-SUMO1 exhibited similar localization with MYB30 in nuclei. Overall, our results suggest that RHA2b targets MYB30 for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation to modulate ABA signaling. Considering that the K283 residue also is the major site for sumoylation, we propose that sumoylation and ubiquitination act antagonistically in the ABA response to regulate the stability of MYB30 by occupying the same residue.</p>

Leaf Starch Turnover Occurs in Long Days and in Falling Light at the End of the Day
<p>We investigated whether starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation occurs at the same time as starch synthesis in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves in the light. Starch accumulated in a linear fashion for about 12 h after dawn, then accumulation slowed and content plateaued. Following decreases in light intensity, the rate of accumulation of starch declined in proportion to the decline in photosynthesis if the decrease occurred <10 h after dawn, but accumulation ceased or loss of starch occurred if the same decrease in light intensity was imposed more than 10 h after dawn. These changes in starch accumulation patterns after prolonged periods in the light occurred at both high and low starch contents and were not related to time-dependent changes in either the rate of photosynthesis or the partitioning of assimilate between starch and Suc, as assessed from metabolite measurements and <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> pulse experiments. Instead, measurements of incorporation of <sup>13</sup>C from <sup>13</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> into starch and of levels of the starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation product maltose showed that substantial starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation occurred simultaneously with synthesis at time points >14 h after dawn and in response to decreases in light intensity that occurred >10 h after dawn. Starch measurements in circadian clock mutants suggested that the clock influences the timing of onset of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation. We conclude that the propensity for leaf starch to be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ed increases with time after dawn. The importance of this phenomenon for efficient use of carbon for growth in long days and for prevention of starvation during twilight is discussed.</p>

Functional degradation: A mechanism of NLRP1 inflammasome activation by diverse pathogen enzymes
<p>Inflammasomes are multiprotein platforms that initiate innate immunity by recruitment and activation of caspase-1. The NLRP1B inflammasome is activated upon direct cleavage by the anthrax lethal toxin protease. However, the mechanism by which cleavage results in NLRP1B activation is unknown. In this study, we find that cleavage results in proteasome-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of the amino-terminal domains of NLRP1B, liberating a carboxyl-terminal fragment that is a potent caspase-1 activator. Proteasome-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of NLRP1B is both necessary and sufficient for NLRP1B activation. Consistent with our functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation model, we identify IpaH7.8, a <i>Shigella flexneri</i> ubiquitin ligase secreted effector, as an enzyme that induces NLRP1B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation and activation. Our results provide a unified mechanism for NLRP1B activation by diverse pathogen-encoded enzymatic activities.</p>

N-terminal degradation activates the NLRP1B inflammasome
<p>Intracellular pathogens and danger signals trigger the formation of inflammasomes, which activate inflammatory caspases and induce pyroptosis. The anthrax lethal factor metalloprotease and small-molecule DPP8/9 inhibitors both activate the NLRP1B inflammasome, but the molecular mechanism of NLRP1B activation is unknown. In this study, we used genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens to identify genes required for NLRP1B-mediated pyroptosis. We discovered that lethal factor induces cell death via the N-end rule proteasomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation pathway. Lethal factor directly cleaves NLRP1B, inducing the N-end rule–mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of the NLRP1B N terminus and freeing the NLRP1B C terminus to activate caspase-1. DPP8/9 inhibitors also induce proteasomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of the NLRP1B N terminus but not via the N-end rule pathway. Thus, N-terminal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation is the common activation mechanism of this innate immune sensor.</p>

Catalyst-controlled stereoselective cationic polymerization of vinyl ethers
<p>The tacticity of vinyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymer</span></strong>s has a profound effect on their physical properties. Despite the well-developed stereoselective methods for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymer</span></strong>ization of propylene and other nonpolar α-olefins, stereoselective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymer</span></strong>ization of polar vinyl monomers has proven more challenging. We have designed chiral counterions that systematically bias the reactivity and chain-end stereochemical environment during cationic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymer</span></strong>ization. This approach overrides conventional chain-end stereochemical bias to achieve catalyst-controlled stereoselective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymer</span></strong>ization. We demonstrate that this method is general to vinyl ether substrates, providing access to a range of isotactic poly(vinyl ether)s with high degrees of isotacticity. The obtained materials display the tensile properties of commercial polyolefins but adhere more strongly to polar substrates by an order of magnitude, indicating their promise for next-generation engineering applications.</p>

Structure basis for RNA-guided DNA degradation by Cascade and Cas3
<p>Type I CRISPR-Cas system features a sequential target-searching and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation process on double-stranded DNA by the RNA-guided Cascade (CRISPR associated complex for antiviral defense) complex and the nuclease-helicase fusion enzyme Cas3, respectively. Here, we present a 3.7-angstrom-resolution cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the Type I-E Cascade/R-loop/Cas3 complex, poised to initiate DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation. Cas3 distinguishes Cascade conformations and only captures the R-loop–forming Cascade, to avoid cleaving partially complementary targets. Its nuclease domain recruits the nontarget strand (NTS) DNA at a bulged region for the nicking of single-stranded DNA. An additional 4.7-angstrom-resolution cryo-EM structure captures the postnicking state, in which the severed NTS retracts to the helicase entrance, to be threaded for adenosine 5′-triphosphate–dependent processive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation.

CAT-tailing as a fail-safe mechanism for efficient degradation of stalled nascent polypeptides
<p>Ribosome stalling leads to recruitment of the ribosome quality control complex (RQC), which targets the partially synthesized polypeptide for proteasomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation through the action of the ubiquitin ligase Ltn1p. A second core RQC component, Rqc2p, modifies the nascent polypeptide by adding a carboxyl-terminal alanine and threonine (CAT) tail through a noncanonical elongation reaction. Here we examined the role of CAT-tailing in nascent-chain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation in budding yeast. We found that Ltn1p efficiently accessed only nascent-chain lysines immediately proximal to the ribosome exit tunnel. For substrates without Ltn1p-accessible lysines, CAT-tailing enabled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation by exposing lysines sequestered in the ribosome exit tunnel. Thus, CAT-tails do not serve as a degron, but rather provide a fail-safe mechanism that expands the range of RQC-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>able substrates.</p>

Nitric Oxide Remodels the Photosynthetic Apparatus upon S-Starvation in <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>
<p>Many photosynthetic autotrophs have evolved responses that adjust their metabolism to limitations in nutrient availability. Here we report a detailed characterization of the remodeling of photosynthesis upon sulfur starvation under heterotrophy and photo-autotrophy in the green alga (<i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>). Photosynthetic inactivation under low light and darkness is achieved through specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of Rubisco and cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub><i>f</i> and occurs only in the presence of reduced carbon in the medium. The process is likely regulated by nitric oxide (NO), which is produced 24 h after the onset of starvation, as detected with NO-sensitive fluorescence probes visualized by fluorescence microscopy. We provide pharmacological evidence that intracellular NO levels govern this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation pathway: the addition of a NO scavenger decreases the rate of cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub><i>f</i> and Rubisco <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation, whereas NO donors accelerate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation. Based on our analysis of the relative contribution of the different NO synthesis pathways, we conclude that the NO<sub>2</sub>-dependent nitrate reductase-independent pathway is crucial for NO production under sulfur starvation. Our data argue for an active role for NO in the remodeling of thylakoid protein complexes upon sulfur starvation.</p>

Control of Retrograde Signaling by Rapid Turnover of GENOMES UNCOUPLED1
<p>The exchange of signals between cellular compartments coordinates development and differentiation, modulates metabolic pathways, and triggers responses to environmental conditions. The proposed central regulator of plastid-to-nucleus retrograde signaling, GENOMES UNCOUPLED1 (GUN1), is present at very low levels, which has hampered the discovery of its precise molecular function. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) GUN1 protein accumulates to detectable levels only at very early stages of leaf development, where it functions in the regulation of chloroplast biogenesis. <i>GUN1</i> mRNA is present at high levels in all tissues, but GUN1 protein undergoes rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation (with an estimated half-life of ∼4 h) in all tissues where chloroplast biogenesis has been completed. The rapid turnover of GUN1 is controlled mainly by the chaperone ClpC1, suggesting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of GUN1 by the Clp protease. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of GUN1 slows under stress conditions that alter retrograde signaling, thus ensuring that the plant has sufficient GUN1 protein. We also find that the pentatricopeptide repeat motifs of GUN1 are important determinants of GUN1 stability. Moreover, overexpression of <i>GUN1</i> causes an early flowering phenotype, suggesting a function of GUN1 in developmental phase transitions beyond chloroplast biogenesis. Taken together, our results provide new insight into the regulation of GUN1 by proteolytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation, uncover its function in early chloroplast biogenesis, and suggest a role in developmental phase transitions.</p>

Higher Novel L-Cys Degradation Activity Results in Lower Organic-S and Biomass in <i>Sarcocornia</i> than the Related Saltwort, <i>Salicornia</i>
<p><i>Salicornia</i> and <i>Sarcocornia</i> are almost identical halophytes whose edible succulent shoots hold promise for commercial production in saline water. Enhanced sulfur nutrition may be beneficial to crops naturally grown on high sulfate. However, little is known about sulfate nutrition in halophytes. Here we show that <i>Salicornia europaea</i> (ecotype RN) exhibits a significant increase in biomass and organic-S accumulation in response to supplemental sulfate, whereas <i>Sarcocornia fruticosa</i> (ecotype VM) does not, instead exhibiting increased sulfate accumulation. We investigated the role of two pathways on organic-S and biomass accumulation in <i>Salicornia</i> and <i>Sarcoconia</i>: the sulfate reductive pathway that generates Cys and <sc>l</sc>-Cys desulfhydrase that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>es Cys to H<sub>2</sub>S, NH<sub>3</sub>, and pyruvate. The major function of <i>O</i>-acetyl-Ser-(thiol) lyase (OAS-TL; EC 2.5.1.47) is the formation of <sc>l</sc>-Cys, but our study shows that the OAS-TL A and OAS-TL B of both halophytes are enzymes that also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>e <sc>l</sc>-Cys to H<sub>2</sub>S. This activity was significantly higher in <i>Sarcocornia</i> than in <i>Salicornia</i>, especially upon sulfate supplementation. The activity of the sulfate reductive pathway key enzyme, adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate reductase (APR, EC 1.8.99.2), was significantly higher in <i>Salicornia</i> than in <i>Sarcocornia</i>. These results suggest that the low organic-S level in <i>Sarcocornia</i> is the result of high <sc>l</sc>-Cys <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation rate by OAS-TLs, whereas the greater organic-S and biomass accumulation in <i>Salicornia</i> is the result of higher APR activity and low <sc>l</sc>-Cys <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation rate, resulting in higher net Cys biosynthesis. These results present an initial road map for halophyte growers to attain better growth rates and nutritional value of <i>Salicornia</i> and <i>Sarcocornia</i>.</p>

Suppressor of Overexpression of CO 1 Negatively Regulates Dark-Induced Leaf Degreening and Senescence by Directly Repressing Pheophytinase and Other Senescence-Associated Genes in Arabidopsis
<p>Although the biochemical pathway of chlorophyll (Chl) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation has been largely elucidated, how Chl is rapidly yet coordinately <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ed during leaf senescence remains elusive. Pheophytinase (PPH) is the enzyme for catalyzing the removal of the phytol group from pheophytin <i>a</i>, and <i>PPH</i> expression is significantly induced during leaf senescence. To elucidate the transcriptional regulation of <i>PPH</i>, we used a yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) one-hybrid system to screen for its trans-regulators. SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CO 1 (SOC1), a key flowering pathway integrator, was initially identified as one of the putative trans-regulators of <i>PPH</i>. After dark treatment, leaves of an <i>SOC1</i> knockdown mutant (<i>soc1-6</i>) showed an accelerated yellowing phenotype, whereas those of <i>SOC1</i>-overexpressing lines exhibited a partial stay-green phenotype. <i>SOC1</i> and <i>PPH</i> expression showed a negative correlation during leaf senescence. Substantially, SOC1 protein could bind specifically to the CArG box of the <i>PPH</i> promoter in vitro and in vivo, and overexpression of <i>SOC1</i> significantly inhibited the transcriptional activity of the <i>PPH</i> promoter in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) protoplasts. Importantly, <i>soc1-6 pph-1</i> (a <i>PPH</i> knockout mutant) double mutant displayed a stay-green phenotype similar to that of <i>pph-1</i> during dark treatment. These results demonstrated that SOC1 inhibits Chl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation via negatively regulating <i>PPH</i> expression. In addition, measurement of the Chl content and the maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II of <i>soc1-6</i> and <i>SOC1-OE</i> leaves after dark treatment suggested that SOC1 also negatively regulates the general senescence process. Seven <i>SENESCENCE-ASSOCIATED GENES</i> (<i>SAGs</i>) were thereafter identified as its potential target genes, and <i>NONYELLOWING1</i> and <i>SAG113</i> were experimentally confirmed. Together, we reveal that SOC1 represses dark-induced leaf Chl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation and senescence in general in Arabidopsis.</p>

Targeting Transmembrane BAX Inhibitor Motif Containing 1 Alleviates Pathological Cardiac Hypertrophy

Abnormal protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation, especially the impaired lysosomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of large organelles and membrane proteins, is involved in the progression of cardiac hypertrophy. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We investigated cardiac transmembrane BAX inhibitor motif containing 1 (TMBIM1) mRNA and protein expression levels in samples from patients with heart failure and mice with aortic banding (AB)–induced cardiac hypertrophy. We generated cardiac-specific <i>Tmbim1</i> knockout mice and cardiac-specific <i>Tmbim1</i>-overexpressing transgenic mice and then challenged them with AB surgery. We used microarray, confocal image, and coimmunoprecipitation analyses to identify the downstream targets of TMBIM1 in cardiac hypertrophy. <i>Tmbim1</i>/<i>Tlr4</i> double-knockout mice were generated to investigate whether the effects of TMBIM1 on cardiac hypertrophy were Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) dependent. Finally, lentivirus-mediated <i>TMBIM1</i> overexpression in a monkey AB model was performed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of TMBIM1.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>TMBIM1 expression was significantly downregulated on hypertrophic stimuli in both human and mice heart samples. Silencing cardiac <i>Tmbim1</i> aggravated AB-induced cardiac hypertrophy. This effect was blunted by <i>Tmbim1</i> overexpression. Transcriptome profiling revealed that the TLR4 signaling pathway was disrupted dramatically by manipulation of <i>Tmbim1</i>. The effects of TMBIM1 on cardiac hypertrophy were shown to be dependent on TLR4 in double-knockout mice.

Noncanonical NF-κB Activation by the Oncoprotein Tio Occurs Through a Nonconserved TRAF3-Binding Motif
<sec><title>Preventing NF-κB Pathway Crosstalk</title><p>The transcription factor NF-κB (nuclear factor κB) can be activated by so-called canonical and noncanonical pathways. Activation of the noncanonical NF-κB pathway blocks the constitutive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of the kinase NIK (NF-κB–inducing kinase), which leads to the generation of an NF-κB subunit required for target gene expression. The viral oncoprotein Tio mimics a constitutively active receptor upstream of NF-κB signaling, and de Jong <i>et al</i>. found that it contains a binding motif not conserved in other proteins that bind to TRAF3 (tumor necrosis factor receptor–associated factor 3), an inhibitor of noncanonical NF-κB signaling. This TRAF3-binding motif enabled Tio to specifically activate noncanonical NF-κB signaling without triggering crosstalk with the canonical pathway. Tio signaling did not result in TRAF3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation; rather, it induced the sequestration of a TRAF3-containing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ative complex from NIK to stimulate the noncanonical pathway. These data suggest that Tio might be used as a tool to examine the specific activation of genes targeted by noncanonical NF-κB signaling in the context of viral transformation. </p></sec>

RIT1 oncoproteins escape LZTR1-mediated proteolysis
<p>RIT1 oncoproteins have emerged as an etiologic factor in Noonan syndrome and cancer. Despite the resemblance of RIT1 to other members of the Ras small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases), mutations affecting RIT1 are not found in the classic hotspots but rather in a region near the switch II domain of the protein. We used an isogenic germline knock-in mouse model to study the effects of RIT1 mutation at the organismal level, which resulted in a phenotype resembling Noonan syndrome. By mass spectrometry, we detected a RIT1 interactor, leucine zipper–like transcription regulator 1 (LZTR1), that acts as an adaptor for protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation. Pathogenic mutations affecting either RIT1 or LZTR1 resulted in incomplete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of RIT1. This led to RIT1 accumulation and dysregulated growth factor signaling responses. Our results highlight a mechanism of pathogenesis that relies on impaired protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of the Ras GTPase RIT1.</p>

Single polymer growth dynamics
<p>In chain-growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymer</span></strong>ization, a chain grows continually to reach thousands of subunits. However, the real-time dynamics of chain growth remains unknown.

A cyclic oligonucleotide signaling pathway in type III CRISPR-Cas systems
<p>Type III CRISPR-Cas systems in prokaryotes provide immunity against invading nucleic acids through the coordinated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of transcriptionally active DNA and its transcripts by the Csm effector complex. The Cas10 subunit of the complex contains an HD nuclease domain that is responsible for DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation and two Palm domains with elusive functions. In addition, Csm6, a ribonuclease that is not part of the complex, is also required to provide full immunity. We show here that target RNA binding by the Csm effector complex of <i>Streptococcus thermophilus</i> triggers Cas10 to synthesize cyclic oligoadenylates (cA<i><sub>n</sub></i>; <i>n</i> = 2 to 6) by means of the Palm domains. Acting as signaling molecules, cyclic oligoadenylates bind Csm6 to activate its nonspecific RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation.

New developments for protein quality control
<p>The cellular proteome is maintained by a dynamic balance between protein synthesis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation, known as proteostasis. An imperative of successful proteostasis is the detection and removal of misfolded proteins by quality control pathways. Proteins that result from translation errors, misfolding, or age-induced or chemical damage, as well as orphan proteins (which result from inappropriate stoichiometry of multiprotein complexes), are all subject to a variety of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ative pathways to limit their cellular accumulation, which can be toxic (<i>1</i>). One of the striking features of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ative quality control is the juxtaposition of high specificity for misfolded versions of normal proteins with the very broad range of substrates that can be accommodated by each pathway. On pages 472 and 471 of this issue, Yanagitani <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) and Nguyen <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>), respectively, show that a newly discovered quality control pathway is used to bring about the sweeping changes in proteome content that are observed in the differentiation of relatively “cellular” reticulocytes to the highly specialized hemoglobin-rich red blood cells (erythrocytes) (<i>4</i>, <i>5</i>).</p>

Early Senescence in Older Leaves of Low Nitrate-Grown <i>Atxdh1</i> Uncovers a Role for Purine Catabolism in N Supply
<p>The nitrogen (N)-rich ureides allantoin and allantoate, which are products of purine catabolism, play a role in N delivery in Leguminosae. Here, we examined their role as an N source in nonlegume plants using Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants mutated in XANTHINE DEHYDROGENASE1 (AtXDH1), a catalytic bottleneck in purine catabolism. Older leaves of the <i>Atxdh1</i> mutant exhibited early senescence, lower soluble protein, and lower organic N levels as compared with wild-type older leaves when grown with 1 m<sc>m</sc> nitrate but were comparable to the wild type under 5 m<sc>m</sc> nitrate. Similar nitrate-dependent senescence phenotypes were evident in the older leaves of <i>allantoinase</i> (<i>Ataln</i>) and <i>allantoate amidohydrolase</i> (<i>Ataah</i>) mutants, which also are impaired in purine catabolism. Under low-nitrate conditions, xanthine accumulated in older leaves of <i>Atxdh1</i>, whereas allantoin accumulated in both older and younger leaves of <i>Ataln</i> but not in wild-type leaves, indicating the remobilization of xanthine-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ed products from older to younger leaves. Supporting this notion, ureide transporter expression was enhanced in older leaves of the wild type in low-nitrate as compared with high-nitrate conditions. Elevated transcripts and proteins of AtXDH and AtAAH were detected in low-nitrate-grown wild-type plants, indicating regulation at protein and transcript levels. The higher nitrate reductase activity in <i>Atxdh1</i> leaves compared with wild-type leaves indicated a need for nitrate assimilation products. Together, these results indicate that the absence of remobilized purine-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ed N from older leaves of <i>Atxdh1</i> caused senescence symptoms, a result of higher chloroplastic protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation in older leaves of low-nitrate-grown plants.</p>

Decoys Untangle Complicated Redundancy and Reveal Targets of Circadian Clock F-Box Proteins
<p>Eukaryotic circadian clocks utilize the ubiquitin proteasome system to precisely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>e clock proteins. In plants, the F-box-type E3 ubiquitin ligases ZEITLUPE (ZTL), FLAVIN-BINDING, KELCH REPEAT, F-BOX1 (FKF1), and LOV KELCH PROTEIN2 (LKP2) regulate clock period and couple the clock to photoperiodic flowering in response to end-of-day light conditions. To better understand their functions, we expressed decoy ZTL, FKF1, and LKP2 proteins that associate with target proteins but are unable to ubiquitylate their targets in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). These dominant-negative forms of the proteins inhibit the ubiquitylation of target proteins and allow for the study of ubiquitylation-independent and -dependent functions of ZTL, FKF1, and LKP2. We demonstrate the effects of expressing ZTL, FKF1, and LKP2 decoys on the circadian clock and flowering time. Furthermore, the decoy E3 ligases trap substrate interactions, and using immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry, we identify interacting partners. We focus studies on the clock transcription factor CCA1 HIKING EXPEDITION (CHE) and show that ZTL interacts directly with CHE and can mediate CHE ubiquitylation. We also demonstrate that CHE protein is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ed in the dark and that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation is reduced in a <i>ztl</i> mutant plant, showing that CHE is a bona fide ZTL target protein. This work increases our understanding of the genetic and biochemical roles for ZTL, FKF1, and LKP2 and also demonstrates an effective methodology for studying complicated genetic redundancy among E3 ubiquitin ligases.</p>

Boron-Dependent Translational Suppression of the Borate Exporter <i>BOR1</i> Contributes to the Avoidance of Boron Toxicity
<p>Boron (B) is an essential element for plants; however, as high B concentrations are toxic, B transport must be tightly regulated. BOR1 is a borate exporter in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) that facilitates B translocation into shoots under B deficiency conditions. When the B supply is sufficient, <i>BOR1</i> expression is down-regulated by selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of BOR1 protein, while additional <i>BOR1</i> regulatory mechanisms are proposed to exist. In this study, we identified a novel B-dependent <i>BOR1</i> translational suppression mechanism. In vivo and in vitro reporter assays demonstrated that <i>BOR1</i> translation was reduced in a B-dependent manner and that the 5′-untranslated region was both necessary and sufficient for this process. Mutational analysis revealed that multiple upstream open reading frames in the 5′-untranslated region were required for <i>BOR1</i> translational suppression, and this process depended on the efficiency of translational reinitiation at the <i>BOR1</i> open reading frame after translation of the upstream open reading frames. To understand the physiological significance of <i>BOR1</i> regulation, we characterized transgenic plants defective in either one or both of the <i>BOR1</i> regulation mechanisms. <i>BOR1</i> translational suppression was induced at higher B concentrations than those triggering BOR1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation. Plants lacking both regulation mechanisms exhibited more severe shoot growth reduction under high-B conditions than did plants lacking BOR1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation alone, thus demonstrating the importance of <i>BOR1</i> translational suppression. This study demonstrates that two mechanisms of posttranscriptional <i>BOR1</i> regulation, each induced under different B concentrations, contribute to the avoidance of B toxicity in plants.</p>

The Kinase OsCPK4 Regulates a Buffering Mechanism That Fine-Tunes Innate Immunity
<p>The calcium-dependent protein kinase OsCPK4 has been demonstrated to play important roles in salt and drought tolerance, plant growth, and development in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). However, little is known about molecular mechanisms underlying OsCPK4 function in rice immunity. In this study, we demonstrated that the generation of oxidative burst and pathogenesis-related gene expression triggered by microbe-associated molecular patterns were significantly enhanced in the <i>oscpk4</i> mutants. These mutant lines are more resistant to bacterial blight and fungal blast diseases than the wild-type plants, indicating that OsCPK4 negatively regulates innate immunity in rice. OsCPK4 was further identified to interact with a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase OsRLCK176. OsRLCK176 accumulation is negatively regulated by OsCPK4. Interestingly, the kinase-dead OsCPK4 promotes OsRLCK176 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation more strongly than the wild-type protein. OsCPK4 and OsRLCK176 mutually phosphorylate each other and form a feedback loop. Moreover, the kinase activity and phosphorylation of OsCPK4 and OsRLCK176 contribute to the stability of OsRLCK176. These findings indicate that the kinase-inactive OsCPK4 promotes OsRLCK176 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation and restricts plant defenses, whereas the activation of OsCPK4-OsRLCK176 phosphorylation circuit invalidates the OsRLCK176 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation machinery, thus enhancing plant immunity. Collectively, the study proposes a novel defense buffering mechanism mediated by OsCPK4, which fine-tunes microbe-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity in rice.</p>

Gibberellin Induces an Increase in Cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> via a DELLA-Independent Signaling Pathway
<p>DELLA proteins play a central role in gibberellin (GA) signaling. GA triggers DELLA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, thereby promoting plant growth. An increase in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub>) was observed previously after several hours of GA application.

This study reexamined the effects of GAs on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> using the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor protein aequorin in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>).

The E3 Ligase TaSAP5 Alters Drought Stress Responses by Promoting the Degradation of DRIP Proteins
<p>In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants growing under normal conditions, DEHYDRATION-RESPONSIVE ELEMENT BINDING PROTEIN2A (DREB2A) is present at low levels because it is ubiquitinated and destabilized by DREB2A INTERACTING PROTEIN1 (DRIP1) and DRIP2 through 26S proteasome-mediated proteolysis. Drought stress counteracts the ubiquitination and proteolysis of DREB2A, thus allowing the accumulation of sufficient amounts of DREB2A protein to activate downstream gene expression. The mechanisms leading to drought stress-mediated DREB2A accumulation are still unclear. Here, we report that the wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) TaSAP5 protein, which contains an A20/AN1 domain, acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to mediate DRIP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation and thus increase DREB2A protein levels. Drought induces <i>TaSAP5</i> expression in wheat, and <i>TaSAP5</i> overexpression in Arabidopsis and wheat seedlings increased their drought tolerance, as measured by survival rate and grain yield under severe drought stress. TaSAP5 can interact with and ubiquitinate TaDRIP, as well as AtDRIP1 and AtDRIP2, leading to their subsequent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation through the 26S proteasome pathway. Consistent with this, <i>TaSAP5</i> overexpression enhances DRIP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation and increases the levels of DREB2A protein and its downstream targets. These results suggest that TaSAP5 acts to link drought with DREB2A accumulation and illustrate the molecular mechanisms involved in this process.</p>

The RING-Type E3 Ligase XBAT35.2 Is Involved in Cell Death Induction and Pathogen Response
<p>XBAT35 belongs to a subfamily of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) RING-type E3s that are similar in domain architecture to the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) XA21 Binding Protein3, a defense protein. The <i>XBAT35</i> transcript undergoes alternative splicing to produce two protein isoforms, XBAT35.1 and XBAT35.2. Here, we demonstrate that XBAT35.2 localizes predominantly to the Golgi and is involved in cell death induction and pathogen response. XBAT35.2, but not XBAT35.1, was found to trigger cell death when overexpressed in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>) leaves and does so in a manner that requires its RING domain. Loss of <i>XBAT35</i> gene function disrupts the plant’s ability to defend against pathogen attack, whereas overexpression of <i>XBAT35.2</i> enhances resistance to pathogens. XBAT35.2 was found to be unstable and promotes its own <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation, suggesting self-regulation. Inoculation with virulent and avirulent strains of the bacterial pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> DC3000 results in a drastic reduction in the levels of ubiquitinated XBAT35.2 and an increase in the abundance of the E3. This implies that pathogen infection prohibits XBAT35.2 self-regulation and stabilizes the E3. In agreement with a role in defending against pathogens, XBAT35.2 interacts with defense-related Accelerated Cell Death11 (ACD11) in planta and promotes the proteasome-dependent turnover of ACD11 in cell-free <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation assays. In accordance with regulation by a stabilized XBAT35.2, the levels of ubiquitinated ACD11 increased considerably, and the abundance of ACD11 was reduced following pathogen infection. In addition, treatment of transgenic seedlings with a proteasome inhibitor results in the accumulation of ACD11, confirming proteasome-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation. Collectively, these results highlight a novel role for XBAT35.2 in cell death induction and defense against pathogens.</p>

Synthesis and Self-Assembly of Cellulose Microfibrils from Reconstituted Cellulose Synthase
<p>Cellulose, the major component of plant cell walls, can be converted to bioethanol and is thus highly studied. In plants, cellulose is produced by cellulose synthase, a processive family-2 glycosyltransferase. In plant cell walls, individual β-1,4-glucan chains <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymer</span></strong>ized by CesA are assembled into microfibrils that are frequently bundled into macrofibrils. An in vitro system in which cellulose is synthesized and assembled into fibrils would facilitate detailed study of this process. Here, we report the heterologous expression and partial purification of His-tagged CesA5 from <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. Immunoblot analysis and mass spectrometry confirmed enrichment of PpCesA5. The recombinant protein was functional when reconstituted into liposomes made from yeast total lipid extract. The functional studies included incorporation of radiolabeled Glc, linkage analysis, and imaging of cellulose microfibril formation using transmission electron microscopy. Several microfibrils were observed either inside or on the outer surface of proteoliposomes, and strikingly, several thinner fibrils formed ordered bundles that either covered the surfaces of proteoliposomes or were spawned from liposome surfaces. We also report this arrangement of fibrils made by proteoliposomes bearing CesA8 from hybrid aspen. These observations describe minimal systems of membrane-reconstituted CesAs that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymer</span></strong>ize β-1,4-glucan chains that coalesce to form microfibrils and higher-ordered macrofibrils. How these micro- and macrofibrils relate to those found in primary and secondary plant cell walls is uncertain, but their presence enables further study of the mechanisms that govern the formation and assembly of fibrillar cellulosic structures and cell wall composites during or after the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymer</span></strong>ization process controlled by CesA proteins.</p>

5′ to 3′ mRNA Decay Contributes to the Regulation of Arabidopsis Seed Germination by Dormancy
<p>The regulation of plant gene expression, necessary for development and adaptive responses, relies not only on RNA transcription but also on messenger RNA (mRNA) fate. To understand whether seed germination relies on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of specific subsets of mRNA, we investigated whether the 5′ to 3′ RNA decay machinery participated in the regulation of this process. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seeds of <i>exoribonuclease4</i> (<i>xrn4</i>) and <i>varicose</i> (<i>vcs</i>) mutants displayed distinct dormancy phenotypes. Transcriptome analysis <i>of xrn4-5</i> and <i>vcs-8</i> mutant seeds allowed us to identify genes that are likely to play a role in the control of germination. Study of 5′ untranslated region features of these transcripts revealed that specific motifs, secondary energy, and GC content could play a role in their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation by XRN4 and VCS, and Gene Ontology clustering revealed novel actors of seed dormancy and germination. Several specific transcripts identified as being putative targets of XRN4 and VCS in seeds (<i>PECTIN LYASE-LIKE</i>, <i>ASPARTYL PROTEASE</i>, <i>DWD-HYPERSENSITIVE-TO-ABA3</i>, and <i>YELLOW STRIPE-LIKE5</i>) were further studied by reverse genetics, and their functional roles in the germination process were confirmed by mutant analysis. These findings suggest that completion of germination and its regulation by dormancy also depend on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of specific subsets of mRNA.</p>

Three Pectin Methylesterase Inhibitors Protect Cell Wall Integrity for Arabidopsis Immunity to <i>Botrytis</i>
<p>Infection by necrotrophs is a complex process that starts with the breakdown of the cell wall (CW) matrix initiated by CW-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ing enzymes and results in an extensive tissue maceration. Plants exploit induced defense mechanisms based on biochemical modification of the CW components to protect themselves from enzymatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation. The pectin matrix is the main CW target of <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>, and pectin methylesterification status is strongly altered in response to infection. The methylesterification of pectin is controlled mainly by pectin methylesterases (PMEs), whose activity is posttranscriptionally regulated by endogenous protein inhibitors (PMEIs). Here, AtPMEI10, AtPMEI11, and AtPMEI12 are identified as functional PMEIs induced in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) during <i>B. cinerea</i> infection. AtPMEI expression is strictly regulated by jasmonic acid and ethylene signaling, while only AtPMEI11 expression is controlled by PME-related damage-associated molecular patterns, such as oligogalacturonides and methanol. The decrease of pectin methylesterification during infection is higher and the immunity to <i>B. cinerea</i> is compromised in <i>pmei10</i>, <i>pmei11</i>, and <i>pmei12</i> mutants with respect to the control plants. A higher stimulation of the fungal oxalic acid biosynthetic pathway also can contribute to the higher susceptibility of <i>pmei</i> mutants. The lack of <i>PMEI</i> expression does not affect hemicellulose strengthening, callose deposition, and the synthesis of structural defense proteins, proposed as CW-remodeling mechanisms exploited by Arabidopsis to resist CW <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation upon <i>B. cinerea</i> infection. We show that PME activity and pectin methylesterification are dynamically modulated by PMEIs during <i>B. cinerea</i> infection. Our findings point to AtPMEI10, AtPMEI11, and AtPMEI12 as mediators of CW integrity maintenance in plant immunity.</p>

(2) In anthers, <i>MON1</i> showed preferential high level expression in tapetal cell layers and pollen. (3) The <i>mon1</i> mutants exhibited delayed tapetum degeneration and tapetal PCD, resulting in abnormal pollen coat formation and decreased male fertility. (4) MON1/CALCIUM CAFFEINE ZINC SENSITIVITY1 (CCZ1)-mediated Rab7 activation was indispensable for vacuolar trafficking of tapetum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation-related cysteine proteases, supporting that PCD-triggered tapetum degeneration requires Rab7-mediated vacuolar trafficking of these cysteine proteases. (5) <i>MON1</i> mutations also resulted in defective pollen germination and tube growth. Taken together, tapetal PCD and pollen development require successful MON1/CCZ1-mediated vacuolar transport in Arabidopsis.</p>

<p>Iron (Fe) homeostasis is crucial for plant growth and development. A network of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors positively regulates Fe uptake during iron deficiency. However, their up-regulation or overexpression leads to Fe overload and reactive oxygen species generation, thereby damaging the plants. Here, we found that two BTB/TAZ proteins, MdBT1 and MdBT2, interact with the MbHLH104 protein in apple. In addition, the function of MdBT2 was characterized as a regulator of MdbHLH104 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation via ubiquitination and the 26S proteasome pathway, thereby controlling the activity of plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases and the acquisition of iron. Furthermore, MdBT2 interacted with MdCUL3 proteins, which were required for the MdBT2-mediated ubiquitination modification of MdbHLH104 and its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation. In sum, our findings demonstrate that MdBT proteins interact with MdCUL3 to bridge the formation of the MdBTs<sup>MdCUL3</sup> complex, which negatively modulates the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of the MdbHLH104 protein in response to changes in Fe status to maintain iron homeostasis in plants.</p>

A Rice Ca<sup>2+</sup> Binding Protein Is Required for Tapetum Function and Pollen Formation
<p>In flowering plants, successful male reproduction requires the sophisticated interaction between somatic anther wall layers and reproductive cells. Timely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of the innermost tissue of the anther wall layer, the tapetal layer, is critical for pollen development. Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a well-known stimulus for plant development, but whether it plays a role in affecting male reproduction remains elusive. Here we report a role of Defective in Exine Formation 1 (OsDEX1) in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), a Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding protein, in regulating rice tapetal cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation and pollen formation. In <i>osdex1</i> anthers, tapetal cell degeneration is delayed and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of the callose wall surrounding the microspores is compromised, leading to aborted pollen formation and complete male sterility. <i>OsDEX1</i> is expressed in tapetal cells and microspores during early anther development. Recombinant OsDEX1 is able to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> and regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in vitro, and <i>osdex1</i> exhibited disturbed Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in tapetal cells. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that OsDEX1 may have a conserved function in binding Ca<sup>2+</sup> in flowering plants, and genetic complementation of pollen wall defects of an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>dex1</i> mutant confirmed its evolutionary conservation in pollen development. Collectively, these findings suggest that OsDEX1 plays a fundamental role in the development of tapetal cells and pollen formation, possibly via modulating the Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis during pollen development.</p>

A SAP domain-containing protein shuttles between the nucleus and cell membranes and plays a role in adhesion and migration in <i>D. discoideum</i>
<p>The AmpA protein reduces cell adhesion, thereby influencing cell migration in <i>Dictyostelium</i>. To understand how <i>ampA</i> influences cell migration, second site suppressors of an AmpA overexpressing cell line were created by REMI mutagenesis. Mutant candidates were identified by their ability to suppress the large plaques that the AmpA overexpressing cells form on bacterial lawns as a result of their increased rate of migration. One suppressor gene, <i>sma</i>, encodes an uncharacterized protein, which contains a SAP DNA-binding domain and a PTEN-like domain. Using <i>sma</i> gene knockouts and Sma-mRFP expressing cell lines, a role for <i>sma</i> in influencing cell migration was uncovered. Knockouts of the <i>sma</i> gene in a wild-type background enhanced chemotaxis. An additional role for Sma in influencing cell–cell adhesion was also demonstrated. Sma protein transitions between cytosolic and nuclear localizations as a function of cell density. In growing cells migrating to folic acid it is localized to regions of actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymer</span></strong>ization and absent from the nucleus. A role for Sma in influencing <i>ampA</i> mRNA levels is also demonstrated. Sma additionally appears to be involved in <i>ampA</i> pathways regulating cell size, actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymer</span></strong>ization, and cell substrate adhesion. We present insights to the SAP domain-containing group of proteins in <i>Dictyostelium</i> and provide evidence of a role for a SAP domain-containing protein shuttling from the nucleus to sites of actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymer</span></strong>ization during chemotaxis to folic acid and influencing the efficiency of migration.</p>

A Temperature-Sensitive Misfolded bri1-301 Receptor Requires Its Kinase Activity to Promote Growth
<p>BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE1 (BRI1) is a leucine-rich-repeat receptor-like kinase that functions as the cell surface receptor for brassinosteroids (BRs). Previous studies showed that BRI1 requires its kinase activity to transduce the extracellular BR signal into the nucleus. Among the many reported mutant <i>bri1</i> alleles, <i>bri1-301</i> is unique, as its glycine-989-to-isoleucine mutation completely inhibits its kinase activity in vitro but only gives rise to a weak dwarf phenotype compared with strong or null <i>bri1</i> alleles, raising the question of whether kinase activity is essential for the biological function of BRI1. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) bri1-301 mutant receptor exhibits weak BR-triggered phosphorylation in vivo and absolutely requires its kinase activity for the limited growth that occurs in the <i>bri1-301</i> mutant. We also show that bri1-301 is a temperature-sensitive misfolded protein that is rapidly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ed in the endoplasmic reticulum and at the plasma membrane by yet unknown mechanisms. A temperature increase from 22°C to 29°C reduced the protein stability and biochemical activity of bri1-301, likely due to temperature-enhanced protein misfolding. The bri1-301 protein could be used as a model to study the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation machinery for misfolded membrane proteins with cytosolic structural lesions and the plasma membrane-associated protein quality-control mechanism.</p>

Differential Roles of the Thylakoid Lumenal Deg Protease Homologs in Chloroplast Proteostasis<xref><sup>,2</sup></xref>
<p>Deg proteases are involved in protein quality control in prokaryotes. Of the three Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) homologs, Deg1, Deg5, and Deg8, located in the thylakoid lumen, Deg1 forms a homohexamer, whereas Deg5 and Deg8 form a heterocomplex. Both Deg1 and Deg5-Deg8 were shown separately to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>e photosynthetic proteins during photoinhibition. To investigate whether Deg1 and Deg5-Deg8 are redundant, a full set of Arabidopsis <i>Deg</i> knockout mutants were generated and their phenotypes were compared. Under all conditions tested, <i>deg1</i> mutants were affected more than the wild type and <i>deg5</i> and <i>deg8</i> mutants. Moreover, overexpression of Deg5-Deg8 could only partially compensate for the loss of Deg1. Comparative proteomics of <i>deg1</i> mutants revealed moderate up-regulation of thylakoid proteins involved in photoprotection, assembly, repair, and housekeeping and down-regulation of those that form photosynthetic complexes. Quantification of protein levels in the wild type revealed that Deg1 was 2-fold more abundant than Deg5-Deg8. Moreover, recombinant Deg1 displayed higher in vitro proteolytic activity. Affinity enrichment assays revealed that Deg1 was precipitated with very few interacting proteins, whereas Deg5-Deg8 was associated with a number of thylakoid proteins, including D1, OECs, LHCBs, Cyt <i>b</i><sub>6</sub><i>f</i>, and NDH subunits, thus implying that Deg5-Deg8 is capable of binding substrates but is unable to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>e them efficiently. This work suggests that differences in protein abundance and proteolytic activity underlie the differential importance of Deg1 and Deg5-Deg8 protease complexes observed in vivo.</p>

The Photosystem II Repair Cycle Requires FtsH Turnover through the EngA GTPase
<p>Specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of photodamaged D1, the photosystem II (PSII) reaction center protein, is a crucial step in the PSII repair cycle to maintain photosynthesis activity. Processive proteolysis by the FtsH protease is fundamental to cooperative D1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation. Here, we attempted to purify the FtsH complex to elucidate its regulation mechanisms and substrate recognition in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Unlike previously reported prokaryotic and mitochondrial FtsHs, the Arabidopsis chloroplastic FtsH does not appear to form a megacomplex with prohibition-like proteins but instead accumulates as smaller complexes. The copurified fraction was enriched with a partial PSII intermediate presumably undergoing repair, although its precise properties were not fully clarified. In addition, we copurified a bacteria-type GTPase localized in chloroplasts, EngA, and confirmed its interaction with FtsH by subsequent pull-down and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays. While the <i>engA</i> mutation is embryo lethal, the transgenic lines overexpressing EngA (EngA-OX) showed leaf variegation reminiscent of the variegated mutant lacking FtsH2. EngA-OX was revealed to accumulate more cleaved D1 fragments and reactive oxygen species than the wild type, indicative of compromised PSII repair. Based on these results and the fact that FtsH becomes more stable in EngA-OX, we propose that EngA negatively regulates FtsH stability. We demonstrate that proper FtsH turnover is crucial for PSII repair in the chloroplasts of Arabidopsis. Consistent with the increased turnover of FtsH under high-light conditions in <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, our findings underline the rapid turnover of not only D1 but also FtsH proteases in the PSII repair cycle.</p>

Physio-Genetic Dissection of Dark-Induced Leaf Senescence and Timing Its Reversal in Barley
<p>Barley crop model was analyzed for early and late events during the dark-induced leaf senescence (DILS) as well as for deciphering critical time limit for reversal of the senescence process. Chlorophyll fluorescence vitality index Rfd was determined as the earliest parameter that correlated well with the cessation of photosynthesis prior to microautophagy symptoms, initiation of DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation, and severalfold increase in the endonuclease <i>BNUC1.</i> DILS was found characterized by up-regulation of processes that enable recycling of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ed macromolecules and metabolites, including increased NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> remobilization, gluconeogenesis, glycolysis, and partial up-regulation of glyoxylate and tricarboxylate acid cycles. The most evident differences in gene medleys between DILS and developmental senescence included hormone-activated signaling pathways, lipid catabolic processes, carbohydrate metabolic processes, low-affinity ammonia remobilization, and RNA methylation. The mega-autophagy symptoms were apparent much later, specifically on day 10 of DILS, when disruption of organelles—nucleus and mitochondria —became evident. Also, during this latter-stage programmed cell death processes, namely, shrinking of the protoplast, tonoplast interruption, and vacuole breakdown, chromatin condensation, more DNA fragmentation, and disintegration of the cell membrane were prominent. Reversal of DILS by re-exposure of the plants from dark to light was possible until but not later than day 7 of dark exposure and was accompanied by regained photosynthesis, increase in chlorophyll, and reversal of Rfd, despite activation of macro-autophagy-related genes.</p>

The Nitrate-Responsive Protein MdBT2 Regulates Anthocyanin Biosynthesis by Interacting with the MdMYB1 Transcription Factor
<p>In addition to scavenging reactive oxygen species, anthocyanins are pigments that give organs their color. In apple (<i>Malus domestica</i>), R2R3-MYB transcription factor MdMYB1 is a master regulator of anthocyanin biosynthesis and fruit coloration. In this study, we found that MdMYB1 was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ed via a ubiquitin-dependent pathway in response to nitrate, an inhibitor of anthocyanin synthesis. Using a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) approach, we found that the BTB-TAZ protein encoded by the nitrate-responsive gene <i>MdBT2</i> interacts with MdMYB1. Pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation assays supported this conclusion. In vivo and in vitro experiments revealed that MdBT2 promoted the ubiquitination and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of MdMYB1 through a cullin protein MdCUL3-independent pathway. Expression analysis demonstrated that MdBT2 and MdMYB1 were inversely regulated by nitrate and other environmental signals. Furthermore, we used transgenic approaches in apple and Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) to characterize the function of <i>MdBT2</i> in regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis in response to nitrate. Our findings provide insight into a mechanism involving the MdBT2-MdMYB1 pathway that regulates anthocyanin accumulation in apple and possibly in other plant species.</p>

The NAC Transcription Factor SlNAP2 Regulates Leaf Senescence and Fruit Yield in Tomato
<p>Leaf senescence is an essential physiological process in plants that supports the recycling of nitrogen and other nutrients to support the growth of developing organs, including young leaves, seeds, and fruits. Thus, the regulation of senescence is crucial for evolutionary success in wild populations and for increasing yield in crops. Here, we describe the influence of a NAC transcription factor, SlNAP2 (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i> NAC-like, activated by Apetala3/Pistillata), that controls both leaf senescence and fruit yield in tomato (<i>S. lycopersicum</i>). <i>SlNAP2</i> expression increases during age-dependent and dark-induced leaf senescence. We demonstrate that SlNAP2 activates <i>SlSAG113</i> (<i>S. lycopersicum SENESCENCE-ASSOCIATED GENE113</i>), a homolog of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>SAG113</i>, chlorophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation genes such as <i>SlSGR1</i> (<i>S. lycopersicum</i> senescence-inducible chloroplast stay-green protein 1) and <i>SlPAO</i> (<i>S. lycopersicum</i> pheide <i>a</i> oxygenase), and other downstream targets by directly binding to their promoters, thereby promoting leaf senescence. Furthermore, SlNAP2 directly controls the expression of genes important for abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis, <i>S. lycopersicum</i> 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase 1 (<i>SlNCED1</i>); transport, <i>S. lycopersicum</i> ABC transporter G family member 40 (<i>SlABCG40</i>); and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation, <i>S. lycopersicum</i> ABA 8′-hydroxylase (<i>SlCYP707A2</i>), indicating that SlNAP2 has a complex role in establishing ABA homeostasis during leaf senescence. Inhibiting <i>SlNAP2</i> expression in transgenic tomato plants impedes leaf senescence but enhances fruit yield and sugar content likely due to prolonged leaf photosynthesis in aging tomato plants. Our data indicate that SlNAP2 has a central role in controlling leaf senescence and fruit yield in tomato.</p>

Molecular Mechanisms Preventing Senescence in Response to Prolonged Darkness in a Desiccation-Tolerant Plant
<p>The desiccation-tolerant plant <i>Haberlea rhodopensis</i> can withstand months of darkness without any visible senescence. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of this adaptation to prolonged (30 d) darkness and subsequent return to light. <i>H. rhodopensis</i> plants remained green and viable throughout the dark treatment. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that darkness regulated several transcription factor (TF) genes. Stress- and autophagy-related TFs such as <i>ERF8</i>, <i>HSFA2b</i>, <i>RD26</i>, <i>TGA1</i>, and <i>WRKY33</i> were up-regulated, while chloroplast- and flowering-related TFs such as <i>ATH1</i>, <i>COL2</i>, <i>COL4</i>, <i>RL1</i>, and <i>PTAC7</i> were repressed. <i>PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR4</i>, a negative regulator of photomorphogenesis and promoter of senescence, also was down-regulated. In response to darkness, most of the photosynthesis- and photorespiratory-related genes were strongly down-regulated, while genes related to autophagy were up-regulated. This occurred concomitant with the induction of SUCROSE NON-FERMENTING1-RELATED PROTEIN KINASES (SnRK1) signaling pathway genes, which regulate responses to stress-induced starvation and autophagy. Most of the genes associated with chlorophyll catabolism, which are induced by darkness in dark-senescing species, were either unregulated (<i>PHEOPHORBIDE A OXYGENASE, PAO; RED CHLOROPHYLL CATABOLITE REDUCTASE, RCCR</i>) or repressed (<i>STAY GREEN-LIKE</i>, <i>PHEOPHYTINASE</i>, and <i>NON-YELLOW COLORING1</i>). Metabolite profiling revealed increases in the levels of many amino acids in darkness, suggesting increased protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation. In darkness, levels of the chloroplastic lipids digalactosyldiacylglycerol, monogalactosyldiacylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, and sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol decreased, while those of storage triacylglycerols increased, suggesting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of chloroplast membrane lipids and their conversion to triacylglycerols for use as energy and carbon sources. Collectively, these data show a coordinated response to darkness, including repression of photosynthetic, photorespiratory, flowering, and chlorophyll catabolic genes, induction of autophagy and SnRK1 pathways, and metabolic reconfigurations that enable survival under prolonged darkness.</p>

<i>Medicago</i> Plants Control Nodulation by Regulating Proteolysis of the Receptor-Like Kinase DMI2
<p>Plants use receptor-like kinases to monitor environmental changes and transduce signals into plant cells. The <i>Medicago truncatula</i> (hereafter <i>M</i>. <i>truncatula</i>) DOES NOT MAKE INFECTIONS2 (DMI2) protein functions as a coreceptor of rhizobial signals to initiate nodule development and rhizobial infection during nitrogen-fixing symbiosis, but the mechanisms regulating DMI2 protein level and folding are still unknown. Here, we report that DMI2 protein abundance changes during nitrogen-fixing symbiosis. DMI2 accumulates in the nodules and is induced by rhizobia treatment through a posttranscriptional process. However, DMI2 induction is independent of the perception of Nod factor, a group of lipochitooligosaccharides secreted by rhizobia. The stability of the DMI2 protein is controlled by the proteasome pathway: in rhizobia-free environments, DMI2 is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ed by the proteasome, but during rhizobial infection, DMI2 is protected from the proteasome, resulting in protein accumulation. Furthermore, proteasome inhibitor-promoted accumulation of DMI2 protein in <i>Medicago</i> roots induces the expression of two early nodulation marker genes, supporting the hypothesis that DMI2 accumulation activates downstream symbiosis signaling. The extracellular region of DMI2 contains two malectin-like domains (MLDs) and a leucine-rich repeat. When conserved amino acids in the MLDs are mutated, DMI2 fails to restore nodule development in <i>dmi2</i> mutants, and point-mutated MLD proteins are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ed constitutively, suggesting that the MLD may be vital for the accumulation of DMI2. Our findings suggest that legumes control nodule development through modulating the protein level of DMI2, revealing a layer of regulation in the interaction between plants and rhizobia in nitrogen-fixing symbiosis.</p>

Natural Variation Underlies Differences in ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR17 Activity in Fruit Peel Degreening
<p>Through natural or human selection, many fleshy fruits have evolved vivid external or internal coloration, which often develops during ripening. Such developmental changes in color are associated with the biosynthesis of pigments as well as with degreening through chlorophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation. Here, we demonstrated that natural variation in the coding region of the gene <i>ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR17</i> (<i>ERF17</i>) contributes to apple (<i>Malus domestica</i>) fruit peel degreening. Specifically, <i>ERF17</i> mutant alleles with different serine (Ser) repeat insertions in the coding region exhibited enhanced transcriptional regulation activity in a dual-luciferase reporter assay when more Ser repeats were present. Notably, surface plasmon resonance analysis showed that the number of Ser repeats affected the binding activity of ERF17 to the promoter sequences of chlorophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation-related genes. In addition, overexpression of <i>ERF17</i> in evergreen apples altered the accumulation of chlorophyll. Furthermore, we demonstrated that <i>ERF17</i> has been under selection since the origin of apple tree cultivation. Taken together, these results reveal allelic variation underlying an important fruit quality trait and a molecular genetic mechanism associated with apple domestication.</p>

The Cytokinin Oxidase/Dehydrogenase CKX1 Is a Membrane-Bound Protein Requiring Homooligomerization in the Endoplasmic Reticulum for Its Cellular Activity
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of the plant hormone cytokinin is controlled by cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase (CKX) enzymes. The molecular and cellular behavior of these proteins is still largely unknown. In this study, we show that CKX1 is a type II single-pass membrane protein that localizes predominantly to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). This indicates that this CKX isoform is a bona fide ER protein directly controlling the cytokinin, which triggers the signaling from the ER. By using various approaches, we demonstrate that CKX1 forms homodimers and homooligomers in vivo. The amino-terminal part of CKX1 was necessary and sufficient for the protein oligomerization as well as for targeting and retention in the ER. Moreover, we show that protein-protein interaction is largely facilitated by transmembrane helices and depends on a functional GxxxG-like interaction motif. Importantly, mutations rendering CKX1 monomeric interfere with its steady-state localization in the ER and cause a loss of the CKX1 biological activity by increasing its ER-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation. Therefore, our study provides evidence that oligomerization is a crucial parameter regulating CKX1 biological activity and the cytokinin concentration in the ER. The work also lends strong support for the cytokinin signaling from the ER and for the functional relevance of the cytokinin pool in this compartment.</p>

The Transcription Factor COL12 Is a Substrate of the COP1/SPA E3 Ligase and Regulates Flowering Time and Plant Architecture<sup>1</sup>
<p>The ambient light environment controls many aspects of plant development throughout a plant’s life cycle. Such complex control is achieved because a key repressor of light signaling, the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) COP1/SPA E3 ubiquitin ligase causes the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of multiple regulators of endogenous developmental pathways. This includes the CONSTANS (CO) transcription factor that is responsible for photoperiodic control of flowering time. There are 16 CO-like proteins whose functions are only partly understood. Here, we show that 14 CO-like (COL) proteins bind CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (COP1) and SUPPRESSOR OF PHYTOCHROME A-105 (SPA)1 in vitro. We subsequently focused on COL12 and show that COL12 binds COP1 and SPA proteins in vivo. The COL12 protein is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ed in darkness in a COP1-dependent fashion, indicating that COL12 is a substrate of the COP1/SPA ubiquitin ligase. Overexpression of COL12 causes late flowering specifically in long day conditions by decreasing the expression of <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T</i>. This phenotype is genetically dependent on <i>CO.</i> Consistent with this finding, COL12 physically interacts with CO in vivo, suggesting that COL12 represses flowering by inhibiting CO protein function. We show that COL12 overexpression did not alter CO protein stability. It is therefore likely that COL12 represses the activity of CO rather than CO levels. Overexpression of COL12 also affects plant architecture by increasing the number of rosette branches and reducing inflorescence height. These phenotypes are <i>CO</i> independent. Hence, we suggest that COL12 affects plant development through CO-dependent and CO-independent mechanisms.</p>

Arabidopsis β-Amylase2 Is a K<sup>+</sup>-Requiring, Catalytic Tetramer with Sigmoidal Kinetics
<p>The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) genome contains nine β-amylase (<i>BAM</i>) genes, some of which play important roles in starch hydrolysis. However, little is known about BAM2, a plastid-localized enzyme reported to have extremely low catalytic activity. Using conservation of intron positions, we determined that the nine Arabidopsis <i>BAM</i> genes fall into two distinct subfamilies. A similar pattern was found in each major lineage of land plants, suggesting that these subfamilies diverged prior to the origin of land plants. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis indicated that <i>BAM2</i> is the ancestral member of one of these subfamilies. This finding, along with the conservation of amino acids in the active site of BAM2, suggested that it might be catalytically active. We then identified KCl as necessary for BAM2 activity. Unlike BAM1, BAM3, and BAM5, three Arabidopsis BAMs that all exhibited hyperbolic kinetics, BAM2 exhibited sigmoidal kinetics with a Hill coefficient of over 3. Using multi-angle light scattering, we determined that BAM2 was a tetramer, whereas BAM5 was a monomer. Conserved residues from a diverse set of BAM2 orthologs were mapped onto a homology model of the protein, revealing a large, conserved surface away from the active site that we hypothesize is a secondary carbohydrate-binding site. Introduction of bulky methionine for glycine at two points on this surface reduced catalytic activity significantly without disrupting the tetrameric structure. Expression analysis indicated that BAM2 is more closely coexpressed with other starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation enzymes than any other BAM, suggesting that BAM2 may play an important role in starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation in plants.</p>

Mechanisms of Phosphorus Acquisition and Lipid Class Remodeling under P Limitation in a Marine Microalga
<p>Molecular mechanisms of phosphorus (P) limitation are of great interest for understanding algal production in aquatic ecosystems. Previous studies point to P limitation-induced changes in lipid composition. As, in microalgae, the molecular mechanisms of this specific P stress adaptation remain unresolved, we reveal a detailed phospholipid-recycling scheme in <i>Nannochloropsis oceanica</i> and describe important P acquisition genes based on highly corresponding transcriptome and lipidome data. Initial responses to P limitation showed increased expression of genes involved in P uptake and an expansion of the P substrate spectrum based on purple acid phosphatases. Increase in P trafficking displayed a rearrangement between compartments by supplying P to the chloroplast and carbon to the cytosol for lipid synthesis. We propose a novel phospholipid-recycling scheme for algae that leads to the rapid reduction of phospholipids and synthesis of the P-free lipid classes. P mobilization through membrane lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation is mediated mainly by two glycerophosphoryldiester phosphodiesterases and three patatin-like phospholipases A on the transcriptome level. To compensate for low phospholipids in exponential growth, <i>N. oceanica</i> synthesized sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol and diacylglyceroltrimethylhomoserine. In this study, it was shown that an <i>N. oceanica</i> strain has a unique repertoire of genes that facilitate P acquisition and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degrad</span></strong>ation of phospholipids compared with other stramenopiles. The novel phospholipid-recycling scheme opens new avenues for metabolic engineering of lipid composition in algae.</p>

Phloem Loading through Plasmodesmata: A Biophysical Analysis
<p>In many species, Suc en route out of the leaf migrates from photosynthetically active mesophyll cells into the phloem down its concentration gradient via plasmodesmata, i.e. symplastically. In some of these plants, the process is entirely passive, but in others phloem Suc is actively converted into larger sugars, raffinose and stachyose, and segregated (trapped), thus raising total phloem sugar concentration to a level higher than in the mesophyll. Questions remain regarding the mechanisms and selective advantages conferred by both of these symplastic-loading processes. Here, we present an integrated model—including local and global transport and kinetics of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymer</span></strong>ization—for passive and active symplastic loading. We also propose a physical model of transport through the plasmodesmata. With these models, we predict that (1) relative to passive loading, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymer</span></strong>ization of Suc in the phloem, even in the absence of segregation, lowers the sugar content in the leaf required to achieve a given export rate and accelerates export for a given concentration of Suc in the mesophyll and (2) segregation of oligomers and the inverted gradient of total sugar content can be achieved for physiologically reasonable parameter values, but even higher export rates can be accessed in scenarios in which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polymer</span></strong>s are allowed to diffuse back into the mesophyll. We discuss these predictions in relation to further studies aimed at the clarification of loading mechanisms, fitness of active and passive symplastic loading, and potential targets for engineering improved rates of export.</p>

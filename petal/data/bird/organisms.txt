Acclimation of <i>Betula alleghaniensis</i> Britton to moderate soil water deficit: small morphological changes make for important consequences in crown display
<p>In the context of the predicted increasing frequency of summer droughts in the northeastern deciduous forest of North America due to climate change, we investigated the acclimation capacity of yellow birch, an economically important native tree species, to soil water deficit. We carried out an integrated examination of allocation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong>, leaf physiology, branching pattern and in situ 3D crown display. Potted seedlings were subjected to moderate soil water deficit for four consecutive months during their second growing season. Individuals under soil water deficit showed a 40% decrease in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> accumulation but no change in the relative allocation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> to the different plant compartments. Net CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rates at leaf level decreased under water deficit (~15%) but could not alone explain the total reduction in growth, excluding the carbon starvation hypothesis. The observed reduction in net CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rates was related to a decrease in stomatal conductance and chlorophyll content. <i>STAR</i><sub>zen</sub> (in situ silhouette to total leaf area ratio; a proxy for light interception efficiency) decreased under soil water deficit due to shifts in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> allocation within the branch compartment from long upper axes to short bottom axes. Despite the fact that the understanding of the processes involved in growth reduction and branching pattern alteration will need more attention in future research, we conclude that under water deficit yellow birch at young stages will: (i) experience a substantial loss of growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong>; and (ii) acclimate through architectural plasticity rather than through changes in the relative allocation of root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> to enhance its water management.</p>

Ancient steroids establish the Ediacaran fossil <i>Dickinsonia</i> as one of the earliest animals
<p>The enigmatic Ediacara biota (571 million to 541 million years ago) represents the first macroscopic complex organisms in the geological record and may hold the key to our understanding of the origin of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als. Ediacaran macrofossils are as “strange as life on another planet” and have evaded taxonomic classification, with interpretations ranging from marine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als or giant single-celled protists to terrestrial lichens. Here, we show that lipid biomarkers extracted from organically preserved Ediacaran macrofossils unambiguously clarify their phylogeny. <i>Dickinsonia</i> and its relatives solely produced cholesteroids, a hallmark of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als. Our results make these iconic members of the Ediacara biota the oldest confirmed macroscopic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als in the rock record, indicating that the appearance of the Ediacara biota was indeed a prelude to the Cambrian explosion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al life.</p>

Leaf Photosynthetic Parameters Related to Biomass Accumulation in a Global Rice Diversity Survey
<p>Mining natural variations is a major approach to identify new options to improve crop light use efficiency. So far, successes in identifying photosynthetic parameters positively related to crop <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> accumulation through this approach are scarce, possibly due to the earlier emphasis on properties related to leaf instead of canopy photosynthetic efficiency. This study aims to uncover rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) natural variations to identify leaf physiological parameters that are highly correlated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> accumulation, a surrogate of canopy photosynthesis. To do this, we systematically investigated 14 photosynthetic parameters and four morphological traits in a rice population, which consists of 204 U.S. Department of Agriculture-curated minicore accessions collected globally and 11 elite Chinese rice cultivars in both Beijing and Shanghai. To identify key components responsible for the variance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> accumulation, we applied a stepwise feature-selection approach based on linear regression models. Although there are large variations in photosynthetic parameters measured in different environments, we observed that photosynthetic rate under low light (A<sub>low</sub>) was highly related to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> accumulation and also exhibited high genomic inheritability in both environments, suggesting its great potential to be used as a target for future rice breeding programs. Large variations in A<sub>low</sub> among modern rice cultivars further suggest the great potential of using this parameter in contemporary rice breeding for the improvement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> and, hence, yield potential.</p>

Reduction of blood oxygen levels enhances postprandial cardiac hypertrophy in Burmese python (<i>Python bivittatus</i>)
<p>Physiological cardiac hypertrophy is characterized by reversible enlargement of cardiomyocytes and changes in chamber architecture, which increase stroke volume and [Formula] via augmented convective oxygen transport. Cardiac hypertrophy is known to occur in response to repeated elevations of O<sub>2</sub> demand and/or reduced O<sub>2</sub> supply in several species of vertebrate ectotherms, including postprandial Burmese pythons (<i>Python bivittatus</i>). Recent data suggest postprandial cardiac hypertrophy in <i>P. bivittatus</i> is a facultative rather than obligatory response to digestion, though the triggers of this response are unknown. Here, we hypothesized that an O<sub>2</sub> supply–demand mismatch stimulates postprandial cardiac enlargement in Burmese pythons. To test this hypothesis, we rendered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als anemic prior to feeding, essentially halving blood oxygen content during the postprandial period. Fed anemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als had heart rates 126% higher than those of fasted controls, which, coupled with a 71% increase in mean arterial pressure, suggests fed anemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als were experiencing significantly elevated cardiac work. We found significant cardiac hypertrophy in fed anemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als, which exhibited ventricles 39% larger than those of fasted controls and 28% larger than in fed controls. These findings support our hypothesis that those <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als with a greater magnitude of O<sub>2</sub> supply–demand mismatch exhibit the largest hearts. The ‘low O<sub>2</sub> signal’ stimulating postprandial cardiac hypertrophy is likely mediated by elevated ventricular wall stress associated with postprandial hemodynamics.</p>

<i>Cryptosporidium parvum</i>-induced ileo-caecal adenocarcinoma and Wnt signaling in a mouse model
<p><i>Cryptosporidium</i> species are apicomplexan protozoans that are found worldwide. These parasites constitute a large risk to human and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al health. They cause self-limited diarrhea in immunocompetent hosts and a life-threatening disease in immunocompromised hosts. Interestingly, <i>Cryptosporidium parvum</i> has been related to digestive carcinogenesis in humans. Consistent with a potential tumorigenic role of this parasite, in an original reproducible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al model of chronic cryptosporidiosis based on dexamethasone-treated or untreated adult SCID mice, we formerly reported that <i>C. parvum</i> (strains of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al and human origin) is able to induce digestive adenocarcinoma even in infections induced with very low inoculum. The aim of this study was to further characterize this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al model and to explore metabolic pathways potentially involved in the development of <i>C. parvum</i>-induced ileo-caecal oncogenesis. We searched for alterations in genes or proteins commonly involved in cell cycle, differentiation or cell migration, such as β-catenin, <i>Apc</i>, E-cadherin, <i>Kras</i> and <i>p53</i>. After infection of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als with <i>C. parvum</i> we demonstrated immunohistochemical abnormal localization of Wnt signaling pathway components and p53. Mutations in the selected loci of studied genes were not found after high-throughput sequencing. Furthermore, alterations in the ultrastructure of adherens junctions of the ileo-caecal neoplastic epithelia of <i>C. parvum</i>-infected mice were recorded using transmission electron microscopy. In conclusion, we found for the first time that the Wnt signaling pathway, and particularly the cytoskeleton network, seems to be pivotal for the development of the <i>C. parvum</i>-induced neoplastic process and cell migration of transformed cells. Furthermore, this model is a valuable tool in understanding the host-pathogen interactions associated with the intricate infection process of this parasite, which is able to modulate host cytoskeleton activities and several host-cell biological processes and remains a significant cause of infection worldwide.</p>

Interplay of growth rate and xylem plasticity for optimal coordination of carbon and hydraulic economies in <i>Fraxinus ornus</i> trees
<p>Efficient leaf water supply is fundamental for assimilation processes and tree growth. Renovating the architecture of the xylem transport system requires an increasing carbon investment while growing taller, and any deficiency of carbon availability may result in increasing hydraulic constraints to water flow. Therefore, plants need to coordinate carbon assimilation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> allocation to guarantee an efficient and safe long-distance transport system. We tested the hypothesis that reduced branch elongation rates together with carbon-saving adjustments of xylem anatomy hydraulically compensate for the reduction in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> allocation to xylem. We measured leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong>, hydraulic and anatomical properties of wood segments along the main axis of branches in 10 slow growing (SG) and 10 fast growing (FG) <i>Fraxinus ornus</i> L. trees. Branches of SG trees had five times slower branch elongation rate (7 vs 35  cm year<sup>–1</sup>), and produced a higher leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> (<i>P</i> < 0.0001) and thinner xylem rings with fewer but larger vessels (<i>P</i> < 0.0001). On the contrary, we found no differences between SG and FG trees in terms of leaf-specific conductivity (<i>P</i> > 0.05) and xylem safety (Ψ<sub>50</sub> ≈ −3.2  MPa). Slower elongation rate coupled with thinner annual rings and larger vessels allows the reduction of carbon costs associated with growth, while maintaining similar leaf-specific conductivity and xylem safety.</p>

Digital chemical test impresses
<p>Toxicologists this week unveiled a chemical safety screening tool that could greatly reduce the need for six common <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al tests. Those tests account for nearly 60% of the estimated 3 million to 4 million <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als used annually in risk testing worldwide. The computerized tool—built on a massive database of molecular structures and existing safety data—appears to match, and sometimes improve on, the results of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al tests for properties such as skin sensitization and eye irritation, the researchers report in today's issue of <i>Toxicological Sciences</i>. But it also has limitations; for instance, the method can't reliably evaluate a chemical's risk of causing cancer. And it's not clear how open regulatory agencies will be to adopting a non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al approach, although both European and U.S. regulators say they are open to the idea. Still, the big data approach is encouraging to those seeking to reduce and replace <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al testing.</p>

Moving in the Anthropocene: Global reductions in terrestrial mammalian movements
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al movement is fundamental for ecosystem functioning and species survival, yet the effects of the anthropogenic footprint on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al movements have not been estimated across species. Using a unique GPS-tracking database of 803 individuals across 57 species, we found that movements of mammals in areas with a comparatively high human footprint were on average one-half to one-third the extent of their movements in areas with a low human footprint. We attribute this reduction to behavioral changes of individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als and to the exclusion of species with long-range movements from areas with higher human impact. Global loss of vagility alters a key ecological trait of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als that affects not only population persistence but also ecosystem processes such as predator-prey interactions, nutrient cycling, and disease transmission.</p>

Mass seasonal bioflows of high-flying insect migrants

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Chloroplast Accumulation Response Enhances Leaf Photosynthesis and Plant Biomass Production
<p>Under high light intensity, chloroplasts avoid absorbing excess light by moving to anticlinal cell walls (avoidance response), but under low light intensity, chloroplasts accumulate along periclinal cell walls (accumulation response). In most plant species, these responses are induced by blue light and are mediated by the blue light photoreceptor, phototropin, which also regulates phototropism, leaf flattening, and stomatal opening. These phototropin-mediated responses could enhance photosynthesis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> production. Here, using various Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants deficient in chloroplast movement, we demonstrated that the accumulation response enhances leaf photosynthesis and plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> production. Conspicuously, <i>phototropin2</i> mutant plants specifically defective in the avoidance response but not in other phototropin-mediated responses displayed a constitutive accumulation response irrespective of light intensities, enhanced leaf photosynthesis, and increased plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> production. Therefore, our findings provide clear experimental evidence of the importance of the chloroplast accumulation response in leaf photosynthesis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> production.</p>

Predicting Dynamic Metabolic Demands in the Photosynthetic Eukaryote <i>Chlorella vulgaris</i>
<p>Phototrophic organisms exhibit a highly dynamic proteome, adapting their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> composition in response to diurnal light/dark cycles and nutrient availability. Here, we used experimentally determined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> compositions over the course of growth to determine and constrain the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> objective function (BOF) in a genome-scale metabolic model of <i>Chlorella vulgaris</i> UTEX 395 over time. Changes in the BOF, which encompasses all metabolites necessary to produce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong>, influence the state of the metabolic network thus directly affecting predictions. Simulations using dynamic BOFs predicted distinct proteome demands during heterotrophic or photoautotrophic growth. Model-driven analysis of extracellular nitrogen concentrations and predicted nitrogen uptake rates revealed an intracellular nitrogen pool, which contains 38% of the total nitrogen provided in the medium for photoautotrophic and 13% for heterotrophic growth. Agreement between flux and gene expression trends was determined by statistical comparison. Accordance between predicted flux trends and gene expression trends was found for 65% of multisubunit enzymes and 75% of allosteric reactions. Reactions with the highest agreement between simulations and experimental data were associated with energy metabolism, terpenoid biosynthesis, fatty acids, nucleotides, and amino acid metabolism. Furthermore, predicted flux distributions at each time point were compared with gene expression data to gain new insights into intracellular compartmentalization, specifically for transporters. A total of 103 genes related to internal transport reactions were identified and added to the updated model of <i>C. vulgaris</i>, <i>i</i>CZ946, thus increasing our knowledgebase by 10% for this model green alga.</p>

Drag, but not buoyancy, affects swim speed in captive Steller sea lions
<p>Swimming at an optimal speed is critical for breath-hold divers seeking to maximize the time they can spend foraging underwater. Theoretical studies have predicted that the optimal swim speed for an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al while transiting to and from depth is independent of buoyancy, but is dependent on drag and metabolic rate. However, this prediction has never been experimentally tested. Our study assessed the effects of buoyancy and drag on the swim speed of three captive Steller sea lions (<i>Eumetopias jubatus</i>) that made 186 dives. Our study <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als were trained to dive to feed at fixed depths (10–50 m) under artificially controlled buoyancy and drag conditions. Buoyancy and drag were manipulated using a pair of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tubes attached to harnesses worn by the sea lions, and buoyancy conditions were designed to fall within the natural range of wild <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als (∼12–26% subcutaneous fat). Drag conditions were changed with and without the PVC tubes, and swim speeds were recorded and compared during descent and ascent phases using an accelerometer attached to the harnesses. Generalized linear mixed-effect models with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al as the random variable and five explanatory variables (body mass, buoyancy, dive depth, dive phase, and drag) showed that swim speed was best predicted by two variables, drag and dive phase (AIC = −139). Consistent with a previous theoretical prediction, the results of our study suggest that the optimal swim speed of Steller sea lions is a function of drag, and is independent of dive depth and buoyancy.</p>

Olfactory experience primes the heat shock transcription factor HSF-1 to enhance the expression of molecular chaperones in <i>C. elegans</i>
<p>Learning, a process by which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als modify their behavior as a result of experience, enables organisms to synthesize information from their surroundings to acquire resources and avoid danger. We showed that a previous encounter with only the odor of pathogenic bacteria prepared <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> to survive exposure to the pathogen by increasing the heat shock factor 1 (HSF-1)–dependent expression of genes encoding molecular chaperones. Experience-mediated enhancement of chaperone gene expression required serotonin, which primed HSF-1 to enhance the expression of molecular chaperone genes by promoting its localization to RNA polymerase II–enriched nuclear loci, even before transcription occurred. However, HSF-1–dependent chaperone gene expression was stimulated only if and when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als encountered the pathogen. Thus, learning equips <i>C. elegans</i> to better survive environmental dangers by preemptively and specifically initiating transcriptional mechanisms throughout the whole organism that prepare the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al to respond rapidly to proteotoxic agents. These studies provide one plausible basis for the protective role of environmental enrichment in disease.</p>

Self-organization and progenitor targeting generate stable patterns in planarian regeneration
<p>During <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al regeneration, cells must organize into discrete and functional systems. We show that self-organization, along with patterning cues, govern progenitor behavior in planarian regeneration. Surgical paradigms allowed the manipulation of planarian eye regeneration in predictable locations and numbers, generating alternative stable neuroanatomical states for wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als with multiple functional ectopic eyes. We used <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als with multiple ectopic eyes and eye transplantation to demonstrate that broad progenitor specification, combined with self-organization, allows anatomy maintenance during regeneration. We propose a model for regenerative progenitors involving (i) migratory targeting cues, (ii) self-organization into existing or regenerating eyes, and (iii) a broad zone, associated with coarse progenitor specification, in which eyes can be targeted by progenitors. These three properties help explain how tissues can be organized during regeneration.</p>

Unexpected reversal of C<sub>3</sub> versus C<sub>4</sub> grass response to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> during a 20-year field experiment

We document a reversal from this expected C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> contrast. Over the first 12 years of a 20-year free-air CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment experiment with 88 C<sub>3</sub> or C<sub>4</sub> grassland plots, we found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> was markedly enhanced at <i>e</i>CO<sub>2</sub> relative to ambient CO<sub>2</sub> in C<sub>3</sub> but not C<sub>4</sub> plots, as expected. During the subsequent 8 years, the pattern reversed: <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> was markedly enhanced at <i>e</i>CO<sub>2</sub> relative to ambient CO<sub>2</sub> in C<sub>4</sub> but not C<sub>3</sub> plots. Soil net nitrogen mineralization rates, an index of soil nitrogen supply, exhibited a similar shift: <i>e</i>CO<sub>2</sub> first enhanced but later depressed rates in C<sub>3</sub> plots, with the opposite true in C<sub>4</sub> plots, partially explaining the reversal of the <i>e</i>CO<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> response. These findings challenge the current C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> <i>e</i>CO<sub>2</sub> paradigm and show that even the best-supported short-term drivers of plant response to global change might not predict long-term results.</p>

Polyploidy Affects Plant Growth and Alters Cell Wall Composition
<p>Polyploidization has played a key role in plant breeding and crop improvement. Although its potential to increase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> yield is well described, the effect of polyploidization on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> composition has largely remained unexplored. Here, we generated a series of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants with different somatic ploidy levels (2n, 4n, 6n, and 8n) and performed rigorous phenotypic characterization. Kinematic analysis showed that polyploids developed slower compared to diploids; however, tetra- and hexaploids, but not octaploids, generated larger rosettes due to delayed flowering. In addition, morphometric analysis of leaves showed that polyploidy affected epidermal pavement cells, with increased cell size and reduced cell number per leaf blade with incrementing ploidy. However, the inflorescence stem dry weight was highest in tetraploids. Cell wall characterization revealed that the basic somatic ploidy level negatively correlated with lignin and cellulose content, and positively correlated with matrix polysaccharide content (i.e. hemicellulose and pectin) in the stem tissue. In addition, higher ploidy plants displayed altered sugar composition. Such effects were linked to the delayed development of polyploids. Moreover, the changes in polyploid cell wall composition promoted saccharification yield. The results of this study indicate that induction of polyploidy is a promising breeding strategy to further tailor crops for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> production.</p>

Vessel-Specific Reintroduction of CINNAMOYL-COA REDUCTASE1 (CCR1) in Dwarfed <i>ccr1</i> Mutants Restores Vessel and Xylary Fiber Integrity and Increases Biomass
<p>Lignocellulosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> is recalcitrant toward deconstruction into simple sugars due to the presence of lignin. To render lignocellulosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> a suitable feedstock for the bio-based economy, plants can be engineered to have decreased amounts of lignin. However, engineered plants with the lowest amounts of lignin exhibit collapsed vessels and yield penalties. Previous efforts were not able to fully overcome this phenotype without settling in sugar yield upon saccharification. Here, we reintroduced <i>CINNAMOYL-COENZYME A REDUCTASE1</i> (<i>CCR1</i>) expression specifically in the protoxylem and metaxylem vessel cells of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>ccr1</i> mutants. The resulting <i>ccr1 ProSNBE</i>:<i>CCR1</i> lines had overcome the vascular collapse and had a total stem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> yield that was increased up to 59% as compared with the wild type. Raman analysis showed that monolignols synthesized in the vessels also contribute to the lignification of neighboring xylary fibers. The cell wall composition and metabolome of <i>ccr1 ProSNBE</i>:<i>CCR1</i> still exhibited many similarities to those of <i>ccr1</i> mutants, regardless of their yield increase. In contrast to a recent report, the yield penalty of <i>ccr1</i> mutants was not caused by ferulic acid accumulation but was (largely) the consequence of collapsed vessels. Finally, <i>ccr1 ProSNBE</i>:<i>CCR1</i> plants had a 4-fold increase in total sugar yield when compared with wild-type plants.</p>

Higher Novel L-Cys Degradation Activity Results in Lower Organic-S and Biomass in <i>Sarcocornia</i> than the Related Saltwort, <i>Salicornia</i>
<p><i>Salicornia</i> and <i>Sarcocornia</i> are almost identical halophytes whose edible succulent shoots hold promise for commercial production in saline water. Enhanced sulfur nutrition may be beneficial to crops naturally grown on high sulfate. However, little is known about sulfate nutrition in halophytes. Here we show that <i>Salicornia europaea</i> (ecotype RN) exhibits a significant increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> and organic-S accumulation in response to supplemental sulfate, whereas <i>Sarcocornia fruticosa</i> (ecotype VM) does not, instead exhibiting increased sulfate accumulation. We investigated the role of two pathways on organic-S and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> accumulation in <i>Salicornia</i> and <i>Sarcoconia</i>: the sulfate reductive pathway that generates Cys and <sc>l</sc>-Cys desulfhydrase that degrades Cys to H<sub>2</sub>S, NH<sub>3</sub>, and pyruvate. The major function of <i>O</i>-acetyl-Ser-(thiol) lyase (OAS-TL; EC 2.5.1.47) is the formation of <sc>l</sc>-Cys, but our study shows that the OAS-TL A and OAS-TL B of both halophytes are enzymes that also degrade <sc>l</sc>-Cys to H<sub>2</sub>S. This activity was significantly higher in <i>Sarcocornia</i> than in <i>Salicornia</i>, especially upon sulfate supplementation. The activity of the sulfate reductive pathway key enzyme, adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate reductase (APR, EC 1.8.99.2), was significantly higher in <i>Salicornia</i> than in <i>Sarcocornia</i>. These results suggest that the low organic-S level in <i>Sarcocornia</i> is the result of high <sc>l</sc>-Cys degradation rate by OAS-TLs, whereas the greater organic-S and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> accumulation in <i>Salicornia</i> is the result of higher APR activity and low <sc>l</sc>-Cys degradation rate, resulting in higher net Cys biosynthesis. These results present an initial road map for halophyte growers to attain better growth rates and nutritional value of <i>Salicornia</i> and <i>Sarcocornia</i>.</p>

Seasonal accumulation of acetylated triacylglycerols by a freeze-tolerant insect
<p>Most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als store energy as long-chain triacylglycerols (lcTAGs). Trace amounts of acetylated triacylglycerols (acTAGs) have been reported in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als, but are not accumulated, likely because they have lower energy density than lcTAGs. Here we report that acTAGs comprise 36% of the neutral lipid pool of overwintering prepupae of the goldenrod gall fly, <i>Eurosta solidaginis</i>, while only 17% of the neutral lipid pool is made up of typical lcTAGs. These high concentrations of acTAGs, present only during winter, appear to be synthesized by <i>E. solidaginis</i> and are not found in other freeze-tolerant insects, nor in the plant host. The mixture of acTAGs found in <i>E. solidaginis</i> has a significantly lower melting point than equivalent lcTAGs, and thus remains liquid at temperatures at which <i>E. solidaginis</i> is frozen in the field, and depresses the melting point of aqueous solutions in a manner unusual for neutral lipids. We note that accumulation of acTAGs coincides with preparation for overwintering and the seasonal acquisition of freeze tolerance. This is the first observation of accumulation of acTAGs by an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al, and the first evidence of dynamic interconversion between acTAGs and lcTAGs during development and in response to stress.</p>

The cost of muscle power production: muscle oxygen consumption per unit work increases at low temperatures in <i>Xenopus laevis</i>
<p>Metabolic energy (ATP) supply to muscle is essential to support activity and behaviour. It is expected, therefore, that there is strong selection to maximise muscle power output for a given rate of ATP use. However, the viscosity and stiffness of muscle increases with a decrease in temperature, which means that more ATP may be required to achieve a given work output. Here, we tested the hypothesis that ATP use increases at lower temperatures for a given power output in <i>Xenopus laevis.</i> To account for temperature variation at different time scales, we considered the interaction between acclimation for 4 weeks (to 15 or 25°C) and acute exposure to these temperatures. Cold-acclimated frogs had greater sprint speed at 15°C than warm-acclimated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als. However, acclimation temperature did not affect isolated gastrocnemius muscle biomechanics. Isolated muscle produced greater tetanus force, and faster isometric force generation and relaxation, and generated more work loop power at 25°C than at 15°C acute test temperature. Oxygen consumption of isolated muscle at rest did not change with test temperature, but oxygen consumption while muscle was performing work was significantly higher at 15°C than at 25°C, regardless of acclimation conditions. Muscle therefore consumed significantly more oxygen at 15°C for a given work output than at 25°C, and plastic responses did not modify this thermodynamic effect. The metabolic cost of muscle performance and activity therefore increased with a decrease in temperature. To maintain activity across a range of temperature, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als must increase ATP production or face an allocation trade-off at lower temperatures. Our data demonstrate the potential energetic benefits of warming up muscle before activity, which is seen in diverse groups of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als such as bees, which warm flight muscle before take-off, and humans performing warm ups before exercise.</p>

The olfactory neuron AWC promotes avoidance of normally palatable food following chronic dietary restriction
<p>Changes in metabolic state alter foraging behavior and food preference in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als. Here, I show that normally attractive food becomes repulsive to <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> if <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als are chronically undernourished as a result of alimentary tract defects. This behavioral plasticity is achieved in two ways: increased food leaving and induction of aversive behavior towards food. A particularly strong food avoider is defective in the chitin synthase that makes the pharyngeal lining. Food avoidance induced by underfeeding is mediated by cGMP signaling in the olfactory neurons AWC and AWB, and the gustatory neurons ASJ and ASK. Food avoidance is enhanced by increased population density and is reduced if the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als are unable to correctly interpret their nutritional state as a result of defects in the AMP kinase or TOR/S6kinase pathways. The TGF-β/DBL-1 pathway suppresses food avoidance and the cellular basis for this is distinct from its role in aversive olfactory learning of harmful food. This study suggests that nutritional state feedback via nutrient sensors, population size and olfactory neurons guides food preference in <i>C. elegans</i>.</p>

Rapid cold hardening improves recovery of ion homeostasis and chill coma recovery time in the migratory locust, <i>Locusta migratoria</i>
<p>Chill tolerance of insects is defined as the ability to tolerate low temperature under circumstances not involving freezing of intracellular or extracellular fluids. For many insects chill tolerance is crucial for their ability to persist in cold environments and mounting evidence indicates that chill tolerance is associated with the ability to maintain ion and water homeostasis, thereby ensuring muscular function and preventing chill injury at low temperature. The present study describes the relationship between muscle and haemolymph ion homeostasis and time to regain posture following cold shock (CS, 2 h at −4°C) in the chill-susceptible locust <i>Locusta migratoria</i>. This relationship was examined in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als with and without a prior rapid cold-hardening treatment (RCH, 2 h at 0°C) to investigate the physiological underpinnings of RCH. CS elicited a doubling of haemolymph [K<sup>+</sup>] and this disturbance was greater in locusts pre-exposed to RCH. Recovery of ion homeostasis was, however, markedly faster in RCH-treated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als, which correlated well with whole-organism performance as hardened individuals regained posture faster than non-hardened individuals following CS. The present study indicates that loss and recovery of muscular function are associated with the resting membrane potential of excitable membranes as attested by the changes in the equilibrium potential for K<sup>+</sup> (<i>E</i><sub>K</sub>) following CS. Both hardened and non-hardened <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als regained movement once K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis had recovered to a fixed level (<i>E</i><sub>K</sub>≈−41 mV). RCH is therefore not associated with altered sensitivity to ion disturbance but instead is correlated to a faster recovery of haemolymph [K<sup>+</sup>].</p>

Flexible strategies for flight control: an active role for the abdomen
<p>Moving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als orchestrate myriad motor systems in response to multimodal sensory inputs. Coordinating movement is particularly challenging in flight control, where <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als deal with potential instability and multiple degrees of freedom of movement. Prior studies have focused on wings as the primary flight control structures, for which changes in angle of attack or shape are used to modulate lift and drag forces. However, other actuators that may impact flight performance are reflexively activated during flight. We investigated the visual–abdominal reflex displayed by the hawkmoth <i>Manduca sexta</i> to determine its role in flight control. We measured the open-loop stimulus–response characteristics (measured as a transfer function) between the visual stimulus and abdominal response in tethered moths. The transfer function reveals a 41 ms delay and a high-pass filter behavior with a pass band starting at ~0.5 Hz. We also developed a simplified mathematical model of hovering flight wherein articulation of the thoracic–abdominal joint redirects an average lift force provided by the wings. We show that control of the joint, subject to a high-pass filter, is sufficient to maintain stable hovering, but with a slim stability margin. Our experiments and models suggest a novel mechanism by which articulation of the body or ‘airframe’ of an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al can be used to redirect lift forces for effective flight control. Furthermore, the small stability margin may increase flight agility by easing the transition from stable flight to a more maneuverable, unstable regime.</p>

Balance between the two kinin receptors in the progression of experimental focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis in mice
<p>Focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is one of the most important renal diseases related to end-stage renal failure. Bradykinin has been implicated in the pathogenesis of renal inflammation, whereas the role of its receptor 2 (B2RBK; also known as BDKRB2) in FSGS has not been studied. FSGS was induced in wild-type and B2RBK-knockout mice by a single intravenous injection of Adriamycin (ADM). In order to further modulate the kinin receptors, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als were also treated with the B2RBK antagonist HOE-140 and the B1RBK antagonist DALBK. Here, we show that the blockage of B2RBK with HOE-140 protects mice from the development of FSGS, including podocyte foot process effacement and the re-establishment of slit-diaphragm-related proteins. However, B2RBK-knockout mice were not protected from FSGS. These opposite results were due to B1RBK expression. B1RBK was upregulated after the injection of ADM and this upregulation was exacerbated in B2RBK-knockout <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als. Furthermore, treatment with HOE-140 downregulated the B1RBK receptor. The blockage of B1RBK in B2RBK-knockout <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als promoted FSGS regression, with a less-inflammatory phenotype. These results indicate a deleterious role of both kinin receptors in an FSGS model and suggest a possible cross-talk between them in the progression of disease.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
The fraction of strongly bound cross-bridges is increased in mice that carry the myopathy-linked myosin heavy chain mutation MYH4<sup>L342Q</sup>
<p>Myosinopathies have emerged as a new group of diseases and are caused by mutations in genes encoding myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms. One major hallmark of these diseases is skeletal muscle weakness or paralysis, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we have undertaken a detailed functional study of muscle fibers from <i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i> mice, which carry a mutation that provokes an L342Q change within the catalytic domain of the type IIb skeletal muscle myosin protein MYH4. Because homozygous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als develop rapid muscle-structure disruption and lower-limb paralysis, they must be killed by postnatal day 13, so all experiments were performed using skeletal muscles from adult heterozygous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als (<i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i>/+). <i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i>/+ mice contain MYH4<sup>L342Q</sup> expressed at 7% of the levels of the wild-type (WT) protein, and are overtly and histologically normal. However, mechanical and X-ray diffraction pattern analyses of single membrane-permeabilized fibers revealed, upon maximal Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation, higher stiffness as well as altered meridional and equatorial reflections in <i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i>/+ mice when compared with age-matched WT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als. Under rigor conditions, by contrast, no difference was observed between <i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i>/+ and WT mice. Altogether, these findings prove that, in adult <i>MYH4<sup>L342Q</sup></i> heterozygous mice, the transition from weak to strong myosin cross-bridge binding is facilitated, increasing the number of strongly attached myosin heads, thus enhancing force production. These changes are predictably exacerbated in the type IIb fibers of homozygous mice, in which the embryonic myosin isoform is fully replaced by MYH4<sup>L342Q</sup>, leading to a hypercontraction, muscle-structure disruption and lower-limb paralysis. Overall, these findings provide important insights into the molecular pathogenesis of skeletal myosinopathies.</p>

Highly efficient targeted mutagenesis in axolotl using Cas9 RNA-guided nuclease

The mystery of why salamanders, but not other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als, possess this ability has for generations captivated scientists seeking to induce this phenomenon in other vertebrates. Although many recent advances in molecular biology have allowed limb regeneration and tissue repair in the axolotl to be investigated in increasing detail, the molecular toolkit for the study of this process has been limited. Here, we report that the CRISPR-Cas9 RNA-guided nuclease system can efficiently create mutations at targeted sites within the axolotl genome. We identify individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als treated with RNA-guided nucleases that have mutation frequencies close to 100% at targeted sites. We employ this technique to completely functionally ablate EGFP expression in transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als and recapitulate developmental phenotypes produced by loss of the conserved gene <i>brachyury</i>. Thus, this advance allows a reverse genetic approach in the axolotl and will undoubtedly provide invaluable insight into the mechanisms of salamanders' unique regenerative ability.</p>

Formaldehyde stabilization facilitates lignin monomer production during biomass depolymerization
<p>Practical, high-yield lignin depolymerization methods could greatly increase biorefinery productivity and profitability. However, development of these methods is limited by the presence of interunit carbon-carbon bonds within native lignin, and further by formation of such linkages during lignin extraction. We report that adding formaldehyde during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> pretreatment produces a soluble lignin fraction that can be converted to guaiacyl and syringyl monomers at near theoretical yields during subsequent hydrogenolysis (47 mole % of Klason lignin for beech and 78 mole % for a high-syringyl transgenic poplar). These yields were three to seven times those obtained without formaldehyde, which prevented lignin condensation by forming 1,3-dioxane structures with lignin side-chain hydroxyl groups. By depolymerizing cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin separately, monomer yields were between 76 and 90 mole % for these three major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> fractions.</p>

Mesophyll Abscisic Acid Restrains Early Growth and Flowering But Does Not Directly Suppress Photosynthesis
<p>Abscisic acid (ABA) levels increase significantly in plants under stress conditions, and ABA is thought to serve as a key stress-response regulator. However, the direct effect of ABA on photosynthesis and the effect of mesophyll ABA on yield under both well-watered and drought conditions are still the subject of debate. Here, we examined this issue using transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants carrying a dominant ABA-signaling inhibitor under the control of a mesophyll-specific promoter (<i>FBPase::abi1-1</i>, abbreviated to <i>fa</i>). Under normal conditions, <i>fa</i> plants displayed slightly higher stomatal conductance and carbon assimilation than wild-type plants; however, these parameters were comparable following ABA treatment. These observations suggest that ABA does not directly inhibit photosynthesis in the short term. The <i>fa</i> plants also exhibited a variety of altered phenotypes under optimal conditions, including more vigorous initial growth, earlier flowering, smaller flowers, and delayed chlorophyll degradation. Furthermore, under optimal conditions, <i>fa</i> plant seed production was less than a third of that observed for the wild type. However, under drought conditions, wild-type and <i>fa</i> seed yields were similar due to a significant reduction in wild-type seed and no reduction in <i>fa</i> seed. These findings suggest that endogenous basal ABA inhibits a stress-escape response under nonstressed conditions, allowing plants to accumulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> and maximize yield. The lack of a correlation between flowering time and plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> combined with delayed chlorophyll degradation suggests that this stress-escape behavior is regulated independently and upstream of other ABA-induced effects such as rapid growth and flowering.</p>

Loss of CRWN Nuclear Proteins Induces Cell Death and Salicylic Acid Defense Signaling
<p>Defects in the nuclear lamina of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al cell nuclei have dramatic effects on nuclear structure and gene expression as well as diverse physiological manifestations. We report that deficiencies in CROWDED NUCLEI (CRWN), which are candidate nuclear lamina proteins in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), trigger widespread changes in transcript levels and whole-plant phenotypes, including dwarfing and spontaneous cell death lesions. These phenotypes are caused in part by ectopic induction of plant defense responses via the salicylic acid pathway. Loss of CRWN proteins induces the expression of the salicylic acid biosynthetic gene <i>ISOCHORISMATE SYNTHASE1</i>, which leads to spontaneous defense responses in <i>crwn1 crwn2</i> and <i>crwn1 crwn4</i> mutants, which are deficient in two of the four CRWN paralogs. The symptoms of ectopic defense response, including pathogenesis marker gene expression and cell death, increase in older <i>crwn</i> double mutants. These age-dependent effects are postulated to reflect an increase in nuclear dysfunction or damage over time, a phenomenon reminiscent of aging effects seen in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al nuclei and in some human laminopathy patients.</p>

Genome-Scale Fluxome of <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973 Using Transient <sup>13</sup>C-Labeling Data
<p><i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973 (<i>Synechococcus</i> 2973) has the shortest reported doubling time (2.1 h) among cyanobacteria, making it a promising platform for the solar-based production of biochemicals. In this meta-analysis, its intracellular flux distribution was recomputed using genome-scale isotopic nonstationary <sup>13</sup>C-metabolic flux analysis given the labeling dynamics of 13 metabolites reported in an earlier study. To achieve this, a genome-scale mapping model, namely <i>i</i>mSyu593, was constructed using the <i>i</i>mSyn617 mapping model for <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 (<i>Synechocystis</i> 6803) as the starting point encompassing 593 reactions. The flux elucidation revealed nearly complete conversion (greater than 96%) of the assimilated carbon into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> in <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973. In contrast, <i>Synechocystis</i> 6803 achieves complete conversion of only 86% of the assimilated carbon. This high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> yield was enabled by the reincorporation of the fixed carbons lost in anabolic and photorespiratory pathways in conjunction with flux rerouting through a nondecarboxylating reaction such as phosphoketolase. This reincorporation of lost CO<sub>2</sub> sustains a higher flux through the photorespiratory C2 cycle that fully meets the glycine and serine demands for growth. In accordance with the high carbon efficiency drive, acetyl-coenzyme A was entirely produced using the carbon-efficient phosphoketolase pathway. Comparison of the <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973 flux map with that of <i>Synechocystis</i> 6803 revealed differences in the use of Calvin cycle and photorespiratory pathway reactions. The two species used different reactions for the synthesis of metabolites such as fructose-6-phosphate, glycine, sedoheptulose-7-phosphate, and Ser. These findings allude to a highly carbon-efficient metabolism alongside the fast carbon uptake rate in <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973, which explains its faster growth rate.</p>

<i>INCREASING NODULE SIZE1</i> Expression Is Required for Normal Rhizobial Symbiosis and Nodule Development
<p>Nodulation is crucial for biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) in legumes, but the molecular mechanisms underlying BNF have remained elusive. Here, we cloned a candidate gene underlying a major nodulation quantitative trait locus in soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>), <i>INCREASING NODULE SIZE1</i> (<i>GmINS1</i>). <i>GmINS1</i> encodes a cell wall β-expansin and is expressed primarily in vascular bundles, along with cortical and parenchyma cells of nodules. Four single-nucleotide polymorphisms distinguishing the two parents were found in the <i>GmINS1</i> promoter region. Among them, single-nucleotide polymorphism A/C has a significant effect on <i>GmINS1</i> expression in the parental genotype P2, based on β-glucuronidase activity and promoter deletion analysis. The expression of <i>GmINS1</i> and the P2 genotype promoter was strongly associated with nodule development, not only in the parents but also in 40 progeny lines and 40 genotypes selected from a soybean core collection. Overexpression of <i>GmINS1</i> resulted in increases in the number, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong>, infection cell abundance, and nitrogenase activity of large nodules and subsequently changed the nitrogen content and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> of soybean plants. <i>GmINS1</i> suppression via RNA interference had the opposite effect. Double suppression of <i>GmEXPB2</i> and <i>GmINS1</i> dramatically inhibited soybean nodulation. Our results reveal that <i>GmINS1</i> is a critical gene in nodule development and that <i>GmEXPB2</i> and <i>GmINS1</i> synergistically control nodulation in soybean. Our findings shed light on the genetic basis of soybean nodulation and provide a candidate gene for optimizing BNF capacity through molecular breeding in soybean.</p>

Large Crown Root Number Improves Topsoil Foraging and Phosphorus Acquisition
<p>Suboptimal phosphorus (P) availability is a primary constraint to plant growth on Earth. We tested the hypothesis that maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) genotypes with large crown root number (CN) will have shallower rooting depth and improved P acquisition from low-P soils. Maize recombinant inbred lines with contrasting CN were evaluated under suboptimal P availability in greenhouse mesocosms and the field. Under P stress in mesocosms, the large-CN phenotype had 48% greater root respiration, 24% shallower rooting depth, 32% greater root length density in the topsoil, 37% greater leaf P concentration, 48% greater leaf photosynthesis, 33% greater stomatal conductance, and 44% greater shoot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> than the small-CN phenotype. Under P stress in the field, the large-CN phenotype had 32% shallower rooting depth, 51% greater root length density in the topsoil, 44% greater leaf P concentration, 18% greater leaf photosynthesis, 21% greater stomatal conductance, 23% greater shoot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> at anthesis, and 28% greater yield than the small-CN phenotype. These results support the hypothesis that large CN improves plant P acquisition from low-P soils by reducing rooting depth and increasing topsoil foraging. The large-CN phenotype merits consideration as a selection target to improve P capture in maize and possibly other cereal crops.</p>

Here, we classified all Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) microProteins and developed a synthetic microProtein approach to target specific protein classes, such as hydrolases, receptors, and lyases, in a proof-of-concept approach. Our findings reveal that microProteins can be used to influence different physiological processes, which makes them useful tools for posttranslational regulation in plants and potentially also in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als.</p>

Different Routes for Conifer- and Sinapaldehyde and Higher Saccharification upon Deficiency in the Dehydrogenase CAD1
<p>In the search for renewable energy sources, genetic engineering is a promising strategy to improve plant cell wall composition for biofuel and bioproducts generation. Lignin is a major factor determining saccharification efficiency and, therefore, is a prime target to engineer. Here, lignin content and composition were modified in poplar (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus alba</i>) by specifically down-regulating <i>CINNAMYL ALCOHOL DEHYDROGENASE1</i> (<i>CAD1</i>) by a hairpin-RNA-mediated silencing approach, which resulted in only 5% residual <i>CAD1</i> transcript abundance. These transgenic lines showed no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> penalty despite a 10% reduction in Klason lignin content and severe shifts in lignin composition. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and thioacidolysis revealed a strong increase (up to 20-fold) in sinapaldehyde incorporation into lignin, whereas coniferaldehyde was not increased markedly. Accordingly, ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based phenolic profiling revealed a more than 24,000-fold accumulation of a newly identified compound made from 8-8 coupling of two sinapaldehyde radicals. However, no additional cinnamaldehyde coupling products could be detected in the CAD1-deficient poplars. Instead, the transgenic lines accumulated a range of hydroxycinnamate-derived metabolites, of which the most prominent accumulation (over 8,500-fold) was observed for a compound that was identified by purification and nuclear magnetic resonance as syringyl lactic acid hexoside. Our data suggest that, upon down-regulation of <i>CAD1</i>, coniferaldehyde is converted into ferulic acid and derivatives, whereas sinapaldehyde is either oxidatively coupled into S′(8-8)S′ and lignin or converted to sinapic acid and derivatives. The most prominent sink of the increased flux to hydroxycinnamates is syringyl lactic acid hexoside. Furthermore, low-extent saccharification assays, under different pretreatment conditions, showed strongly increased glucose (up to +81%) and xylose (up to +153%) release, suggesting that down-regulating <i>CAD1</i> is a promising strategy for improving lignocellulosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> for the sugar platform industry.</p>

SCYL2 Genes Are Involved in Clathrin-Mediated Vesicle Trafficking and Essential for Plant Growth
<p>Protein transport between organelles is an essential process in all eukaryotic cells and is mediated by the regulation of processes such as vesicle formation, transport, docking, and fusion. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als, SCY1-LIKE2 (SCYL2) binds to clathrin and has been shown to play roles in trans-Golgi network-mediated clathrin-coated vesicle trafficking. Here, we demonstrate that SCYL2A and SCYL2B, which are Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) homologs of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al SCYL2, are vital for plant cell growth and root hair development. Studies of the SCYL2 isoforms using multiple single or double loss-of-function alleles show that SCYL2B is involved in root hair development and that SCYL2A and SCYL2B are essential for plant growth and development and act redundantly in those processes. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and a β-glucuronidase-aided promoter assay show that <i>SCYL2A</i> and <i>SCYL2B</i> are differentially expressed in various tissues. We also show that SCYL2 proteins localize to the Golgi, trans-Golgi network, and prevacuolar compartment and colocalize with Clathrin Heavy Chain1 (CHC1). Furthermore, bimolecular fluorescence complementation and coimmunoprecipitation data show that SCYL2B interacts with CHC1 and two Soluble NSF Attachment Protein Receptors (SNAREs): Vesicle Transport through t-SNARE Interaction11 (VTI11) and VTI12. Finally, we present evidence that the root hair tip localization of Cellulose Synthase-Like D3 is dependent on SCYL2B. These findings suggest the role of SCYL2 genes in plant cell developmental processes via clathrin-mediated vesicle membrane trafficking.</p>

A Plant Cryptochrome Controls Key Features of the <i>Chlamydomonas</i> Circadian Clock and Its Life Cycle
<p>Cryptochromes are flavin-binding proteins that act as blue light receptors in bacteria, fungi, plants, and insects and are components of the circadian oscillator in mammals. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al and plant cryptochromes are evolutionarily divergent, although the unicellular alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> (<i>Chlamydomonas</i> throughout) has both an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al-like cryptochrome and a plant cryptochrome (pCRY; formerly designated CPH1). Here, we show that the pCRY protein accumulates at night as part of a complex. Functional characterization of pCRY was performed based on an insertional mutant that expresses only 11% of the wild-type pCRY level. The <i>pcry</i> mutant is defective for central properties of the circadian clock. In the mutant, the period is lengthened significantly, ultimately resulting in arrhythmicity, while blue light-based phase shifts show large deviations from what is observed in wild-type cells. We also show that pCRY is involved in gametogenesis in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>. pCRY is down-regulated in pregametes and gametes, and in the <i>pcry</i> mutant, there is altered transcript accumulation under blue light of the strictly light-dependent, gamete-specific gene <i>GAS28</i>. pCRY acts as a negative regulator for the induction of mating ability in the light and for the loss of mating ability in the dark. Moreover, pCRY is necessary for light-dependent germination, during which the zygote undergoes meiosis that gives rise to four vegetative cells. In sum, our data demonstrate that pCRY is a key blue light receptor in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> that is involved in both circadian timing and life cycle progression.</p>

Optimization of Light-Harvesting Pigment Improves Photosynthetic Efficiency
<p>Maximizing light capture by light-harvesting pigment optimization represents an attractive but challenging strategy to improve photosynthetic efficiency. Here, we report that loss of a previously uncharacterized gene, <i>HIGH PHOTOSYNTHETIC EFFICIENCY1</i> (<i>HPE1</i>), optimizes light-harvesting pigments, leading to improved photosynthetic efficiency and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> production. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>hpe1</i> mutants show faster electron transport and increased contents of carbohydrates. <i>HPE1</i> encodes a chloroplast protein containing an RNA recognition motif that directly associates with and regulates the splicing of target RNAs of plastid genes. HPE1 also interacts with other plastid RNA-splicing factors, including CAF1 and OTP51, which share common targets with HPE1. Deficiency of HPE1 alters the expression of nucleus-encoded chlorophyll-related genes, probably through plastid-to-nucleus signaling, causing decreased total content of chlorophyll (<i>a</i>+<i>b</i>) in a limited range but increased chlorophyll <i>a</i>/<i>b</i> ratio. Interestingly, this adjustment of light-harvesting pigment reduces antenna size, improves light capture, decreases energy loss, mitigates photodamage, and enhances photosynthetic quantum yield during photosynthesis. Our findings suggest a novel strategy to optimize light-harvesting pigments that improves photosynthetic efficiency and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> production in higher plants.</p>

Fine-Tuning Motile Cilia and Flagella: Evolution of the Dynein Motor Proteins from Plants to Humans at High Resolution
<p>The flagellum is a key innovation linked to eukaryogenesis. It provides motility by regulated cycles of bending and bend propagation, which are thought to be controlled by a complex arrangement of seven distinct dyneins in repeated patterns of outer- (OAD) and inner-arm dynein (IAD) complexes. Electron tomography showed high similarity of this axonemal repeat pattern across ciliates, algae, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als, but the diversity of dynein sequences across the eukaryotes has not yet comprehensively been resolved and correlated with structural data. To shed light on the evolution of the axoneme I performed an exhaustive analysis of dyneins using the available sequenced genome data. Evidence from motor domain phylogeny allowed expanding the current set of nine dynein subtypes by eight additional isoforms with, however, restricted taxonomic distributions. I confirmed the presence of the nine dyneins in all eukaryotic super-groups indicating their origin predating the last eukaryotic common ancestor. The comparison of the N-terminal tail domains revealed a most likely axonemal dynein origin of the new classes, a group of chimeric dyneins in plants/algae and Stramenopiles, and the unique domain architecture and origin of the outermost OADs present in green algae and ciliates but not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als. The correlation of sequence and structural data suggests the single-headed class-8 and class-9 dyneins to localize to the distal end of the axonemal repeat and the class-7 dyneins filling the region up to the proximal heterodimeric IAD. Tracing dynein gene duplications across the eukaryotes indicated ongoing diversification and fine-tuning of flagellar functions in extant taxa and species.</p>

Molecular Evolution of the Yap/Yorkie Proto-Oncogene and Elucidation of Its Core Transcriptional Program
<p>Throughout Metazoa, developmental processes are controlled by a surprisingly limited number of conserved signaling pathways. Precisely how these signaling cassettes were assembled in early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al evolution remains poorly understood, as do the molecular transitions that potentiated the acquisition of their myriad developmental functions. Here we analyze the molecular evolution of the proto-oncogene yes-associated protein (Yap)/Yorkie, a key effector of the Hippo signaling pathway that controls organ size in both <i>Drosophila</i> and mammals. Based on heterologous functional analysis of evolutionarily distant Yap/Yorkie orthologs, we demonstrate that a structurally distinct interaction interface between Yap/Yorkie and its partner TEAD/Scalloped became fixed in the eumetazoan common ancestor. We then combine transcriptional profiling of tissues expressing phylogenetically diverse forms of Yap/Yorkie with ChIP-seq validation to identify a common downstream gene expression program underlying the control of tissue growth in <i>Drosophila</i>. Intriguingly, a subset of the newly identified Yorkie target genes are also induced by Yap in mammalian tissues, thus revealing a conserved Yap-dependent gene expression signature likely to mediate organ size control throughout bilaterian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als. Combined, these experiments provide new mechanistic insights while revealing the ancient evolutionary history of Hippo signaling.</p>

The Evolution of Human Cells in Terms of Protein Innovation
<p>Humans are composed of hundreds of cell types. As the genomic DNA of each somatic cell is identical, cell type is determined by what is expressed and when. Until recently, little has been reported about the determinants of human cell identity, particularly from the joint perspective of gene evolution and expression. Here, we chart the evolutionary past of all documented human cell types via the collective histories of proteins, the principal product of gene expression. FANTOM5 data provide cell-type–specific digital expression of human protein-coding genes and the SUPERFAMILY resource is used to provide protein domain annotation. The evolutionary epoch in which each protein was created is inferred by comparison with domain annotation of all other completely sequenced genomes. Studying the distribution across epochs of genes expressed in each cell type reveals insights into human cellular evolution in terms of protein innovation. For each cell type, its history of protein innovation is charted based on the genes it expresses. Combining the histories of all cell types enables us to create a timeline of cell evolution. This timeline identifies the possibility that our common ancestor Coelomata (cavity-forming <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als) provided the innovation required for the innate immune system, whereas cells which now form the brain of human have followed a trajectory of continually accumulating novel proteins since Opisthokonta (boundary of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als and fungi). We conclude that exaptation of existing domain architectures into new contexts is the dominant source of cell-type–specific domain architectures.</p>

Genetic and phenotypically flexible components of seasonal variation in immune function
<p>Animals cope with seasonal variation in environmental factors by adjustments of physiology and life history. When seasonal variation is partly predictable, such adjustments can be based on a genetic component or be phenotypically flexible. Animals have to allocate limited resources over different demands, including immune function. Accordingly, immune traits could change seasonally, and such changes could have a genetic component that differs between environments. We tested this hypothesis in genotypically distinct groups of a widespread songbird, the stonechat (<i>Saxicola torquata</i>). We compared variation in immunity during 1 year in long-distance migrants, short-distance migrants, tropical residents and hybrids in a common garden environment. Additionally, we investigated phenotypically flexible responses to temperature by applying different temperature regimes to one group. We assessed constitutive immunity by measuring hemagglutination, hemolysis, haptoglobin and bactericidal ability against <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. Genotypic groups differed in patterns of variation of all measured immune indices except haptoglobin. Hybrids differed from, but were rarely intermediate to, parental subspecies. Temperature treatment only influenced patterns of hemolysis and bactericidal ability against <i>E. coli.</i> We conclude that seasonal variation in constitutive immunity has a genetic component, that heredity does not follow simple Mendelian rules, and that some immune measures are relatively rigid while others are more flexible. Furthermore, our results support the idea that seasonal variability in constitutive immunity is associated with variability in environment and annual-cycle demands. This study stresses the importance of considering seasonal variation in immune function in relation to the ecology and life history of the organism of interest.</p>

Prior experience with conspecific signals enhances auditory midbrain responsiveness to conspecific vocalizations
<p>There is a long history in neuroethology of investigating how communication signals influence the brain and behavior. It has become increasingly clear that brain areas associated with sensory processing are plastic in adults and that this plasticity is related to reproductive condition. However, the role of communication signal reception in adult auditory plasticity has received relatively little attention. Here, we investigated whether the reception of communication signals (a frog chorus) could enhance the responsiveness of the auditory system to future reception of communication signals (a single male call). We found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als that had been exposed to 10 days of a male chorus had stronger auditory midbrain immediate early gene expression than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als that had been exposed to 10 days of random tones when tested with 30 min of male calls or 30 min of tones. Our results suggest that exposure to dynamic social stimuli, like frog choruses, may play an important role in shaping the neural and behavioral responses to communication signals.</p>

Gut microbiota dictates the metabolic response of <i>Drosophila</i> to diet
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al nutrition is profoundly influenced by the gut microbiota, but knowledge of the scope and core mechanisms of the underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>al–microbiota interactions is fragmentary. To investigate the nutritional traits shaped by the gut microbiota of <i>Drosophila</i>, we determined the microbiota-dependent response of multiple metabolic and performance indices to systematically varied diet composition. Diet-dependent differences between <i>Drosophila</i> bearing its unmanipulated microbiota (conventional flies) and experimentally deprived of its microbiota (axenic flies) revealed evidence for: microbial sparing of dietary B vitamins, especially riboflavin, on low-yeast diets; microbial promotion of protein nutrition, particularly in females; and microbiota-mediated suppression of lipid/carbohydrate storage, especially on high sugar diets. The microbiota also sets the relationship between energy storage and body mass, indicative of microbial modulation of the host signaling networks that coordinate metabolism with body size. This analysis identifies the multiple impacts of the microbiota on the metabolism of <i>Drosophila</i>, and demonstrates that the significance of these different interactions varies with diet composition and host sex.</p>

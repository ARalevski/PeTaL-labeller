HCN Regulates Cellular Processes through Posttranslational Modification of Proteins by <i>S-</i>cyanylation
<p>Hydrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cyanid</span></strong>e (HCN) is coproduced with ethylene in plant cells and is primarily enzymatically detoxified by the mitochondrial β-CYANOALANINE SYNTHASE (CAS-C1). Permanent or transient depletion of CAS-C1 activity in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) results in physiological alterations in the plant that suggest that HCN acts as a gasotransmitter molecule. Label-free quantitative proteomic analysis of mitochondrially enriched samples isolated from the wild type and <i>cas-c1</i> mutant revealed significant changes in protein content, identifying 451 proteins that are absent or less abundant in <i>cas-c1</i> and 353 proteins that are only present or more abundant in <i>cas-c1</i>. Gene ontology classification of these proteins identified proteomic changes that explain the root hairless phenotype and the altered immune response observed in the <i>cas-c1</i> mutant. The mechanism of action of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cyanid</span></strong>e as a signaling molecule was addressed using two proteomic approaches aimed at identifying the <i>S-</i>cyanylation of Cys as a posttranslational modification of proteins. Both the 2-imino-thiazolidine chemical method and the direct untargeted analysis of proteins using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry identified a set of 163 proteins susceptible to <i>S-</i>cyanylation that included SEDOHEPTULOSE 1,7-BISPHOSPHATASE (SBPase), the PEPTIDYL-PROLYL CIS-TRANS ISOMERASE 20-3 (CYP20-3), and ENOLASE2 (ENO2). In vitro analysis of these enzymes showed that <i>S-</i>cyanylation of SBPase Cys<sup>74</sup>, CYP20-3 Cys<sup>259</sup>, and ENO2 Cys<sup>346</sup> residues affected their enzymatic activity. Gene Ontology classification and protein-protein interaction cluster analysis showed that <i>S-</i>cyanylation is involved in the regulation of primary metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis, and the Calvin and <i>S</i>-adenosyl-Met cycles.</p>

Renewable acrylonitrile production
<p>Acrylonitrile (ACN) is a petroleum-derived compound used in resins, polymers, acrylics, and carbon fiber. We present a process for renewable ACN production using 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP), which can be produced microbially from sugars. The process achieves ACN molar yields exceeding 90% from ethyl 3-hydroxypropanoate (ethyl 3-HP) via dehydration and nitrilation with ammonia over an inexpensive titanium dioxide solid acid catalyst. We further describe an integrated process modeled at scale that is based on this chemistry and achieves near-quantitative ACN yields (98 ± 2%) from ethyl acrylate. This endothermic approach eliminates runaway reaction hazards and achieves higher yields than the standard propylene ammoxidation process. Avoidance of hydrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cyanid</span></strong>e as a by-product also improves process safety and mitigates product handling requirements.</p>

Reconfigured Cyanogenic Glucoside Biosynthesis in <i>Eucalyptus cladocalyx</i> Involves a Cytochrome P450 CYP706C55
<p>Cyanogenic glucosides are a class of specialized metabolites widespread in the plant kingdom. Cyanogenic glucosides are α-hydroxynitriles, and their hydrolysis releases toxic hydrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cyanid</span></strong>e, providing an effective chemical defense against herbivores. <i>Eucalyptus cladocalyx</i> is a cyanogenic tree, allocating up to 20% of leaf nitrogen to the biosynthesis of the cyanogenic monoglucoside, prunasin. Here, mass spectrometry analyses of <i>E. cladocalyx</i> tissues revealed spatial and ontogenetic variations in prunasin content, as well as the presence of the cyanogenic diglucoside amygdalin in flower buds and flowers. The identification and biochemical characterization of the prunasin biosynthetic enzymes revealed a unique enzyme configuration for prunasin production in <i>E. cladocalyx</i>. This result indicates that a multifunctional cytochrome P450 (CYP), CYP79A125, catalyzes the initial conversion of <sc>l</sc>-phenylalanine into its corresponding aldoxime, phenylacetaldoxime; a function consistent with other members of the CYP79 family. In contrast to the single multifunctional CYP known from other plant species, the conversion of phenylacetaldoxime to the α-hydroxynitrile, mandelonitrile, is catalyzed by two distinct CYPs. CYP706C55 catalyzes the dehydration of phenylacetaldoxime, an unusual CYP reaction. The resulting phenylacetonitrile is subsequently hydroxylatedby CYP71B103 to form mandelonitrile. The final glucosylation step to yield prunasin is catalyzed by a UDP-glucosyltransferase, UGT85A59. Members of the CYP706 family have not been reported previously to participate in the biosynthesis of cyanogenic glucosides, and the pathway structure in <i>E. cladocalyx</i> represents an example of convergent evolution in the biosynthesis of cyanogenic glucosides in plants.</p>

Elucidation of the Amygdalin Pathway Reveals the Metabolic Basis of Bitter and Sweet Almonds (<i>Prunus dulcis</i>)
<p>Almond (<i>Prunus dulcis</i>) is the principal <i>Prunus</i> species in which the consumed and thus commercially important part of the fruit is the kernel. As a result of continued selection, the vast majority of almonds have a nonbitter kernel. However, in the field, there are trees carrying bitter kernels, which are toxic to humans and, consequently, need to be removed. The toxicity of bitter almonds is caused by the accumulation of the cyanogenic diglucoside amygdalin, which releases toxic hydrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cyanid</span></strong>e upon hydrolysis. In this study, we identified and characterized the enzymes involved in the amygdalin biosynthetic pathway: PdCYP79D16 and PdCYP71AN24 as the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes catalyzing phenylalanine-to-mandelonitrile conversion, PdUGT94AF3 as an additional monoglucosyl transferase (UGT) catalyzing prunasin formation, and PdUGT94AF1 and PdUGT94AF2 as the two enzymes catalyzing amygdalin formation from prunasin. This was accomplished by constructing a sequence database containing UGTs known, or predicted, to catalyze a β(1→6)-<i>O</i>-glycosylation reaction and a Basic Local Alignment Search Tool search of the draft version of the almond genome versus these sequences. Functional characterization of candidate genes was achieved by transient expression in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that the expression of <i>PdCYP79D16</i> and <i>PdCYP71AN24</i> was not detectable or only reached minute levels in the sweet almond genotype during fruit development, while it was high and consistent in the bitter genotype. Therefore, the basis for the sweet kernel phenotype is a lack of expression of the genes encoding the two CYPs catalyzing the first steps in amygdalin biosynthesis.</p>

Alternative Oxidase Isoforms Are Differentially Activated by Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle Intermediates
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cyanid</span></strong>e-insensitive alternative oxidase (AOX) is a non-proton-pumping ubiquinol oxidase that catalyzes the reduction of oxygen to water and is posttranslationally regulated by redox mechanisms and 2-oxo acids. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) possesses five AOX isoforms (AOX1A–AOX1D and AOX2). AOX1D expression is increased in <i>aox1a</i> knockout mutants from Arabidopsis (especially after restriction of the cytochrome <i>c</i> pathway) but cannot compensate for the lack of AOX1A, suggesting a difference in the regulation of these isoforms. Therefore, we analyzed the different AOX isoenzymes with the aim to identify differences in their posttranslational regulation. Seven tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates (citrate, isocitrate, 2-oxoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, malate, and oxaloacetate) were tested for their influence on AOX1A, AOX1C, and AOX1D wild-type protein activity using a refined in vitro system. AOX1C is insensitive to all seven organic acids, AOX1A and AOX1D are both activated by 2-oxoglutarate, but only AOX1A is additionally activated by oxaloacetate. Furthermore, AOX isoforms cannot be transformed to mimic one another by substituting the variable cysteine residues at position III in the protein. In summary, we show that AOX isoforms from Arabidopsis are differentially fine-regulated by tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolites (most likely depending on the amino-terminal region around the highly conserved cysteine residues known to be involved in regulation by the 2-oxo acids pyruvate and glyoxylate) and propose that this is the main reason why they cannot functionally compensate for each other.</p>

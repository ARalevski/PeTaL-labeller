Study Comparing Vein Integrity and Clinical Outcomes in Open Vein Harvesting and 2 Types of Endoscopic Vein Harvesting for Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Current consensus statements maintain that endoscopic vein harvesting (EVH) should be standard care in coronary artery bypass graft surgery, but vein quality and clinical outcomes have been questioned. The VICO trial (Vein Integrity and Clinical Outcomes) was designed to assess the impact of different vein harvesting methods on vessel damage and whether this contributes to clinical outcomes after coronary artery bypass grafting.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In this single-center, randomized clinical trial, patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with an internal mammary artery and with 1 to 4 vein grafts were recruited. All veins were harvested by a single experienced practitioner. We randomly allocated 300 patients into closed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong> CO<sub>2</sub> EVH (n=100), open <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong> CO<sub>2</sub> EVH (n=100), and traditional open vein harvesting (n=100) groups. The primary end point was endothelial integrity and muscular damage of the harvested vein. Secondary end points included clinical outcomes (major adverse cardiac events), use of healthcare resources, and impact on health status (quality-adjusted life-years).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The open vein harvesting group demonstrated marginally better endothelial integrity in random samples (85% versus 88% versus 93% for closed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong> EVH, open <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong> EVH, and open vein harvesting; <i>P</i><0.001). Closed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong> EVH displayed the lowest longitudinal hypertrophy (1% versus 13.5% versus 3%; <i>P</i>=0.001). However, no differences in endothelial stretching were observed between groups (37% versus 37% versus 31%; <i>P</i>=0.62). Secondary clinical outcomes demonstrated no significant differences in composite major adverse cardiac event scores at each time point up to 48 months. The quality-adjusted life-year gain per patient was 0.11 (<i>P</i><0.001) for closed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong> EVH and 0.07 (<i>P</i>=0.003) for open <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong> EVH compared with open vein harvesting. The likelihood of being cost-effective, at a predefined threshold of £20 000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, was 75% for closed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong> EVH, 19% for open <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong> EVH, and 6% for open vein harvesting.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our study demonstrates that harvesting techniques affect the integrity of different vein layers, albeit only slightly. Secondary outcomes suggest that histological findings do not directly contribute to major adverse cardiac event outcomes. Gains in health status were observed, and cost-effectiveness was better with closed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong> EVH. High-level experience with endoscopic harvesting performed by a dedicated specialist practitioner gives optimal results comparable to those of open vein harvesting.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.isrctn.com</ext-link>.

Magneto-Seebeck tunneling on the atomic scale
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong>ing of spin-polarized electrons across a magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong> junct</span></strong>ion driven by a temperature gradient is a fundamental process for the thermal control of electron spin transport. We experimentally investigated the atomic-scale details of this magneto-Seebeck <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong>ing by placing a magnetic probe tip in close proximity to a magnetic sample at cryogenic temperature, with a vacuum as the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong>ing barrier. Heating the tip and measuring the thermopower of the junction while scanning across the spin texture of the sample lead to spin-resolved Seebeck coefficients that can be mapped at atomic-scale lateral resolution. We propose a spin detector for spintronics applications that is driven solely by waste heat, using magneto-Seebeck <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong>ing to convert spin information into a voltage that can be used for further data processing.</p>

Evidence for Majorana bound states in an iron-based superconductor
<p>The search for Majorana bound states (MBSs) has been fueled by the prospect of using their non-Abelian statistics for robust quantum computation. Two-dimensional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing topological materials have been predicted to host MBSs as zero-energy modes in vortex cores. By using scanning <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong>ing spectroscopy on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing Dirac surface state of the iron-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>or FeTe<sub>0.55</sub>Se<sub>0.45</sub>, we observed a sharp zero-bias peak inside a vortex core that does not split when moving away from the vortex center. The evolution of the peak under varying magnetic field, temperature, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong>ing barrier is consistent with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong>ing to a nearly pure MBS, separated from nontopological bound states. This observation offers a potential platform for realizing and manipulating MBSs at a relatively high temperature.</p>

Rapid change of superconductivity and electron-phonon coupling through critical doping in Bi-2212
<p>Electron-boson coupling plays a key role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ivity for many systems. However, in copper-based high–critical temperature (<i>T</i><sub>c</sub>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ors, its relation to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ivity remains controversial despite strong spectroscopic fingerprints. In this study, we used angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to find a pronounced correlation between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing gap and the bosonic coupling strength near the Brillouin zone boundary in Bi<sub>2</sub>Sr<sub>2</sub>CaCu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8+δ</sub>. The bosonic coupling strength rapidly increases from the overdoped Fermi liquid regime to the optimally doped strange metal, concomitant with the quadrupled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing gap and the doubled gap-to-<i>T</i><sub>c</sub> ratio across the pseudogap boundary. This synchronized lattice and electronic response suggests that the effects of electronic interaction and the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) reinforce each other in a positive-feedback loop upon entering the strange-metal regime, which in turn drives a stronger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ivity.</p>

Probing optically silent superfluid stripes in cuprates
<p>Unconventional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ivity in the cuprates coexists with other types of electronic order. However, some of these orders are invisible to most experimental probes because of their symmetry. For example, the possible existence of superfluid stripes is not easily validated with linear optics, because the stripe alignment causes interlayer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong>ing to vanish on average. Here we show that this frustration is removed in the nonlinear optical response. A giant terahertz third harmonic, characteristic of nonlinear Josephson <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong>ing, is observed in La<sub>1.885</sub>Ba<sub>0.115</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> above the transition temperature <i>T</i><sub>c</sub> = 13 kelvin and up to the charge-ordering temperature <i>T</i><sub>co</sub> = 55 kelvin. We model these results by hypothesizing the presence of a pair density wave condensate, in which nonlinear mixing of optically silent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong>ing modes drives large dipole-carrying supercurrents.</p>

Strongly correlated quantum walks with a 12-qubit superconducting processor
<p>Quantum walks are the quantum analogs of classical random walks, which allow for the simulation of large-scale quantum many-body systems and the realization of universal quantum computation without time-dependent control. We experimentally demonstrate quantum walks of one and two strongly correlated microwave photons in a one-dimensional array of 12 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing qubits with short-range interactions. First, in one-photon quantum walks, we observed the propagation of the density and correlation of the quasiparticle excitation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing qubit and quantum entanglement between qubit pairs. Second, when implementing two-photon quantum walks by exciting two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing qubits, we observed the fermionization of strongly interacting photons from the measured time-dependent long-range anticorrelations, representing the antibunching of photons with attractive interactions. The demonstration of quantum walks on a quantum processor, using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing qubits as artificial atoms and tomographic readout, paves the way to quantum simulation of many-body phenomena and universal quantum computation.</p>

Phonon-mediated quantum state transfer and remote qubit entanglement

Electrically tunable low-density superconductivity in a monolayer topological insulator
<p>Turning on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ivity in a topologically nontrivial insulator may provide a route to search for non-Abelian topological states.

Scale-invariant magnetoresistance in a cuprate superconductor
<p>The anomalous metallic state in the high-temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing cuprates is masked by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ivity near a quantum critical point. Applying high magnetic fields to suppress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ivity has enabled detailed studies of the normal state, yet the direct effect of strong magnetic fields on the metallic state is poorly understood. We report the high-field magnetoresistance of thin-film La<sub>2–</sub><i><sub>x</sub></i>Sr<i><sub>x</sub></i>CuO<sub>4</sub> cuprate in the vicinity of the critical doping, 0.161 ≤ <i>p</i> ≤ 0.190. We find that the metallic state exposed by suppressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ivity is characterized by magnetoresistance that is linear in magnetic fields up to 80 tesla. The magnitude of the linear-in-field resistivity mirrors the magnitude and doping evolution of the well-known linear-in-temperature resistivity that has been associated with quantum criticality in high-temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ors.</p>

Evidence for bulk superconductivity in pure bismuth single crystals at ambient pressure
<p>At ambient pressure, bulk rhombohedral bismuth is a semimetal that remains in the normal state down to at least 10 millikelvin. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ivity in bulk bismuth is thought to be unlikely because of the extremely low carrier density.

Tuning superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene
<p>Materials with flat electronic bands often exhibit exotic quantum phenomena owing to strong correlations. An isolated low-energy flat band can be induced in bilayer graphene by simply rotating the layers by 1.1°, resulting in the appearance of gate-tunable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing and correlated insulating phases. In this study, we demonstrate that in addition to the twist angle, the interlayer coupling can be varied to precisely tune these phases. We induce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ivity at a twist angle larger than 1.1°—in which correlated phases are otherwise absent—by varying the interlayer spacing with hydrostatic pressure. Our low-disorder devices reveal details about the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing phase diagram and its relationship to the nearby insulator. Our results demonstrate twisted bilayer graphene to be a distinctively tunable platform for exploring correlated states.</p>

Most of the proposed topological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ors are realized in difficult-to-fabricate heterostructures at very low temperatures.

Structure of the complete elongation complex of RNA polymerase II with basal factors

Here we report the structure of the Pol II elongation complex bound with the basal elongation factors Spt4/5, Elf1, and TFIIS. Spt4/5 (the Spt4/Spt5 complex) and Elf1 modify a wide area of the Pol II surface. Elf1 bridges the Pol II central cleft, completing a “DNA entry <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong>” for downstream DNA. Spt4 and the Spt5 NGN and KOW1 domains encircle the upstream DNA, constituting a “DNA exit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong>.” The Spt5 KOW4 and KOW5 domains augment the “RNA exit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong>,” directing the exiting nascent RNA.

Magnetic field–induced pair density wave state in the cuprate vortex halo

Although routinely labeled a charge density wave (CDW), this DW state could actually be an electron-pair density wave (PDW). To search for evidence of a field-induced PDW, we visualized modulations in the density of electronic states <i>N</i>(<i>r</i>) within the halo surrounding Bi<sub>2</sub>Sr<sub>2</sub>CaCu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub> vortex cores.

Quantum acoustics with superconducting qubits
<p>Mechanical objects have important practical applications in the fields of quantum information and metrology as quantum memories or transducers for measuring and connecting different types of quantum systems. The field of electromechanics is in pursuit of a robust and highly coherent device that couples motion to nonlinear quantum objects such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing qubits. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a high-frequency bulk acoustic wave resonator that is strongly coupled to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing qubit using piezoelectric transduction with a cooperativity of 260. We measure qubit and mechanical coherence times on the order of 10 microseconds. Our device requires only simple fabrication methods and provides controllable access to a multitude of phonon modes. We demonstrate quantum control and measurement on gigahertz phonons at the single-quantum level.</p>

CAT-tailing as a fail-safe mechanism for efficient degradation of stalled nascent polypeptides
<p>Ribosome stalling leads to recruitment of the ribosome quality control complex (RQC), which targets the partially synthesized polypeptide for proteasomal degradation through the action of the ubiquitin ligase Ltn1p. A second core RQC component, Rqc2p, modifies the nascent polypeptide by adding a carboxyl-terminal alanine and threonine (CAT) tail through a noncanonical elongation reaction. Here we examined the role of CAT-tailing in nascent-chain degradation in budding yeast. We found that Ltn1p efficiently accessed only nascent-chain lysines immediately proximal to the ribosome exit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong>. For substrates without Ltn1p-accessible lysines, CAT-tailing enabled degradation by exposing lysines sequestered in the ribosome exit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong>. Thus, CAT-tails do not serve as a degron, but rather provide a fail-safe mechanism that expands the range of RQC-degradable substrates.</p>

Discovery of orbital-selective Cooper pairing in FeSe
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>or iron selenide (FeSe) is of intense interest owing to its unusual nonmagnetic nematic state and potential for high-temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ivity. But its Cooper pairing mechanism has not been determined. We used Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference imaging to determine the Fermi surface geometry of the electronic bands surrounding the Γ = (0, 0) and <i>X</i> = (π/<i>a</i><sub>Fe</sub>, 0) points of FeSe and to measure the corresponding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing energy gaps. We show that both gaps are extremely anisotropic but nodeless and that they exhibit gap maxima oriented orthogonally in momentum space. Moreover, by implementing a novel technique, we demonstrate that these gaps have opposite sign with respect to each other. This complex gap configuration reveals the existence of orbital-selective Cooper pairing that, in FeSe, is based preferentially on electrons from the d<i><sub>yz</sub></i> orbitals of the iron atoms.</p>

Femtosecond electron-phonon lock-in by photoemission and x-ray free-electron laser
<p>The interactions that lead to the emergence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ivity in iron-based materials remain a subject of debate. It has been suggested that electron-electron correlations enhance electron-phonon coupling in iron selenide (FeSe) and related pnictides, but direct experimental verification has been lacking. Here we show that the electron-phonon coupling strength in FeSe can be quantified by combining two time-domain experiments into a “coherent lock-in” measurement in the terahertz regime. X-ray diffraction tracks the light-induced femtosecond coherent lattice motion at a single phonon frequency, and photoemission monitors the subsequent coherent changes in the electronic band structure. Comparison with theory reveals a strong enhancement of the coupling strength in FeSe owing to correlation effects. Given that the electron-phonon coupling affects <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ivity exponentially, this enhancement highlights the importance of the cooperative interplay between electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions.</p>

Bifurcating electron-transfer pathways in DNA photolyases determine the repair quantum yield
<p>Photolyase is a blue-light–activated enzyme that repairs ultraviolet-induced DNA damage that occurs in the form of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4) photoproducts. Previous studies on microbial photolyases have revealed an electron-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong>ing pathway that is critical for the repair mechanism. In this study, we used femtosecond spectroscopy to deconvolute seven electron-transfer reactions in 10 elementary steps in all classes of CPD photolyases. We report a unified electron-transfer pathway through a conserved structural configuration that bifurcates to favor direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong>ing in prokaryotes and a two-step hopping mechanism in eukaryotes. Both bifurcation routes are operative, but their relative contributions, dictated by the reduction potentials of the flavin cofactor and the substrate, determine the overall quantum yield of repair.</p>

Measurement of a superconducting qubit with a microwave photon counter

Conventional approaches to the measurement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing qubits, involving linear amplification of a microwave probe tone followed by heterodyne detection at room temperature, do not scale well to large system sizes. We introduce an approach to measurement based on a microwave photon counter demonstrating raw single-shot measurement fidelity of 92%. Moreover, the intrinsic damping of the photon counter is used to extract the energy released by the measurement process, allowing repeated high-fidelity quantum nondemolition measurements. Our scheme provides access to the classical outcome of projective quantum measurement at the millikelvin stage and could form the basis for a scalable quantum-to-classical interface.</p>

Regulating the femtosecond excited-state lifetime of a single molecule
<p>The key to controlling reactions of molecules induced with the current of a scanning <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong>ing microscope (STM) tip is the ultrashort intermediate excited ionic state. The initial condition of the excited state is set by the energy and position of the injected current; thereafter, its dynamics determines the reaction outcome. We show that a STM can directly and controllably influence the excited-state dynamics. For the STM-induced desorption of toluene molecules from the Si(111)-7x7 surface, as the tip approaches the molecule, the probability of manipulation drops by two orders of magnitude. A two-channel quenching of the excited state is proposed, consisting of an invariant surface channel and a tip height–dependent channel. We conclude that picometer tip proximity regulates the lifetime of the excited state from 10 femtoseconds to less than 0.1 femtoseconds.</p>

Collective clog control: Optimizing traffic flow in confined biological and robophysical excavation

Tools from the study of dense particulate ensembles elucidate how idleness reduces the frequency of flow-stopping clogs and how selective retreating reduces cluster dissolution time for the rare clusters that still occur.

The emission of the charged molecule was controlled by tuning the thickness of the insulator and the plasmons localized at the apex of the STM tip.

A blueprint for demonstrating quantum supremacy with superconducting qubits

In this study, we used nine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing qubits to demonstrate a promising path toward quantum supremacy. By individually tuning the qubit parameters, we were able to generate thousands of distinct Hamiltonian evolutions and probe the output probabilities. The measured probabilities obey a universal distribution, consistent with uniformly sampling the full Hilbert space. As the number of qubits increases, the system continues to explore the exponentially growing number of states. Extending these results to a system of 50 qubits has the potential to address scientific questions that are beyond the capabilities of any classical computer.</p>

Encoding of vinylidene isomerization in its anion photoelectron spectrum
<p>Vinylidene-acetylene isomerization is the prototypical example of a 1,2-hydrogen shift, one of the most important classes of isomerization reactions in organic chemistry.

Peaks in the photoelectron spectra are considerably narrower than in previous work and reveal subtleties in the isomerization dynamics of neutral vinylidene, as well as vibronic coupling with an excited state of vinylidene. Comparison with theory permits assignment of most spectral features to eigenstates dominated by vinylidene character. However, excitation of the ν<sub>6</sub> in-plane rocking mode in H<sub>2</sub>CC results in appreciable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong>ing-facilitated mixing with highly vibrationally excited states of acetylene, leading to broadening and/or spectral fine structure that is largely suppressed for analogous vibrational levels of D<sub>2</sub>CC.</p>

An algal photoenzyme converts fatty acids to hydrocarbons

This enzyme belongs to an algae-specific clade of the glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase family and catalyzes the decarboxylation of free fatty acids to n-alkanes or -alkenes in response to blue light. Crystal structure of the protein reveals a fatty acid–binding site in a hydrophobic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tunnel</span></strong> leading to the light-capturing flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor.

These results suggest that in general, it is impossible to form flat two-dimensional nanocrystalline films of copper and other metals exhibiting small stacking fault energies and/or large elastic anisotropy, which induce a large anisotropy in the dislocation-line energy.</p>

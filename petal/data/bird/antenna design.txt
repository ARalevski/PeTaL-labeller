Global analysis of protein folding using massively parallel design, synthesis, and testing
<p>Proteins fold into unique native structures stabilized by thousands of weak interactions that collectively overcome the entropic cost of folding. Although these forces are “encoded” in the thousands of known protein structures, “decoding” them is challenging because of the complexity of natural proteins that have evolved for function, not stability. We combined computational protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>, next-generation gene synthesis, and a high-throughput protease susceptibility assay to measure folding and stability for more than 15,000 de novo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed miniproteins, 1000 natural proteins, 10,000 point mutants, and 30,000 negative control sequences. This analysis identified more than 2500 stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed proteins in four basic folds—a number sufficient to enable us to systematically examine how sequence determines folding and stability in uncharted protein space. Iteration between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> and experiment increased the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> success rate from 6% to 47%, produced stable proteins unlike those found in nature for topologies where <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> was initially unsuccessful, and revealed subtle contributions to stability as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>s became increasingly optimized. Our approach achieves the long-standing goal of a tight feedback cycle between computation and experiment and has the potential to transform computational protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> into a data-driven science.</p>

De novo design of tunable, pH-driven conformational changes
<p>The ability of naturally occurring proteins to change conformation in response to environmental changes is critical to biological function. Although there have been advances in the de novo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> of stable proteins with a single, deep free-energy minimum, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> of conformational switches remains challenging. We present a general strategy to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> pH-responsive protein conformational changes by precisely preorganizing histidine residues in buried hydrogen-bond networks. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> homotrimers and heterodimers that are stable above pH 6.5 but undergo cooperative, large-scale conformational changes when the pH is lowered and electrostatic and steric repulsion builds up as the network histidine residues become protonated. The transition pH and cooperativity can be controlled through the number of histidine-containing networks and the strength of the surrounding hydrophobic interactions. Upon disassembly, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed proteins disrupt lipid membranes both in vitro and after being endocytosed in mammalian cells. Our results demonstrate that environmentally triggered conformational changes can now be programmed by de novo protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>.</p>

Accurate computational design of multipass transmembrane proteins
<p>The computational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> of transmembrane proteins with more than one membrane-spanning region remains a major challenge. We report the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> of transmembrane monomers, homodimers, trimers, and tetramers with 76 to 215 residue subunits containing two to four membrane-spanning regions and up to 860 total residues that adopt the target oligomerization state in detergent solution. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed proteins localize to the plasma membrane in bacteria and in mammalian cells, and magnetic tweezer unfolding experiments in the membrane indicate that they are very stable.

Comprehensive computational design of ordered peptide macrocycles
<p>Mixed-chirality peptide macrocycles such as cyclosporine are among the most potent therapeutics identified to date, but there is currently no way to systematically search the structural space spanned by such compounds. Natural proteins do not provide a useful guide: Peptide macrocycles lack regular secondary structures and hydrophobic cores, and can contain local structures not accessible with <sc>l</sc>-amino acids. Here, we enumerate the stable structures that can be adopted by macrocyclic peptides composed of <sc>l</sc>- and <sc>d</sc>-amino acids by near-exhaustive backbone sampling followed by sequence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> and energy landscape calculations. We identify more than 200 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>s predicted to fold into single stable structures, many times more than the number of currently available unbound peptide macrocycle structures. Nuclear magnetic resonance structures of 9 of 12 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed 7- to 10-residue macrocycles, and three 11- to 14-residue bicyclic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>s, are close to the computational models. Our results provide a nearly complete coverage of the rich space of structures possible for short peptide macrocycles and vastly increase the available starting scaffolds for both rational drug <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> and library selection methods.</p>

“Perfect” designer chromosome V and behavior of a ring derivative
<p>Perfect matching of an assembled physical sequence to a specified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed sequence is crucial to verify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> principles in genome synthesis. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed and de novo synthesized 536,024–base pair chromosome synV in the “Build-A-Genome China” course. We corrected an initial isolate of synV to perfectly match the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed sequence using integrative cotransformation and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9)–mediated editing in 22 steps; synV strains exhibit high fitness under a variety of culture conditions, compared with that of wild-type V strains. A ring synV derivative was constructed, which is fully functional in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> under all conditions tested and exhibits lower spore viability during meiosis. Ring synV chromosome can extends Sc2.0 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> principles and provides a model with which to study genomic rearrangement, ring chromosome evolution, and human ring chromosome disorders.</p>

Principles for designing proteins with cavities formed by curved β sheets
<p>Active sites and ligand-binding cavities in native proteins are often formed by curved β sheets, and the ability to control β-sheet curvature would allow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> of binding proteins with cavities customized to specific ligands. Toward this end, we investigated the mechanisms controlling β-sheet curvature by studying the geometry of β sheets in naturally occurring protein structures and folding simulations.

Molecular Mechanisms of Photoadaptation of Photosystem I Supercomplex from an Evolutionary Cyanobacterial/Algal Intermediate
<p>The monomeric photosystem I-light-harvesting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antenna</span></strong> complex I (PSI-LHCI) supercomplex from the extremophilic red alga <i>Cyanidioschyzon merolae</i> represents an intermediate evolutionary link between the cyanobacterial PSI reaction center and its green algal/higher plant counterpart. We show that the <i>C. merolae</i> PSI-LHCI supercomplex is characterized by robustness in various extreme conditions. By a combination of biochemical, spectroscopic, mass spectrometry, and electron microscopy/single particle analyses, we dissected three molecular mechanisms underlying the inherent robustness of the <i>C. merolae</i> PSI-LHCI supercomplex: (1) the accumulation of photoprotective zeaxanthin in the LHCI <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antenna</span></strong> and the PSI reaction center; (2) structural remodeling of the LHCI <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antenna</span></strong> and adjustment of the effective absorption cross section; and (3) dynamic readjustment of the stoichiometry of the two PSI-LHCI isomers and changes in the oligomeric state of the PSI-LHCI supercomplex, accompanied by dissociation of the PsaK core subunit. We show that the largest low light-treated <i>C. merolae</i> PSI-LHCI supercomplex can bind up to eight Lhcr <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antenna</span></strong> subunits, which are organized as two rows on the PsaF/PsaJ side of the core complex. Under our experimental conditions, we found no evidence of functional coupling of the phycobilisomes with the PSI-LHCI supercomplex purified from various light conditions, suggesting that the putative association of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antenna</span></strong> with the PSI supercomplex is absent or may be lost during the purification procedure.</p>

Reassessing the Roles of PIN Proteins and Anticlinal Microtubules during Pavement Cell Morphogenesis
<p>The leaf epidermis is a biomechanical shell that influences the size and shape of the organ. Its morphogenesis is a multiscale process in which nanometer-scale cytoskeletal protein complexes, individual cells, and groups of cells pattern growth and define macroscopic leaf traits. Interdigitated growth of neighboring cells is an evolutionarily conserved developmental strategy. Understanding how signaling pathways and cytoskeletal proteins pattern cell walls during this form of tissue morphogenesis is an important research challenge. The cellular and molecular control of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lobe</span></strong>d cell morphology is currently thought to involve PIN-FORMED (PIN)-type plasma membrane efflux carriers that generate subcellular auxin gradients. Auxin gradients were proposed to function across cell boundaries to encode stable offset patterns of cortical microtubules and actin filaments between adjacent cells. Many models suggest that long-lived microtubules along the anticlinal cell wall generate local cell wall heterogeneities that restrict local growth and specify the timing and location of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lobe</span></strong> formation. Here, we used Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) reverse genetics and multivariate long-term time-lapse imaging to test current cell shape control models. We found that neither PIN proteins nor long-lived microtubules along the anticlinal wall predict the patterns of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lobe</span></strong> formation. In fields of lobing cells, anticlinal microtubules are not correlated with cell shape and are unstable at the time scales of cell expansion. Our analyses indicate that anticlinal microtubules have multiple functions in pavement cells and that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lobe</span></strong> initiation is likely controlled by complex interactions among cell geometry, cell wall stress patterns, and transient microtubule networks that span the anticlinal and periclinal walls.</p>

De novo design of self-assembling helical protein filaments

Cryo–electron microscopy structures of six <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>s are close to the computational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> models. The filament building blocks are idealized repeat proteins, and thus the diameter of the filaments can be systematically tuned by varying the number of repeat units. The assembly and disassembly of the filaments can be controlled by engineered anchor and capping units built from monomers lacking one of the interaction surfaces. The ability to generate dynamic, highly ordered structures that span micrometers from protein monomers opens up possibilities for the fabrication of new multiscale metamaterials.</p>

Chemogenetics revealed: DREADD occupancy and activation via converted clozapine
<p>The chemogenetic technology DREADD (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>er receptors exclusively activated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>er drugs) is widely used for remote manipulation of neuronal activity in freely moving animals.

Nevertheless, the in vivo mechanism of action of CNO at DREADDs has never been confirmed. CNO does not enter the brain after systemic drug injections and shows low affinity for DREADDs. Clozapine, to which CNO rapidly converts in vivo, shows high DREADD affinity and potency. Upon systemic CNO injections, converted clozapine readily enters the brain and occupies central nervous system–expressed DREADDs, whereas systemic subthreshold clozapine injections induce preferential DREADD-mediated behaviors.</p>

Electrified methane reforming: A compact approach to greener industrial hydrogen production
<p>Electrification of conventionally fired chemical reactors has the potential to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and provide flexible and compact heat generation. Here, we describe a disruptive approach to a fundamental process by integrating an electrically heated catalytic structure directly into a steam-methane–reforming (SMR) reactor for hydrogen production. Intimate contact between the electric heat source and the reaction site drives the reaction close to thermal equilibrium, increases catalyst utilization, and limits unwanted byproduct formation. The integrated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> with small characteristic length scales allows compact reactor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>s, potentially 100 times smaller than current reformer platforms.

Packing of apolar side chains enables accurate design of highly stable membrane proteins
<p>The features that stabilize the structures of membrane proteins remain poorly understood. Polar interactions contribute modestly, and the hydrophobic effect contributes little to the energetics of apolar side-chain packing in membranes. Disruption of steric packing can destabilize the native folds of membrane proteins, but is packing alone sufficient to drive folding in lipids? If so, then membrane proteins stabilized by this feature should be readily <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed and structurally characterized—yet this has not been achieved. Through simulation of the natural protein phospholamban and re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> of variants, we define a steric packing code underlying its assembly. Synthetic membrane proteins <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed using this code and stabilized entirely by apolar side chains conform to the intended fold. Although highly stable, the steric complementarity required for their folding is surprisingly stringent. Structural informatics shows that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed packing motif recurs across the proteome, emphasizing a prominent role for precise apolar packing in membrane protein folding, stabilization, and evolution.</p>

A sweeter approach to vaccine design
<p>Vaccines have transformed human health. Yet, guided primarily by empiricism for centuries, vaccine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> ultimately met its match in scourges such as HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria, which continue to plague global health. The elusive search for vaccines against such diseases has driven researchers of diverse expertise to forgo empirical vaccinology. Instead, they favor a reductionist approach inspired by how pathogens interact with the immune system, which has evolved to distinguish foreign from self by sensing both physical (e.g, size) and chemical (e.g., foreign molecules) features of pathogens. This has guided the rational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> of vaccines that mimic key pathogen properties, including arraying antigens on particles to increase recognition by antibody-producing B cells (<i>1</i>). However, the mechanisms by which multivalent antigen display on nanoparticles—either synthetic or natural—enhances immunity, and how this may influence vaccine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> principles, remain unresolved. On page 649 of this issue, Tokatlian <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) help fill this knowledge gap by demonstrating that engineering nanoparticles with glycans—sugar molecules—is critical to potentiating antibody responses. This might lead to improved next-generation vaccines against a wide diversity of pathogens.</p>

Activation mechanism of a human SK-calmodulin channel complex elucidated by cryo-EM structures
<p>Small-conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> (SK) channels mediate neuron excitability and are associated with synaptic transmission and plasticity. They also regulate immune responses and the size of blood cells. Activation of SK channels requires calmodulin (CaM), but how CaM binds and opens SK channels has been unclear. Here we report cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of a human SK4-CaM channel complex in closed and activated states at 3.4- and 3.5-angstrom resolution, respectively. Four CaM molecules bind to one channel tetramer. Each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lobe</span></strong> of CaM serves a distinct function: The C-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lobe</span></strong> binds to the channel constitutively, whereas the N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lobe</span></strong> interacts with the S4-S5 linker in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner. The S4-S5 linker, which contains two distinct helices, undergoes conformational changes upon CaM binding to open the channel pore. These structures reveal the gating mechanism of SK channels and provide a basis for understanding SK channel pharmacology.</p>

The robot explores a two-dimensional testing ground on the surface of DNA origami, picks up multiple cargos of two types that are initially at unordered locations, and delivers them to specified destinations until all molecules are sorted into two distinct piles. The robot is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed to perform a random walk without any energy supply. Exploiting this feature, a single robot can repeatedly sort multiple cargos. Localization on DNA origami allows for distinct cargo-sorting tasks to take place simultaneously in one test tube or for multiple robots to collectively perform the same task.</p>

Dynamic Changes between Two LHCX-Related Energy Quenching Sites Control Diatom Photoacclimation
<p>Marine diatoms are prominent phytoplankton organisms that perform photosynthesis in extremely variable environments. Diatoms possess a strong ability to dissipate excess absorbed energy as heat via nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ). This process relies on changes in carotenoid pigment composition (xanthophyll cycle) and on specific members of the light-harvesting complex family specialized in photoprotection (LHCXs), which potentially act as NPQ effectors. However, the link between light stress, NPQ, and the existence of different LHCX isoforms is not understood in these organisms. Using picosecond fluorescence analysis, we observed two types of NPQ in the pennate diatom <i>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</i> that were dependent on light conditions. Short exposure of low-light-acclimated cells to high light triggers the onset of energy quenching close to the core of photosystem II, while prolonged light stress activates NPQ in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antenna</span></strong>. Biochemical analysis indicated a link between the changes in the NPQ site/mechanism and the induction of different LHCX isoforms, which accumulate either in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antenna</span></strong> complexes or in the core complex. By comparing the responses of wild-type cells and transgenic lines with a reduced expression of the major LHCX isoform, LHCX1, we conclude that core complex-associated NPQ is more effective in photoprotection than is the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antenna</span></strong> complex. Overall, our data clarify the complex molecular scenario of light responses in diatoms and provide a rationale for the existence of a degenerate family of LHCX proteins in these algae.</p>

Digitization of multistep organic synthesis in reactionware for on-demand pharmaceuticals

Synthetic transcription elongation factors license transcription across repressive chromatin

These molecules are composed of programmable DNA-binding ligands flexibly tethered to a small molecule that engages the transcription elongation machinery. By limiting activity to targeted loci, Syn-TEFs convert constituent modules from broad-spectrum inhibitors of transcription into gene-specific stimulators. Here we present Syn-TEF1, a molecule that actively enables transcription across repressive GAA repeats that silence frataxin expression in Friedreich’s ataxia, a terminal neurodegenerative disease with no effective therapy. The modular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> of Syn-TEF1 defines a general framework for developing a class of molecules that license transcription elongation at targeted genomic loci.</p>

Single-stranded DNA and RNA origami
<p>Self-folding of an information-carrying polymer into a defined structure is foundational to biology and offers attractive potential as a synthetic strategy. Although multicomponent self-assembly has produced complex synthetic nanostructures, unimolecular folding has seen limited progress. We describe a framework to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> and synthesize a single DNA or RNA strand to self-fold into a complex yet unknotted structure that approximates an arbitrary user-prescribed shape. We experimentally construct diverse multikilobase single-stranded structures, including a ~10,000-nucleotide (nt) DNA structure and a ~6000-nt RNA structure. We demonstrate facile replication of the strand in vitro and in living cells. The work here thus establishes unimolecular folding as a general strategy for constructing complex and replicable nucleic acid nanostructures, and expands the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> space and material scalability for bottom-up nanotechnology.</p>

Reducing the stochasticity of crystal nucleation to enable subnanosecond memory writing
<p>Operation speed is a key challenge in phase-change random-access memory (PCRAM) technology, especially for achieving subnanosecond high-speed cache memory. Commercialized PCRAM products are limited by the tens of nanoseconds writing speed, originating from the stochastic crystal nucleation during the crystallization of amorphous germanium antimony telluride<i> </i>(Ge<sub>2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>5</sub>). Here, we demonstrate an alloying strategy to speed up the crystallization kinetics. The scandium antimony telluride (Sc<sub>0.2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>) compound that we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed allows a writing speed of only 700 picoseconds without preprogramming in a large conventional PCRAM device. This ultrafast crystallization stems from the reduced stochasticity of nucleation through geometrically matched and robust scandium telluride (ScTe) chemical bonds that stabilize crystal precursors in the amorphous state. Controlling nucleation through alloy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> paves the way for the development of cache-type PCRAM technology to boost the working efficiency of computing systems.</p>

Purcell effect for active tuning of light scattering from semiconductor optical antennas
<p>Subwavelength, high–refractive index semiconductor nanostructures support optical resonances that endow them with valuable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antenna</span></strong> functions. Control over the intrinsic properties, including their complex refractive index, size, and geometry, has been used to manipulate fundamental light absorption, scattering, and emission processes in nanostructured optoelectronic devices. In this study, we harness the electric and magnetic resonances of such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antenna</span></strong>s to achieve a very strong dependence of the optical properties on the external environment. Specifically, we illustrate how the resonant scattering wavelength of single silicon nanowires is tunable across the entire visible spectrum by simply moving the height of the nanowires above a metallic mirror. We apply this concept by using a nanoelectromechanical platform to demonstrate active tuning.</p>

Designing river flows to improve food security futures in the Lower Mekong Basin
<p>Rivers provide unrivaled opportunity for clean energy via hydropower, but little is known about the potential impact of dam-building on the food security these rivers provide. In tropical rivers, rainfall drives a periodic flood pulse fueling fish production and delivering nutrition to more than 150 million people worldwide. Hydropower will modulate this flood pulse, thereby threatening food security. We identified variance components of the Mekong River flood pulse that predict yield in one of the largest freshwater fisheries in the world. We used these variance components to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> an algorithm for a managed hydrograph to explore future yields. This algorithm mimics attributes of discharge variance that drive fishery yield: prolonged low flows followed by a short flood pulse. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed flows increased yield by a factor of 3.7 relative to historical hydrology. Managing desired components of discharge variance will lead to greater efficiency in the Lower Mekong Basin food system.</p>

Three-dimensional mechanical metamaterials with a twist
<p>Rationally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed artificial materials enable mechanical properties that are inaccessible with ordinary materials. Pushing on an ordinary linearly elastic bar can cause it to be deformed in many ways. However, a twist, the counterpart of optical activity in the static case, is strictly zero. The unavailability of this degree of freedom hinders applications in terms of mode conversion and the realization of advanced mechanical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>s using coordinate transformations. Here, we aim at realizing microstructured three-dimensional elastic chiral mechanical metamaterials that overcome this limitation. On overall millimeter-sized samples, we measure twists per axial strain exceeding 2°/%. Scaling up the number of unit cells for fixed sample dimensions, the twist is robust due to metamaterial stiffening, indicating a characteristic length scale and bringing the aforementioned applications into reach.</p>

Arbitrary spin-to–orbital angular momentum conversion of light

Synthesis, debugging, and effects of synthetic chromosome consolidation: synVI and beyond

Completing Sc2.0 specifies consolidation of 16 synthetic chromosomes into a single strain. We investigated phenotypic, transcriptional, and proteomewide consequences of Sc2.0 chromosome consolidation in poly-synthetic strains. Another “bug” was discovered through proteomic analysis, associated with alteration of the <i>HIS2</i> transcription start due to transfer RNA deletion and loxPsym site insertion.

3D organization of synthetic and scrambled chromosomes
<p>Although the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> of the synthetic yeast genome Sc2.0 is highly conservative with respect to gene content, the deletion of several classes of repeated sequences and the introduction of thousands of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>er changes may affect genome organization and potentially alter cellular functions. We report here the Hi-C–determined three-dimensional (3D) conformations of Sc2.0 chromosomes. The absence of repeats leads to a smoother contact pattern and more precisely tractable chromosome conformations, and the large-scale genomic organization is globally unaffected by the presence of synthetic chromosome(s). Two exceptions are synIII, which lacks the silent mating-type cassettes, and synXII, specifically when the ribosomal DNA is moved to another chromosome.

Bone-like crack resistance in hierarchical metastable nanolaminate steels

Inspired by the excellent fracture toughness of bone, we explored the fatigue resistance in metastability-assisted multiphase steels. We show here that when steel microstructures are hierarchical and laminated, similar to the substructure of bone, superior crack resistance can be realized. Our results reveal that tuning the interface structure, distribution, and phase stability to simultaneously activate multiple micromechanisms that resist crack propagation is key for the observed leap in mechanical response.

A chemical biology route to site-specific authentic protein modifications

We first use the established <i>O</i>-phosphoserine (Sep) orthogonal translation system to create a Sep-containing recombinant protein. The Sep residue is then dephosphorylated to dehydroalanine (Dha). Last, conjugate addition of alkyl iodides to Dha, promoted by zinc and copper, enables chemoselective carbon-carbon bond formation. To validate our approach, we produced histone H3, ubiquitin, and green fluorescent protein variants with site-specific modifications, including different methylations of H3K79. The methylated histones stimulate transcription through histone acetylation.

Extensive migration of young neurons into the infant human frontal lobe
<p>The first few months after birth, when a child begins to interact with the environment, are critical to human brain development. The human frontal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lobe</span></strong> is important for social behavior and executive function; it has increased in size and complexity relative to other species, but the processes that have contributed to this expansion are unknown. Our studies of postmortem infant human brains revealed a collection of neurons that migrate and integrate widely into the frontal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lobe</span></strong> during infancy. Chains of young neurons move tangentially close to the walls of the lateral ventricles and along blood vessels. These cells then individually disperse long distances to reach cortical tissue, where they differentiate and contribute to inhibitory circuits. Late-arriving interneurons could contribute to developmental plasticity, and the disruption of their postnatal migration or differentiation may underlie neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

These improvements enable the amiRNA technology to be a functional gene knockout tool for basic and applied plant research.</p>

PaCeQuant: A Tool for High-Throughput Quantification of Pavement Cell Shape Characteristics
<p>Pavement cells (PCs) are the most frequently occurring cell type in the leaf epidermis and play important roles in leaf growth and function. In many plant species, PCs form highly complex jigsaw-puzzle-shaped cells with interlocking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lobe</span></strong>s. Understanding of their development is of high interest for plant science research because of their importance for leaf growth and hence for plant fitness and crop yield. Studies of PC development, however, are limited, because robust methods are lacking that enable automatic segmentation and quantification of PC shape parameters suitable to reflect their cellular complexity. Here, we present our new ImageJ-based tool, PaCeQuant, which provides a fully automatic image analysis workflow for PC shape quantification. PaCeQuant automatically detects cell boundaries of PCs from confocal input images and enables manual correction of automatic segmentation results or direct import of manually segmented cells. PaCeQuant simultaneously extracts 27 shape features that include global, contour-based, skeleton-based, and PC-specific object descriptors. In addition, we included a method for classification and analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lobe</span></strong>s at two-cell junctions and three-cell junctions, respectively. We provide an R script for graphical visualization and statistical analysis. We validated PaCeQuant by extensive comparative analysis to manual segmentation and existing quantification tools and demonstrated its usability to analyze PC shape characteristics during development and between different genotypes. PaCeQuant thus provides a platform for robust, efficient, and reproducible quantitative analysis of PC shape characteristics that can easily be applied to study PC development in large data sets.</p>

Modeling of Dolichol Mass Spectra Isotopic Envelopes as a Tool to Monitor Isoprenoid Biosynthesis
<p>The cooperation of the mevalonate (MVA) and methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathways, operating in parallel in plants to generate isoprenoid precursors, has been studied extensively. Elucidation of the isoprenoid metabolic pathways is indispensable for the rational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> of plant and microbial systems for the production of industrially valuable terpenoids. Here, we describe a new method, based on numerical modeling of mass spectra of metabolically labeled dolichols (Dols), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed to quantitatively follow the cooperation of MVA and MEP reprogrammed upon osmotic stress (sorbitol treatment) in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The contribution of the MEP pathway increased significantly (reaching 100%) exclusively for the dominating Dols, while for long-chain Dols, the relative input of the MEP and MVA pathways remained unchanged, suggesting divergent sites of synthesis for dominating and long-chain Dols. The analysis of numerically modeled Dol mass spectra is a novel method to follow modulation of the concomitant activity of isoprenoid-generating pathways in plant cells; additionally, it suggests an exchange of isoprenoid intermediates between plastids and peroxisomes.</p>

Carbon Supply and Photoacclimation Cross Talk in the Green Alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>
<p>Photosynthetic organisms are exposed to drastic changes in light conditions, which can affect their photosynthetic efficiency and induce photodamage. To face these changes, they have developed a series of acclimation mechanisms. In this work, we have studied the acclimation strategies of <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, a model green alga that can grow using various carbon sources and is thus an excellent system in which to study photosynthesis. Like other photosynthetic algae, it has evolved inducible mechanisms to adapt to conditions where carbon supply is limiting. We have analyzed how the carbon availability influences the composition and organization of the photosynthetic apparatus and the capacity of the cells to acclimate to different light conditions. Using electron microscopy, biochemical, and fluorescence measurements, we show that differences in CO<sub>2</sub> availability not only have a strong effect on the induction of the carbon-concentrating mechanisms but also change the acclimation strategy of the cells to light. For example, while cells in limiting CO<sub>2</sub> maintain a large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antenna</span></strong> even in high light and switch on energy-dissipative mechanisms, cells in high CO<sub>2</sub> reduce the amount of pigments per cell and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antenna</span></strong> size. Our results show the high plasticity of the photosynthetic apparatus of <i>C. reinhardtii</i>. This alga is able to use various photoacclimation strategies, and the choice of which to activate strongly depends on the carbon availability.</p>

Five-year clinical and radiological outcomes in 257 consecutive cementless Oxford medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasties
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Our aim was to examine the clinical and radiographic outcomes   in 257 consecutive Oxford unicompartmental knee arthroplasties (OUKAs)   (238 patients), five years post-operatively.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A retrospective evaluation was undertaken of patients treated   between April 2008 and October 2010 in a regional centre by two   non-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ing surgeons with no previous experience of UKAs. The   Oxford Knee Scores (OKSs) were recorded and fluoroscopically aligned   radiographs were assessed post-operatively at one and five years.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The median age of the 238 patients was 65.0 years (interquartile   range (IQR) 59.0 to 73.0), the median body mas index was 30.0 (IQR   27.5 to 33.0) and 51.7% were male. There were no intra-operative   complications. There was a significant improvement in the median   OKS at six weeks (34, IQR 31.0 to 37.0), one year (38, IQR 29.0   to 43.0) and five years (37, IQR 27.0 to 42.0) when compared with   the pre-operative scores (16, IQR 13.0 to 19.0) (all p = < 0.01).   No patient had progressive radiolucent lines or loosening.</p><p>A total of 16 patients had died by five years. The cumulative   survival at five years was 98.8% and the mean survival time was   5.8 years (95% confidence interval 5.6 to 5.9). A total of seven   OUKAs (2.7%) were revised; three within five years and four thereafter,   between 5.1 and 5.7 years post-operatively.

Periprosthetic femoral fractures and trying to avoid them
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Periprosthetic femoral fractures (PFF) following total hip arthroplasty   (THA) are devastating complications that are associated with functional   limitations and increased overall mortality. Although cementless   implants have been associated with an increased risk of PFF, the   precise contribution of implant geometry and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> on the risk   of both intra-operative and post-operative PFF remains poorly investigated.   A systematic review was performed to aggregate all of the PFF literature   with specific attention to the femoral implant used.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A systematic search strategy of several journal databases and   recent proceedings from the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons   was performed. Clinical articles were included for analysis if sufficient   implant description was provided. All articles were reviewed by   two reviewers. A review of fundamental investigations of implant   load-to-failure was performed, with the intent of identifying similar   conclusions from the clinical and fundamental literature.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In total 596 articles were initially identified, with 34 being   eligible for analysis. Aggregate analysis of 1691 PFFs in 342 719   primary THAs revealed a significantly higher number of PFFs with   cementless femoral implants (p < 0.001). Single-wedge and double-wedge   (fit-and-fill) femoral implants were associated with a threefold   increase in PFF rates (p < 0.001) compared with anatomical, fully   coated and tapered/rounded stems. Within cemented stems, loaded-taper   (Exeter) stems were associated with more PFFs than composite-beam   (Charnley) stems (p = 0.004). Review of the fundamental literature   revealed very few studies comparing cementless component <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Very few studies within the PFF literature provide detailed implant   information. Cementless implants, specifically those of single-wedge   and double-wedge, have the highest PFF rates in the literature,   with most investigations recommending against their use in older   patients with osteoporotic bone. This review illustrates the need   for registries and future PFF studies to record implant name and   information for future analysis. Furthermore, future biomechanical   investigations comparing modern implants are needed to clarify the   precise contribution of implant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> to PFF risk.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B(1 Supple   A):50–9.</p></sec>

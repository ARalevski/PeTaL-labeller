Defining modes of failure after joint-preserving surgery of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Joint-preserving surgery of the hip (JPSH) has evolved considerably   and now includes a number of procedures, including arthroscopy,   surgical dislocation, and redirectional osteotomies of the femur   and acetabulum. There are a number of different factors which lead   to failure of JPSH. Consequently, it is of interest to assess the   various modes of failure in order to continue to identify best practice   and the indications for these procedures. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Using a retrospective observational study design, we reviewed   1013 patients who had undergone JPSH by a single surgeon between   2005 and 2015. There were 509 men and 504 women with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age   of 39 years (16 to 78). Of the 1013 operations, 783 were arthroscopies,   122 surgical dislocations, and 108 peri-acetabular osteotomies (PAO).   We analysed the overall failure rates and modes of failure. Re-operations   were categorised into four groups: Mode 1 was arthritis progression   or organ failure leading to total hip arthroplasty (THA); Mode 2   was an Incorrect diagnosis/procedure; Mode 3 resulted from malcorrection   of femur (type A), acetabulum (type B), or labrum (type C) and Mode 4   resulted from an unintended consequence of the initial surgical   intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> follow-up of 2.5 years, there had been 104 re-operations   (10.2%) with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> patient age of 35.5 years (17 to 64). There   were 64 Mode 1 failures (6.3%) at a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> of 3.2 years following   JPSH with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> patient age of 46.8 years (18 to 64). There were   17 Mode 2 failures (1.7%) at a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> of 2.2 years post-JPSH with   a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> patient age of 28.9 years (17 to 42) (2% scopes; 1% surgical   dislocations). There were 19 Mode 3 failures (1.9%) at a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> of   2.0 years post-JPSH, with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> patient age of 29.9 years (18 to   51) (2% scopes; 2% surgical dislocations; 5% PAO). There were 4   Mode 4 failures (0.4%) at a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> of 1.8 years post-JPSH with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong>   patient age of 31.5 years (15 to 43). Using the modified Dindo-Clavien   classification system, the overall complication rate among JPSHs   was 4.2%.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>While defining the overall re-operation and complication rates,   it is important to define the safety and effectiveness of JPSH.   Standardisation of the modes of failure may help identify the best   practice. Application of these modes to large clinical series, such   as registries, will assist in further establishing how to improve   the efficacy of JPSH.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:303–9.</p></sec>

Total hip arthroplasty using a monobloc cementless femoral stem for patients with childhood Perthes’ disease
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Modular or custom-made femoral components have been preferred   for total hip arthroplasty (THA) in patients with a history of Perthes’   disease because of the distortion in the anatomy of the proximal   femur. However, it has not been established whether a monobloc cementless   stem will fit the distorted proximal femur or whether the results   of the procedure are satisfactory in this group of patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We reviewed 68 consecutive patients who had undergone THA for   childhood Perthes’ disease between June 2003 and December 2008.   There were 35 men and 33 women with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age of 48 years (16 to   73) at the time of index arthroplasty. Their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> body mass index   was 24.4 (18.3 to 32.9). Of the 68 hips, 32 were classified as Stulberg   class III and 36 as class IV. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> pre-operative shortening   of the affected leg was 17.2 mm (5 to 34). The minimum follow-up   was five years (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> 8.5 years; 5.2 to 10).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>An intra-operative calcar fracture occurred in eight hips (11.8%)   and was successfully treated by cerclage wiring.

Minimally invasive surgery for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to report a retrospective, consecutive   series of patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) who   were treated with posterior minimally invasive surgery (MIS) with   a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> follow-up of two years (<sc>sd</sc> 1.4; 0.9 to 0 3.7). Our   objectives were to measure the correction of the deformity and record   the peri-operative morbidity. Special attention was paid to the   operating time (ORT), estimated blood loss (EBL), length of stay   (LOS) and further complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We prospectively collected the data of 70 consecutive patients   with AIS treated with MIS using three incisions and a muscle-splitting   approach by a single surgeon between June 2013 and February 2016   and these were retrospectively reviewed. There were eight male and   62 female patients with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age of 15 years (<sc>sd</sc> 4.5   ) with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> body mass index of 19.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (<sc>sd</sc> 5.4).   The curves were classified according to Lenke; 40 curves were type   1, 15 were type 2, three were type 3, two were type 4, eight were   type 5 and two were type 6.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> primary Cobb angle was corrected from 58.9° (<sc>sd</sc> 12.6°)   pre-operatively to 17.7° (<sc>sd</sc> 10.2°) post-operatively with   a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> correction of 69% (<sc>sd</sc> 20%, p < 0.001). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong>   kyphosis at T5 to T12 increased from 24.2° (<sc>sd</sc> 12.2°) pre-operatively   to 30.1° (<sc>sd</sc> 9.6°,    p < 0.001) post-operatively. Peri-operative (30 days) complications   occurred in three patients(4.2%): one subcutaneous haematoma, one   deep venous thrombosis and one pulmonary complication. Five additional complications   occurred in five patients (7.1%): one superficial wound infection,   one suture granuloma and three delayed deep surgical site infections.   The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> ORT was 337.1 mins (<sc>sd</sc> 121.3); the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> EBL was   345.7 ml (<sc>sd</sc> 175.1) and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> LOS was 4.6 days (<sc>sd</sc> 0.8).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The use of MIS for patients with AIS results in a significant   correction of spinal deformity in both the frontal and sagittal   planes, with a low EBL and a short LOS. The rate of peri-operative   complications compares well with that following a routine open technique.   The longer term safety and benefit of MIS in these patients needs   to be evaluated with further follow-up of a larger cohort of patients.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1651–7.</p></sec>

Regional and global sea-surface temperatures during the last interglaciation
<p>The last interglaciation (LIG, 129 to 116 thousand years ago) was the most recent time in Earth’s history when global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> sea level was substantially higher than it is at present. However, reconstructions of LIG global temperature remain uncertain, with estimates ranging from no significant difference to nearly 2°C warmer than present-day temperatures. Here we use a network of sea-surface temperature (SST) records to reconstruct spatiotemporal variability in regional and global SSTs during the LIG. Our results indicate that peak LIG global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> annual SSTs were 0.5 ± 0.3°C warmer than the climatological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> from 1870 to 1889 and indistinguishable from the 1995 to 2014 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong>. LIG warming in the extratropical latitudes occurred in response to boreal insolation and the bipolar seesaw, whereas tropical SSTs were slightly cooler than the 1870 to 1889 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> in response to reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> annual insolation.</p>

Posterior spinal fusion for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis using a convex pedicle screw technique
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We present the results of correcting a double or triple curve   adolescent idiopathic scoliosis using a convex segmental pedicle   screw technique.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We reviewed 191 patients with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age at surgery of 15 years   (11 to 23.3). Pedicle screws were placed at the convexity of each   curve. Concave screws were inserted at one or two cephalad levels   and two caudal levels. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> operating time was 183 minutes (132   to 276) and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> blood loss 0.22% of the total blood volume   (0.08% to 0.4%). Multimodal monitoring remained stable throughout   the operation. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> hospital stay was 6.8 days (5 to 15).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> post-operative follow-up was 5.8 years (2.5 to 9.5).   There were no neurological complications, deep wound infection,   obvious nonunion or need for revision surgery.</p><p>Upper thoracic scoliosis was corrected by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> 68.2% (38% to   48%, p < 0.001). Main thoracic scoliosis was corrected by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong>   71% (43.5% to 8.9%, p < 0.001). Lumbar scoliosis was corrected   by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> 72.3% (41% to 90%, p < 0.001). No patient lost more   than 3° of correction at follow-up. The thoracic kyphosis improved   by 13.1° (-21° to 49°, p < 0.001); the lumbar lordosis remained   unchanged (p = 0.58). Coronal imbalance was corrected by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong>   98% (0% to 100%, p < 0.001). Sagittal imbalance was corrected   by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> 96% (20% to 100%, p < 0.001). The Scoliosis Research   Society Outcomes Questionnaire score improved from a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> 3.6 to   4.6 (2.4 to 4, p < 0.001); patient satisfaction was a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> 4.9   (4.8 to 5). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This technique carries low neurological and vascular risks because   the screws are placed in the pedicles of the convex side of the   curve, away from the spinal cord, cauda equina and the aorta. A   low implant density (pedicle screw density 1.2, when a density of   2 represents placement of pedicle screws bilaterally at every instrumented segment)   achieved satisfactory correction of the scoliosis, an improved thoracic   kyphosis and normal global sagittal balance.

The analysis of synovial fluid in total knee arthroplasties with flexion instability
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Patients with flexion instability after total knee arthroplasty   (TKA) often present with a recurrent effusion, which may be a haemarthrosis.   While the radiographic factors contributing to flexion instability   have been elucidated, the clinical diagnosis remains challenging.   Our aim, in this study, was to determine the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> white cell count   and differential profile in pre-operative aspirations of synovial   fluid in a consecutive series of patients undergoing revision TKA   for flexion instability.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 2000 and 2010, 60 patients undergoing aseptic revision   TKA for flexion instability were identified. The results of the   pre-operative aspiration of synovial fluid were available for 53   patients (88%). These patients were 1:2 matched to 106 patients   who underwent aseptic TKA for indications other than flexion instability.   The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age of the patients at revision TKA was 65 years (44 to   82) and 55% were women. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> follow-up was 4.3 years (2 to 10.2).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In the flexion instability group, the median total cell count   was 312 cells/µL (interquartile range (IQR) 104 to 624), with a   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> distribution of 45% macrophages (2% to 90%), 30% lymphocytes   (1% to 69%), 18% neutrophils (0% to 80%), 0.5% eosinophils (0% to   6%) and 7% other cells (0% to 42%; mainly synovial cells).

Mapping the stochastic sequence of individual ligand-receptor binding events to cellular activation: T cells act on the rare events
<p>T cell receptor (TCR) binding to agonist peptide major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) triggers signaling events that initiate T cell responses. This system is remarkably sensitive, requiring only a few binding events to successfully activate a cellular response. On <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">averag</span></strong>e, activating pMHC ligands exhibit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> dwell times of at least a few seconds when bound to the TCR. However, a T cell accumulates pMHC-TCR interactions as a stochastic series of discrete, single-molecule binding events whose individual dwell times are broadly distributed. With activation occurring in response to only a handful of such binding events, individual cells are unlikely to experience the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">averag</span></strong>e binding time. Here, we mapped the ensemble of pMHC-TCR binding events in space and time while simultaneously monitoring cellular activation. Our findings revealed that T cell activation hinges on rare, long–dwell time binding events that are an order of magnitude longer than the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">averag</span></strong>e agonist pMHC-TCR dwell time. Furthermore, we observed that short pMHC-TCR binding events that were spatially correlated and temporally sequential led to cellular activation. These observations indicate that T cell antigen discrimination likely occurs by sensing the tail end of the pMHC-TCR binding dwell time distribution rather than its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">averag</span></strong>e properties.</p>

Outcome was assessed using a validated performance   based outcome instrument as well as patient reported outcome measures   (PROMs).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We prospectively analysed 33 patients whose THA involved a contemporary   proximally porous coated tapered short stem femoral component and   53 patients with a standard conventional femoral component, at a   minimum follow-up of two years. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> follow-up was 31.4 months   (24 to 39). Patients with poor proximal femoral bone quality were   excluded. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age of the patients was 66.6 years (59 to 77)   and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> body mass index was 30.2 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (24.1 to   41.0). Outcome was assessed using the Oxford Hip Score (OHS) and   the University College Hospital (UCH) hip score which is a validated   performance based instrument. HRQoL was assessed using the EuroQol   5D (EQ-5D).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were no major peri-operative complications. There was no   difference in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> post-operative OHS, EQ-5D or function subscale   of the UCH hip scores between the two groups. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> pre-operative   OHS and EQ-5D scores improved significantly (all p < 0.001).   The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> functional component of the UCH hip score at final follow-up   was 42.5 and 40.6 in the short stem and conventional stem groups,   respectively. There was no statistically significant difference   between the groups (p = 0.42). A total of seven patients (21.2%)   in the short stem group and nine (16.98%) in the conventional group   achieved a ceiling effect using the OHS; none did using the function   subscale of the UCH hip score.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The proximally porous coated tapered short stem femoral component   achieves comparable short-term functional outcomes when compared   with a conventional longer stem uncemented femoral component when   THA is undertaken in patients with good bone quality.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B(4   Supple B):49–55.</p></sec>

Satisfaction, function and repair integrity after arthroscopic <i>versus</i> mini-open rotator cuff repair
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Advances in arthroscopic techniques for rotator cuff repair have   made the mini-open approach less popular. However, the mini-open   approach remains an important technique for repair for many surgeons.   The aims of this study were to compare the integrity of the repair,   the function of the shoulder and satisfaction post-operatively using   these two techniques in patients aged > 50 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We identified 22 patients treated with mini-open and 128 patients   treated with arthroscopic rotator cuff repair of July 2007 and June   2011. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> follow-up was two years (1 to 5). Outcome was assessed   using the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) and Simple   Shoulder Test (SST) scores, and satisfaction. The integrity of the repair   was assessed using ultrasonography. A power analysis ensured sufficient   enrolment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was no statistically significant difference between the   age, function, satisfaction, or pain scores (p > 0.05) of the two   groups. The integrity of the repair and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> SST scores were   significantly better in the mini-open group (91% of mini-open repairs   were intact <i>versus</i> 60% of arthroscopic repairs,   p = 0.023; <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> SST score 10.9 (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard devi</span></strong>ation (<sc>sd</sc>)   1.3) in the mini-open group; 8.9 (<sc>sd</sc> 3.5) in arthroscopic   group; p = 0.003). The ASES scores were also higher in the mini-open   group (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> ASES score 91.0 (<sc>sd</sc> 10.5) in mini-open group;   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> 82.70 (<sc>sd</sc> 19.8) in the arthroscopic group; p = 0.048).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The integrity of the repair and function of the shoulder were   better after a mini-open repair than after arthroscopic repair of   a rotator cuff tear in these patients. The functional difference   did not translate into a difference in satisfaction.</p><p>Mini-open rotator cuff repair remains a useful technique despite   advances in arthroscopy.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:245–9.</p></sec>

Quantifying the ‘law of diminishing returns’ in magnetically controlled growing rods
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Magnetically controlled growing rods (MCGRs) allow non-invasive   correction of the spinal deformity in the treatment of early-onset   scoliosis. Conventional growing rod systems (CGRS) need repeated   surgical distractions: these are associated with the effect of the   ‘law of diminishing returns’.</p><p>The primary aim of this study was to quantify this effect in   MCGRs over sequential distractions. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 35 patients with a maximum follow-up of 57 months   were included in the study. There were 17 boys and 18 girls with   a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age of 7.4 years (2 to 14). True Distraction (TD) was determined   by measuring the expansion gap on fluoroscopy. This was compared   with Intended Distraction (ID) and expressed as the ‘T/I’ ratio.   The T/I ratio and the Cobb angle were calculated at several time   points during follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> follow-up was 30 months (6 to 57). There was a significant   decrease in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> T/I ratio over time (convex rod at 3 months   0.81, <sc>sd</sc> 0.58 <i>vs</i> 51 months 0.17, <sc>sd </sc>0.16,    p = 0.0001; concave rod at 3 months 0.93, <sc>sd</sc> 0.67 <i>vs</i> 51   months 0.18, <sc>sd</sc> 0.15, p = 0.0001). A linear decline of   the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> T/I ratios was noted for both convex rods (r<sup>2</sup> =   0.90, p = 0.004) and concave rods (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.81, p = 0.015)   over 51 months. At the 24-month follow-up stage, there was a significant   negative correlation between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> T/I ratio of the concave rod   with weight (r = -0.59, p = 0.01), age (r = -0.59, p = 0.01), and   BMI of the child (r = -0.54,    p = 0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The ‘law of diminishing returns’ is also seen after serial distraction   using MCGR. Compared to previously published data for CGRS, there   is a gradual linear decline rather than a rapid initial decline   in lengthening. In older, heavier children a reduced distraction   ratio in the concave rod of the MCGR device is noted over time.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1658–64.</p></sec>

Cemented total hip arthroplasty following acetabular fracture
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To evaluate the outcomes of cemented total hip arthroplasty (THA)   following a fracture of the acetabulum, with evaluation of risk   factors and comparison with a patient group with no history of fracture. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 1992 and 2016, 49 patients (33 male) with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age of   57 years (25 to 87) underwent cemented THA at a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> of 6.5 years   (0.1 to 25) following acetabular fracture. A total of 38 had undergone   surgical fixation and 11 had been treated non-operatively; 13 patients   died at a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> of 10.2 years after THA (0.6 to 19). Patients were   assessed pre-operatively, at one year and at final follow-up (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong>   9.1 years, 0.5 to 23) using the Oxford Hip Score (OHS). Implant   survivorship was assessed. An age and gender-matched cohort of THAs   performed for non-traumatic osteoarthritis (OA) or avascular necrosis   (AVN) (n = 98) were used to compare complications and patient-reported outcome   measures (PROMs).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> time from fracture to THA was significantly shorter   for patients with AVN    (2.2 years) or protrusio (2.2 years) than those with post-traumatic   OA (9.4 years) or infection (8.0 years) (p = 0.03). Nine contained   and four uncontained defects were managed with autograft (n = 11),   bulk allograft (n = 1), or trabecular metal augment (n = 1). Initial   fracture management (open reduction and internal fixation or non-operative),   timing of THA    (>/< one year), and age (>/< 55 years) had no significant   effect on OHS or ten-year survival. Six THAs were revised at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong>   of 12 years (5 to 23) with ten-year all-cause survival of 92% (95%   confidence interval 80.8 to 100). THA complication rates (all complications,   heterotopic ossification, leg length discrepancy > 10 mm) were significantly higher   following acetabular fracture compared with atraumatic OA/AVN and   OHSs were inferior: one-year OHS    (35.7 v<i>ersus</i> 40.2, p = 0.026); and final follow-up   OHS (33.6 v<i>ersus</i> 40.9, p = 0.008). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion </title><p>Cemented THA is a reasonable option for the sequelae of acetabular   fracture.

Tuberculosis of the spine with severe angular kyphosis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To address the natural history of severe post-tuberculous (TB)   kyphosis, with focus upon the long-term neurological outcome, occurrence   of restrictive lung disease, and the effect on life expectancy. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This is a retrospective clinical review of prospectively collected   imaging data based at a single institute. A total of 24 patients   of Southern Chinese origin who presented with spinal TB with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong>   of 113° of kyphosis (65° to 159°) who fulfilled inclusion criteria   were reviewed. Plain radiographs were used to assess the degree   of spinal deformity. Myelography, CT and MRI were used when available   to assess the integrity of the spinal cord and canal. Patient demographics,   age of onset of spinal TB and interventions, types of surgical procedure,   intra- and post-operative complications, and neurological status   were assessed. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>All except one of the 24 patients were treated with anti-TB chemotherapy   when they were first diagnosed with spinal TB. They subsequently   received surgery either for neurological deterioration, or deformity   correction in later life. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> follow-up was 34 years (11 to   59) since these surgical interventions. Some 16 patients (66.7%) suffered   from late neurological deterioration at a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> of 26 years (8 to   49) after the initial drug treatment. The causes of neurological   deterioration were healed disease in nine patients (56.2%),    re-activation in six patients (37.5%) and adjacent level spinal   stenosis in one patient (6.3%). The result of surgery was worse   in healed disease. Eight patients without neurological deterioration   received surgery to correct the kyphosis. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> correction ranged   from 97° to 72°. Three patients who were clinically quiescent with   no neurological deterioration were found to have active TB of the   spine. Solid fusion was achieved in all cases and no patient suffered   from neurological deterioration after 42 years of follow-up. On   final follow-up, six patients were noted to have deceased (age range:   47 years to 75 years).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study presents one of the longest assessments of spinal TB   with severe kyphosis. Severe post-TB kyphosis may lead to significant   health problems many years following the initial drug treatment.   Early surgical correction of the kyphosis, solid fusion and regular   surveillance may avoid late complications. Paraplegia, restrictive   lung disease and early onset kyphosis might relate to early death.

What is the morbidity of a non-invasive growing prosthesis?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Extendible endoprostheses have been available for more than 30   years and have become more sophisticated with time. The latest generation   is ‘non-invasive’ and can be lengthened with an external magnetic   force. Early results have shown a worryingly high rate of complications   such as infection. This study investigates the incidence of complications   and the need for further surgery in a cohort of patients with a   non-invasive growing endoprosthesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 2003 and June 2014, 50 children (51 prostheses) had a   non-invasive growing prosthesis implanted for a primary bone sarcoma.   The minimum follow-up was 24 months for those who survived. Their   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age was 10.4 years (6 to 14). The incidence of complications   and further surgery was documented.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> follow-up was 64 months (20 to 145). The overall survivorship   of the patients was 84% at three years and 70% at five years. Revision-free   survival was 81.7% at three years and 61.6% at five years with competing   risk analysis. Deep infection occurred in 19.6% of implants at a   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> of 12.5 months (0 to 55). Other complications were a failure   of the lengthening mechanism in five prostheses (9.8%) and breakage   of the implant in two (3.9%). Overall, there were 53 additional   operations (0 to 5 per patient). A total of seven patients (14%)   underwent amputation, three for local recurrence and four for infection.   Their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> limb length discrepancy was 4.3 mm (0 to 25) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> Musculoskeletal   Tumor Society Score functional score was 26.5 (18 to 30) at the   final follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>When compared with previously published early results, this mid-term   series has shown continued good functional outcomes and compensation   for leg-length discrepancy.

Post-operative outcomes of atypical femoral subtrochanteric fracture in patients on bisphosphonate therapy
<p>Management of bisphosphonate-associated subtrochanteric   fractures remains opinion- or consensus-based. There are limited   data regarding the outcomes of this fracture.</p><p>We retrospectively reviewed 33 consecutive female patients with   a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age of 67.5 years (47 to 91) who were treated surgically   between May 2004 and October 2009. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> follow-up was 21.7 months   (0 to 53). Medical records and radiographs were reviewed to determine   the post-operative ambulatory status, time to clinical and radiological   union and post-fixation complications such as implant failure and   need for second surgery. </p><p>The predominant fixation method was with an extramedullary device   in 23 patients. 25 (75%) patients were placed on wheelchair mobilisation   or no weight-bearing initially.

Clinical outcomes following re-admission for non-infectious wound complications after primary total knee replacement
<p>Haematomas, drainage, and other non-infectious   wound complications following total knee replacement (TKR) have   been associated with long-term sequelae, in particular, deep infection.   However, the impact of these wound complications on clinical outcome   is unknown. This study compares results in 15 patients re-admitted   for wound complications within 90 days of TKR to 30 matched patients   who underwent uncomplicated total knee replacements. Patients with   wound complications had a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age of 66 years (49 to 83) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong>   body mass index (BMI) of 37 (21 to 54), both similar to that of   patients without complications (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age 65 years and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> BMI 35). Those   with complications had lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> Knee Society function scores (46   (0 to 100 <i>vs</i> 66 (20 to 100), p = 0.047) and a higher   incidence of mild or greater pain (73% <i>vs</i> 33%,   p = 0.01) after two years compared with the non re-admitted group.   Expectations in patients with wound complications following TKR   should be tempered, even in those who do not develop an infection.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014;96-B:619–21.</p>

Mid-term results of lateral unicondylar mobile bearing knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this independent multicentre study was to assess the   mid-term results of mobile bearing unicondylar knee arthroplasty   (UKA) for isolated lateral osteoarthritis of the knee joint.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We retrospectively evaluated 363 consecutive, lateral UKAs (346   patients) performed using the Oxford domed lateral prosthesis undertaken   in three high-volume knee arthroplasty centres between 2006 and   2014. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age of the patients at surgery was 65 years (36 to 88)   with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> final follow-up of 37 months (12 to 93)</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 36 (10.5%) patients underwent revision surgery, giving   a survival rate of 90.1% at three years (95% confidence intervals   (CI) 86.1 to 93.1; number at risk: 155) and 85.0% at five years   (95% CI 77.9 to 89.9; number at risk: 43). Dislocation of the mobile   bearing occurred in 18 patients (5.6%) at three years (95% CI 1.0   to 16.4; number at risk: 154) and in 20 patients (8.5%) at five   years (95% CI 1.0 to 27.0; number at risk: 42).

Use of a Single Baseline Versus Multiyear 24-Hour Urine Collection for Estimation of Long-Term Sodium Intake and Associated Cardiovascular and Renal Risk
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>A decrease in sodium intake has been shown to lower blood pressure, but data from cohort studies on the association with cardiovascular and renal outcomes are inconsistent. In these studies, sodium intake was often estimated with a single baseline measurement, which may be inaccurate considering day-to-day changes in sodium intake and sodium excretion. We compared the effects of single versus repetitive follow-up 24-hour urine samples on the relation between sodium intake and long-term cardiorenal outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We selected adult subjects with an estimated glomerular filtration rate >60 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>, an outpatient 24-hour urine sample between 1998 and 1999, and at least 1 collection during a 17-year follow-up. Sodium intake was estimated with a single baseline collection and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">averag</span></strong>e of samples collected during a 1-, 5-, and 15-year follow-up. We used Cox regression analysis and the landmark approach to investigate the relation between sodium intake and cardiovascular (cardiovascular events or mortality) and renal (end-stage renal disease: dialysis, transplantation, and/or >60% estimated glomerular filtration rate decline, or mortality) outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We included 574 subjects with 9776 twenty-four–hour urine samples. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">averag</span></strong>e age was 47 years, and 46% were male. Median follow-up was 16.2 years. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">averag</span></strong>e 24-hour sodium excretion, ranging from 3.8 to 3.9 g (165–170 mmol), was equal among all methods (<i>P</i>=0.88). However, relative to a single baseline measurement, 50% of the subjects had a >0.8-g (>34-mmol) difference in sodium intake with long-term estimations. As a result, 45%, 49%, and 50% of all subjects switched between tertiles of sodium intake when the 1-, 5-, or 15-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">averag</span></strong>e was used, respectively. Consequently, hazard ratios for cardiorenal outcome changed up to 85% with the use of sodium intake estimations from short-term (1-year) and long-term (5-year) follow-up instead of baseline estimations.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Relative to a single baseline 24-hour sodium measurement, the use of subsequent 24-hour urine samples resulted in different estimations of an individual’s sodium intake, whereas population <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">averag</span></strong>es remained similar. This finding had significant consequences for the association between sodium intake and long-term cardiovascular and renal outcomes.</p></sec>

EZ-Root-VIS: A Software Pipeline for the Rapid Analysis and Visual Reconstruction of Root System Architecture
<p>If we want to understand how the environment has shaped the appearance and behavior of living creatures, we need to compare groups of individuals that differ in genetic makeup and environment experience. For complex phenotypic features, such as body posture or facial expression in humans, comparison is not straightforward because some of the contributing factors cannot easily be quantified or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">averag</span></strong>ed across individuals. Therefore, computational methods are used to reconstruct representative prototypes using a range of algorithms for filling in missing information and calculating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong>s. The same problem applies to the root system architecture (RSA) of plants. Several computer programs are available for extracting numerical data from root images, but they usually do not offer customized data analysis or visual reconstruction of RSA. We developed Root-VIS, a free software tool that facilitates the determination of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong>s and variance of many different RSA features across user-selected sets of root images. Furthermore, Root-VIS offers several options to generate visual reconstructions of root systems from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">averag</span></strong>ed data to enable screening and modeling. We confirmed the suitability of Root-VIS, combined with a new version of EZ-Rhizo, for the rapid characterization of genotype-environment interactions and gene discovery through genome-wide association studies in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>).</p>

Intercalary allograft augmented with intramedullary cement and plate fixation is a reliable solution after resection of a diaphyseal tumour
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Intercalary allografts following resection of a primary diaphyseal   tumour have high rates of complications and failures. At our institution   intercalary allografts are augmented with intramedullary cement   and fixed using compression plating. Our aim was to evaluate their   long-term outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 46 patients underwent reconstruction with an intercalary   allograft between 1989 and 2014. The patients had a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age of   32.8 years (14 to 77). The most common diagnoses were osteosarcoma   (n = 16) and chondrosarcoma (n = 9). The location of the tumours   was in the femur in 21, the tibia in 16 and the humerus in nine. Function   was assessed using the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) scoring   system and the Toronto Extremity Salvage Score (TESS). The survival   of the graft and the overall survival were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The median follow-up was 92 months (4 to 288). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> MSTS   87 score was 29.1 (19 to 35), the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> MSTS 93 score was 82.2 (50   to 100) and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> TESS score was 81.2 (43 to 100).

The medium- and long-term outcome of total shoulder arthroplasty for primary glenohumeral osteoarthritis in middle-aged patients
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Promising medium-term results from total shoulder arthroplasty   (TSA) have been reported for the treatment of primary osteoarthritis   in young and middle-aged patients. The aim of this study was to   evaluate the long-term functional and radiological outcome of TSA   in the middle-aged patient.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The data of all patients from the previous medium-term study   were available. At a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> follow-up of 13 years (8 to 17), we reviewed   21 patients (12 men, nine women, 21 shoulders) with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age of   55 years (37 to 60). The Constant-Murley score (CS) with its subgroups   and subjective satisfaction were measured. Radiological signs of implant   loosening were analysed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Two shoulders (two patients) were revised and in two shoulders   of two different patients, revision surgery was recommended. The   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> CS increased from 23.3 (10 to 45) pre-operatively to 56.5 (26   to 81; p < 0.0001), but with a decrease in CS from 62.8 (38 to   93) to 56.5 (26 to 81) between medium- and long-term follow-up (p   = 0.01). Without revision surgery, 18 patients (95%) rated their   result as good or very good.</p><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> radiolucent line score for the glenoid components increased   from 1.8 (0 to 6) to 8.2 (2 to 18) between medium- and long-term   follow-up (p < 0.001). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>TSA in young and middle-aged patients leads to improvement in   clinical function and a relatively high satisfaction rate. However,   clinical or radiological glenoid loosening worsens in the long term.

Long-term survival and risk factors for failure of the native hip joint after operatively treated displaced acetabular fractures
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Our aim in this study was to describe the long-term survival   of the native hip joint after open reduction and internal fixation   of a displaced fracture of the acetabulum. We also present long-term   clinical outcomes and risk factors associated with a poor outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 285 patients underwent surgery for a displaced acetabular   fracture between 1993 and 2005. For the survival analysis 253 were   included, there were 197 men and 56 women with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age of 42   years (12 to 78). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> follow-up of 11 years (1 to 20) was identified   from our pelvic fracture registry. There were 99 elementary and 154   associated fracture types. For the long-term clinical follow-up,   192 patients with complete data were included. Their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age was   40 years (13 to 78) with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> follow-up of 12 years (5 to 20).   Injury to the femoral head and acetabular impaction were assessed   with CT scans and patients with an ipsilateral fracture of the femoral   head were excluded.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 36 patients underwent total hip arthroplasty (THA).   The overall ten-year survival of the hip joint was 86% (95% confidence   interval (CI) 81% to 90%) and the 20-year survival was 82% (95%   CI 76% to 87%). Injury to the femoral head and acetabular impaction   were the strongest predictors of failure, with the long-term survival   rate falling towards 50% in these patients.

Functional outcome of debridement, antibiotics and implant retention in periprosthetic joint infection involving the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Advocates of debridement, antibiotics and implant retention (DAIR)   in hip periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) argue that a procedure   not disturbing a sound prosthesis-bone interface is likely to lead   to better survival and functional outcome compared with revision.   This case-control study aims were to compare outcome of DAIRs for   infected primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) with outcomes following   primary THA and two-stage revision of infected primary THAs.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We retrospectively reviewed all DAIRs, performed for confirmed   infected primary hip arthropasty (n = 82) at out institution, between   1997 and 2013. Data recorded included full patient information and   type of surgery. Outcome measures included complications, mortality,   implant survivorship and functional outcome. Outcome was compared with   two control groups matched for gender and age; a cohort of primary   THAs (n = 120) and a cohort of two-stage revisions for infection   (n = 66).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age at DAIR was 69 years (33 to 87) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> follow-up was   eight years (2 to 17; <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard devi</span></strong>ation (<sc>sd)</sc> 5). A total   of 52 (63%) of DAIRs were for early PJI (less than six weeks). Greater   success in the eradication of infection with DAIR was identified   with early PJI, comprising an interval less than a week between   onset of symptoms and exchange of modular components with the DAIR   procedure. Eradication of infection, complications and re-operation   rates were similar in the DAIR and two-stage revision groups. For   hips with successful eradication of infection with DAIR, the five-year   survival (98%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 94 to 100) was similar   to the primary THA group (98%; 95% CI 95 to 100) (n = 43; p = 0.3).   The DAIR group had inferior <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> Oxford Hip Scores (OHS) (38; 12   to 48) compared with the primary THA group (42; 15 to 48) (p = 0.02)   but a significantly better <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> OHS compared with the two-stage   revision group (31; 0 to 48) (p = 0.008). Patients who required   only one DAIR for eradication of infection had a similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> OHS   (41; 20 to 48) to the primary THA group (p = 0.2).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The DAIR procedure is associated with a similar complication   rate and ability to eradicate infection as two-stage revision. This   study emphasises the need for exchange of modular components for   improved chances of eradication of infection.

Management of massive acetabular bone defects in revision arthroplasty of the hip using a reconstruction cage and porous metal augment
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>It may not be possible to undertake revision total hip arthroplasty   (THA) in the presence of massive loss of acetabular bone stock using   standard cementless hemispherical acetabular components and metal   augments, as satisfactory stability cannot always be achieved. We   aimed to study the outcome using a reconstruction cage and a porous   metal augment in these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 22 acetabular revisions in 19 patients were performed   using a combination of a reconstruction cage and porous metal augments.   The augments were used in place of structural allografts. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong>   age of the patients at the time of surgery was 70 years (27 to 85)   and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> follow-up was 39 months (27 to 58). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> number   of previous THAs was 1.9 (1 to 3). All patients had segmental defects   involving more than 50% of the acetabulum and seven hips had an   associated pelvic discontinuity. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Three failures were observed in two hips, both of which had undergone   a previous resection of a tumour affecting the acetabulum. Other   complications included a late arterial injury, a sciatic nerve palsy,   a dislocation treated with a femoral revision, a deep infection   treated with irrigation and debridement and a fracture of the greater   trochanter treated conservatively. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> Oxford Hip Score significantly   increased from 13.9 (2 to 23) to 28.7 (13 to 38) (p < 0.00001).

Minimally invasive periacetabular osteotomy using a modified Smith-Petersen approach
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Periacetabular osteotomy is an effective way of treating symptomatic   hip dysplasia. We describe a new minimally invasive technique using   a modification of the Smith-Peterson approach.</p><p>We performed a prospective, longitudinal cohort study to assess   for any compromise in acetabular correction when using this approach,   and to see if the procedure would have a higher complication rate   than that quoted in the literature for other approaches. We also   assessed for any improvement in functional outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>From 168 consecutive patients (189 hips) who underwent acetabular   correction between March 2010 and March 2013 we excluded those who   had undergone previous pelvic surgery for DDH and those being treated   for acetabular retroversion. The remaining 151 patients (15 men,   136 women) (166 hips) had a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age of 32 years (15 to 56) and the   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> duration of follow-up was 2.8 years (1.2 to 4.5). In all 90%   of cases were Tönnis grade 0 or 1. Functional outcomes were assessed   using the Non Arthritic Hip Score (NAHS), University of California,   Los Angeles (UCLA) and Tegner activity scores.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> pre-operative lateral centre-edge angle was 14.2° (-5°   to 30°) and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> acetabular index was 18.4° (4° to 40°). Post-operatively   these were 31° (18° to 46°) and 3° (-7° to 29°), respectively, a   significant improvement in both (p < 0.001). Allogenic blood   transfusion was required in two patients (1.2%). There were no major   nerve or vascular complications, and no wound infections. At the   time of last follow-up, we noted a significant improvement in functional   outcome scores: UCLA improved by 2.31 points, Tegner improved by   1.08 points, and the NAHS improved by 25.4 points (p < 0.001   for each). Hypermobility and longer duration of surgery were significant   negative predictors for a good post-operative UCLA score, while   residual retroversion was a positive predictor of post-operative   UCLA score.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have found this approach to be safe and effective, facilitating   early recovery from surgery.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:22–8.</p></sec>

Minimising aseptic loosening in extreme bone resections
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Following the resection of an extensive amount of bone in the   treatment of a tumour, the residual segment may be insufficient   to accept a standard length intramedullary cemented stem. Short-stemmed   endoprostheses conceivably have an increased risk of aseptic loosening.   Extra-cortical plates have been added to minimise this risk by supplementing   fixation. The aim of this study was to investigate the survivorship   of short-stemmed endoprostheses and extra-cortical plates.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The study involved 37 patients who underwent limb salvage surgery   for a primary neoplasm of bone between 1998 and 2013. Endoprosthetic   replacement involved the proximal humerus in nine, the proximal   femur in nine, the distal femur in 13 and the proximal tibia in   six patients. There were 12 primary (32%) and 25 revision procedures (68%).   Implant survivorship was compared with matched controls. The amount   of bone that was resected was > 70% of its length and statistically   greater than the standard control group at each anatomical site.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> follow-up was seven years (one to 17). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> length   of the stem was 33 mm (20 to 60) in the humerus and 79 mm (34 to   100) in the lower limb. Kaplan-Meier analysis of survival of the   implant according to anatomical site confirmed that there was no   statistically significant difference between the short-stemmed endoprostheses and   the standard stemmed controls at the proximal humeral (p = 0.84),   proximal femoral (p = 0.57), distal femoral (p = 0.21) and proximal   tibial (p = 0.61) sites.</p><p>In the short-stemmed group, no implants with extra-cortical plate   osseointegration suffered loosening at a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> of 8.5 years (range   2 to 16 years). Three of ten (30%) without osseointegration suffered   aseptic loosening at a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> of 7.7 years (range 2 to 11.5 years).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>When extensive resections of bone are required in the surgical   management of tumours, and in revision cases, the addition of extra-cortical   plates to short medullary stems has shown non-inferiority to standard   length medullary stems and minimises aseptic failure.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1689–95.</p></sec>

Clinical, functional and radiological outcomes of extracorporeal irradiation in limb salvage surgery for bone tumours
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We present a retrospective review of patients treated with extracorporeally   irradiated allografts for primary and secondary bone tumours with   the mid- and long-term survivorship and the functional and radiographic   outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 113 of 116 (97.4%) patients who were treated with   extracorporeally irradiated allografts between 1996 and 2014 were   followed up. Forms of treatment included reconstructions, prostheses   and composite reconstructions, both with and without vascularised   grafts. Survivorship was determined by the Kaplan-Meier method.   Clinical outcomes were assessed using the Musculoskeletal Tumor   Society (MSTS) scoring system, the Toronto Extremity Salvage Score   (TESS) and Quality of Life-C30 (QLQ-30) measures. Radiographic outcomes   were assessed using the International Society of Limb Salvage (ISOLS)   radiographic scoring system.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were 61 (54%) men with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age of 22 years (6 to 70)   and 52 (46%) women with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age of 26 years (3 to 85). There   were 23 deaths. The five-year patient survivorship was 82.3% and   the ten-year patient survivorship was 79.6%. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> follow-up   of the 90 surviving patients was 80.3 months (2 to 207).

A total of six patients were lost to   follow-up and two died of unrelated causes. A total of ten patients   had bilateral procedures. Accordingly, 75 patients (85 TWAs) were   included in the study. There were 59 women and 16 men with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong>   age of 59 years (26 to 86). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> follow-up was 53 months (24   to 120). Clinical assessment involved recording pain on a visual   analogue score, range of movement, grip strength, the Quick Disabilities   of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) and Wrightington wrist scores.   Any adverse effects were documented with particular emphasis on   residual pain, limitation of movement, infection, dislocation and   the need for revision surgery.</p><p>Radiographic assessment was performed pre-operatively and at   three, six and 12 months post-operatively, and annually thereafter.

A pilot randomized trial of meniscal allograft transplantation versus personalized physiotherapy for patients with a symptomatic meniscal deficient knee compartment
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Meniscal allograft transplantation is undertaken to improve pain   and function in patients with a symptomatic meniscal deficient knee   compartment. While case series have shown improvements in patient   reported outcome measures (PROMs), its efficacy has not been rigorously   evaluated. This study aimed to compare PROMs in patients having   meniscal transplantation with those having personalized physiotherapy   at 12 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A single-centre assessor-blinded, comprehensive cohort study,   incorporating a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) was performed   on patients with a symptomatic compartment of the knee in which   a (sub)total meniscectomy had previously been performed. They were   randomized to be treated either with a meniscal allograft transplantation   or personalized physiotherapy, and stratified for malalignment of   the limb. They entered the preference groups if they were not willing   to be randomized. The Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS),   International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score and Lysholm   score and complications were collected at baseline and at four,   eight and 12 months following the interventions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 36 patients entered the study; 21 were randomized   and 15 chose their treatments. Their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age was 28 years (range   17 to 46). The outcomes were similar in the randomized and preference   groups, allowing pooling of data. At 12 months, the KOOS<sub>4</sub> composite   score (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> difference 12, p = 0.03) and KOOS subscales of pain   (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> difference 15, p = 0.02) and activities of daily living (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong>   difference 18, p = 0.005) were significantly superior in the meniscal   transplantation group. Other PROMs also favoured this group without   reaching statistical significance. There were five complications   in the meniscal transplantation and one in the physiotherapy groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This is the first study to compare meniscal allograft transplantation   to non-operative treatment. The results provide the best quality   evidence to date of the symptomatic benefits of meniscal allograft   transplantation in the short term, but a multicentre RCT is required   to investigate this question further.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:56–63.</p></sec>

Trends in Hospitalizations and Survival of Acute Decompensated Heart Failure in Four US Communities (2005–2014)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Community trends of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) in diverse populations may differ by race and sex.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The ARIC study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) sampled heart failure-related hospitalizations (≥55 years of age) in 4 US communities from 2005 to 2014 using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes. ADHF hospitalizations were validated by standardized physician review and computer algorithm, yielding 40 173 events after accounting for sampling design (unweighted n=8746).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of the ADHF hospitalizations, 50% had reduced ejection fraction, and 39% had preserved EF (HFpEF). HF with reduced ejection fraction was more common in black men and white men, whereas HFpEF was most common in white women. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">averag</span></strong>e age-adjusted rates of ADHF were highest in blacks (38.1 per 1000 black men, 30.5 per 1000 black women), with rates differing by HF type and sex. ADHF rates increased over the 10 years (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">averag</span></strong>e annual percentage change: black women +4.3%, black men +3.7%, white women +1.9%, white men +2.6%), mostly reflecting more acute HFpEF. Age-adjusted 28-day and 1-year case fatality proportions were ≈10% and 30%, respectively, similar across race-sex groups and HF types. Only blacks showed decreased 1-year mortality over time (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">averag</span></strong>e annual percentage change: black women –5.4%, black men –4.6%), with rates differing by HF type (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">averag</span></strong>e annual percentage change: black women HFpEF –7.1%, black men HF with reduced ejection fraction –4.7%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Between 2005 and 2014, trends in ADHF hospitalizations increased in 4 US communities, primarily driven by acute HFpEF.

Impact of Practice-Based Management of Pulmonary Artery Pressures in 2000 Patients Implanted With the CardioMEMS Sensor
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Elevated pulmonary artery (PA) pressures in patients with heart failure are associated with a high risk for hospitalization and mortality. Recent clinical trial evidence demonstrated a direct relationship between lowering remotely monitored PA pressures and heart failure hospitalization risk reduction with a novel implantable PA pressure monitoring system (CardioMEMS HF System, St. Jude Medical). This study examines PA pressure changes in the first 2000 US patients implanted in general practice use.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Deidentified data from the remote monitoring Merlin.net (St. Jude Medical) database were used to examine PA pressure trends from the first consecutive 2000 patients with at least 6 months of follow-up. Changes in PA pressures were evaluated with an area under the curve methodology to estimate the total sum increase or decrease in pressures (mm Hg-day) during the follow-up period relative to the baseline pressure. As a reference, the PA pressure trends were compared with the historic CHAMPION clinical trial (CardioMEMS Heart Sensor Allows Monitoring of Pressure to Improve Outcomes in New York Heart Association [NYHA] Functional Class III Heart Failure Patients). The area under the curve results are presented as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong>±2 SE, and <i>P</i> values comparing the area under the curve of the general-use cohort with outcomes in the CHAMPION trial were computed by the <i>t</i> test with equal variance.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Patients were on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">averag</span></strong>e 70±12 years old; 60% were male; 34% had preserved ejection fraction; and patients were followed up for an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">averag</span></strong>e of 333±125 days. At implantation, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> PA pressure for the general-use patients was 34.9±10.2 mm Hg compared with 31.3±10.9 mm Hg for CHAMPION treatment and 32.0±10.5 mm Hg for CHAMPION control groups. The general-use patients had an area under the curve of −32.8 mm Hg-day at the 1-month time mark, −156.2 mm Hg-day at the 3-month time mark, and −434.0 mm Hg-day after 6 months of hemodynamic guided care, which was significantly lower than the treatment group in the CHAMPION trial. Patients consistently transmitted pressure information with a median of 1.27 days between transmissions after 6 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The first 2000 general-use patients managed with hemodynamic-guided heart failure care had higher PA pressures at baseline and experienced greater reduction in PA pressure over time compared with the pivotal CHAMPION clinical trial. These data demonstrate that general use of implantable hemodynamic technology in a nontrial setting leads to significant lowering of PA pressures.</p></sec>

Congenital Heart Defects and Indices of Placental and Fetal Growth in a Nationwide Study of 924 422 Liveborn Infants
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Congenital heart defects (CHDs) have been associated with placental anomalies. The nature and the consequences of this association remain poorly understood. We aimed to estimate the associations between all major subtypes of CHD and placental weight at birth, and the association between placental weight and measures of both overall and cerebral growth in fetuses with CHD, as well.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We included all 924 422 liveborn Danish singletons, 1997 to 2011. CHD was present in 7569. We compared <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> differences in placental weight <i>z</i> score between newborns with CHD and newborns without CHD by multivariable linear regression adjusted for potential confounders.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>CHD was associated with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> <i>z</i> score difference of –0.04 (95% confidence interval, –0.07 to –0.02). Some subtypes were associated with smaller placental size at birth: tetralogy of Fallot, –0.45 (95% confidence interval, –0.58 to –0.31); double-outlet right ventricle, –0.48 (95% confidence interval, –0.87 to –0.10); major ventricular septal defects, –0.41 (95% confidence interval, –0.52 to –0.29). Placental weight <i>z</i> score was associated with birth weight and head circumference <i>z</i> scores in all subtypes. In the 3 mentioned subtypes, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> deviations from the population <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> head circumference and birth weight <i>z</i> scores were reduced by up to 66% with adjustment for placental weight <i>z</i> score.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Three subtypes of CHD were associated with lower placental weight, and placental weight was associated with measures of both overall growth and cerebral growth in fetuses with all subtypes of CHD.

Proximal femoral replacement in contemporary revision total hip arthroplasty for severe femoral bone loss
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Loss or absence of proximal femoral bone in revision total hip   arthroplasty (THA) remains a significant challenge. While the main   indication for the use of proximal femoral replacements (PFRs) is   in the treatment of malignant disease, they have a valuable role   in revision THA for loosening, fracture and infection in patients   with bone loss. Our aim was to determine the clinical outcomes,   implant survivorship, and complications of PFRs used in revision   THA for indications other than malignancy.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A retrospective review of 44 patients who underwent revision   THA using a PFR between 2000 and 2013 was undertaken. Their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong>   age was 79 years (53 to 97); 31 (70%) were women. The bone loss   was classified as Paprosky IIIB or IV in all patients. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong>   follow-up was six years (2 to 12), at which time 22 patients had   died and five were lost to follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> Harris Hip Score improved from 42.8 (25.9 to 82.9) pre-operatively   to 68.5 (21.0 to 87.7) post-operatively (p = 0.0009). A total of   two PFRs had been revised, one for periprosthetic infection eight   years post-operatively and one for aseptic loosening six years post-operatively.   The Kaplan-Meier survivorship free of any revision or removal of   an implant was 86% at five years and 66% years at ten years.

While the survivorship   of the implant is good at five years, dislocation continues to be   the most common complication. The judicious use of larger femoral   heads, dual-mobility constructs, or constrained liners may help   to minimise the risk of dislocation.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:325–9.</p></sec>

Custom-made total ankle arthroplasty for the salvage of major talar bone loss
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>A failed total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) is often associated with   much bone loss. As an alternative to arthrodesis, the surgeon may   consider a custom-made talar component to compensate for the bone   loss. Our aim in this study was to assess the functional and radiological   outcome after the use of such a component at mid- to long-term follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 12 patients (five women and seven men, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age 53   years; 36 to77) with a failed TAA and a large talar defect underwent   a revision procedure using a custom-made talar component. The design   of the custom-made components was based on CT scans and standard   radiographs, when compared with the contralateral ankle. After the   anterior talocalcaneal joint was fused, the talar component was   introduced and fixed to the body of the calcaneum.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> follow-up of 6.9 years (1 to 13), 11 ankles were stable   with no radiological evidence of loosening. Only one was lost to   follow-up. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> arc of movement was 21<sup>°</sup> (10<sup>°</sup> to   35<sup>°</sup>). A total of nine patients (75%) were satisfied or   very satisfied with the outcome, two (17%) were satisfied but with   reservations and one (8%) was not satisfied.

Variation in functional pelvic tilt in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The pelvis rotates in the sagittal plane during daily activities.   These rotations have a direct effect on the functional orientation   of the acetabulum. The aim of this study was to quantify changes   in pelvic tilt between different functional positions.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Pre-operatively, pelvic tilt was measured in 1517 patients undergoing   total hip arthroplasty (THA) in three functional positions – supine,   standing and flexed seated (the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">moment</span></strong> when patients initiate rising   from a seated position). Supine pelvic tilt was measured from CT   scans, standing and flexed seated pelvic tilts were measured from standardised   lateral radiographs. Anterior pelvic tilt was assigned a positive   value.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> pelvic tilt was 4.2° (-20.5° to 24.5°), -1.3° (-30.2°   to 27.9°) and 0.6° (-42.0° to 41.3°) in the three positions, respectively.   The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> sagittal pelvic rotation from supine to standing was -5.5°   (-21.8° to 8.4°), from supine to flexed seated was -3.7° (-48.3°   to 38.6°) and from standing to flexed seated was 1.8° (-51.8° to   39.5°). In 259 patients (17%), the extent of sagittal pelvic rotation   could lead to functional malorientation of the acetabular component. Factoring   in an intra-operative delivery error of ± 5° extends this risk to   51% of patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Planning and measurement of the intended position of the acetabular   component in the supine position may fail to predict clinically   significant changes in its orientation during functional activities,   as a consequence of individual pelvic kinematics. Optimal orientation   is patient-specific and requires an evaluation of functional pelvic   tilt pre-operatively.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:184–91.</p></sec>

Comparative study on the effectiveness of a corticosteroid injection for carpal tunnel syndrome in patients with and without Raynaud’s phenomenon
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of a corticosteroid   injection for the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) in patients   with and without Raynaud’s phenomenon.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>In a prospective study, 139 patients with CTS were treated with   a corticosteroid injection (10 mg triamcinolone acetonide); 34 had   Raynaud’s phenomenon and 105 did not (control group). Grip strength,   perception of touch with a Semmes-Weinstein monofilament and the   Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaires (BCTQ) were assessed at baseline and   at six, 12 and 24 weeks after the injection. The Cold Intolerance   Severity Score (CISS) questionnaire was also assessed at baseline   and 24 weeks after the injection.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The two groups had similar baseline BCTQ scores, but the scores   in the Raynaud’s phenomenon group were significantly higher than   those in the control group at 12 and 24 weeks after the injection.   Throughout the 24-week follow-up, there were no significant differences   in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> grip strength between the groups, whereas the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> Semmes-Weinstein   monofilament sensory index for the control group was significantly   higher than that of the Raynaud’s phenomenon group. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> CISSs   were not significantly different between the groups at baseline   and at 24 weeks. After 24 weeks, 11 patients (32%) in the Raynaud’s   phenomenon group and 16 (15%) in the control group required carpal   tunnel decompression (p = 0.028). Multivariable analysis indicated   that concurrent Raynaud’s phenomenon (odds ratio (OR) 2.6) and severe   electrophysiological grade (OR 2.1) were independently associated with   a failure of treatment after a corticosteroid injection.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Although considerable improvements in symptoms will probably   occur in patients with Raynaud’s phenomenon who have CTS, they have   higher risk of poor functional outcomes and failure of treatment   than those without Raynaud’s phenomenon.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1637–42.</p></sec>

Comparison of the outcome of total ankle arthroplasty for osteoarthritis with moderate and severe varus malalignment and that with neutral alignment
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical and radiographic   outcomes of total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) in patients with pre-operatively   moderate and severe arthritic varus ankles to those achieved for   patients with neutral ankles.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 105 patients (105 ankles), matched for age, gender,   body mass index, and follow-up duration, were divided into three   groups by pre-operative coronal plane tibiotalar angle; neutral   (< 5°), moderate (5° to 15°) and severe (> 15°) varus deformity.   American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot   score, a visual analogue scale (VAS), and Short Form (SF)-36 score   were used to compare the clinical outcomes after a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> follow-up period   of 51 months (24 to 147).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The post-operative AOFAS, VAS scores, range of movement and complication   rates did not significantly differ among three groups. However,   there was less improvement in the SF-36 score of the severe varus   group (p = 0.008). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> post-operative tibiotalar alignment   was 2.6° (0.1° to 8.9°), 3.1° (0.1° to 6.5°) and 4.6° (1.0° to 10.6°)   in the neutral, moderate and severe groups respectively.

Metallosis following implantation of magnetically controlled growing rods in the treatment of scoliosis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We present a case series of five patients who had revision surgery   following magnetic controlled growing rods (MGCR) for early onset   scoliosis. Metallosis was found during revision in four out of five   patients and we postulated a mechanism for rod failure based on   retrieval analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Retrieval analysis was performed on the seven explanted rods.   The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> duration of MCGR from implantation to revision was 35 months   (17 to 46). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age at revision was 12 years (7 to 15; four   boys, one girl).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of six out of seven rods had tissue metallosis and pseudo-capsule   surrounding the actuator. A total of four out of seven rods were   pistoning. There were two rods which were broken. All rods had abrasive   circumferential markings. A significant amount of metal debris was   found when the actuators were carefully cut open.

Comparative study of computer-assisted total knee arthroplasty after opening wedge osteotomy <i>versus</i> after unicompartmental arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The role of high tibial osteotomy (HTO) is being questioned by   the use of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) in the treatment   of medial compartment femorotibial osteoarthritis. Our aim was to   compare the outcomes of revision HTO or UKA to a total knee arthroplasty   (TKA) using computer-assisted surgery in matched groups of patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We conducted a retrospective study to compare the clinical and   radiological outcome of patients who underwent revision of a HTO   to a TKA (group 1) with those who underwent revision of a medial   UKA to a TKA (group 2). All revision procedures were performed using   computer-assisted surgery. We extracted these groups of patients   from our database. They were matched by age, gender, body mass index,   follow-up and pre-operative functional score. The outcomes included   the Knee Society Scores (KSS), radiological outcomes and the rate   of further revision.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were 20 knees in 20 patients in each group. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> follow-up   was 4.1 years (2 to 18.7). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> total KSS at last follow-up   was 185.7 (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard devi</span></strong>ation (<sc>sd</sc>) 5) in group 1 compared   with 176.5 (<sc>sd</sc> 11) for group 2 (p = 0.003). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> hip-knee-ankle   angle was 180.2° (<sc>sd</sc> 3.2°) in group 1 and 179.0° (<sc>sd</sc> 2.2°)   in group 2. No revision was required.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We found that good functional and radiological outcomes followed   revision of both HTO and UKA to TKA. Revision of HTO showed significantly   better functional outcomes. These results need to be further investigated   by a prospective randomised controlled trial involving a larger   group of patients.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2016;98-B:1620–4.</p></sec>

Mid-term outcomes of routine proximal row carpectomy compared with proximal row carpectomy with dorsal capsular interposition arthroplasty for the treatment of late-stage arthropathy of the wrist
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of this study were to compare the mid-term outcomes   of patients with late-stage arthritis of the wrist treated with   proximal row carpectomy (PRC) and dorsal capsular interposition   (DCI) arthroplasty with a matched cohort treated with routine PRC   alone.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 25 arthritic wrists (24 patients) with pre-existing   degenerative changes of the proximal capitate and/or the lunate   fossa of the radius were treated with PRC + DCI over a ten-year   period. This group of patients were matched 1:2 with a group of   50 wrists (48 patients) without degenerative changes in the capitate   or lunate fossa that were treated with a routine PRC alone during   the same period. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> age of the patients at the time of surgery   was 56.8 years (25 to 81), and the demographics and baseline range   of movement of the wrist, grip strength, Quick Disabilities of the   Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (QuickDASH) score, and Patient-Rated Wrist   Evaluation (PRWE) score were similar in both groups. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> follow-up of 5.9 years (1.8 to 11.8), significant improvements   in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mean</span></strong> grip strength, the flexion-extension arc of movement of   the wrist, QuickDASH, and PRWE scores were seen in both groups.   There was no diifference between the groups for any of the outcomes.   One patient in the PRC + DCI group required additional surgery for   a deep infection, while two in the PRC group had complications (one   wound dehiscence requiring revision closure, one transient radial   sensory neuritis). One patient in each group required total arthrodesis   of the wrist for progressive degenerative radiocarpal changes. A   total of 70 patients (93%) were satisfied with the outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>PRC with DCI is an effective form of treatment for late-stage   arthritis of the wrist involving the capitolunate joint, with mid-term   outcomes that are similar to those in patients without degenerative   changes affecting the capitate or lunate fossa who are treated with   a routine PRC alone.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:197–204.</p></sec>

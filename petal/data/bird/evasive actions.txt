Morphology, muscle capacity, skill, and maneuvering ability in hummingbirds
<p>How does agility evolve? This question is challenging because natural movement has many degrees of freedom and can be influenced by multiple traits. We used computer vision to record thousands of translations, rotations, and turns from more than 200 hummingbirds from 25 species, revealing that distinct performance metrics are correlated and that species diverge in their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">maneuv</span></strong>ering style. Our analysis demonstrates that the enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">maneuv</span></strong>erability of larger species is explained by their proportionately greater muscle capacity and lower wing loading. Fast acceleration <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">maneuv</span></strong>ers evolve by recruiting changes in muscle capacity, whereas fast rotations and sharp turns evolve by recruiting changes in wing morphology. Both species and individuals use turns that play to their strengths. These results demonstrate how both skill and biomechanical traits shape <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">maneuv</span></strong>ering behavior.</p>

A tailless aerial robotic flapper reveals that flies use torque coupling in rapid banked turns
<p>Insects are among the most agile natural flyers. Hypotheses on their flight control cannot always be validated by experiments with animals or tethered robots. To this end, we developed a programmable and agile autonomous free-flying robot controlled through bio-inspired motion changes of its flapping wings. Despite being 55 times the size of a fruit fly, the robot can accurately mimic the rapid escape <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">maneuv</span></strong>ers of flies, including a correcting yaw rotation toward the escape heading. Because the robot’s yaw control was turned off, we showed that these yaw rotations result from passive, translation-induced aerodynamic coupling between the yaw torque and the roll and pitch torques produced throughout the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">maneuv</span></strong>er. The robot enables new methods for studying animal flight, and its flight characteristics allow for real-world flight missions.</p>

Catalyst-controlled stereoselective cationic polymerization of vinyl ethers
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tactic</span></strong>ity of vinyl polymers has a profound effect on their physical properties. Despite the well-developed stereoselective methods for the polymerization of propylene and other nonpolar α-olefins, stereoselective polymerization of polar vinyl monomers has proven more challenging. We have designed chiral counterions that systematically bias the reactivity and chain-end stereochemical environment during cationic polymerization. This approach overrides conventional chain-end stereochemical bias to achieve catalyst-controlled stereoselective polymerization. We demonstrate that this method is general to vinyl ether substrates, providing access to a range of iso<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tactic</span></strong> poly(vinyl ether)s with high degrees of iso<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tactic</span></strong>ity. The obtained materials display the tensile properties of commercial polyolefins but adhere more strongly to polar substrates by an order of magnitude, indicating their promise for next-generation engineering applications.</p>

Hydraulic control of tuna fins: A role for the lymphatic system in vertebrate locomotion
<p>The lymphatic system in teleost fish has genetic and developmental origins similar to those of the mammalian lymphatic system, which is involved in immune response and fluid homeostasis. Here, we show that the lymphatic system of tunas functions in swimming hydrodynamics. Specifically, a musculo-vascular complex, consisting of fin muscles, bones, and lymphatic vessels, is involved in the hydraulic control of median fins. This specialization of the lymphatic system is associated with fish in the family Scombridae and may have evolved in response to the demand for swimming and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">maneuv</span></strong>ering control in these high-performance species.</p>

A general catalytic β-C–H carbonylation of aliphatic amines to β-lactams
<p>Methods for the synthesis and functionalization of amines are intrinsically important to a variety of chemical applications. We present a general carbon-hydrogen bond activation process that combines readily available aliphatic amines and the feedstock gas carbon monoxide to form synthetically versatile value-added amide products. The operationally straightforward palladium-catalyzed process exploits a distinct reaction pathway, wherein a sterically hindered carboxylate ligand orchestrates an amine attack on a palladium anhydride to transform aliphatic amines into β-lactams. The reaction is successful with a wide range of secondary amines and can be used as a late-stage functionalization <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tactic</span></strong> to deliver advanced, highly functionalized amine products of utility for pharmaceutical research and other areas.</p>

Brains over brawn: experience overcomes a size disadvantage in fish social hierarchies
<p>Life experiences can alter cognitive abilities and subsequent behavior. Here we asked whether differences in experience could affect social status. In hierarchical animal societies, high-ranking males that typically win aggressive encounters gain territories and hence access to mates. To understand the relative contributions of social experience and physical environment on status, we used a highly territorial African cichlid fish species, <i>Astatotilapia burtoni</i>, that lives in a dynamic lek-like social hierarchy. <i>Astatotilapia burtoni</i> males are either dominant or submissive and can switch status rapidly depending on the local environment. Although dominant males are innately aggressive, we wondered whether they modulated their aggression based on experience. We hypothesized that as males mature they might hone their fighting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tactic</span></strong>s based on observation of other males fighting. We compared males of different ages and sizes in distinctly different physical environments and subsequently tested their fighting skills. We found that a size difference previously thought negligible (<10% body length) gave a significant advantage to the larger opponent. In contrast, we found no evidence that increasing environmental complexity affected status outcomes. Surprisingly, we found that males only a few days older than their opponents had a significant advantage during territorial disputes so that being older compensated for the disadvantage of being smaller. Moreover, the slightly older winners exploited a consistent fighting strategy, starting with lower levels of aggression on the first day that significantly increased on the second day, a pattern absent in younger winners. These data suggest that experience is an advantage during fights for status, and that social learning provides more relevant experience than the physical complexity of the territory.</p>

Protein crystallization promotes type 2 immunity and is reversible by antibody treatment
<p>Although spontaneous protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization is a rare event in vivo, Charcot-Leyden <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s (CLCs) consisting of galectin-10 (Gal10) protein are frequently observed in eosinophilic diseases, such as asthma. We found that CLCs derived from patients showed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> packing and Gal10 structure identical to those of Gal10 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s grown in vitro. When administered to the airways, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>line Gal10 stimulated innate and adaptive immunity and acted as a type 2 adjuvant. By contrast, a soluble Gal10 mutein was inert. Antibodies directed against key epitopes of the CLC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization interface dissolved preexisting CLCs in patient-derived mucus within hours and reversed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>-driven inflammation, goblet-cell metaplasia, immunoglobulin E (IgE) synthesis, and bronchial hyperreactivity (BHR) in a humanized mouse model of asthma. Thus, protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s may promote hallmark features of asthma and are targetable by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>-dissolving antibodies.</p>

Colossal grain growth yields single-crystal metal foils by contact-free annealing
<p>Single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> metals have distinctive properties owing to the absence of grain boundaries and strong anisotropy. Commercial single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> metals are usually synthesized by bulk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> growth or by deposition of thin films onto substrates, and they are expensive and small. We prepared extremely large single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> metal foils by “contact-free annealing” from commercial poly<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>line foils. The colossal grain growth (up to 32 square centimeters) is achieved by minimizing contact stresses, resulting in a preferred in-plane and out-of-plane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> orientation, and is driven by surface energy minimization during the rotation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> lattice followed by “consumption” of neighboring grains. Industrial-scale production of single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> metal foils is possible as a result of this discovery.</p>

Single-crystal x-ray diffraction structures of covalent organic frameworks
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization problem is an outstanding challenge in the chemistry of porous covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Their structural characterization has been limited to modeling and solutions based on powder x-ray or electron diffraction data. Single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s of COFs amenable to x-ray diffraction characterization have not been reported. Here, we developed a general procedure to grow large single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s of three-dimensional imine-based COFs (COF-300, hydrated form of COF-300, COF-303, LZU-79, and LZU-111). The high quality of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s allowed collection of single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> x-ray diffraction data of up to 0.83-angstrom resolution, leading to unambiguous solution and precise anisotropic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">refin</span></strong>ement. Characteristics such as degree of interpenetration, arrangement of water guests, the reversed imine connectivity, linker disorder, and uncommon topology were deciphered with atomic precision—aspects impossible to determine without single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s.</p>

Reproduction-related variation in carbon allocation to woody tissues in <i>Fagus crenata</i> using a natural <sup>13</sup>C approach
<p>The contribution of new photo-assimilates and stored carbon (C) to plant growth remains poorly understood, especially during reproduction. In order to elucidate how mast seeding affects C allocation to both reproductive and vegetative tissues, we measured biomass increase in each tissue, branch starch concentration and stable C isotope composition (δ<sup>13</sup>C) in bulk leaves, current-year shoots, 3-year branches and tree rings in fruiting and non-fruiting trees for 2 years, as well as in fruits. We isolated the effect of reproduction on C allocation to vegetative growth by comparing <sup>13</sup>C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enrich</span></strong>ment in woody tissues in fruiting and non-fruiting specimens. Compared with 2‰ <sup>13</sup>C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enrich</span></strong>ment in shoots relative to leaves from non-fruiting trees, fruiting reduced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enrich</span></strong>ment to 1‰ and this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion disappeared in the following year with no fruiting, indicating that new photo-assimilates are preferentially used for woody tissues even with fruiting burden. In contrast, fruits had up to 2.5‰ <sup>13</sup>C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enrich</span></strong>ment at mid-summer, which dropped thereafter, indicating that fruit production relies on C storage early in the growing season then shifts to current photo-assimilates. At this tipping point, growth of shoots and cupules had almost finished and nuts had a second rapid growth period thereafter. Together with shorter shoots but higher biomass increment per length in fruiting trees than non-fruiting trees, these results indicate that the C limitation due to fruit burden is minimized by fine-tuning of allocation of old C stores and new photo-assimilates, along with the growth pattern in various tissues. Furthermore, fruiting had no significant effect on starch concentration in 3-year-old branches, which became fully depleted during leaf and flower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flush</span></strong>ing but were quickly replenished. These results indicate that reproduction affects C allocation to branches but not its source or storage. These reproduction-related variations in the fate of C have implications for evaluating forest ecosystem C cycles during climate change.</p>

Scalable and safe synthetic organic electroreduction inspired by Li-ion battery chemistry
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ive electrosynthesis has faced long-standing challenges in applications to complex organic substrates at scale. Here, we show how decades of research in lithium-ion battery materials, electrolytes, and additives can serve as an inspiration for achieving practically scalable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ive electrosynthetic conditions for the Birch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion. Specifically, we demonstrate that using a sacrificial anode material (magnesium or aluminum), combined with a cheap, nontoxic, and water-soluble proton source (dimethylurea), and an overcharge protectant inspired by battery technology [tris(pyrrolidino)phosphoramide] can allow for multigram-scale synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant building blocks. We show how these conditions have a very high level of functional-group tolerance relative to classical electrochemical and chemical dissolving-metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ions. Finally, we demonstrate that the same electrochemical conditions can be applied to other dissolving metal–type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ive transformations, including McMurry couplings, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ive ketone deoxygenations, and epoxide openings.</p>

Control of zeolite framework flexibility and pore topology for separation of ethane and ethylene
<p>The discovery of new materials for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ating ethylene from ethane by adsorption, instead of using cryogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distil</span></strong>lation, is a key milestone for molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ations because of the multiple and widely extended uses of these molecules in industry. This technique has the potential to provide tremendous energy savings when compared with the currently used cryogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distil</span></strong>lation process for ethylene produced through steam cracking. Here we describe the synthesis and structural determination of a flexible pure silica zeolite (ITQ-55). This material can kinetically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate ethylene from ethane with an unprecedented selectivity of ~100, owing to its distinctive pore topology with large heart-shaped cages and framework flexibility. Control of such properties extends the boundaries for applicability of zeolites to challenging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ations.</p>

Reductions in Atherogenic Lipids and Major Cardiovascular Events
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>A continuous relationship between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) has been observed in statin and ezetimibe outcomes trials down to achieved levels of 54 mg/dL. However, it is uncertain whether this relationship extends to LDL-C levels <50 mg/dL. We assessed the relationship between additional LDL-C, non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B100 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ions and MACE among patients within the ODYSSEY trials that compared alirocumab with controls (placebo/ezetimibe), mainly as add-on therapy to maximally tolerated statin.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data were pooled from 10 double-blind trials (6699 patient-years of follow-up).

In a post hoc analysis, the relationship between average on-treatment lipid levels and percent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ions in lipids from baseline were correlated with MACE (coronary heart disease death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or unstable angina requiring hospitalization) in multivariable analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, 33.1% of the pooled cohort achieved average LDL-C <50 mg/dL (44.7%–52.6% allocated to alirocumab, 6.5% allocated to ezetimibe, and 0% allocated to placebo).

Reducing the stochasticity of crystal nucleation to enable subnanosecond memory writing
<p>Operation speed is a key challenge in phase-change random-access memory (PCRAM) technology, especially for achieving subnanosecond high-speed cache memory. Commercialized PCRAM products are limited by the tens of nanoseconds writing speed, originating from the stochastic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> nucleation during the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization of amorphous germanium antimony telluride<i> </i>(Ge<sub>2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>5</sub>). Here, we demonstrate an alloying strategy to speed up the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization kinetics. The scandium antimony telluride (Sc<sub>0.2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>) compound that we designed allows a writing speed of only 700 picoseconds without preprogramming in a large conventional PCRAM device. This ultrafast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization stems from the reduced stochasticity of nucleation through geometrically matched and robust scandium telluride (ScTe) chemical bonds that stabilize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> precursors in the amorphous state. Controlling nucleation through alloy design paves the way for the development of cache-type PCRAM technology to boost the working efficiency of computing systems.</p>

Neutrophils take a round-trip
<p>Inflammation is a body's response to harmful stimuli that aims to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elimin</span></strong>ate the trigger that caused the initial injury and enable tissue repair. Inflammation can be either pathogen-associated or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>e. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>e inflammation can be triggered by acute conditions, such as trauma, toxin exposure, and ischemia-reperfusion injury, but it is also an important component of life-threatening chronic inflammatory conditions, such as atherosclerosis, cancer, and asbestosis (<i>1</i>). Regardless of etiology, the mechanisms resolving inflammatory responses constitute highly coordinated and active processes that are vital for restoring tissue homeostasis. Although the cellular and molecular signals that drive the initiation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>e inflammation are well studied (<i>1</i>), we have a relatively poor understanding of the mechanisms through which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>e inflammation is resolved, thus limiting our ability to therapeutically tackle harmful inflammation.

Down-regulation of the Sucrose Transporter <i>CsSUT1</i> Causes Male Sterility by Altering Carbohydrate Supply
<p>In plants, male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>ity is an important agronomic trait, especially in hybrid crop production. Many factors are known to affect crop male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>ity, but it remains unclear whether Suc transporters (SUTs) participate directly in this process. Here, we identified and functionally characterized the cucumber (<i>Cucumis sativus</i>) CsSUT1, a typical plasma membrane-localized energy-dependent high-affinity Suc-H<sup>+</sup> symporter. <i>CsSUT1</i> is expressed in male flowers and encodes a protein that is localized primarily in the tapetum, pollen, and companion cells of the phloem of sepals, petals, filaments, and pedicel. The male flowers of <i>CsSUT1</i>-RNA interference (RNAi) lines exhibited a decrease in Suc, hexose, and starch content, relative to those of the wild type, during the later stages of male flower development, a finding that was highly associated with male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>ity. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that numerous genes associated with sugar metabolism, transport, and signaling, as well as with auxin signaling, were down-regulated, whereas most <i>myeloblastosis</i> (<i>MYB</i>) transcription factor genes were up-regulated in these <i>CsSUT1</i>-RNAi lines relative to wild type. Our findings demonstrate that male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>ity can be induced by RNAi-mediated down-regulation of <i>CsSUT1</i> expression, through the resultant perturbation in carbohydrate delivery and subsequent alteration in sugar and hormone signaling and up-regulation of specific <i>MYB</i> transcription factors. This knowledge provides a new approach for bioengineering male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>ity in crop plants.</p>

The Chinese soft-shelled turtle, <i>Pelodiscus sinensis</i>, decreases nitrogenous excretion, reduces urea synthesis and suppresses ammonia production during emersion
<p>The objective of this study was to examine the effects of 6 days of emersion on nitrogen metabolism and excretion in the Chinese soft-shelled turtle, <i>Pelodiscus sinensis</i>. Despite having a soft shell with a cutaneous surface that is known to be water permeable, <i>P. sinensis</i> lost only ~2% of body mass and was able to maintain its hematocrit and plasma osmolality, [Na<sup>+</sup>] and [Cl<sup>−</sup>] during 6 days of emersion. During emersion, it ameliorated water loss by reducing urine output, which led to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion (by 29–76%) in ammonia excretion. In comparison, there was a more prominent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion (by 82–99%) in urea excretion during emersion due to a lack of water to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flush</span></strong> the buccopharyngeal epithelium, which is known to be the major route of urea excretion. Consequently, emersion resulted in an apparent shift from ureotely to ammonotely in <i>P. sinensis</i>. Although urea concentration increased in several tissues, the excess urea accumulated could only account for 13–22% of the deficit in urea excretion. Hence, it can be concluded that a decrease (~80%) in urea synthesis occurred in <i>P. sinensis</i> during the 6 days of emersion. Indeed, emersion led to significant decreases in the activity of some ornithine–urea cycle enzymes (argininosuccinate synthetase/argininosuccinate lyase and arginase) from the liver of <i>P. sinensis</i>. As a decrease in urea synthesis occurred without the accumulation of ammonia and total free amino acids, it can be deduced that ammonia production through amino acid catabolism was suppressed with a proportional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion in proteolysis in <i>P. sinensis</i> during emersion. Indeed, calculated results revealed that there could be a prominent decrease (~88%) in ammonia production in turtles after 6 days of emersion. In summary, despite being ureogenic and ureotelic in water, <i>P. sinensis</i> adopted a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion in ammonia production, instead of increased urea synthesis, as the major strategy to ameliorate ammonia toxicity and problems associated with dehydration during terrestrial exposure.</p>

PI(4,5)P2 regulates myoblast fusion through Arp2/3 regulator localization at the fusion site
<p>Cell-cell fusion is a regulated process that requires merging of the opposing membranes and underlying cytoskeletons. However, the integration between membrane and cytoskeleton signaling during fusion is not known. Using <i>Drosophila</i>, we demonstrate that the membrane phosphoinositide PI(4,5)P2 is a crucial regulator of F-actin dynamics during myoblast fusion. PI(4,5)P2 is locally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enrich</span></strong>ed and colocalizes spatially and temporally with the F-actin focus that defines the fusion site. PI(4,5)P2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enrich</span></strong>ment depends on receptor engagement but is upstream or parallel to actin remodeling. Regulators of actin branching via Arp2/3 colocalize with PI(4,5)P2 <i>in vivo</i> and bind PI(4,5)P2 <i>in vitro</i>. Manipulation of PI(4,5)P2 availability leads to impaired fusion, with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion in the F-actin focus size and altered focus morphology. Mechanistically, the changes in the actin focus are due to a failure in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enrich</span></strong>ment of actin regulators at the fusion site. Moreover, improper localization of these regulators hinders expansion of the fusion interface. Thus, PI(4,5)P2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enrich</span></strong>ment at the fusion site encodes spatial and temporal information that regulates fusion progression through the localization of activators of actin polymerization.</p>

Size-dependent enhancement of water relations during post-fire resprouting
<p>In resprouting species, fire-induced topkill causes a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion in height and leaf area without a comparable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion in the size of the root system, which should lead to an increase in the efficiency of water transport after fire. However, large plants undergo a greater relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion in size, compared with small plants, so we hypothesized that this enhancement in hydraulic efficiency would be greatest among large growth forms. In the ecotone between long-leaf pine (<i>Pinus palustris</i> Mill.) savannas and wetlands, we measured stomatal conductance (<i>g</i><sub>s</sub>), mid-day leaf water potential (<i>Ψ</i><sub>leaf</sub>), leaf-specific whole-plant hydraulic conductance (<i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub>), leaf area and height of 10 species covering a range of growth forms in burned and unburned sites. As predicted, <i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub> was higher in post-fire resprouts than in unburned plants, and the post-fire increase in <i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub> was positively related to plant size. Specifically, large-statured species tended to undergo the greatest relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ions in leaf area and height, and correspondingly experienced the greatest increases in <i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub>. The post-fire increase in <i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub> was smaller than expected, however, due to a decrease in absolute root hydraulic conductance (i.e., not scaled to leaf area). The higher <i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub> in burned sites was manifested as an increase in <i>g</i><sub>s</sub> rather than an increase in <i>Ψ</i><sub>leaf</sub>. Post-fire increases in <i>g</i><sub>s</sub> should promote high rates of photosynthesis for recovery of carbohydrate reserves and aboveground biomass, which is particularly important for large-statured species that require more time to recover their pre-fire size.</p>

The apo-structure of the leucine sensor Sestrin2 is still elusive
<p>Sestrin2 is a GATOR2-interacting protein that directly binds leucine and is required for the inhibition of mTORC1 under leucine deprivation, indicating that it is a leucine sensor for the mTORC1 pathway. We recently reported the structure of Sestrin2 in complex with leucine [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID, 5DJ4] and demonstrated that mutations in the leucine-binding pocket that alter the affinity of Sestrin2 for leucine result in a corresponding change in the leucine sensitivity of mTORC1 in cells. A lower resolution structure of human Sestrin2 (PDB ID, 5CUF), which was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lized in the absence of exogenous leucine, showed Sestrin2 to be in a nearly identical conformation as the leucine-bound structure. On the basis of this observation, it has been argued that leucine binding does not affect the conformation of Sestrin2 and that Sestrin2 may not be a sensor for leucine. We show that simple analysis of the reported “apo”-Sestrin2 structure reveals the clear presence of prominent, unmodeled electron density in the leucine-binding pocket that exactly accommodates the leucine observed in the higher resolution structure. Refining the reported apo-structure with leucine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elimin</span></strong>ated the large <i>F</i><sub>obs</sub>-<i>F</i><sub>calc</sub> difference density at this position and improved the working and free R factors of the model. Consistent with this result, our own structure of Sestrin2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lized in the absence of exogenous leucine also contained electron density that is best explained by leucine. Thus, the structure of apo-Sestrin2 remains elusive.</p>

Crystal-clear treatment for allergic disease
<p>Charcot-Leyden <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s (CLCs) are protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s produced by human eosinophils, immune cells typically associated with allergy and parasitic worm (helminth) infection. These responses involve the “type 2” arm of the immune system, and CLCs are a hallmark of the more severe pathologies that can occur during type 2 inflammation, such as allergic asthma. Although described over 160 years ago, the biological relevance of CLCs to type 2 immunity has remained unknown. On page 751 of this issue, Persson <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) confirm anecdotal evidence that CLCs are a key feature of severe asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. They demonstrate that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s, but not the soluble proteins, are powerful promoters of allergic inflammation and can be targeted with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>-dissolving antibodies to reverse disease symptoms.</p>

Giant piezoelectricity of Sm-doped Pb(Mg<sub>1/3</sub>Nb<sub>2/3</sub>)O<sub>3</sub>-PbTiO<sub>3</sub> single crystals
<p>High-performance piezoelectrics benefit transducers and sensors in a variety of electromechanical applications. The materials with the highest piezoelectric charge coefficients (<i>d</i><sub>33</sub>) are relaxor-PbTiO<sub>3</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s, which were discovered two decades ago. We successfully grew Sm-doped Pb(Mg<sub>1/3</sub>Nb<sub>2/3</sub>)O<sub>3</sub>-PbTiO<sub>3</sub> (Sm-PMN-PT) single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s with even higher <i>d</i><sub>33</sub> values ranging from 3400 to 4100 picocoulombs per newton, with variation below 20% over the as-grown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> boule, exhibiting good property uniformity. We characterized the Sm-PMN-PT on the atomic scale with scanning transmission electron microscopy and made first-principles calculations to determine that the giant piezoelectric properties arise from the enhanced local structural heterogeneity introduced by Sm<sup>3+</sup> dopants. Rare-earth doping is thus identified as a general strategy for introducing local structural heterogeneity in order to enhance the piezoelectricity of relaxor ferroelectric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s.</p>

Ethane/ethylene separation in a metal-organic framework with iron-peroxo sites

Ketyl radical reactivity via atom transfer catalysis
<p>Single-electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion of a carbonyl to a ketyl enables access to a polarity-reversed platform of reactivity for this cornerstone functional group. However, the synthetic utility of the ketyl radical is hindered by the strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ants necessary for its generation, which also limit its reactivity to net <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ive mechanisms. We report a strategy for net redox-neutral generation and reaction of ketyl radicals. The in situ conversion of aldehydes to α-acetoxy iodides lowers their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion potential by more than 1 volt, allowing for milder access to the corresponding ketyl radicals and an oxidative termination event. Upon subjecting these iodides to a dimanganese decacarbonyl precatalyst and visible light irradiation, an atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) mechanism affords a broad scope of vinyl iodide products with high <i>Z</i>-selectivity.</p>

Imaging of nonlocal hot-electron energy dissipation via shot noise

Despite recent progress in nanothermometry, direct real-space mapping of hot-electron energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissip</span></strong>ation is challenging because existing techniques are restricted to probing the lattice rather than the electrons. We realize electronic nanothermometry by measuring local current fluctuations, or shot noise, associated with ultrafast hot-electron kinetic processes (~21 terahertz). Exploiting a scanning and contact-free tungsten tip as a local noise probe, we directly visualize hot-electron distributions before their thermal equilibration with the host gallium arsenide/aluminium gallium arsenide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> lattice.

Extraordinary plasticity of an inorganic semiconductor in darkness
<p>Inorganic semiconductors generally tend to fail in a brittle manner. Here, we report that extraordinary “plasticity” can take place in an inorganic semiconductor if the deformation is carried out “in complete darkness.” Room-temperature deformation tests of zinc sulfide (ZnS) were performed under varying light conditions. ZnS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s immediately fractured when they deformed under light irradiation. In contrast, it was found that ZnS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s can be plastically deformed up to a deformation strain of ε<sub>t</sub> = 45% in complete darkness. In addition, the optical bandgap of the deformed ZnS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s was distinctly decreased after deformation. These results suggest that dislocations in ZnS become mobile in complete darkness and that multiplied dislocations can affect the optical bandgap over the whole <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>. Inorganic semiconductors are not necessarily intrinsically brittle.</p>

Depending on the reaction conditions under which potassium graphite is introduced as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ant, N<sub>2</sub> binding to two borylene units results in either neutral (B<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>) or dianionic ([B<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2–</sup>) products that can be interconverted by respective exposure to further <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ant or to air.

A catalytic fluoride-rebound mechanism for C(sp<sup>3</sup>)-CF<sub>3</sub> bond formation

<i>ESA1</i> Is Involved in Embryo Sac Abortion in Interspecific Hybrid Progeny of Rice
<p>The emergence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>e individuals in the hybrid backcross progeny of wild and cultivated rice limits the use of wild rice alleles for improving cultivated rice, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>ity remain unclear. Here, we identified the semi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>e introgression line YIL42, derived from a cross between the <i>indica</i> rice variety Teqing (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and <i>Oryza rufipogon</i> accession YJCWR (Yuanjiang common wild rice), which exhibits semi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>ity. Using positional cloning, we isolated <i>EMBRYO SAC ABORTION 1</i> (<i>ESA1</i>), which encodes a nuclear-membrane localized protein containing an armadillo repeat domain. A mutation in <i>ESA1</i> at position 1819 (<sup>T</sup>1819<sup>C</sup>) converts a stop codon into an Arg (R) codon, causing delayed termination of protein translation. Analysis of transgenic lines indicated that the difference in ESA1 protein structure between <i>O. rufipogon</i>–derived <i>ESA1</i> and Teqing-derived <i>esa1</i> affects female gamete abortion during early mitosis. Fertility investigation and expression analysis indicated that the interaction between <i>ESA1</i><sup>T1819</sup> and unknown gene(s) of Teqing affects spikelet fertility of the hybrid backcross progeny. The <i>ESA1</i><sup>T1819</sup> allele is present in <i>O. rufipogon</i> but absent in <i>O. sativa</i>, suggesting that variation in <i>ESA1</i> may be associated with interspecific hybrid incompatibility between wild and cultivated rice.

Protein Phosphatase 2A B'α and B'β Protect Centromeric Cohesion during Meiosis I
<p>During meiosis, the stepwise release of sister chromatid cohesion is crucial for the equal distribution of genetic material to daughter cells, enabling generation of fertile gametophytes. However, the molecular mechanism that protects centromeric cohesion from release at meiosis I is unclear in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Here, we report that the protein phosphatase 2A regulatory subunits B'α and B'β participate in the control of sister chromatid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation. The double mutant <i>b'αβ</i> exhibited severe male and female <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>ity, caused by the lack of a nucleus or presence of an abnormal nucleus in mature microspores and embryo sacs. 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole staining revealed unequal amounts of DNA in the mononuclear microspores. Transverse sections of the anthers revealed unevenly sized tetrads with or without a nucleus, suggesting a defect in meiocyte meiosis. An analysis of chromosome spreads showed that the sister chromatids <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated prematurely at anaphase I in <i>b'αβ</i>. Immunoblotting showed that AtRECOMBINATION DEFECTIVE8 (AtREC8), a key member of the cohesin complex, was hyperphosphorylated in <i>b'αβ</i> anthers and pistils during meiosis but hypophosphorylated in the wild type. Furthermore, yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays showed that B'α and B'β interact specifically with AtREC8, AtSHUGOSHIN1 (AtSGO1), AtSGO2, and PATRONUS1. Given that B'α was reported to localize to the centromere in meiotic cells, we propose that protein phosphatase 2A B'α and B'β are recruited by AtSGO1/2 and PATRONUS1 to dephosphorylate AtREC8 at the site of centromere cohesion to shield it from cleavage until anaphase II, contributing to the balanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of sister chromatids at meiosis.</p>

The Mitochondrial Endonuclease M20 Participates in the Down-Regulation of Mitochondrial DNA in Pollen Cells
<p>Maintaining the appropriate number of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) molecules is crucial for supporting mitochondrial metabolism and function in both plant and animal cells. For example, a substantial decrease in mtDNA levels occurs as a key part of pollen development. The molecular mechanisms regulating mtDNA copy number are largely unclear, particularly with regard to those that reduce mtDNA levels. Here, we identified and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">purifi</span></strong>ed a 20-kD endonuclease, M20, from maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) pollen mitochondria. We found M20 to be an His-Asn-His/Asn (H-N-H/N) nuclease that degrades linear and circular DNA in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> or Mn<sup>2+</sup>. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) AtM20, which shared high sequence similarity with maize M20, localized to the mitochondria, had a similar H-N-H/N structure, and degraded both linear and circular DNA. <i>AtM20</i> transcript levels increased during pollen development, in parallel with a rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion in mtDNA. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 genome-editing techniques were used to generate knockout lines of <i>AtM20</i> (<i>atm20</i>), which exhibited a significant delay in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion in mtDNA levels in pollen vegetative cells but normal mtDNA levels in somatic cells. The delayed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion in pollen mtDNA levels was rescued by the transgenic expression of <i>AtM20</i> in <i>atm20</i> plants. This study thus uncovers an endonucleolytic DNase in plant mitochondria and its crucial role in reducing mtDNA levels, pointing to the complex mechanism regulating mtDNA levels in plants.</p>

Evidence That Isoprene Emission Is Not Limited by Cytosolic Metabolites. Exogenous Malate Does Not Invert the Reverse Sensitivity of Isoprene Emission to High [CO<sub>2</sub>]
<p>Isoprene is synthesized via the chloroplastic 2-<i>C</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-erythritol 4-phosphate/1-deoxy-<sc>d</sc>-xylulose 5-phosphate pathway (MEP/DOXP), and its synthesis is directly related to photosynthesis, except under high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, when the rate of photosynthesis increases but isoprene emission decreases. Suppression of MEP/DOXP pathway activity by high CO<sub>2</sub> has been explained either by limited supply of the cytosolic substrate precursor, phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate (PEP), into chloroplast as the result of enhanced activity of cytosolic PEP carboxylase or by limited supply of energetic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ive equivalents. We tested the PEP-limitation hypotheses by feeding leaves with the PEP carboxylase competitive inhibitors malate and diethyl oxalacetate (DOA) in the strong isoprene emitter hybrid aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus tremuloides</i>). Malate feeding resulted in the inhibition of net assimilation, photosynthetic electron transport, and isoprene emission rates, but DOA feeding did not affect any of these processes except at very high application concentrations. Both malate and DOA did not alter the sensitivity of isoprene emission to high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. Malate inhibition of isoprene emission was associated with enhanced chloroplastic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ive status that suppressed light reactions of photosynthesis, ultimately leading to reduced isoprene substrate dimethylallyl diphosphate pool size. Additional experiments with altered oxygen concentrations in conditions of feedback-limited and non-feedback-limited photosynthesis further indicated that changes in isoprene emission rate in control and malate-inhibited leaves were associated with changes in the share of ATP and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ive equivalent supply for isoprene synthesis. The results of this study collectively indicate that malate importantly controls the chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ive status and, thereby, affects isoprene emission, but they do not support the hypothesis that cytosolic metabolite availability alters the response of isoprene emission to changes in atmospheric composition.</p>

Unique Physiological and Transcriptional Shifts under Combinations of Salinity, Drought, and Heat
<p>Climate-change-driven stresses such as extreme temperatures, water deficit, and ion imbalance are projected to exacerbate and jeopardize global food security. Under field conditions, these stresses usually occur simultaneously and cause damages that exceed single stresses. Here, we investigated the transcriptional patterns and morpho-physiological acclimations of <i>Brachypodium dystachion</i> to single salinity, drought, and heat stresses, as well as their double and triple stress combinations. Hierarchical clustering analysis of morpho-physiological acclimations showed that several traits exhibited a gradually aggravating effect as plants were exposed to combined stresses. On the other hand, other morphological traits were dominated by salinity, while some physiological traits were shaped by heat stress. Response patterns of differentially expressed genes, under single and combined stresses (i.e. common stress genes), were maintained only among 37% of the genes, indicating a limited expression consistency among partially overlapping stresses. A comparison between common stress genes and genes that were uniquely expressed only under combined stresses (i.e. combination unique genes) revealed a significant shift from increased intensity to antagonistic responses, respectively.

Does tantalum exhibit any intrinsic antimicrobial or antibiofilm properties?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Tantalum (Ta) trabecular metal components are increasingly used   to reconstruct major bone defects in revision arthroplasty surgery.   It is known that some metals such as silver have antibacterial properties.   Recent reports have raised the question regarding whether Ta components   are protective against infection in revision surgery. This laboratory   study aimed to establish whether Ta has intrinsic antibacterial   properties against planktonic bacteria, or the ability to inhibit   biofilm formation.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Equal-sized pieces of Ta and titanium (Ti) acetabular components   were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">steril</span></strong>ised and incubated with a low dose inoculum of either <i>Staphylococcus   (S.) aureus</i> or <i>S. epidermidis</i> for 24 hours.   After serial dilution, colony forming units (cfu) were quantified   on Mueller-Hinton agar plates. In order to establish whether biofilms   formed to a greater extent on one material than the other, these   Ta and Ti pieces were then <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wash</span></strong>ed twice, sonicated and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wash</span></strong>ed again   to remove loosely adhered planktonic bacteria. They were then re-incubated   for 24 hours prior to quantifying the number of cfu. All experiments   were performed in triplicate.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>More than 1x10<sup>8</sup> cfu/ml were observed in both the Ta   and Ti experiments. After <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wash</span></strong>ing and sonication, more than 2x10<sup>7</sup> cfu/ml   were observed for both Ta and Ti groups. The results were the same   for both <i>S. aureus</i> and <i>S. epidermidis</i>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Compared with Ti controls, Ta did not demonstrate any intrinsic   antibacterial activity or ability to inhibit biofilm formation.   Hence, intrinsic antimicrobial properties of Ta do not account for   the previously observed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion in the frequency of subsequent   infections when Ta was used in revision procedures. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1153–6.</p></sec>

Comparison of the elution properties of commercially available gentamicin and bone cement containing vancomycin with ‘home-made’ preparations
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Vancomycin is commonly added to acrylic bone cement during revision   arthroplasty surgery. Proprietary cement preparations containing   vancomycin are available, but are significantly more expensive.   We investigated whether the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elut</span></strong>ion of antibiotic from ‘home-made’   cement containing vancomycin was comparable with more expensive   commercially available vancomycin impregnated cement.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A total of 18 cement discs containing either proprietary CopalG+V;   or ‘home-made’ CopalR+G with vancomycin added by hand, were made.   Each disc contained the same amount of antibiotic (0.5 g gentamycin,   2 g vancomycin) and was immersed in ammonium acetate buffer in a   sealed container. Fluid from each container was sampled at eight   time points over a two-week period. The concentrations of gentamicin   and vancomycin in the fluid were analysed using high performance   liquid chromatography mass spectrometry.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The highest peak concentrations of antibiotic were observed from   the ‘home-made’ cements containing vancomycin, added as in the operating   theatre. The overall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elut</span></strong>ion of antibiotic was, fivefold (vancomycin)   and twofold (gentamicin) greater from the ‘home-made’ mix compared   with the commercially mixed cement. The use of a vacuum during mixing   had no significant effect on antibiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elut</span></strong>ion in any of the samples.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These findings suggest that the addition of 2 g vancomycin powder   to gentamicin-impregnated bone cement by hand significantly increases   the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elut</span></strong>ion of both antibiotics compared with commercially prepared   cements containing vancomycin.

The use of ultra-low-dose CT scans for the evaluation of limb fractures
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To evaluate whether an ultra-low-dose CT protocol can diagnose   selected limb fractures as well as conventional CT (C-CT).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We prospectively studied 40 consecutive patients with a limb   fracture in whom a CT scan was indicated. These were scanned using   an ultra-low-dose CT Reduced Effective Dose Using Computed Tomography   In Orthopaedic Injury (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ION) protocol. Studies from 16 selected   cases were compared with 16 C-CT scans matched for age, gender and   type of fracture. Studies were assessed for diagnosis and image   quality. Descriptive and reliability statistics were calculated.   The total effective radiation dose for each scanned site was compared.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean estimated effective dose (ED) for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ION protocol   was 0.03 milliSieverts (mSv) and 0.43 mSv (p < 0.005) for C-CT.   The sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value   (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ION protocol   to detect fractures were 0.98, 0.89, 0.98 and 0.89 respectively   when two occult fractures were excluded. Inter- and intra-observer   reliability for diagnosis using the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ION protocol (κ = 0.75, κ =   0.71) were similar to those of C-CT (κ = 0.85, κ = 0.82).

Inflammatory and Cholesterol Risk in the FOURIER Trial
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In the FOURIER trial (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Patients With Elevated Risk), the PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitor evolocumab reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and cardiovascular risk. It is not known whether the efficacy of evolocumab is modified by baseline inflammatory risk. We explored the efficacy of evolocumab stratified by baseline high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). We also assessed the importance of inflammatory and residual cholesterol risk across the range of on-treatment LDL-C concentrations.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients (n=27 564) with stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and LDL-C ≥70 mg/dL on a statin were randomly assigned to evolocumab versus placebo and followed for a median of 2.2 years (1.8–2.5). The effects of evolocumab on the primary end point of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina or coronary revascularization, and the key secondary end point of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke were compared across strata of baseline hsCRP (<1, 1–3, and >3 mg/dL). Outcomes were also assessed across values for baseline hsCRP and 1-month LDL-C in the entire trial population. Multivariable models adjusted for variables associated with hsCRP and 1-month LDL-C were evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 7981 (29%) patients had a baseline hsCRP<1 mg/L, 11 177 (41%) had a hsCRP 1 to 3 mg/L, and 8337 (30%) had a hsCRP >3 mg/L. Median (interquartile range) baseline hsCRP was 1.8 (0.9–3.6) mg/L and levels were not altered by evolocumab (change at 48 weeks of –0.2 mg/dL [–1.0 to 0.4] in both treatment arms). In the placebo arm, patients in higher baseline hsCRP categories experienced significantly higher 3-year Kaplan-Meier rates of the primary and key secondary end points: 12.0%, 13.7%, and 18.1% for the primary end point (<i>P</i><sub>trend</sub><0.0001) and 7.4%, 9.1%, and 13.2% for the key secondary end point (<i>P</i><sub>trend</sub><0.0001) for categories of <1, 1 to 3, and >3 mg/dL, respectively. The relative risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ions for the primary end point and key secondary end point with evolocumab were consistent across hsCRP strata (<i>P</i>-interactions>0.15 for both). In contrast, the absolute risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ions with evolocumab tended to be greater in patients with higher hsCRP: 1.6%, 1.8%, and 2.6% and 0.8%, 2.0%, and 3.0%, respectively, for the primary and key secondary end points across hsCRP strata. In adjusted analyses of the association between LDL-C and hsCRP levels and cardiovascular risk, both LDL-C and hsCRP were independently associated with the primary outcome (<i>P</i><0.0001 for each).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>LDL-C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion with evolocumab reduces cardiovascular events across hsCRP strata with greater absolute risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ions in patients with higher-baseline hsCRP.

Extracellular Matrix Proteomics Reveals Interplay of Aggrecan and Aggrecanases in Vascular Remodeling of Stented Coronary Arteries
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling contributes to in-stent restenosis and thrombosis. Despite its important clinical implications, little is known about ECM changes post–stent implantation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Bare-metal and drug-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elut</span></strong>ing stents were implanted in pig coronary arteries with an overstretch under optical coherence tomography guidance. Stented segments were harvested 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 days post-stenting for proteomics analysis of the media and neointima.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 151 ECM and ECM-associated proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. After stent implantation, proteins involved in regulating calcification were upregulated in the neointima of drug-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elut</span></strong>ing stents. The earliest changes in the media were proteins involved in inflammation and thrombosis, followed by changes in regulatory ECM proteins. By day 28, basement membrane proteins were reduced in drug-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elut</span></strong>ing stents in comparison with bare-metal stents. In contrast, the large aggregating proteoglycan aggrecan was increased. Aggrecanases of the ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) family contribute to the catabolism of vascular proteoglycans. An increase in ADAMTS-specific aggrecan fragments was accompanied by a notable shift from <i>ADAMTS1</i> and <i>ADAMTS5</i> to <i>ADAMTS4</i> gene expression after stent implantation. Immunostaining in human stented coronary arteries confirmed the presence of aggrecan and aggrecan fragments, in particular, at the contacts of the stent struts with the artery. Further investigation of aggrecan presence in the human vasculature revealed that aggrecan and aggrecan cleavage were more abundant in human arteries than in human veins. In addition, aggrecan synthesis was induced on grafting a vein into the arterial circulation, suggesting an important role for aggrecan in vascular plasticity. Finally, lack of ADAMTS-5 activity in mice resulted in an accumulation of aggrecan and a dilation of the thoracic aorta, confirming that aggrecanase activity regulates aggrecan abundance in the arterial wall and contributes to vascular remodeling.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Significant differences were identified by proteomics in the ECM of coronary arteries after bare-metal and drug-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elut</span></strong>ing stent implantation, most notably an upregulation of aggrecan, a major ECM component of cartilaginous tissues that confers resistance to compression. The accumulation of aggrecan coincided with a shift in <i>ADAMTS</i> gene expression. This study provides the first evidence implicating aggrecan and aggrecanases in the vascular injury response after stenting.</p></sec>

Benefit of Adding Ezetimibe to Statin Therapy on Cardiovascular Outcomes and Safety in Patients With Versus Without Diabetes Mellitus
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Ezetimibe, when added to simvastatin, reduces cardiovascular events after acute coronary syndrome. We explored outcomes stratified by diabetes mellitus (DM).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In IMPROVE-IT (Improved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial), 18 144 patients after acute coronary syndrome with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 50 to 125 mg/dL were randomized to 40 mg ezetimibe/simvastatin (E/S) or 40 mg placebo/simvastatin. The primary composite end point was cardiovascular death, major coronary events, and stroke. DM was a prespecified subgroup.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The 4933 (27%) patients with DM were more often older and female, had had a prior myocardial infarction and revascularization, and presented more frequently with non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome compared with patients without DM (each <i>P</i><0.001). The median admission low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was lower among patients with DM (89 versus 97 mg/dL, <i>P</i><0.001). E/S achieved a significantly lower median time-weighted average low-density lipoprotein cholesterol compared with placebo/simvastatin, irrespective of DM (DM: 49 versus 67 mg/dL; no DM: 55 versus 71 mg/dL; both <i>P</i><0.001). In patients with DM, E/S reduced the 7-year Kaplan–Meier primary end point event rate by 5.5% absolute (hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.78-0.94); in patients without DM, the absolute difference was 0.7% (hazard ratio, 0.98; 95% confidence interval, 0.91–1.04; <i>P</i><sub>int</sub>=0.02). The largest relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ions in patients with DM were in myocardial infarction (24%) and ischemic stroke (39%). No differences in safety outcomes by treatment were present regardless of DM. When stratified further by age, patients ≥75 years of age had a 20% relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion in the primary end point regardless of DM (<i>P</i><sub>int</sub>=0.91), whereas patients <75 years of age with DM had greater benefit than those without (<i>P</i><sub>int</sub>=0.011). When stratified by the TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) Risk Score for Secondary Prevention, all patients with DM demonstrated benefit with E/S regardless of risk.

Early Use of N-acetylcysteine With Nitrate Therapy in Patients Undergoing Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention for ST-Segment–Elevation Myocardial Infarction Reduces Myocardial Infarct Size (the NACIAM Trial [N-acetylcysteine in Acute Myocardial Infarction])
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Contemporary ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction management involves primary percutaneous coronary intervention, with ongoing studies focusing on infarct size <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion using ancillary therapies. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is an antioxidant with reactive oxygen species <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scaveng</span></strong>ing properties that also potentiates the effects of nitroglycerin and thus represents a potentially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">benefici</span></strong>al ancillary therapy in primary percutaneous coronary intervention. The NACIAM trial (N-acetylcysteine in Acute Myocardial Infarction) examined the effects of NAC on infarct size in patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study evaluated the effects of intravenous high-dose NAC (29 g over 2 days) with background low-dose nitroglycerin (7.2 mg over 2 days) on early cardiac magnetic resonance imaging–assessed infarct size. Secondary end points included cardiac magnetic resonance–determined myocardial salvage and creatine kinase kinetics.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 112 randomized patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction, 75 (37 in NAC group, 38 in placebo group) underwent early cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Median duration of ischemia pretreatment was 2.4 hours. With background nitroglycerin infusion administered to all patients, those randomized to NAC exhibited an absolute 5.5% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion in cardiac magnetic resonance–assessed infarct size relative to placebo (median, 11.0%; [interquartile range 4.1, 16.3] versus 16.5%; [interquartile range 10.7, 24.2]; <i>P</i>=0.02). Myocardial salvage was approximately doubled in the NAC group (60%; interquartile range, 37–79) compared with placebo (27%; interquartile range, 14–42; <i>P</i><0.01) and median creatine kinase areas under the curve were 22 000 and 38 000 IU·h in the NAC and placebo groups, respectively (<i>P</i>=0.08).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>High-dose intravenous NAC administered with low-dose intravenous nitroglycerin is associated with reduced infarct size in patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.

Mediterranean Diet Improves High-Density Lipoprotein Function in High-Cardiovascular-Risk Individuals
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The biological functions of high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) contribute to explaining the cardioprotective role of the lipoprotein beyond quantitative HDL cholesterol levels. A few small-scale interventions with a single antioxidant have improved some HDL functions. However, to date, no long-term, large-scale, randomized controlled trial has been conducted to assess the effects of an antioxidant-rich dietary pattern (such as a traditional Mediterranean diet [TMD]) on HDL function in humans.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This study was performed in a random subsample of volunteers from the PREDIMED Study (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea; n=296) after a 1-year intervention. We compared the effects of 2 TMDs, one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enrich</span></strong>ed with virgin olive oil (TMD-VOO; n=100) and the other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enrich</span></strong>ed with nuts (TMD-Nuts; n=100), with respect to a low-fat control diet (n=96). We assessed the effects of both TMDs on the role of HDL particles on reverse cholesterol transport (cholesterol efflux capacity, HDL ability to esterify cholesterol, and cholesteryl ester transfer protein activity), HDL antioxidant properties (paraoxonase-1 arylesterase activity and total HDL antioxidant capacity on low-density lipoproteins), and HDL vasodilatory capacity (HDL ability to induce the release of nitric oxide in endothelial cells). We also studied the effects of a TMD on several HDL quality-related characteristics (HDL particle oxidation, resistance against oxidative modification, main lipid and protein composition, and size distribution).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Both TMDs increased cholesterol efflux capacity relative to baseline (<i>P</i>=0.018 and <i>P</i>=0.013 for TMD-VOO and TMD-Nuts, respectively). The TMD-VOO intervention decreased cholesteryl ester transfer protein activity (relative to baseline, <i>P</i>=0.028) and increased HDL ability to esterify cholesterol, paraoxonase-1 arylesterase activity, and HDL vasodilatory capacity (relative to control, <i>P</i>=0.039, <i>P</i>=0.012, and <i>P</i>=0.026, respectively). Adherence to a TMD induced these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">benefici</span></strong>al changes by improving HDL oxidative status and composition. The 3 diets increased the percentage of large HDL particles (relative to baseline, <i>P</i><0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The TMD, especially when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enrich</span></strong>ed with virgin olive oil, improved HDL atheroprotective functions in humans.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.controlled-trials.com</ext-link>.

Hydrogen positions in single nanocrystals revealed by electron diffraction
<p>The localization of hydrogen atoms is an essential part of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> structure analysis, but it is difficult because of their small scattering power. We report the direct localization of hydrogen atoms in nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>line materials, achieved using the recently developed approach of dynamical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">refin</span></strong>ement of precession electron diffraction tomography data. We used this method to locate hydrogen atoms in both an organic (paracetamol) and an inorganic (framework cobalt aluminophosphate) material. The results demonstrate that the technique can reliably reveal fine structural details, including the positions of hydrogen atoms in single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s with micro- to nanosized dimensions.</p>

Mechanism of Activation of Protein Kinase JAK2 by the Growth Hormone Receptor
<p>Signaling from JAK (Janus kinase) protein kinases to STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) transcription factors is key to many aspects of biology and medicine, yet the mechanism by which cytokine receptors initiate signaling is enigmatic. We present a complete mechanistic model for activation of receptor-bound JAK2, based on an archetypal cytokine receptor, the growth hormone receptor. For this, we used fluorescence resonance energy transfer to monitor positioning of the JAK2 binding motif in the receptor dimer, substitution of the receptor extracellular domains with Jun zippers to control the position of its transmembrane (TM) helices, atomistic modeling of TM helix movements, and docking of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> structures of the JAK2 kinase and its inhibitory pseudokinase domain with an opposing kinase-pseudokinase domain pair. Activation of the receptor dimer induced a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of its JAK2 binding motifs, driven by a ligand-induced transition from a parallel TM helix pair to a left-handed crossover arrangement. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation leads to removal of the pseudokinase domain from the kinase domain of the partner JAK2 and pairing of the two kinase domains, facilitating trans-activation. This model may well generalize to other class I cytokine receptors.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Identification of a Hexenal Reductase That Modulates the Composition of Green Leaf Volatiles
<p>Green leaf volatiles (GLVs), including six-carbon (C6) aldehydes, alcohols, and esters, are formed when plant tissues are damaged. GLVs play roles in direct plant defense at wound sites, indirect plant defense via the attraction of herbivore predators, and plant-plant communication. GLV components provoke distinctive responses in their target recipients; therefore, the control of GLV composition is important for plants to appropriately manage stress responses. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion of C6-aldehydes into C6-alcohols is a key step in the control of GLV composition and also is important to avoid a toxic buildup of C6-aldehydes. However, the molecular mechanisms behind C6-aldehyde <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion remain poorly understood. In this study, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">purifi</span></strong>ed an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) NADPH-dependent cinnamaldehyde and hexenal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ase encoded by At4g37980, named here CINNAMALDEHYDE AND HEXENAL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ASE (CHR). <i>CHR</i> T-DNA knockout mutant plants displayed a normal growth phenotype; however, we observed significant suppression of C6-alcohol production following partial mechanical wounding or herbivore infestation. Our data also showed that the parasitic wasp <i>Cotesia vestalis</i> was more attracted to GLVs emitted from herbivore-infested wild-type plants compared with GLVs emitted from <i>chr</i> plants, which corresponded with reduced C6-alcohol levels in the mutant. Moreover, <i>chr</i> plants were more susceptible to exogenous high-dose exposure to (<i>Z</i>)-3-hexenal, as indicated by their markedly lowered photosystem II activity. Our study shows that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ases play significant roles in changing GLV composition and, thus, are important in avoiding toxicity from volatile carbonyls and in the attraction of herbivore predators.</p>

Biochemical and Structural Analysis of Substrate Specificity of a Phenylalanine Ammonia-Lyase
<p>Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) is the first enzyme of the general phenylpropanoid pathway catalyzing the nonoxidative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elimin</span></strong>ation of ammonia from <sc>l</sc>-phenylalanine to give <i>trans</i>-cinnamate. In monocots, PAL also displays tyrosine ammonia lyase (TAL) activity, leading to the formation of <i>p</i>-coumaric acid. The catalytic mechanism and substrate specificity of a major PAL from sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>; SbPAL1), a strategic plant for bioenergy production, were deduced from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> structures, molecular docking, site-directed mutagenesis, and kinetic and thermodynamic analyses. This first <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> structure of a monocotyledonous PAL displayed a unique conformation in its flexible inner loop of the 4-methylidene-imidazole-5-one (MIO) domain compared with that of dicotyledonous plants. The side chain of histidine-123 in the MIO domain dictated the distance between the catalytic MIO prosthetic group created from <sup>189</sup>Ala-Ser-Gly<sup>191</sup> residues and the bound <sc>l</sc>-phenylalanine and <sc>l</sc>-tyrosine, conferring the deamination reaction through either the Friedel-Crafts or E<sub>2</sub> reaction mechanism. Several recombinant mutant SbPAL1 enzymes were generated via structure-guided mutagenesis, one of which, H123F-SbPAL1, has 6.2 times greater PAL activity without significant TAL activity. Additional PAL isozymes of sorghum were characterized and categorized into three groups. Taken together, this approach identified critical residues and explained substrate preferences among PAL isozymes in sorghum and other monocots, which can serve as the basis for the engineering of plants with enhanced biomass conversion properties, disease resistance, or nutritional quality.</p>

Chlorophyll Can Be Reduced in Crop Canopies with Little Penalty to Photosynthesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The hypothesis that reducing chlorophyll content (Chl) can increase canopy photosynthesis in soybeans was tested using an advanced model of canopy photosynthesis. The relationship among leaf Chl, leaf optical properties, and photosynthetic biochemical capacity was measured in 67 soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) accessions showing large variation in leaf Chl. These relationships were integrated into a biophysical model of canopy-scale photosynthesis to simulate the intercanopy light environment and carbon assimilation capacity of canopies with wild type, a Chl-deficient mutant (<i>Y11y11</i>), and 67 other mutants spanning the extremes of Chl to quantify the impact of variation in leaf-level Chl on canopy-scale photosynthetic assimilation and identify possible opportunities for improving canopy photosynthesis through Chl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion. These simulations demonstrate that canopy photosynthesis should not increase with Chl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion due to increases in leaf reflectance and nonoptimal distribution of canopy nitrogen. However, similar rates of canopy photosynthesis can be maintained with a 9% savings in leaf nitrogen resulting from decreased Chl. Additionally, analysis of these simulations indicate that the inability of Chl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ions to increase photosynthesis arises primarily from the connection between Chl and leaf reflectance and secondarily from the mismatch between the vertical distribution of leaf nitrogen and the light absorption profile. These simulations suggest that future work should explore the possibility of using reduced Chl to improve canopy performance by adapting the distribution of the “saved” nitrogen within the canopy to take greater advantage of the more deeply penetrating light.</p>

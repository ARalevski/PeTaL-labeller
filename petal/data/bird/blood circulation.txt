Association Between Urinary Sodium and Potassium Excretion and Blood Pressure Among Adults in the United States
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Higher levels of sodium and lower levels of potassium intake are associated with higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure. However, the shape and magnitude of these associations can vary by study participant characteristics or intake assessment method. Twenty-four–hour urinary excretion of sodium and potassium are unaffected by recall errors and represent all sources of intake, and were collected for the first time in a nationally representative US survey. Our objective was to assess the associations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure and hypertension with 24-hour urinary excretion of sodium and potassium among US adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Cross-sectional data were obtained from 766 participants age 20 to 69 years with complete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure and 24-hour urine collections in the 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a nationally representative survey of the US noninstitutionalized population. Usual 24-hour urinary electrolyte excretion (sodium, potassium, and their ratio) was estimated from ≤2 collections on nonconsecutive days, adjusting for day-to-day variability in excretion. Outcomes included systolic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure from the average of 3 measures and hypertension status, based on average <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure ≥140/90 and antihypertensive medication use.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>After multivariable adjustment, each 1000-mg difference in usual 24-hour sodium excretion was directly associated with systolic (4.58 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.64–6.51) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic (2.25 mm Hg; 95% CI, 0.83–3.67) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressures. Each 1000-mg difference in potassium excretion was inversely associated with systolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure (–3.72 mm Hg; 95% CI, –6.01 to –1.42). Each 0.5 U difference in sodium-to-potassium ratio was directly associated with systolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure (1.72 mm Hg; 95% CI, 0.76–2.68). Hypertension was linearly associated with progressively higher sodium and lower potassium excretion; in comparison with the lowest quartile of excretion, the adjusted odds of hypertension for the highest quartile was 4.22 (95% CI, 1.36–13.15) for sodium, and 0.38 (95% CI, 0.17–0.87) for potassium (<i>P</i><0.01 for trends).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These cross-sectional results show a strong dose-response association between urinary sodium excretion and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure, and an inverse association between urinary potassium excretion and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure, in a nationally representative sample of US adults.</p></sec>

Day-to-Day Blood Pressure Variability and Risk of Dementia in a General Japanese Elderly Population
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Several observational studies have reported that higher visit-to-visit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure variability is a risk factor for cognitive impairment and dementia. However, no studies have investigated the association of day-to-day <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure variability assessed by home <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure measurement with the development of dementia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A total of 1674 community-dwelling Japanese elderly without dementia, ≥60 years of age, were followed up for 5 years (2007–2012). Home <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure was measured 3 times every morning for a median of 28 days. Day-to-day systolic (SBP) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure variabilities, calculated as coefficients of variation (CoV) of home SBP and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure, were categorized into quartiles. The hazard ratios and their 95% confidence intervals of the CoV levels of home <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure on the development of all-cause dementia, vascular dementia (VaD), and Alzheimer disease (AD) were computed with a Cox proportional hazards model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>During the follow-up, 194 subjects developed all-cause dementia; of these, 47 had VaD and 134 had AD. The age- and sex-adjusted incidences of all-cause dementia, VaD, and AD increased significantly with increasing CoV levels of home SBP (all <i>P</i> for trend <0.05). These associations remained unchanged after adjustment for potential confounding factors, including home SBP. Compared with subjects in the first quartile of CoV levels of home SBP, the risks of the development of all-cause dementia, VaD, and AD were significantly higher in those in the fourth quartile (hazard ratio=2.27, 95% confidence interval=1.45–3.55, <i>P</i><0.001 for all-cause dementia; hazard ratio=2.79, 95% confidence interval=1.04–7.51, <i>P</i>=0.03 for VaD; hazard ratio=2.22, 95% confidence interval=1.31–3.75, <i>P</i><0.001 for AD). Similar associations were observed for CoV levels of home <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure. Meanwhile, home SBP levels were significantly associated with the risk of VaD but not with the risks of all-cause dementia and AD. There was no interaction between home SBP levels and CoV levels of home SBP on the risk of each subtype of dementia.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings suggest that increased day-to-day <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure variability is, independently of average home <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure, a significant risk factor for the development of all-cause dementia, VaD, and AD in the general elderly Japanese population.</p></sec>

A PLCγ1-Dependent, Force-Sensitive Signaling Network in the Myogenic Constriction of Cerebral Arteries
<sec><title>Maintaining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> Flow to the Brain</title><p>Cerebral arteries continually adjust to changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure to ensure constant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> flow to the brain. In response to increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure, the smooth muscle cells in cerebral arteries contract, resulting in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> vessel constriction. This response requires two cell surface ion channels—TRPC6, a channel that is activated by the stretch caused by increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure, and TRPM4, a channel that triggers the electrical impulses necessary for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> vessel constriction. Gonzales <i>et al.</i> found that activation of TRPC6 stimulated TRPM4 through calcium-dependent pathways. TRPC6, TRPM4, and the enzyme PLCγ1 were located in close proximity to each other in smooth muscle cells, indicating that a pressure-sensitive signaling network keeps <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> flowing in the brain.</p></sec>

MicroRNA-93 Controls Perfusion Recovery After Hindlimb Ischemia by Modulating Expression of Multiple Genes in the Cell Cycle Pathway
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>MicroRNAs are key regulators of gene expression in response to injury, but there is limited knowledge of their role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong>-induced angiogenesis, such as in peripheral arterial disease. Here, we used an unbiased strategy and took advantage of different phenotypic outcomes that follow surgically induced hindlimb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong> between inbred mouse strains to identify key microRNAs involved in perfusion recovery from hindlimb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>From comparative microRNA profiling between inbred mouse strains that display profound differences in their extent of perfusion recovery after hindlimb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong>, we found that the mouse strain with higher levels of microRNA-93 (miR-93) in hindlimb muscle before <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong> and the greater ability to upregulate miR-93 in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong> had better perfusion recovery. In vitro, overexpression of miR-93 attenuated hypoxia-induced apoptosis in both endothelial and skeletal muscle cells and enhanced proliferation in both cell types.

Patients received either   100 ml saline (placebo, n = 27), or 100 ml saline together with   1000 mg of tranexamic acid (TXA, n = 27) intravenously prior to   skin incision and during wound closure. Peri-operative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> loss   via an intra-articular drain was recorded and total <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> loss was   calculated. The post-operative transfusion rate was documented.   Assessment of early clinical parameters included the visual analogue   scale for pain (VAS), documentation of haematoma formation and adverse events.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Mean peri-operative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> drainage (placebo: 170 ml <i>versus</i> TXA:   50 ml, p = 0.001) and calculated mean total <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> loss (placebo:   1248.2 ml <i>versus</i> TXA: 871.0 ml, p = 0.009) were   significantly lower in the TXA group. No transfusions were necessary   during the study period in either group. Mean VAS for pain significantly   decreased from pre-operative (VAS 7) to the early post-operative   period (VAS 1.7, p < 0.001). Significant differences regarding   mean post-operative pain between placebo (VAS 2.0) and TXA (VAS   1.3) were detected (p = 0.05). The occurrence of haematomas was   significantly more frequent in the placebo (59.3%, n = 16) than   in the TXA group (25.9%, n = 6, p = 0.027).

Bmal1 in Perivascular Adipose Tissue Regulates Resting-Phase Blood Pressure Through Transcriptional Regulation of Angiotensinogen
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) surrounding vessels constitutes a distinct functional integral layer of the vasculature required to preserve vascular tone under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical conditions. However, there is little information on the relationship between PVAT and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure regulation, including its potential contributions to circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure variation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using unique brown adipocyte–specific aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like protein 1 (Bmal1) and angiotensinogen knockout mice, we determined the vasoactivity of homogenized PVAT in aortic rings and how brown adipocyte peripheral expression of Bmal1 and angiotensinogen in PVAT regulates the amplitude of diurnal change in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure in mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We uncovered a peripheral clock in PVAT and demonstrated that loss of Bmal1 in PVAT reduces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure in mice during the resting phase, leading to a superdipper phenotype. PVAT extracts from wild-type mice significantly induced contractility of isolated aortic rings in vitro in an endothelium-independent manner. This property was impaired in PVAT from brown adipocyte–selective Bmal1-deficient (BA-Bmal1-KO) mice. The PVAT contractile properties were mediated by local angiotensin II, operating through angiotensin II type 1 receptor–dependent signaling in the isolated vessels and linked to PVAT circadian regulation of angiotensinogen. Indeed, angiotensinogen mRNA and angiotensin II levels in PVAT of BA-Bmal1-KO mice were significantly reduced. Systemic infusion of angiotensin II, in turn, reduced Bmal1 expression in PVAT while eliminating the hypotensive phenotype during the resting phase in BA-Bmal1-KO mice. Angiotensinogen, highly expressed in PVAT, shows circadian expression in PVAT, and selective deletion of angiotensinogen in brown adipocytes recapitulates the phenotype of selective deletion of Bmal1 in brown adipocytes. Furthermore, angiotensinogen is a transcriptional target of Bmal1 in PVAT.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These data indicate that local Bmal1 in PVAT regulates angiotensinogen expression and the ensuing increase in angiotensin II, which acts on smooth muscle cells in the vessel walls to regulate vasoactivity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure in a circadian fashion during the resting phase. These findings will contribute to a better understanding of the cardiovascular complications of circadian disorders, alterations in the circadian dipping phenotype, and cross-talk between systemic and peripheral regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure.</p></sec>

Contemporary Assessment of Left Ventricular Diastolic Function in Older Adults

We also determined sex-specific 10th and 90th percentile limits for these measures using quantile regression in 401 participants free of prevalent cardiovascular disease and risk factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Each measure of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic function was robustly associated with N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide and incident HF or death. ARIC-based reference limits for TDI e’ (4.6 and 5.2 cm/s for septal and lateral TDI e’, respectively) were substantially lower than guideline cut points (7 and 10 cm/s, respectively), whereas E/e’ and left atrial size demonstrated good agreement with guideline cut points. TDI e’ was nonlinearly associated with incident HF or death, with inflection points for risk supportive of ARIC-based limits. ARIC-based limits for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic function improved risk discrimination over guideline-based cut points based on the integrated discrimination improvement (<i>P</i><0.001) and continuous net reclassification improvement (<i>P</i><0.001), reclassifying 42% of the study population as having normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic function. We replicate these findings in the Copenhagen City Heart Study. With these limits, 46% had normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic function and were at low risk of HF hospitalization or death (1%/y over a mean 1.7-year follow-up), 49% had 1 or 2 abnormal measures and were at intermediate risk (2.4%/y), and all 3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic measures were abnormal in 5% who were at high risk (7.5%/y).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings suggest that left ventricular longitudinal relaxation velocity declines as a part of healthy aging and is largely prognostically benign.

Point-of-Care Hemostatic Testing in Cardiac Surgery
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac surgery is frequently complicated by coagulopathic bleeding that is difficult to optimally manage using standard hemostatic testing. We hypothesized that point-of-care hemostatic testing within the context of an integrated transfusion algorithm would improve the management of coagulopathy in cardiac surgery and thereby reduce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> transfusions.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a pragmatic multicenter stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial of a point-of-care–based transfusion algorithm in consecutive patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass at 12 hospitals from October 6, 2014, to May 1, 2015. Following a 1-month data collection at all participating hospitals, a transfusion algorithm incorporating point-of-care hemostatic testing was sequentially implemented at 2 hospitals at a time in 1-month intervals, with the implementation order randomly assigned. No other aspects of care were modified. The primary outcome was red <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> cell transfusion from surgery to postoperative day 7. Other outcomes included transfusion of other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> products, major bleeding, and major complications. The analysis adjusted for secular time trends, within-hospital clustering, and patient-level risk factors. All outcomes and analyses were prespecified before study initiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among the 7402 patients studied, 3555 underwent surgery during the control phase and 3847 during the intervention phase. Overall, 3329 (45.0%) received red <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> cells, 1863 (25.2%) received platelets, 1645 (22.2%) received plasma, and 394 (5.3%) received cryoprecipitate.

Physiology of Angina and Its Alleviation With Nitroglycerin
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The mechanisms governing exercise-induced angina and its alleviation by the most commonly used antianginal drug, nitroglycerin, are incompletely understood. The purpose of this study was to develop a method by which the effects of antianginal drugs could be evaluated invasively during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical exercise to gain further understanding of the clinical impact of angina and nitroglycerin.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Forty patients (mean age, 65.2±7.6 years) with exertional angina and coronary artery disease underwent cardiac catheterization via radial access and performed incremental exercise using a supine cycle ergometer. As they developed limiting angina, sublingual nitroglycerin was administered to half the patients, and all patients continued to exercise for 2 minutes at the same workload. Throughout exercise, distal coronary pressure and flow velocity and central aortic pressure were recorded with sensor wires.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Patients continued to exercise after nitroglycerin administration with less ST-segment depression (<i>P</i>=0.003) and therefore myocardial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong>. Significant reductions in afterload (aortic pressure, <i>P</i>=0.030) and myocardial oxygen demand were seen (tension-time index, <i>P</i>=0.024; rate-pressure product, <i>P</i>=0.046), as well as an increase in myocardial oxygen supply (Buckberg index, <i>P</i>=0.017). Exercise reduced peripheral arterial wave reflection (<i>P</i><0.05), which was not further augmented by the administration of nitroglycerin (<i>P</i>=0.648). The observed increases in coronary pressure gradient, stenosis resistance, and flow velocity did not reach statistical significance; however, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic velocity–pressure gradient relation was consistent with a significant increase in relative stenosis severity (k coefficient, <i>P</i><0.0001), in keeping with exercise-induced vasoconstriction of stenosed epicardial segments and dilatation of normal segments, with trends toward reversal with nitroglycerin.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The catheterization laboratory protocol provides a model to study myocardial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong> and the actions of novel and established antianginal drugs. Administration of nitroglycerin causes changes in the systemic and coronary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circul</span></strong>ation that combine to reduce myocardial oxygen demand and to increase supply, thereby attenuating exercise-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong>. Designing antianginal therapies that exploit these mechanisms may provide new therapeutic strategies.</p></sec>

Restoration of Hydrogen Sulfide Production in Diabetic Mice Improves Reparative Function of Bone Marrow Cells
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Bone marrow cell (BMC)–based treatment for critical limb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong> in diabetic patients yielded a modest therapeutic effect resulting from cell dysfunction. Therefore, approaches that improve diabetic stem/progenitor cell functions may provide therapeutic benefits. Here, we tested the hypothesis that restoration of hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) production in diabetic BMCs improves their reparative capacities.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Mouse BMCs were isolated by density-gradient centrifugation. Unilateral hind limb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong> was conducted in 12- to 14-week-old db/+ and db/db mice by ligation of the left femoral artery. The H<sub>2</sub>S level was measured by either gas chromatography or staining with florescent dye sulfidefluor 7 <sc>AM</sc>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Both H<sub>2</sub>S production and cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE), an H<sub>2</sub>S enzyme, levels were significantly decreased in BMCs from diabetic db/db mice. Administration of H<sub>2</sub>S donor diallyl trisulfide (DATS) or overexpression of CSE restored H<sub>2</sub>S production and enhanced cell survival and migratory capacity in high glucose (HG)–treated BMCs. Immediately after hind limb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong> surgery, the db/+ and db/db mice were administered DATS orally and/or given a local intramuscular injection of green fluorescent protein–labeled BMCs or red fluorescent protein–CSE–overexpressing BMCs (CSE-BMCs). Mice with hind limb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong> were divided into 6 groups: db/+, db/db, db/db+BMCs, db/db+DATS, db/db+DATS+BMCs, and db/db+CSE-BMCs. DATS and CSE overexpression greatly enhanced diabetic BMC retention in ischemic hind limbs followed by improved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> perfusion, capillary/arteriole density, skeletal muscle architecture, and cell survival and decreased perivascular CD68<sup>+</sup> cell infiltration in the ischemic hind limbs of diabetic mice. It is interesting to note that DATS or CSE overexpression rescued high glucose–impaired migration, tube formation, and survival of BMCs or mature human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells. Moreover, DATS restored nitric oxide production and decreased endothelial nitric oxide synthase phosphorylation at threonine 495 levels in human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells and improved BMC angiogenic activity under high glucose condition. Last, silencing CSE by siRNA significantly increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase phosphorylation at threonine 495 levels in human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Decreased CSE-mediated H<sub>2</sub>S bioavailability is an underlying source of BMC dysfunction in diabetes mellitus. Our data indicate that H<sub>2</sub>S and overexpression of CSE in diabetic BMCs may rescue their dysfunction and open novel avenues for cell-based therapeutics of critical limb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong> in diabetic patients.</p></sec>

We report the influence of adherence to antihypertensive treatment on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure control.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>One hundred six patients with hypertension resistant to 4 weeks of treatment with indapamide 1.5 mg/d, ramipril 10 mg/d (or irbesartan 300 mg/d), and amlodipine 10 mg/d were randomly assigned to renal denervation plus standardized stepped-care antihypertensive treatment, or the same antihypertensive treatment alone. For standardized stepped-care antihypertensive treatment, spironolactone 25 mg/d, bisoprolol 10 mg/d, prazosin 5 mg/d, and rilmenidine 1 mg/d were sequentially added at monthly visits if home <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure was ≥135/85 mm Hg after randomization. We assessed adherence to antihypertensive treatment at 6 months by drug screening in urine/plasma samples from 85 patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The numbers of fully adherent (20/40 versus 21/45), partially nonadherent (13/40 versus 20/45), or completely nonadherent patients (7/40 versus 4/45) to antihypertensive treatment were not different in the renal denervation and the control groups, respectively (<i>P</i>=0.3605). The difference in the change in daytime ambulatory systolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure from baseline to 6 months between the 2 groups was –6.7 mm Hg (<i>P</i>=0.0461) in fully adherent and –7.8 mm Hg (<i>P</i>=0.0996) in nonadherent (partially nonadherent plus completely nonadherent) patients.

Experimentally Increasing Titin Compliance in a Novel Mouse Model Attenuates the Frank-Starling Mechanism But Has a Beneficial Effect on Diastole
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Experimentally upregulating compliant titins has been suggested as a therapeutic for lowering pathological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic stiffness levels. However, how increasing titin compliance impacts global cardiac function requires in-depth study. We investigate the effect of upregulating compliant titins in a novel mouse model with a genetically altered titin splicing factor; integrative approaches were used from intact cardiomyocyte mechanics to pressure-volume analysis and Doppler echocardiography.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Compliant titins were upregulated through deletion of the RNA Recognition Motif of the splicing factor RBM20 (<i>Rbm20</i><sup><i>ΔRRM</i></sup>mice). A genome-wide exon expression analysis and a candidate approach revealed that the phenotype is likely to be dominated by greatly increased lengths of titin’s spring elements. At both cardiomyocyte and left ventricular chamber levels, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic stiffness was reduced in heterozygous (+/−) <i>Rbm20</i><sup><i>ΔRRM</i></sup>mice with a further reduction in homozygous (−/−) mice at only the intact myocyte level. Fibrosis was present in only −/− <i>Rbm20</i><sup><i>ΔRRM</i></sup> hearts. The Frank-Starling Mechanism was reduced in a graded fashion in <i>Rbm20</i><sup><i>ΔRRM</i></sup> mice, at both the cardiomyocyte and left ventricular chamber levels. Exercise tests revealed an increase in exercise capacity in +/− mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Titin is not only important in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic but also in systolic cardiac function. Upregulating compliant titins reduces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic chamber stiffness owing to the increased compliance of myocytes, but it depresses end-systolic elastance; under conditions of exercise, the beneficial effects on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic function dominate.

The microRNA miR-7a-5p ameliorates ischemic brain damage by repressing α-synuclein
<p>Ischemic stroke, which is caused by a clot that blocks <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> flow to the brain, can be severely disabling and sometimes fatal. We previously showed that transient focal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong> in a rat model induces extensive temporal changes in the expression of cerebral microRNAs, with a sustained decrease in the abundance of miR-7a-5p (miR-7). Here, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of a miR-7 mimic oligonucleotide after cerebral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong> in rodents according to the Stroke Treatment Academic Industry Roundtable (STAIR) criteria. Rodents were injected locally or systemically with miR-7 mimic before or after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. Decreased miR-7 expression was observed in both young and aged rats of both sexes after cerebral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong>. Pre- or postischemic treatment with miR-7 mimic decreased the lesion volume in both sexes and ages studied. Furthermore, systemic injection of miR-7 mimic into mice at 30 min (but not 2 hours) after cerebral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong> substantially decreased the lesion volume and improved motor and cognitive functional recovery with minimal peripheral toxicity. The miR-7 mimic treatment substantially reduced the postischemic induction of α-synuclein (α-Syn), a protein that induces mitochondrial fragmentation, oxidative stress, and autophagy that promote neuronal cell death. Deletion of the gene encoding α-Syn abolished miR-7 mimic–dependent neuroprotection and functional recovery in young male mice. Further analysis confirmed that the transcript encoding α-Syn was bound and repressed by miR-7. Our findings suggest that miR-7 mimics may therapeutically minimize stroke-induced brain damage and disability.</p>

Networks of enzymatically oxidized membrane lipids support calcium-dependent coagulation factor binding to maintain hemostasis
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> coagulation functions as part of the innate immune system by preventing bacterial invasion, and it is critical to stopping <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> loss (hemostasis). Coagulation involves the external membrane surface of activated platelets and leukocytes. Using lipidomic, genetic, biochemical, and mathematical modeling approaches, we found that enzymatically oxidized phospholipids (eoxPLs) generated by the activity of leukocyte or platelet lipoxygenases (LOXs) were required for normal hemostasis and promoted coagulation factor activities in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and phosphatidylserine (PS)–dependent manner. In wild-type mice, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid–phospholipids (HETE-PLs) enhanced coagulation and restored normal hemostasis in clotting-deficient animals genetically lacking p12-LOX or 12/15-LOX activity. Murine platelets generated 22 eoxPL species, all of which were missing in the absence of p12-LOX. Humans with the thrombotic disorder antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) had statistically significantly increased HETE-PLs in platelets and leukocytes, as well as greater HETE-PL immunoreactivity, than healthy controls. HETE-PLs enhanced membrane binding of the serum protein β2GP1 (β2-glycoprotein 1), an event considered central to the autoimmune reactivity responsible for APS symptoms. Correlation network analysis of 47 platelet eoxPL species in platelets from APS and control subjects identified their enzymatic origin and revealed a complex network of regulation, with the abundance of 31 p12-LOX–derived eoxPL molecules substantially increased in APS. In summary, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circul</span></strong>ating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> cells generate networks of eoxPL molecules, including HETE-PLs, which change membrane properties to enhance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> coagulation and contribute to the excessive clotting and immunoreactivity of patients with APS.</p>

A cluster of immunoresolvents links coagulation to innate host defense in human blood
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> coagulation is a protective response that prevents excessive bleeding upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> vessel injury. We investigated the relationship between coagulation and the resolution of inflammation and infection by lipid mediators (LMs) through metabololipidomics-based profiling of human whole <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> (WB) during coagulation. We identified temporal clusters of endogenously produced prothrombotic and proinflammatory LMs (eicosanoids), as well as specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs). In addition to eicosanoids, a specific SPM cluster was identified that consisted of resolvin E1 (RvE1), RvD1, RvD5, lipoxin B<sub>4</sub>, and maresin 1, each of which was present at bioactive concentrations (0.1 to 1 nM). Removal of adenosine from the coagulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> markedly enhanced the amounts of SPMs produced and further increased the biosynthesis of RvD3, RvD4, and RvD6. The cyclooxygenase inhibitors celecoxib and indomethacin, which block the production of thromboxanes and prostanoids, did not block the production of clot-driven SPMs. Unbiased mass cytometry analysis demonstrated that the SPM cluster produced in human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> targeted leukocytes at the single-cell level, directly activating ERK and CREB signaling in neutrophils and CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes. Treatment of human WB with the components of this SPM cluster enhanced both the phagocytosis and killing of <i>Escherichia coli</i> by leukocytes. Together, these data identify a proresolving LM circuit, including endogenous molecular brakes and accelerators, which promoted host defense. These temporal LM-SPM clusters can provide accessible metabolomic profiles for precision and personalized medicine.</p>

Gene expression profiles of brain endothelial cells during embryonic development at bulk and single-cell levels
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong>-brain barrier is a dynamic interface that separates the brain from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circul</span></strong>atory system, and it is formed by highly specialized endothelial cells. To explore the molecular mechanisms defining the unique nature of vascular development and differentiation in the brain, we generated high-resolution gene expression profiles of mouse embryonic brain endothelial cells using translating ribosome affinity purification and single-cell RNA sequencing. We compared the brain vascular translatome with the vascular translatomes of other organs and analyzed the vascular translatomes of the brain at different time points during embryonic development. Because canonical Wnt signaling is implicated in the formation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong>-brain barrier, we also compared the brain endothelial translatome of wild-type mice with that of mice lacking the transcriptional cofactor β-catenin (<i>Ctnnb1</i>). Our analysis revealed extensive molecular changes during the embryonic development of the brain endothelium. We identified genes encoding brain endothelium–specific transcription factors (<i>Foxf2</i>, <i>Foxl2</i>, <i>Foxq1</i>, <i>Lef1</i>, <i>Ppard</i>, <i>Zfp551</i>, and <i>Zic3</i>) that are associated with maturation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong>-brain barrier and act downstream of the Wnt–β-catenin signaling pathway. Profiling of individual brain endothelial cells revealed substantial heterogeneity in the population. Nevertheless, the high abundance of <i>Foxf2</i>, <i>Foxq1</i>, <i>Ppard</i>, or <i>Zic3</i> transcripts correlated with the increased expression of genes encoding markers of brain endothelial cell differentiation. Expression of <i>Foxf2</i> and <i>Zic3</i> in human umbilical vein endothelial cells induced the production of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong>-brain barrier differentiation markers. This comprehensive data set may help to improve the engineering of in vitro <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong>-brain barrier models.</p>

Perivascular dendritic cells elicit anaphylaxis by relaying allergens to mast cells via microvesicles
<p>Anaphylactic reactions are triggered when allergens enter the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circul</span></strong>ation and activate immunoglobulin E (IgE)–sensitized mast cells (MCs), causing systemic discharge of prestored proinflammatory mediators. As MCs are extravascular, how they perceive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circul</span></strong>ating allergens remains a conundrum. Here, we describe the existence of a CD301b<sup>+</sup> perivascular dendritic cell (DC) subset that continuously samples <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> and relays antigens to neighboring MCs, which vigorously degranulate and trigger anaphylaxis. DC antigen transfer involves the active discharge of surface-associated antigens on 0.5- to 1.0-micrometer microvesicles (MVs) generated by vacuolar protein sorting 4 (VPS4). Antigen sharing by DCs is not limited to MCs, as neighboring DCs also acquire antigen-bearing MVs. This capacity of DCs to distribute antigen-bearing MVs to various immune cells in the perivascular space potentiates inflammatory and immune responses to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong>-borne antigens.</p>

Elevated carboxyhemoglobin in a marine mammal, the northern elephant seal
<p>Low concentrations of endogenous carbon monoxide (CO), generated primarily through degradation of heme from heme-proteins, have been shown to maintain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical function of organs and to exert cytoprotective effects. However, high concentrations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carboxyhemoglobin</span></strong> (COHb), formed by CO binding to hemoglobin, potentially prevent adequate O<sub>2</sub> delivery to tissues by lowering arterial O<sub>2</sub> content. Elevated heme-protein concentrations, as found in marine mammals, are likely associated with greater heme degradation, more endogenous CO production and, consequently, elevated COHb concentrations. Therefore, we measured COHb in elephant seals, a species with large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> volumes and elevated hemoglobin and myoglobin concentrations. The levels of COHb were positively related to the total hemoglobin concentration. The maximum COHb value was 10.4% of total hemoglobin concentration. The mean (±s.e.m.) value in adult seals was 8.7±0.3% (<i>N</i>=6), while juveniles and pups (with lower heme-protein contents) had lower mean COHb values of 7.6±0.2% and 7.1±0.3%, respectively (<i>N</i>=9 and <i>N</i>=9, respectively). Serial samples over several hours revealed little to no fluctuation in COHb values. This consistent elevation in COHb suggests that the magnitude and/or rate of heme-protein turnover is much higher than in terrestrial mammals. The maximum COHb values from this study decrease total body O<sub>2</sub> stores by 7%, thereby reducing the calculated aerobic dive limit for this species. However, the constant presence of elevated CO in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> may also protect against potential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong>–reperfusion injury associated with the extreme breath-holds of elephant seals. We suggest the elephant seal represents an ideal model for understanding the potential cytoprotective effects, mechanisms of action and evolutionary adaptation associated with chronically elevated concentrations of endogenously produced CO.</p>

Mental Stress–Induced-Myocardial Ischemia in Young Patients With Recent Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Mental stress-induced myocardial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong> (MSIMI) is frequent in patients with coronary artery disease and is associated with worse prognosis. Young women with a previous myocardial infarction (MI), a group with unexplained higher mortality than men of comparable age, have shown elevated rates of MSIMI, but the mechanisms are unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied 306 patients (150 women and 156 men) ≤61 years of age who were hospitalized for MI in the previous 8 months and 112 community controls (58 women and 54 men) frequency matched for sex and age to the patients with MI. Endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilation and microvascular reactivity (reactive hyperemia index) were measured at rest and 30 minutes after mental stress. The digital vasomotor response to mental stress was assessed using peripheral arterial tonometry. Patients received <sup>99m</sup>Tc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging at rest, with mental (speech task) and conventional (exercise/pharmacological) stress.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean age of the sample was 50 years (range, 22–61). In the MI group but not among controls, women had a more adverse socioeconomic and psychosocial profile than men. There were no sex differences in cardiovascular risk factors, and among patients with MI, clinical severity tended to be lower in women. Women in both groups showed a higher peripheral arterial tonometry ratio during mental stress but a lower reactive hyperemia index after mental stress, indicating enhanced microvascular dysfunction after stress. There were no sex differences in flow-mediated dilation changes with mental stress. The rate of MSIMI was twice as high in women as in men (22% versus 11%, <i>P</i>=0.009), and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong> with conventional stress was similarly elevated (31% versus 16%, <i>P</i>=0.002). Psychosocial and clinical risk factors did not explain sex differences in inducible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong>. Although vascular responses to mental stress (peripheral arterial tonometry ratio and reactive hyperemia index) also did not explain sex differences in MSIMI, they were predictive of MSIMI in women only.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Young women after MI have a 2-fold likelihood of developing MSIMI compared with men and a similar increase in conventional stress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong>. Microvascular dysfunction and peripheral vasoconstriction with mental stress are implicated in MSIMI among women but not among men, perhaps reflecting women’s proclivity toward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong> because of micro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circul</span></strong>atory abnormalities.</p></sec>

Prognostic Value of Follow-Up Hemodynamic Variables After Initial Management in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemodynam</span></strong>ic variables such as cardiac index and right atrial pressure have consistently been associated with survival in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) at the time of diagnosis. Recent studies have suggested that pulmonary arterial compliance may also predict prognosis in PAH. The prognostic importance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemodynam</span></strong>ic values achieved after treatment initiation is less well established.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Our objective was to evaluate the prognostic importance of clinical and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemodynam</span></strong>ic variables during follow-up, including pulmonary arterial compliance, after initial management in PAH. We evaluated incident patients with idiopathic, drug- and toxin-induced, or heritable PAH enrolled in the French pulmonary hypertension registry between 2006 and 2016 who had a follow-up right-sided heart catheterization (RHC). The primary outcome was death or lung transplantation. We used stepwise Cox regression and the Kaplan-Meier method to assess variables obtained at baseline and at first follow-up RHC.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 981 patients, a primary outcome occurred in 331 patients (33.7%) over a median follow-up duration of 2.8 years (interquartile range, 1.1–4.6 years). In a multivariable model considering only baseline variables, no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemodynam</span></strong>ic variables independently predicted prognosis. Median time to first follow-up RHC was 4.6 months (interquartile range, 3.7–7.8 months). At first follow-up RHC (n=763), New York Heart Association functional class, 6-minute walk distance, stroke volume index (SVI), and right atrial pressure were independently associated with death or lung transplantation, adjusted for age, sex, and type of PAH. Pulmonary arterial compliance did not independently predict outcomes at baseline or during follow-up. The adjusted hazard ratio for SVI was 1.28 (95% confidence interval, 1.11–1.49; <i>P</i><0.01) per 10-mL/m<sup>2</sup> decrease and for right atrial pressure was 1.05 (95% confidence interval, 1.02–1.09; <i>P</i><0.01) per 1–mm Hg increase. Among patients who had 2 (n=355) or 3 (n=193) low-risk prognostic features at follow-up, including a cardiac index ≥2.5 L·min<sup>−1</sup>·m<sup>−2</sup>, 6-minute walk distance >440 m, and New York Heart Association class I or II functional class, lower SVI was still associated with higher rates of death or lung transplantation (<i>P</i><0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>SVI and right atrial pressure were the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemodynam</span></strong>ic variables that were independently associated with death or lung transplantation at first follow-up RHC after initial PAH treatment. These findings suggest that the SVI could be a more appropriate treatment target than cardiac index in PAH.</p></sec>

Association Between Diastolic Blood Pressure During Pediatric In-Hospital Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Survival
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>On the basis of laboratory cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) investigations and limited adult data demonstrating that survival depends on attaining adequate arterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure (DBP) during CPR, the American Heart Association recommends using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure to guide pediatric CPR. However, evidence-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure targets during pediatric CPR remain an important knowledge gap for CPR guidelines.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>All children ≥37 weeks’ gestation and <19 years old in Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network intensive care units with chest compressions for ≥1 minute and invasive arterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure monitoring before and during CPR between July 1, 2013, and June 31, 2016, were included. Mean DBP during CPR and Utstein-style standardized cardiac arrest data were collected. The hypothesis was that DBP ≥25 mm Hg during CPR in infants and ≥30 mm Hg in children ≥1 year old would be associated with survival. Primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. Secondary outcome was survival to hospital discharge with favorable neurological outcome, defined as Pediatric Cerebral Performance Categories 1 to 3 or no worse than prearrest baseline. Multivariable Poisson regression models with robust error estimates were used to estimate the relative risk of outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Blinded investigators analyzed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure waveforms during CPR from 164 children, including 60% <1 year old, 60% with congenital heart disease, and 54% after cardiac surgery. The immediate cause of arrest was hypotension in 67%, respiratory decompensation in 44%, and arrhythmia in 19%. Median duration of CPR was 8 minutes (quartiles, 3 and 27 minutes). Ninety percent survived the event, 68% with return of spontaneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circul</span></strong>ation and 22% by extracorporeal life support. Forty-seven percent survived to hospital discharge, and 43% survived to discharge with favorable neurological outcome. Maintaining mean DBP ≥25 mm Hg in infants and ≥30 mm Hg in children ≥1 year old occurred in 101 of 164 children (62%) and was associated with survival (adjusted relative risk, 1.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.2–2.6; <i>P</i>=0.007) and survival with favorable neurological outcome (adjusted relative risk, 1.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.1–2.5; <i>P</i>=0.02).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These data demonstrate that mean DBP ≥25 mm Hg during CPR in infants and ≥30 mm Hg in children ≥1 year old was associated with greater likelihood of survival to hospital discharge and survival with favorable neurological outcome.</p></sec>

BAG3 (Bcl-2–Associated Athanogene-3) Coding Variant in Mice Determines Susceptibility to Ischemic Limb Muscle Myopathy by Directing Autophagy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Critical limb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong> is a manifestation of peripheral artery disease that carries significant mortality and morbidity risk in humans, although its genetic determinants remain largely unknown. We previously discovered 2 overlapping quantitative trait loci in mice, <i>Lsq-1</i> and <i>Civq-1</i>, that affected limb muscle survival and stroke volume after femoral artery or middle cerebral artery ligation, respectively. Here, we report that a <i>Bag3</i> variant (Ile81Met) segregates with tissue protection from hind-limb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We treated mice with either adeno-associated viruses encoding a control (green fluorescent protein) or 2 BAG3 (Bcl-2–associated athanogene-3) variants, namely Met81 or Ile81, and subjected the mice to hind-limb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We found that the BAG3 Ile81Met variant in the C57BL/6 (BL6) mouse background segregates with protection from tissue necrosis in a shorter congenic fragment of <i>Lsq-1</i> (C.B6–<i>Lsq1-3</i>). BALB/c mice treated with adeno-associated virus encoding the BL6 BAG3 variant (Ile81; n=25) displayed reduced limb-tissue necrosis and increased limb tissue perfusion compared with Met81- (n=25) or green fluorescent protein– (n=29) expressing animals. BAG3<sup>Ile81</sup>, but not BAG3<sup>Met81</sup>, improved ischemic muscle myopathy and muscle precursor cell differentiation and improved muscle regeneration in a separate, toxin-induced model of injury.

Exercise-Induced Changes in Glucose Metabolism Promote Physiological Cardiac Growth
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Exercise promotes metabolic remodeling in the heart, which is associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical cardiac growth; however, it is not known whether or how physical activity–induced changes in cardiac metabolism cause myocardial remodeling. In this study, we tested whether exercise-mediated changes in cardiomyocyte glucose metabolism are important for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical cardiac growth.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used radiometric, immunologic, metabolomic, and biochemical assays to measure changes in myocardial glucose metabolism in mice subjected to acute and chronic treadmill exercise. To assess the relevance of changes in glycolytic activity, we determined how cardiac-specific expression of mutant forms of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase affect cardiac structure, function, metabolism, and gene programs relevant to cardiac remodeling. Metabolomic and transcriptomic screenings were used to identify metabolic pathways and gene sets regulated by glycolytic activity in the heart.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Exercise acutely decreased glucose utilization via glycolysis by modulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circul</span></strong>ating substrates and reducing phosphofructokinase activity; however, in the recovered state following exercise adaptation, there was an increase in myocardial phosphofructokinase activity and glycolysis. In mice, cardiac-specific expression of a kinase-deficient 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase transgene (Glyco<sup>Lo</sup> mice) lowered glycolytic rate and regulated the expression of genes known to promote cardiac growth. Hearts of Glyco<sup>Lo</sup> mice had larger myocytes, enhanced cardiac function, and higher capillary-to-myocyte ratios. Expression of phosphatase-deficient 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase in the heart (Glyco<sup>Hi</sup> mice) increased glucose utilization and promoted a more pathological form of hypertrophy devoid of transcriptional activation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical cardiac growth program. Modulation of phosphofructokinase activity was sufficient to regulate the glucose–fatty acid cycle in the heart; however, metabolic inflexibility caused by invariantly low or high phosphofructokinase activity caused modest mitochondrial damage. Transcriptomic analyses showed that glycolysis regulates the expression of key genes involved in cardiac metabolism and remodeling.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Exercise-induced decreases in glycolytic activity stimulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical cardiac remodeling, and metabolic flexibility is important for maintaining mitochondrial health in the heart.</p></sec>

Cardiovascular and Ventilatory Consequences of Laparoscopic Surgery
<p>Although laparoscopic surgery accounts for >2 million surgical procedures every year, the current preoperative risk scores and guidelines do not adequately assess the risks of laparoscopy. In general, laparoscopic procedures have a lower risk of morbidity and mortality compared with operations requiring a midline laparotomy. During laparoscopic surgery, carbon dioxide insufflation may produce significant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemodynam</span></strong>ic and ventilatory consequences such as increased intraabdominal pressure and hypercarbia. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemodynam</span></strong>ic insults secondary to increased intraabdominal pressure include increased afterload and preload and decreased cardiac output, whereas ventilatory consequences include increased airway pressures, hypercarbia, and decreased pulmonary compliance. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemodynam</span></strong>ic effects are accentuated in patients with cardiovascular disease such as congestive heart failure, ischemic heart disease, valvular heart disease, pulmonary hypertension, and congenital heart disease. Prevention of cardiovascular complications may be accomplished through a sound understanding of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemodynam</span></strong>ic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical consequences of laparoscopic surgery as well as a defined operative plan generated by a multidisciplinary team involving the preoperative consultant, anesthesiologist, and surgeon.</p>

Association of Traditional Cardiovascular Risk Factors With Venous Thromboembolism
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Much controversy surrounds the association of traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors with venous thromboembolism (VTE).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed an individual level random-effect meta-analysis including 9 prospective studies with measured baseline cardiovascular disease risk factors and validated VTE events. Definitions were harmonized across studies. Traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors were modeled categorically and continuously using restricted cubic splines. Estimates were obtained for overall VTE, provoked VTE (ie, VTE occurring in the presence of 1 or more established VTE risk factors), and unprovoked VTE, pulmonary embolism, and deep-vein thrombosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The studies included 244 865 participants with 4910 VTE events occurring during a mean follow-up of 4.7 to 19.7 years per study. Age, sex, and body mass index-adjusted hazard ratios for overall VTE were 0.98 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.89−1.07) for hypertension, 0.97 (95% CI: 0.88−1.08) for hyperlipidemia, 1.01 (95% CI: 0.89−1.15) for diabetes mellitus, and 1.19 (95% CI: 1.08−1.32) for current smoking. After full adjustment, these estimates were numerically similar. When modeled continuously, an inverse association was observed for systolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure (hazard ratio=0.79 [95% CI: 0.68−0.92] at systolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure 160 vs 110 mm Hg) but not for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure or lipid measures with VTE. An important finding from VTE subtype analyses was that cigarette smoking was associated with provoked but not unprovoked VTE. Fully adjusted hazard ratios for the associations of current smoking with provoked and unprovoked VTE were 1.36 (95% CI: 1.22−1.52) and 1.08 (95% CI: 0.90−1.29), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Except for the association between cigarette smoking and provoked VTE, which is potentially mediated through comorbid conditions such as cancer, the modifiable traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors are not associated with increased VTE risk.

Augmentation of Muscle Blood Flow by Ultrasound Cavitation Is Mediated by ATP and Purinergic Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Augmentation of tissue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> flow by therapeutic ultrasound is thought to rely on convective shear. Microbubble contrast agents that undergo ultrasound-mediated cavitation markedly amplify these effects. We hypothesized that purinergic signaling is responsible for shear-dependent increases in muscle perfusion during therapeutic cavitation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Unilateral exposure of the proximal hindlimb of mice (with or without <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong> produced by iliac ligation) to therapeutic ultrasound (1.3 MHz, mechanical index 1.3) was performed for 10 minutes after intravenous injection of 2×10<sup>8</sup> lipid microbubbles. Microvascular perfusion was evaluated by low-power contrast ultrasound perfusion imaging. In vivo muscle ATP release and in vitro ATP release from endothelial cells or erythrocytes were assessed by a luciferin-luciferase assay. Purinergic signaling pathways were assessed by studying interventions that (1) accelerated ATP degradation; (2) inhibited P2Y receptors, adenosine receptors, or K<sub>ATP</sub> channels; or (3) inhibited downstream signaling pathways involving endothelial nitric oxide synthase or prostanoid production (indomethacin). Augmentation in muscle perfusion by ultrasound cavitation was assessed in a proof-of-concept clinical trial in 12 subjects with stable sickle cell disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Therapeutic ultrasound cavitation increased muscle perfusion by 7-fold in normal mice, reversed tissue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong> for up to 24 hours in the murine model of peripheral artery disease, and doubled muscle perfusion in patients with sickle cell disease. Augmentation in flow extended well beyond the region of ultrasound exposure. Ultrasound cavitation produced an ≈40-fold focal and sustained increase in ATP, the source of which included both endothelial cells and erythrocytes. Inhibitory studies indicated that ATP was a critical mediator of flow augmentation that acts primarily through either P2Y receptors or adenosine produced by ectonucleotidase activity. Combined indomethacin and inhibition of endothelial nitric oxide synthase abolished the effects of therapeutic ultrasound, indicating downstream signaling through both nitric oxide and prostaglandins.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Therapeutic ultrasound using microbubble cavitation to increase muscle perfusion relies on shear-dependent increases in ATP, which can act through a diverse portfolio of purinergic signaling pathways. These events can reverse hindlimb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong> in mice for >24 hours and increase muscle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> flow in patients with sickle cell disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Neuroprotective Effects of the Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Analog Exenatide After Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In-hospital mortality in comatose patients resuscitated from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is ≈50%. In OHCA patients, the leading cause of death is neurological injury secondary to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong> and reperfusion. Glucagon-like peptide-1 analogs are approved for type 2 diabetes mellitus; preclinical and clinical data have suggested their organ-protective effects in patients with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong> and reperfusion injury. The aim of this trial was to investigate the neuroprotective effects of the glucagon-like peptide-1 analog exenatide in resuscitated OHCA patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We randomly assigned 120 consecutive comatose patients resuscitated from OHCA in a double-blind, 2-center trial. They were administered 17.4 μg exenatide (Byetta) or placebo over a 6-hour and 15-minute infusion, in addition to standardized intensive care including targeted temperature management. The coprimary end points were feasibility, defined as initiation of the study drug in >90% patients within 240 minutes of return of spontaneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circul</span></strong>ation, and efficacy, defined as the geometric area under the neuron-specific enolase curve from 24 to 72 hours after admission.

Effect of Childhood Obesity Prevention Programs on Blood Pressure
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Childhood overweight and obesity are associated with elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure (BP). However, little is known about how childhood obesity lifestyle prevention programs affect BP. We assessed the effects of childhood obesity prevention programs on BP in children in developed countries.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We searched databases up to April 22, 2013, for relevant randomized, controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, and natural experiments. Studies were included if they applied a diet or physical activity intervention(s) and were followed for ≥1 year (or ≥6 months for school-based intervention studies); they were excluded if they targeted only overweight/obese subjects or those with a medical condition. In our meta-analysis, intervention effects were calculated for systolic BP and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic BP with the use of weighted random-effects models.

Has a second person with HIV been cured?
<p>Since the AIDS epidemic surfaced in 1980, some 75 million people have been infected with HIV and only one person has been cured, Timothy Ray Brown, aka the "Berlin patient." Now, a second infected person, who received a similar intervention to Brown, also appears to have cleared his infection. Both Brown and a man dubbed "the London patient" had <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> cancers that required stem cell transplants. At the advice of their doctors, they received transplants from immunologically matched donors who also happened to have mutations in CCR5, a receptor on white <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> cells that HIV uses to establish infections. The transplants may have also helped rid their bodies of HIV because they required "conditioning" regimens of toxic chemicals—and in the case of Brown, whole body irradiation, too—to kill off their tumor cells. What's more, they both had graft-versus-host disease in which the donor immune cells attack the recipient's tissues as foreign, which further could have killed residual HIV. As the London patient's doctor explained at an AIDS conference in Seattle, Washington, this week and in a description of the case in <i>Nature</i>, the man (who wants to remain anonymous) has been off anti-HIV drugs for 18 months and has no detectable virus in his <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> on the most sensitive assays. The researchers studying him are being cautious and saying he is in long-term remission, not cured—and indeed the virus has rebounded in others who looked cured but many months later had HIV resurface. The intensive intervention also will only make sense for HIV-infected people with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> cancers, a tiny fraction of the 37 million people living with the virus today. But there's hope that if both men indeed are cured it will spur simpler interventions that genetically modify CCR5, some of which are being studied today.</p>

Lymph node blood vessels provide exit routes for metastatic tumor cell dissemination in mice
<p>During metastasis, malignant cells escape the primary tumor, intravasate lymphatic vessels, and reach draining sentinel lymph nodes before they colonize distant organs via the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circul</span></strong>ation. Although lymph node metastasis in cancer patients correlates with poor prognosis, evidence is lacking as to whether and how tumor cells enter the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong>stream via lymph nodes. To investigate this question, we delivered carcinoma cells into the lymph nodes of mice by microinfusing the cells into afferent lymphatic vessels. We found that tumor cells rapidly infiltrated the lymph node parenchyma, invaded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> vessels, and seeded lung metastases without involvement of the thoracic duct. These results suggest that the lymph node <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> vessels can serve as an exit route for systemic dissemination of cancer cells in experimental mouse models. Whether this form of tumor cell spreading occurs in cancer patients remains to be determined.</p>

Targeting an energy sensor to treat diabetes
<p>Obesity occurs when whole-body energy intake exceeds energy expenditure for prolonged periods. This is a major public health issue because obesity increases the risk of disorders such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The liver and muscle store excess energy in the form of fat, leading to resistance to the hormone insulin. Released when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> glucose rises after meals, insulin normally promotes glucose uptake by muscle and represses glucose production by the liver, thus rapidly returning <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> glucose to normal. However, this process is impaired in insulin-resistant individuals, who may eventually develop persistently elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> glucose (i.e., T2DM), which can cause debilitating or life-threatening complications. Because the energy sensor AMPK (adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase) promotes muscle glucose uptake by insulin-independent mechanisms, it was proposed in 1999 that AMPK-activating drugs might represent a novel approach to treating T2DM (<i>1</i>). Representing the culmination of more than 15 years of developing this concept, a study by Myers <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) on page 507 of this issue and a study by Cokorinos <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) show that compounds that bind to a unique site on AMPK can promote glucose uptake by muscle, and hence reverse elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> glucose in animal models of T2DM.</p>

A key malaria metabolite modulates vector blood seeking, feeding, and susceptibility to infection
<p>Malaria infection renders humans more attractive to <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> sensu lato mosquitoes than uninfected people. The mechanisms remain unknown. We found that an isoprenoid precursor produced by <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>, (<i>E</i>)-4-hydroxy-3-methyl-but-2-enyl pyrophosphate (HMBPP), affects <i>A. gambiae</i> s.l. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> meal seeking and feeding behaviors as well as susceptibility to infection. HMBPP acts indirectly by triggering human red <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> cells to increase the release of CO<sub>2</sub>, aldehydes, and monoterpenes, which together enhance vector attraction and stimulate vector feeding. When offered in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> meal, HMBPP modulates neural, antimalarial, and oogenic gene transcription without affecting mosquito survival or fecundity; in a <i>P. falciparum</i>–infected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> meal, sporogony is increased.</p>

Thermal tolerance breadths among groundwater crustaceans living in a thermally constant environment
<p>The climate variability hypothesis assumes that the thermal tolerance breadth of a species is primarily determined by temperature variations experienced in its environment. If so, aquatic invertebrates living in thermally buffered environments would be expected to exhibit narrow thermal tolerance breadths (stenothermy). We tested this prediction by studying the thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>y of three isopods (Asellidae, <i>Proasellus</i>) colonizing groundwater habitats characterized by an annual temperature amplitude of less than 1°C. The species responses to temperature variation were assessed in the laboratory using five <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical variables: survival, locomotor activity, aerobic respiration, immune defense and concentrations of total free amino acids and sugars. The three species exhibited contrasted thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ies, although all variables were not equally informative. In accordance with the climate variability hypothesis, two species were extremely sensitive even to moderate changes in temperature (2°C) below and above their habitat temperature. In contrast, the third species exhibited a surprisingly high thermal tolerance breadth (11°C). Differences in response to temperature variation among <i>Proasellus</i> species indicated that their thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>y was not solely shaped by the current temperature seasonality in their natural habitats. More particularly, recent gene flow among populations living in thermally constant yet contrasted habitats might explain the occurrence of eurytherm species in thermally buffered environments.</p>

Improving 1-Year Outcomes of Infrainguinal Limb Revascularization

Major lower limb amputations and deaths within 1 year after revascularization were ascertained from Hospital Episode Statistics and Office for National Statistics mortality records. Competing risks regression was used to estimate the cumulative incidence of major amputation and death, adjusted for patient age, sex, comorbidity score, indication for the intervention (intermittent claudication, severe limb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong> without record of tissue loss, severe limb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong> with a record of ulceration, severe limb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong> with a record of gangrene/osteomyelitis), and comorbid diabetes mellitus.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The estimated 1-year risk of major amputation decreased from 5.7% (in 2006–2007) to 3.9% (in 2014–2015) following endovascular revascularization, and from 11.2% (2006–2007) to 6.6% (2014–2015) following surgical procedures.

Randomized trials designed to assess the impact of bariatric surgery in patients with obesity and hypertension are needed.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In this randomized, single-center, nonblinded trial, we included patients with hypertension (using ≥2 medications at maximum doses or >2 at moderate doses) and a body mass index between 30.0 and 39.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Patients were randomized to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass plus medical therapy or medical therapy alone. The primary end point was reduction of ≥30% of the total number of antihypertensive medications while maintaining systolic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure <140 mm Hg and 90 mm Hg, respectively, at 12 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We included 100 patients (70% female, mean age 43.8±9.2 years, mean body mass index 36.9±2.7 kg/m2), and 96% completed follow-up.

cGMP-Elevating Compounds and Ischemic Conditioning Provide Cardioprotection Against Ischemia and Reperfusion Injury via Cardiomyocyte-Specific BK Channels
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The nitric oxide–sensitive guanylyl cyclase/cGMP-dependent protein kinase type I signaling pathway can afford protection against the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong>/reperfusion injury that occurs during myocardial infarction. Reportedly, voltage and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channels of the BK type are stimulated by cGMP/cGMP-dependent protein kinase type I, and recent ex vivo studies implicated that increased BK activity favors the survival of the myocardium at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong>/reperfusion. It remains unclear, however, whether the molecular events downstream of cGMP involve BK channels present in cardiomyocytes or in other cardiac cell types.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Gene-targeted mice with a cardiomyocyte- or smooth muscle cell–specific deletion of the BK (CMBK or SMBK knockouts) were subjected to the open-chest model of myocardial infarction. Infarct sizes of the conditional mutants were compared with litter-matched controls, global BK knockout, and wild-type mice. Cardiac damage was assessed after mechanical conditioning or pharmacological stimulation of the cGMP pathway and by using direct modulators of BK. Long-term outcome was studied with respect to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heart funct</span></strong>ions and cardiac fibrosis in a chronic myocardial infarction model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Global BK knockouts and CMBK knockouts, in contrast with SMBK knockouts, exhibited significantly larger infarct sizes compared with their respective controls. Ablation of CMBK resulted in higher serum levels of cardiac troponin I and elevated amounts of reactive oxygen species, lower phosphorylated extracellular receptor kinase and phosphorylated AKT levels and an increase in myocardial apoptosis. Moreover, CMBK was required to allow beneficial effects of both nitric oxide–sensitive guanylyl cyclase activation and inhibition of the cGMP-degrading phosphodiesterase-5, ischemic preconditioning, and postconditioning regimens. To this end, after 4 weeks of reperfusion, fibrotic tissue increased and myocardial strain echocardiography was significantly compromised in CMBK-deficient mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Lack of CMBK channels renders the heart more susceptible to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong>/reperfusion injury, whereas the pathological events elicited by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong>/reperfusion do not involve BK in vascular smooth muscle cells. BK seems to permit the protective effects triggered by cinaciguat, riociguat, and different phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors and beneficial actions of ischemic preconditioning and ischemic postconditioning by a mechanism stemming primarily from cardiomyocytes. This study establishes mitochondrial CMBK channels as a promising target for limiting acute cardiac damage and adverse long-term events that occur after myocardial infarction.</p></sec>

J Curve in Patients Randomly Assigned to Different Systolic Blood Pressure Targets

For both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure targets, an identical shape of the J curve was present, with a nadir for cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality just below the SBP target.

<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Earlier age at menopause is widely considered to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. However, the underlying mechanisms of this relationship remain undetermined. Indications suggest that anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), an ovarian reserve marker, plays a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>ical role outside of the reproductive system. Therefore, we investigated whether longitudinal AMH decline trajectories are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) occurrence.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This study included 3108 female participants between 20 and 60 years of age at baseline of the population-based Doetinchem Cohort. Participants completed ≥1 of 5 consecutive quinquennial visits between 1987 and 2010, resulting in a total follow-up time of 20 years. AMH was measured in 8507 stored plasma samples. Information on total CVD, stroke, and coronary heart disease was obtained through a hospital discharge registry linkage. The association of AMH trajectories with CVD was quantified with joint modeling, with adjustment for age, smoking, oral contraceptive use, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone therapy use, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and glucose levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>By the end of follow-up, 8.2% of the women had suffered from CVD, 4.9% had suffered from coronary heart disease, and 2.6% had experienced a stroke. After adjustment, each ng/mL lower <sub>log</sub>AMH level was associated with a 21% higher risk of CVD (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.07–1.36) and a 26% higher risk of coronary heart disease (hazard ratio, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.08–1.46). Each additional ng/mL/year decrease of <sub>log</sub>AMH was associated with a significantly higher risk of CVD (hazard ratio, 1.46; 95% confidence interval, 1.14–1.87) and coronary heart disease (hazard ratio, 1.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.15–2.12). No association between AMH and stroke was found.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These results indicate that AMH trajectories in women are independently associated with CVD risk. Therefore, we postulate that the decline of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circul</span></strong>ating AMH levels may be part of the patho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physiolog</span></strong>y of the increased cardiovascular risk of earlier menopause. Confirmation of this association and elucidation of its underlying mechanisms are needed to place these results in a clinical perspective.</p></sec>

Heart Failure Stages Among Older Adults in the Community
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although heart failure (HF) disproportionately affects older adults, little data exist regarding the prevalence of American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association HF stages among older individuals in the community. Additionally, the role of contemporary measures of longitudinal strain and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic dysfunction in defining HF stages is unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>HF stages were classified in 6118 participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study (67–91 years of age) at the fifth study visit as follows: A (asymptomatic with HF risk factors but no cardiac structural or functional abnormalities), B (asymptomatic with structural abnormalities, defined as left ventricular hypertrophy, dilation or dysfunction, or significant valvular disease), C1 (clinical HF without prior hospitalization), and C2 (clinical HF with earlier hospitalization).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Using the traditional definitions of HF stages, only 5% of examined participants were free of HF risk factors or structural heart disease (Stage 0), 52% were categorized as Stage A, 30% Stage B, 7% Stage C1, and 6% Stage C2. Worse HF stage was associated with a greater risk of incident HF hospitalization or death at a median follow-up of 608 days. Left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction was preserved in 77% and 65% in Stages C1 and C2, respectively. Incorporation of longitudinal strain and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic dysfunction into the Stage B definition reclassified 14% of the sample from Stage A to B and improved the net reclassification index (<i>P</i>=0.028) and integrated discrimination index (<i>P</i>=0.016). Abnormal LV structure, systolic function (based on LV ejection fraction and longitudinal strain), and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic function (based on e’, E/e’, and left atrial volume index) were each independently and additively associated with risk of incident HF hospitalization or death in Stage A and B participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The majority of older adults in the community are at risk for HF (Stages A or B), appreciably more compared with previous reports in younger community-based samples. LV ejection fraction is robustly preserved in at least two-thirds of older adults with prevalent HF (Stage C), highlighting the burden of HF with preserved LV ejection fraction in the elderly. LV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic function and longitudinal strain provide incremental prognostic value beyond conventional measures of LV structure and LV ejection fraction in identifying persons at risk for HF hospitalization or death.</p></sec>

Fire Simulation and Cardiovascular Health in Firefighters
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Rates of myocardial infarction in firefighters are increased during fire suppression duties, and are likely to reflect a combination of factors including extreme physical exertion and heat exposure. We assessed the effects of simulated fire suppression on measures of cardiovascular health in healthy firefighters.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In an open-label randomized crossover study, 19 healthy firefighters (age, 41±7 years; 16 males) performed a standardized training exercise in a fire simulation facility or light duties for 20 minutes. After each exposure, ex vivo thrombus formation, fibrinolysis, platelet activation, and forearm <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> flow in response to intra-arterial infusions of endothelial-dependent and -independent vasodilators were measured.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>After fire simulation training, core temperature increased (1.0±0.1°C) and weight reduced (0.46±0.14 kg, <i>P</i><0.001 for both). In comparison with control, exposure to fire simulation increased thrombus formation under low-shear (73±14%) and high-shear (66±14%) conditions (<i>P</i><0.001 for both) and increased platelet-monocyte binding (7±10%, <i>P</i>=0.03). There was a dose-dependent increase in forearm <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> flow with all vasodilators (<i>P</i><0.001), which was attenuated by fire simulation in response to acetylcholine (<i>P</i>=0.01) and sodium nitroprusside (<i>P</i>=0.004). This was associated with a rise in fibrinolytic capacity, asymptomatic myocardial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong>, and an increase in plasma cardiac troponin I concentrations (1.4 [0.8–2.5] versus 3.0 [1.7–6.4] ng/L, <i>P</i>=0.010).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Exposure to extreme heat and physical exertion during fire suppression activates platelets, increases thrombus formation, impairs vascular function, and promotes myocardial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ischemia</span></strong> and injury in healthy firefighters. Our findings provide pathogenic mechanisms to explain the association between fire suppression activity and acute myocardial infarction in firefighters.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Gene Regulatory Networks for the Haploid-to-Diploid Transition of <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>
<p>The sexual cycle of the unicellular <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> culminates in the formation of diploid zygotes that differentiate into dormant spores that eventually undergo meiosis. Mating between gametes induces rapid cell wall shedding via the enzyme g-lysin; cell fusion is followed by heterodimerization of sex-specific homeobox transcription factors, GSM1 and GSP1, and initiation of zygote-specific gene expression. To investigate the genetic underpinnings of the zygote developmental pathway, we performed comparative transcriptome analysis of both pre- and post-fertilization samples. We identified 253 transcripts specifically enriched in early zygotes, 82% of which were not up-regulated in <i>gsp1</i> null zygotes. We also found that the GSM1/GSP1 heterodimer negatively regulates the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative wall program at the posttranscriptional level, enabling prompt transition from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative wall to zygotic wall assembly. Annotation of the g-lysin-induced and early zygote genes reveals distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative and zygotic wall programs, supported by concerted up-regulation of genes encoding cell wall-modifying enzymes and proteins involved in nucleotide-sugar metabolism. The haploid-to-diploid transition in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> is masterfully controlled by the GSM1/GSP1 heterodimer, translating fertilization and gamete coalescence into a bona fide differentiation program. The fertilization-triggered integration of genes required to make related, but structurally and functionally distinct organelles—the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative versus zygote cell wall—presents a likely scenario for the evolution of complex developmental gene regulatory networks.</p>

SDG2-Mediated H3K4me3 Is Crucial for Chromatin Condensation and Mitotic Division during Male Gametogenesis in Arabidopsis
<p>Epigenetic reprogramming occurring during reproduction is crucial for both animal and plant development. Histone H3 Lys 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) is an evolutionarily conserved epigenetic mark of transcriptional active euchromatin. While much has been learned in somatic cells, H3K4me3 deposition and function in gametophyte is poorly studied. Here, we demonstrate that SET DOMAIN GROUP2 (SDG2)-mediated H3K4me3 deposition participates in epigenetic reprogramming during Arabidopsis male gametogenesis. We show that loss of SDG2 barely affects meiosis and cell fate establishment of haploid cells. However, we found that SDG2 is critical for postmeiotic microspore development. Mitotic cell division progression is partly impaired in the loss-of-function <i>sdg2-1</i> mutant, particularly at the second mitosis setting up the two sperm cells. We demonstrate that SDG2 is involved in promoting chromatin decondensation in the pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative nucleus, likely through its role in H3K4me3 deposition, which prevents ectopic heterochromatic H3K9me2 speckle formation. Moreover, we found that derepression of the LTR retrotransposon <i>ATLANTYS1</i> is compromised in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative cell of the <i>sdg2-1</i> mutant pollen. Consistent with chromatin condensation and compromised transcription activity, pollen germination and pollen tube elongation, representing the key function of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative cell in transporting sperm cells during fertilization, are inhibited in the <i>sdg2-1</i> mutant. Taken together, we conclude that SDG2-mediated H3K4me3 is an essential epigenetic mark of the gametophyte chromatin landscape, playing critical roles in gamete mitotic cell cycle progression and pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative cell function during male gametogenesis and beyond.</p>

Regulation of Vegetative Phase Change by SWI2/SNF2 Chromatin Remodeling ATPase BRAHMA
<p>Plants progress from a juvenile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative phase of development to an adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative phase of development before they enter the reproductive phase. miR156 has been shown to be the master regulator of the juvenile-to-adult transition in plants. However, the mechanism of how miR156 is transcriptionally regulated still remains elusive. In a forward genetic screen, we identified that a mutation in the SWI2/SNF2 chromatin remodeling ATPase BRAHMA (BRM) exhibited an accelerated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative phase change phenotype by reducing the expression of miR156, which in turn caused a corresponding increase in the levels of <i>SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN LIKE</i> genes. BRM regulates miR156 expression by directly binding to the <i>MIR156A</i> promoter. Mutations in <i>BRM</i> not only increased occupancy of the −2 and +1 nucleosomes proximal to the transcription start site at the <i>MIR156A</i> locus but also the levels of trimethylated histone H3 at Lys 27. The precocious phenotype of <i>brm</i> mutant was partially suppressed by a second mutation in <i>SWINGER</i> (<i>SWN</i>), but not by a mutation in <i>CURLEY LEAF</i>, both of which are key components of the Polycomb Group Repressive Complex 2 in plants. Our results indicate that BRM and SWN act antagonistically at the nucleosome level to fine-tune the temporal expression of miR156 to regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative phase change in Arabidopsis.</p>

The Target of β-Expansin EXPB1 in Maize Cell Walls from Binding and Solid-State NMR Studies<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The wall-loosening actions of β-expansins are known primarily from studies of EXPB1 extracted from maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) pollen. EXPB1 selectively loosens cell walls (CWs) of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grass</span></strong>es, but its specific binding target is unknown. We characterized EXPB1 binding to sequentially extracted maize CWs, finding that the protein primarily binds glucuronoarabinoxylan (GAX), the major matrix polysaccharide in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grass</span></strong> CWs. This binding is strongly reduced by salts, indicating that it is predominantly electrostatic in nature. For direct molecular evidence of EXPB1 binding, we conducted solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance experiments using paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE), which is sensitive to distances between unpaired electrons and nuclei. By mixing <sup>13</sup>C-enriched maize CWs with EXPB1 functionalized with a Mn<sup>2+</sup> tag, we measured Mn<sup>2+</sup>-induced PRE. Strong <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C PREs were observed for the carboxyls of GAX, followed by more moderate PREs for carboxyl groups in homogalacturonan and rhamnogalacturonan-I, indicating that EXPB1 preferentially binds GAX. In contrast, no PRE was observed for cellulose, indicating very weak interaction of EXPB1 with cellulose. Dynamics experiments show that EXPB1 changes GAX mobility in a complex manner: the rigid fraction of GAX became more rigid upon EXPB1 binding while the dynamic fraction became more mobile. Combining these data with previous results, we propose that EXPB1 loosens <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grass</span></strong> CWs by disrupting noncovalent junctions between highly substituted GAX and GAX of low substitution, which binds cellulose. This study provides molecular evidence of β-expansin’s target in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grass</span></strong> CWs and demonstrates a new strategy for investigating ligand binding for proteins that are difficult to express heterologously.</p>

The impact of long-term water stress on tree architecture and production is related to changes in transitions between vegetative and reproductive growth in the ‘Granny Smith’ apple cultivar
<p>Water stress (WS) generates a number of physiological and morphological responses in plants that depend on the intensity and duration of stress as well as the plant species and development stage. In perennial plants, WS may affect plant development through cumulative effects that modify plant functions, architecture and production over time. Plant architecture depends on the fate of the terminal and axillary buds that can give rise, in the particular case of apple, to reproductive or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative growth units (GUs) of different lengths. In this study, the impact of long-term WS (7 years) on the fate of terminal and axillary buds was investigated in relation to flowering occurrence and production pattern (biennial vs regular) in the ‘Granny Smith’ cultivar. It was observed that WS decreased the total number of GUs per branch, regardless of their type. Conversely, WS did not modify the timing of the two successive developmental phases characterized by the production of long and medium GUs and an alternation of floral GUs over time, respectively. The analysis of GU successions over time using a variable-order Markov chain that included both the effects of the predecessor and water treatment revealed that WS reduced the transition towards long and medium GUs and increased the transition toward floral, short and dead GUs. WS also slightly increased the proportion of axillary floral GUs. The higher relative frequency of floral GUs compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative ones reduced the tendency to biennial bearing under WS. The accelerated ontogenetic trend observed under WS suggests lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative growth that could, in turn, be beneficial to floral induction and fruit set.</p>

Climate model shows large-scale wind and solar farms in the Sahara increase rain and vegetation
<p>Wind and solar farms offer a major pathway to clean, renewable energies. However, these farms would significantly change land surface properties, and, if sufficiently large, the farms may lead to unintended climate consequences. In this study, we used a climate model with dynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ation to show that large-scale installations of wind and solar farms covering the Sahara lead to a local temperature increase and more than a twofold precipitation increase, especially in the Sahel, through increased surface friction and reduced albedo. The resulting increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ation further enhances precipitation, creating a positive albedo–precipitation–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ation feedback that contributes ~80% of the precipitation increase for wind farms. This local enhancement is scale dependent and is particular to the Sahara, with small impacts in other deserts.</p>

Extended Vernalization Regulates Inflorescence Fate in <i>Arabis alpina</i> by Stably Silencing <i>PERPETUAL FLOWERING1</i>
<p>The alpine perennial <i>Arabis alpina</i> initiates flower buds during prolonged exposure to cold. In the accession Pajares, we demonstrate that the length of vernalization influences flowering time and inflorescence fate but does not affect the axillary branches that maintain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative growth. The expression of floral organ identity genes gradually increases in the main shoot apex during vernalization, correlating with an increase in floral commitment. In northern Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) accessions, the length of vernalization modulates the stable silencing of the floral repressor <i>FLOWERING LOCUS C</i> (<i>FLC</i>). We demonstrate that expression of <i>PERPETUAL FLOWERING1</i> (<i>PEP1</i>), the ortholog of <i>FLC</i> in <i>A. alpina</i>, is similarly influenced by the duration of the exposure to cold. Extended vernalization results in stable silencing of <i>PEP1</i> in the inflorescence. In contrast, insufficient vernalization leads to <i>PEP1</i> reactivation after cold treatment, which correlates with delayed flowering and the appearance of floral reversion phenotypes such as bracts and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative inflorescence branches. Floral reversion phenotypes are reduced in the <i>pep1-1</i> mutant, suggesting that <i>PEP1</i> regulates the fate of the inflorescence after vernalization. The effect of vernalization duration on stable silencing of <i>PEP1</i> is specific to meristems that initiate flowering during cold treatment. Extended vernalization fails to silence <i>PEP1</i> in young seedlings and axillary branches that arise from buds initiated during cold treatment, which remain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative. We conclude that the duration of vernalization in <i>A. alpina</i> differentially regulates <i>PEP1</i> in the inflorescence and axillary branches. <i>PEP1</i> has a dual role regulating meristem fate; it prevents meristems from flowering and antagonizes inflorescence development after vernalization.</p>

An Improved <i>Brome mosaic virus</i> Silencing Vector: Greater Insert Stability and More Extensive VIGS
<p>Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) is used extensively for gene function studies in plants. VIGS is inexpensive and rapid compared with silencing conducted through stable transformation, but many virus-silencing vectors, especially in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grass</span></strong>es, induce only transient silencing phenotypes. A major reason for transient phenotypes is the instability of the foreign gene fragment (insert) in the vector during VIGS. Here, we report the development of a <i>Brome mosaic virus</i> (BMV)-based vector that better maintains inserts through modification of the original BMV vector RNA sequence. Modification of the BMV RNA3 sequence yielded a vector, BMVCP5, that better maintained <i>phytoene desaturase</i> and <i>heat shock protein70-1</i> (<i>HSP70-1</i>) inserts in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). Longer maintenance of inserts was correlated with greater target gene silencing and more extensive visible silencing phenotypes displaying greater tissue penetration and involving more leaves. The modified vector accumulated similarly to the original vector in <i>N. benthamiana</i> after agroinfiltration, thus maintaining a high titer of virus in this intermediate host used to produce virus inoculum for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grass</span></strong> hosts. For <i>HSP70</i>, silencing one family member led to a large increase in the expression of another family member, an increase likely related to the target gene knockdown and not a general effect of virus infection. The cause of the increased insert stability in the modified vector is discussed in relationship to its recombination and accumulation potential. The modified vector will improve functional genomic studies in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grass</span></strong>es, and the conceptual methods used to improve the vector may be applied to other VIGS vectors.</p>

Gibberellin Signaling Requires Chromatin Remodeler PICKLE to Promote Vegetative Growth and Phase Transitions
<p>PICKLE (PKL) is an ATP-dependent chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding domain (CHD3) chromatin remodeling enzyme in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Previous studies showed that PKL promotes embryonic-to-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative transition by inhibiting expression of seed-specific genes during seed germination. The <i>pkl</i> mutants display a low penetrance of the “pickle root” phenotype, with a thick and green primary root that retains embryonic characteristics. The penetrance of this pickle root phenotype in <i>pkl</i> is dramatically increased in gibberellin (GA)-deficient conditions. At adult stages, the <i>pkl</i> mutants are semidwarfs with delayed flowering time, which resemble reduced GA-signaling mutants. These findings suggest that PKL may play a positive role in regulating GA signaling. A recent biochemical analysis further showed that PKL and GA signaling repressors DELLAs antagonistically regulate hypocotyl cell elongation genes by direct protein-protein interaction. To elucidate further the role of PKL in GA signaling and plant development, we studied the genetic interaction between PKL and DELLAs using the hextuple mutant containing <i>pkl</i> and <i>della</i> pentuple (<i>dP</i>) mutations. Here, we show that PKL is required for most of GA-promoted developmental processes, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative growth such as hypocotyl, leaf, and inflorescence stem elongation, and phase transitions such as juvenile-to-adult leaf and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative-to-reproductive phase. The removal of all DELLA functions (in the <i>dP</i> background) cannot rescue these phenotypes in <i>pkl</i>. RNA-sequencing analysis using the <i>ga1</i> (a GA-deficient mutant), <i>pkl</i>, and the <i>ga1 pkl</i> double mutant further shows that expression of 80% of GA-responsive genes in seedlings is PKL dependent, including genes that function in cell elongation, cell division, and phase transitions. These results indicate that the CHD3 chromatin remodeler PKL is required for regulating gene expression during most of GA-regulated developmental processes.</p>

A Comprehensively Curated Genome-Scale Two-Cell Model for the Heterocystous Cyanobacterium <i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120
<p><i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120 is a nitrogen-fixing filamentous cyanobacterium. Under nitrogen-limiting conditions, a fraction of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative cells in each filament terminally differentiate to nongrowing heterocysts. Heterocysts are metabolically and structurally specialized to enable O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive nitrogen fixation. The functionality of the filament, as an association of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative cells and heterocysts, is postulated to depend on metabolic exchange of electrons, carbon, and fixed nitrogen. In this study, we compile and evaluate a comprehensive curated stoichiometric model of this two-cell system, with the objective function based on the growth of the filament under diazotrophic conditions. The predicted growth rate under nitrogen-replete and -deplete conditions, as well as the effect of external carbon and nitrogen sources, was thereafter verified. Furthermore, the model was utilized to comprehensively evaluate the optimality of putative metabolic exchange reactions between heterocysts and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative cells. The model suggested that optimal growth requires at least four exchange metabolites. Several combinations of exchange metabolites resulted in predicted growth rates that are higher than growth rates achieved by only considering exchange of metabolites previously suggested in the literature. The curated model of the metabolic network of <i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120 enhances our ability to understand the metabolic organization of multicellular cyanobacteria and provides a platform for further study and engineering of their metabolism.</p>

Convergence in morphology and masticatory function between the pharyngeal jaws of grass carp, <i>Ctenopharyngodon idella</i>, and oral jaws of amniote herbivores
<p>The cellulose-rich walls that protect plant cells are difficult to digest, and therefore mechanical food processing is a key aspect of herbivory across vertebrates. Cell walls are typically broken down by translation of flattened teeth in the occlusal plane (i.e. grinding) as part of a complex, rhythmic chewing stroke. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grass</span></strong> carp, <i>Ctenopharyngodon idella</i>, is a voracious, invasive herbivorous fish that relies solely on its pharyngeal teeth, located in the back of the throat, for mechanical processing of plant material. Here, we describe the musculoskeletal anatomy of the pharyngeal jaws of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grass</span></strong> carp and use XROMM to quantify chewing kinematics and muscle strain. The pharyngeal jaws are suspended in a sling of 11 muscles and maintain no bony articulation with any other skeletal elements in the head. The jaws bear long, serrated teeth that are worn during use into flattened tooth cusps. Our kinematic data show that this wear is the result of the teeth being elevated into occlusion against the basioccipital process and keratinous chewing pad, not tooth-on-tooth occlusion. Pharyngeal jaw elevation results from large strains in the jaw elevator muscle, the levator arcus branchialis V, to drive a pulley-like mechanism that rotates the jaws about a pivot point at the symphysis between the left and right pharyngeal jaws. These complex, rhythmic jaw rotations translate the teeth laterally across the chewing surface throughout the occlusion phase. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grass</span></strong> carp chewing system is strikingly similar in gross morphology and masticatory function to herbivorous chewing strategies in other vertebrates.</p>

Genome-Wide Development and Use of Microsatellite Markers for Large-Scale Genotyping Applications in Foxtail Millet [<i>Setaria italica</i> (L.)]
<p>The availability of well-validated informative co-dominant microsatellite markers and saturated genetic linkage map has been limited in foxtail millet (<i>Setaria italica</i> L.). In view of this, we conducted a genome-wide analysis and identified 28 342 microsatellite repeat-motifs spanning 405.3 Mb of foxtail millet genome. The trinucleotide repeats (∼48%) was prevalent when compared with dinucleotide repeats (∼46%). Of the 28 342 microsatellites, 21 294 (∼75%) primer pairs were successfully designed, and a total of 15 573 markers were physically mapped on 9 chromosomes of foxtail millet. About 159 markers were validated successfully in 8 accessions of <i>Setaria</i> sp. with ∼67% polymorphic potential. The high percentage (89.3%) of cross-genera transferability across millet and non-millet species with higher transferability percentage in bioenergy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grass</span></strong>es (∼79%, Switch<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grass</span></strong> and ∼93%, Pearl millet) signifies their importance in studying the bioenergy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grass</span></strong>es. <i>In silico</i> comparative mapping of 15 573 foxtail millet microsatellite markers against the mapping data of sorghum (16.9%), maize (14.5%) and rice (6.4%) indicated syntenic relationships among the chromosomes of foxtail millet and target species. The results, thus, demonstrate the immense applicability of developed microsatellite markers in germplasm characterization, phylogenetics, construction of genetic linkage map for gene/quantitative trait loci discovery, comparative mapping in foxtail millet, including other millets and bioenergy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grass</span></strong> species.</p>

Reproduction-related variation in carbon allocation to woody tissues in <i>Fagus crenata</i> using a natural <sup>13</sup>C approach
<p>The contribution of new photo-assimilates and stored carbon (C) to plant growth remains poorly understood, especially during reproduction. In order to elucidate how mast seeding affects C allocation to both reproductive and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative tissues, we measured biomass increase in each tissue, branch starch concentration and stable C isotope composition (δ<sup>13</sup>C) in bulk leaves, current-year shoots, 3-year branches and tree rings in fruiting and non-fruiting trees for 2 years, as well as in fruits. We isolated the effect of reproduction on C allocation to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative growth by comparing <sup>13</sup>C enrichment in woody tissues in fruiting and non-fruiting specimens. Compared with 2‰ <sup>13</sup>C enrichment in shoots relative to leaves from non-fruiting trees, fruiting reduced the enrichment to 1‰ and this reduction disappeared in the following year with no fruiting, indicating that new photo-assimilates are preferentially used for woody tissues even with fruiting burden. In contrast, fruits had up to 2.5‰ <sup>13</sup>C enrichment at mid-summer, which dropped thereafter, indicating that fruit production relies on C storage early in the growing season then shifts to current photo-assimilates. At this tipping point, growth of shoots and cupules had almost finished and nuts had a second rapid growth period thereafter. Together with shorter shoots but higher biomass increment per length in fruiting trees than non-fruiting trees, these results indicate that the C limitation due to fruit burden is minimized by fine-tuning of allocation of old C stores and new photo-assimilates, along with the growth pattern in various tissues. Furthermore, fruiting had no significant effect on starch concentration in 3-year-old branches, which became fully depleted during leaf and flower flushing but were quickly replenished. These results indicate that reproduction affects C allocation to branches but not its source or storage. These reproduction-related variations in the fate of C have implications for evaluating forest ecosystem C cycles during climate change.</p>

Evolution of alluvial mudrock forced by early land plants
<p>Mudrocks are a primary archive of Earth’s history from the Archean eon to recent times, and their source-to-sink production and deposition play a central role in long-term ocean chemistry and climate regulation. Using original and published stratigraphic data from all 704 of Earth’s known alluvial formations from the Archean eon (3.5 billion years ago) to the Carboniferous period (0.3 billion years ago), we prove contentions of an upsurge in the proportion of mud retained on land coeval with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ation evolution. We constrain the onset of the upsurge to the Ordovician-Silurian and show that alluvium deposited after land plant evolution contains a proportion of mudrock that is, on average, 1.4 orders of magnitude greater than the proportion contained in alluvium from the preceding 90% of Earth’s history. We attribute this shift to the ways in which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ation revolutionized mud production and sediment flux from continental interiors.</p>

Satellites reveal contrasting responses of regional climate to the widespread greening of Earth
<p>Changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ation cover associated with the observed greening may affect several biophysical processes, whose net effects on climate are unclear. We analyzed remotely sensed dynamics in leaf area index (LAI) and energy fluxes in order to explore the associated variation in local climate. We show that the increasing trend in LAI contributed to the warming of boreal zones through a reduction of surface albedo and to an evaporation-driven cooling in arid regions. The interplay between LAI and surface biophysics is amplified up to five times under extreme warm-dry and cold-wet years. Altogether, these signals reveal that the recent dynamics in global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ation have had relevant biophysical impacts on the local climates and should be considered in the design of local mitigation and adaptation plans.</p>

Evolution of Cold Acclimation and Its Role in Niche Transition in the Temperate Grass Subfamily Pooideae
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grass</span></strong> subfamily Pooideae dominates the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grass</span></strong> floras in cold temperate regions and has evolved complex physiological adaptations to cope with extreme environmental conditions like frost, winter, and seasonality. One such adaptation is cold acclimation, wherein plants increase their frost tolerance in response to gradually falling temperatures and shorter days in the autumn. However, understanding how complex traits like cold acclimation evolve remains a major challenge in evolutionary biology. Here, we investigated the evolution of cold acclimation in Pooideae and found that a phylogenetically diverse set of Pooideae species displayed cold acclimation capacity. However, comparing differential gene expression after cold treatment in transcriptomes of five phylogenetically diverse species revealed widespread species-specific responses of genes with conserved sequences. Furthermore, we studied the correlation between gene family size and number of cold-responsive genes as well as between selection pressure on coding sequences of genes and their cold responsiveness. We saw evidence of protein-coding and regulatory sequence evolution as well as the origin of novel genes and functions contributing toward evolution of a cold response in Pooideae. Our results reflect that selection pressure resulting from global cooling must have acted on already diverged lineages. Nevertheless, conservation of cold-induced gene expression of certain genes indicates that the Pooideae ancestor may have possessed some molecular machinery to mitigate cold stress. Evolution of adaptations to seasonally cold climates is regarded as particularly difficult. How Pooideae evolved to transition from tropical to temperate biomes sheds light on how complex traits evolve in the light of climate changes.</p>

A Trihelix Family Transcription Factor Is Associated with Key Genes in Mixed-Linkage Glucan Accumulation
<p>Mixed-linkage glucan (MLG) is a polysaccharide that is highly abundant in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grass</span></strong> endosperm cell walls and present at lower amounts in other tissues. <i>Cellulose synthase-like F</i> (<i>CSLF</i>) and <i>cellulose synthase-like H</i> genes synthesize MLG, but it is unknown if other genes participate in the production and restructuring of MLG. Using <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i> transcriptional profiling data, we identified a <i>B</i>. <i>distachyon</i> trihelix family transcription factor (<i>BdTHX1</i>) that is highly coexpressed with the <i>B</i>. <i>distachyon CSLF6</i> gene (<i>BdCSLF6</i>), which suggests that BdTHX1 is involved in the regulation of MLG biosynthesis. To determine the genes regulated by this transcription factor, we conducted chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments using immature <i>B</i>. <i>distachyon</i> seeds and an anti-BdTHX1 polyclonal antibody. The ChIP-seq experiment identified the second intron of <i>BdCSLF6</i> as one of the most enriched sequences. The binding of BdTHX1 to the <i>BdCSLF6</i> intron sequence was confirmed using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). ChIP-seq also showed that a gene encoding a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grass</span></strong>-specific glycoside hydrolase family 16 endotransglucosylase/hydrolase (<i>BdXTH8</i>) is bound by BdTHX1, and the binding was confirmed by EMSA. Radiochemical transglucanase assays showed that BdXTH8 exhibits predominantly MLG:xyloglucan endotransglucosylase activity, a hetero-transglycosylation reaction, and can thus produce MLG-xyloglucan covalent bonds; it also has a lower xyloglucan:xyloglucan endotransglucosylase activity. <i>B</i>. <i>distachyon</i> shoots regenerated from transformed calli overexpressing <i>BdTHX1</i> showed an abnormal arrangement of vascular tissue and seedling-lethal phenotypes. These results indicate that the transcription factor BdTHX1 likely plays an important role in MLG biosynthesis and restructuring by regulating the expression of <i>BdCSLF6</i> and <i>BdXTH8</i>.</p>

Carbonic Anhydrase Mutants in <i>Zea mays</i> Have Altered Stomatal Responses to Environmental Signals
<p>Stomata regulate transpirational water loss and CO<sub>2</sub> uptake for photosynthesis in response to changing environmental conditions. Research investigating stomatal movement has mostly been conducted in C<sub>3</sub> eudicot species, which have very different CO<sub>2</sub> requirements for photosynthesis relative to C<sub>4</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grass</span></strong>es. Carbonic anhydrase (CA) catalyzes the hydration of CO<sub>2</sub>, and its activity has been linked to stomatal aperture regulation in eudicots. The number of <i>Ca</i> genes and their evolutionary history differ between monocots and dicots, and many questions remain unanswered about potential neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grass</span></strong> <i>Ca</i> paralogs and their roles in photosynthesis and stomatal conductance. To investigate the roles of different <i>Ca</i> genes in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), we examined stomatal responses in <i>ca1</i> and <i>ca2</i> single mutants as well as a <i>ca1ca2</i> double mutant. The <i>ca1</i> and <i>ca2</i> single mutants had 10% and 87% of the CA activity exhibited by the wild type, respectively, while <i>ca1ca2</i> had less than 5% of wild-type CA activity. The <i>ca</i> mutants had higher stomatal conductance than the wild type and slower stomatal closure in response to increases in CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure. Contrary to previous reports in eudicots, <i>ca</i> mutants showed slowed stomatal closure in response to the light-dark transition and did not show differences in stomatal density compared with the wild type. These results implicate CA-mediated signaling in the control of stomatal movement but not stomatal development. Drought experiments with <i>ca1ca2</i> mutant plants suggest a role for CA in water-use efficiency and reveal that <i>Z. mays</i> is not optimized for water-use efficiency under well-watered conditions.</p>

Soft X-Ray Imaging of Cellular Carbon and Nitrogen Distributions in Heterocystous Cyanobacteria
<p>Soft x-ray microscopy (SXM) is a minimally invasive technique for single-cell high-resolution imaging as well as the visualization of intracellular distributions of light elements such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. We used SXM to observe photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation in the filamentous cyanobacterium <i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120, which can form heterocysts during nitrogen starvation. Statistical and spectroscopic analyses from SXM images around the K-absorption edge of nitrogen revealed a significant difference in the carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratio between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative cells and heterocysts. Application of this analysis to soft x-ray images of <i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120 revealed inhomogenous C/N ratios in the cells. Furthermore, soft x-ray tomography of <i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120 revealed differing cellular C/N ratios, indicating different carbon and nitrogen distributions between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative cells and heterocysts in three dimensions.</p>

A Dynamic Hydro-Mechanical and Biochemical Model of Stomatal Conductance for C<sub>4</sub> Photosynthesis
<p>C<sub>4</sub> plants are major grain (maize [<i>Zea mays</i>] and sorghum [<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>]), sugar (sugarcane [<i>Saccharum officinarum</i>]), and biofuel (<i>Miscanthus</i> spp.) producers and contribute ∼20% to global productivity. Plants lose water through stomatal pores in order to acquire CO<sub>2</sub> (assimilation [<i>A</i>]) and control their carbon-for-water balance by regulating stomatal conductance (<i>g</i><sub>S</sub>). The ability to mechanistically predict <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> and <i>A</i> in response to atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, water availability, and time is critical for simulating stomatal control of plant-atmospheric carbon and water exchange under current, past, or future environmental conditions. Yet, dynamic mechanistic models for <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> are lacking, especially for C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. We developed and coupled a hydromechanical model of stomatal behavior with a biochemical model of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis, calibrated using gas-exchange measurements in maize, and extended the coupled model with time-explicit functions to predict dynamic responses. We demonstrated the wider applicability of the model with three additional C<sub>4</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grass</span></strong> species in which interspecific differences in stomatal behavior could be accounted for by fitting a single parameter. The model accurately predicted steady-state responses of <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> to light, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and oxygen, soil drying, and evaporative demand as well as dynamic responses to light intensity. Further analyses suggest that the effect of variable leaf hydraulic conductance is negligible. Based on the model, we derived a set of equations suitable for incorporation in land surface models. Our model illuminates the processes underpinning stomatal control in C<sub>4</sub> plants and suggests that the hydraulic benefits associated with fast stomatal responses of C<sub>4</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grass</span></strong>es may have supported the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis.</p>

An Animal-Like Cryptochrome Controls the <i>Chlamydomonas</i> Sexual Cycle
<p>Cryptochromes are known as flavin-binding blue light receptors in bacteria, fungi, plants, and insects. The animal-like cryptochrome (aCRY) of the green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> has extended our view on cryptochromes, because it responds also to other wavelengths of the visible spectrum, including red light. Here, we have investigated if aCRY is involved in the regulation of the sexual life cycle of <i>C. reinhardtii</i>, which is controlled by blue and red light at the steps of gametogenesis along with its restoration and germination. We show that aCRY is differentially expressed not only during the life cycle but also within the cell as part of the soluble and/or membrane-associated protein fraction. Moreover, localization of aCRY within the algal cell body varies between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative cells and the different cell types of gametogenesis. aCRY is significantly (early day) or to a small extent (late night) enriched in the nucleus in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative cells. In pregametes, gametes and dark-inactivated gametes, aCRY is localized over the cell body. aCRY plays an important role in the sexual life cycle of <i>C. reinhardtii</i>: It controls the germination of the alga, under which the zygote undergoes meiosis, in a positive manner, similar to the regulation by the blue light receptors phototropin and plant cryptochrome (pCRY). However, aCRY acts in combination with pCRY as a negative regulator for mating ability as well as for mating maintenance, opposite to the function of phototropin in these processes.</p>

Disrupting Flavone Synthase II Alters Lignin and Improves Biomass Digestibility
<p>Lignin, a ubiquitous phenylpropanoid polymer in vascular plant cell walls, is derived primarily from oxidative couplings of monolignols (<i>p</i>-hydroxycinnamyl alcohols). It was discovered recently that a wide range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grass</span></strong>es, including cereals, utilize a member of the flavonoids, tricin (3′,5′-dimethoxyflavone), as a natural comonomer with monolignols for cell wall lignification. Previously, we established that cytochrome P450 93G1 is a flavone synthase II (OsFNSII) indispensable for the biosynthesis of soluble tricin-derived metabolites in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). Here, our tricin-deficient <i>fnsII</i> mutant was analyzed further with an emphasis on its cell wall structure and properties. The mutant is similar in growth to wild-type control plants with normal vascular morphology. Chemical and nuclear magnetic resonance structural analyses demonstrated that the mutant lignin is completely devoid of tricin, indicating that FNSII activity is essential for the deposition of tricin-bound lignin in rice cell walls. The mutant also showed substantially reduced lignin content with decreased syringyl/guaiacyl lignin unit composition. Interestingly, the loss of tricin in the mutant lignin appears to be partially compensated by incorporating naringenin, which is a preferred substrate of OsFNSII. The <i>fnsII</i> mutant was further revealed to have enhanced enzymatic saccharification efficiency, suggesting that the cell wall recalcitrance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grass</span></strong> biomass may be reduced through the manipulation of the flavonoid monomer supply for lignification.</p>

A 2-Oxoglutarate-Dependent Dioxygenase Mediates the Biosynthesis of Glucoraphasatin in Radish
<p>Glucosinolates (GSLs) are secondary metabolites whose degradation products confer intrinsic flavors and aromas to Brassicaceae <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ables. Several structures of GSLs are known in the Brassicaceae, and the biosynthetic pathway and regulatory networks have been elucidated in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). GSLs are precursors of chemical defense substances against herbivorous pests. Specific GSLs can act as feeding blockers or stimulants, depending on the pest species. Natural selection has led to diversity in the GSL composition even within individual species. However, in radish (<i>Raphanus sativus</i>), glucoraphasatin (4-methylthio-3-butenyl glucosinolate) accounts for more than 90% of the total GSLs, and little compositional variation is observed. Because glucoraphasatin is not contained in other members of the Brassicaceae, like Arabidopsis and cabbage (<i>Brassica oleracea</i>), the biosynthetic pathways for glucoraphasatin remain unclear. In this report, we identified and characterized a gene encoding GLUCORAPHASATIN SYNTHASE 1 (GRS1) by genetic mapping using a mutant that genetically lacks glucoraphasatin. Transgenic Arabidopsis, which overexpressed <i>GRS1</i> cDNA, accumulated glucoraphasatin in the leaves. <i>GRS1</i> encodes a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase, and it is abundantly expressed in the leaf. To further investigate the biosynthesis and transportation of GSLs in radish, we grafted a <i>grs1</i> plant onto a wild-type plant. The grafting experiment revealed a leaf-to-root long-distance glucoraphasatin transport system in radish and showed that the composition of GSLs differed among the organs. Based on these observations, we propose a characteristic biosynthesis pathway for glucoraphasatin in radish. Our results should be useful in metabolite engineering for breeding of high-value <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ables.</p>

Loss of the Chloroplast Transit Peptide from an Ancestral C<sub>3</sub> Carbonic Anhydrase Is Associated with C<sub>4</sub> Evolution in the Grass Genus <i>Neurachne</i>
<p><i>Neurachne</i> is the only known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grass</span></strong> lineage containing closely related C<sub>3</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> intermediate, and C<sub>4</sub> species, making it an ideal taxon with which to study the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grass</span></strong>es. To begin dissecting the molecular changes that led to the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis in this group, the complementary DNAs encoding four distinct β-carbonic anhydrase (CA) isoforms were characterized from leaf tissue of <i>Neurachne munroi</i> (C<sub>4</sub>), <i>Neurachne minor</i> (C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>4</sub>), and <i>Neurachne alopecuroidea</i> (C<sub>3</sub>). Two genes (<i>CA1</i> and <i>CA2</i>) each encode two different isoforms: CA1a/CA1b and CA2a/CA2b. Transcript analyses found that <i>CA1</i> messenger RNAs were significantly more abundant than transcripts from the <i>CA2</i> gene in the leaves of each species examined, constituting ∼99% of all β-CA transcripts measured. Localization experiments using green fluorescent protein fusion constructs showed that, while CA1b is a cytosolic CA in all three species, the CA1a proteins are differentially localized. The <i>N. alopecuroidea</i> and <i>N. minor</i> CA1a isoforms were imported into chloroplasts of <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaf cells, whereas <i>N. munroi</i> CA1a localized to the cytosol. Sequence analysis indicated an 11-amino acid deletion in the amino terminus of <i>N. munroi</i> CA1a relative to the C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> proteins, suggesting that chloroplast targeting of CA1a is the ancestral state and that loss of a functional chloroplast transit peptide in <i>N. munroi</i> CA1a is associated with the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis in <i>Neurachne</i> spp. Remarkably, this mechanism is homoplastic with the evolution of the C<sub>4</sub>-associated CA in the dicotyledonous genus <i>Flaveria</i>, although the actual mutations in the two lineages differ.</p>

A Flowering Locus C Homolog Is a Vernalization-Regulated Repressor in <i>Brachypodium</i> and Is Cold Regulated in Wheat
<p>Winter cereals require prolonged cold to transition from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative to reproductive development. This process, referred to as vernalization, has been extensively studied in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). In Arabidopsis, a key flowering repressor called <i>FLOWERING LOCUS C</i> (<i>FLC</i>) quantitatively controls the vernalization requirement. By contrast, in cereals, the vernalization response is mainly regulated by the <i>VERNALIZATION</i> genes, <i>VRN1</i> and <i>VRN2</i>. Here, we characterize <i>ODDSOC2</i>, a recently identified <i>FLC</i> ortholog in monocots, knowing that it belongs to the <i>FLC</i> lineage. By studying its expression in a diverse set of <i>Brachypodium</i> accessions, we find that it is a good predictor of the vernalization requirement. Analyses of transgenics demonstrated that <i>BdODDSOC2</i> functions as a vernalization-regulated flowering repressor. In most <i>Brachypodium</i> accessions <i>BdODDSOC2</i> is down-regulated by cold, and in one of the winter accessions in which this down-regulation was evident, <i>BdODDSOC2</i> responded to cold before <i>BdVRN1.</i> When stably down-regulated, the mechanism is associated with spreading H3K27me3 modifications at the <i>BdODDSOC2</i> chromatin. Finally, homoeolog-specific gene expression analyses identify <i>TaAGL33</i> and its splice variant <i>TaAGL22</i> as the <i>FLC</i> orthologs in wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) behaving most similar to <i>Brachypodium ODDSOC2</i>. Overall, our study suggests that <i>ODDSOC2</i> is not only phylogenetically related to <i>FLC</i> in eudicots but also functions as a flowering repressor in the vernalization pathway of <i>Brachypodium</i> and likely other temperate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grass</span></strong>es. These insights could prove useful in breeding efforts to refine the vernalization requirement of temperate cereals and adapt varieties to changing climates.</p>

Stability of Single-Parent Gene Expression Complementation in Maize Hybrids upon Water Deficit Stress
<p>Heterosis is the superior performance of F1 hybrids compared with their homozygous, genetically distinct parents. In this study, we monitored the transcriptomic divergence of the maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) inbred lines B73 and Mo17 and their reciprocal F1 hybrid progeny in primary roots under control and water deficit conditions simulated by polyethylene glycol treatment. Single-parent expression (SPE) of genes is an extreme instance of gene expression complementation, in which genes are active in only one of two parents but are expressed in both reciprocal hybrids. In this study, 1,997 genes only expressed in B73 and 2,024 genes only expressed in Mo17 displayed SPE complementation under control and water deficit conditions. As a consequence, the number of active genes in hybrids exceeded the number of active genes in the parental inbred lines significantly independent of treatment. SPE patterns were substantially more stable to expression changes by water deficit treatment than other genotype-specific expression profiles. While, on average, 75% of all SPE patterns were not altered in response to polyethylene glycol treatment, only 17% of the remaining genotype-specific expression patterns were not changed by water deficit. Nonsyntenic genes that lack syntenic orthologs in other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grass</span></strong> species, and thus evolved late in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grass</span></strong> lineage, were significantly overrepresented among SPE genes. Hence, the significant overrepresentation of nonsyntenic genes among SPE patterns and their stability under water limitation might suggest a function of these genes during the early developmental manifestation of heterosis under fluctuating environmental conditions in hybrid progeny of the inbred lines B73 and Mo17.</p>

Genetic Architecture of Flowering-Time Variation in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i><xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The transition to reproductive development is a crucial step in the plant life cycle, and the timing of this transition is an important factor in crop yields. Here, we report new insights into the genetic control of natural variation in flowering time in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>, a nondomesticated pooid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grass</span></strong> closely related to cereals such as wheat (<i>Triticum</i> spp.) and barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i> L.). A recombinant inbred line population derived from a cross between the rapid-flowering accession Bd21 and the delayed-flowering accession Bd1-1 were grown in a variety of environmental conditions to enable exploration of the genetic architecture of flowering time. A genotyping-by-sequencing approach was used to develop SNP markers for genetic map construction, and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that control differences in flowering time were identified. Many of the flowering-time QTLs are detected across a range of photoperiod and vernalization conditions, suggesting that the genetic control of flowering within this population is robust. The two major QTLs identified in undomesticated <i>B. distachyon</i> colocalize with <i>VERNALIZATION1/PHYTOCHROME C</i> and <i>VERNALIZATION2</i>, loci identified as flowering regulators in the domesticated crops wheat and barley. This suggests that variation in flowering time is controlled in part by a set of genes broadly conserved within pooid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grass</span></strong>es.</p>

Natural Variation in <i>Brachypodium</i> Links Vernalization and Flowering Time Loci as Major Flowering Determinants
<p>The domestication of plants is underscored by the selection of agriculturally favorable developmental traits, including flowering time, which resulted in the creation of varieties with altered growth habits. Research into the pathways underlying these growth habits in cereals has highlighted the role of three main flowering regulators: <i>VERNALIZATION1</i> (<i>VRN1</i>), <i>VRN2</i>, and <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T</i> (<i>FT</i>). Previous reverse genetic studies suggested that the roles of <i>VRN1</i> and <i>FT</i> are conserved in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i> yet identified considerable ambiguity surrounding the role of <i>VRN2</i>. To investigate the natural diversity governing flowering time pathways in a nondomesticated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grass</span></strong>, the reference <i>B. distachyon</i> accession Bd21 was crossed with the vernalization-dependent accession ABR6. Resequencing of ABR6 allowed the creation of a single-nucleotide polymorphism-based genetic map at the F4 stage of the mapping population. Flowering time was evaluated in F4:5 families in five environmental conditions, and three major loci were found to govern flowering time. Interestingly, two of these loci colocalize with the <i>B. distachyon</i> homologs of the major flowering pathway genes <i>VRN2</i> and <i>FT</i>, whereas no linkage was observed at <i>VRN1</i>. Characterization of these candidates identified sequence and expression variation between the two parental genotypes, which may explain the contrasting growth habits. However, the identification of additional quantitative trait loci suggests that greater complexity underlies flowering time in this nondomesticated system. Studying the interaction of these regulators in <i>B. distachyon</i> provides insights into the evolutionary context of flowering time regulation in the Poaceae as well as elucidates the way humans have utilized the natural variation present in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grass</span></strong>es to create modern temperate cereals.</p>

<p>The brown alga, <i>Cladosiphon okamuranus</i> (Okinawa mozuku), is economically one of the most important edible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seawe</span></strong>eds, and is cultivated for market primarily in Okinawa, Japan. <i>C. okamuranus</i> constitutes a significant source of fucoidan, which has various physiological and biological activities. To facilitate studies of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seawe</span></strong>ed biology, we decoded the draft genome of <i>C. okamuranus</i> S-strain. The genome size of <i>C. okamuranus</i> was estimated as ∼140 Mbp, smaller than genomes of two other brown algae, <i>Ectocarpus siliculosus</i> and <i>Saccharina japonica</i>. Sequencing with ∼100× coverage yielded an assembly of 541 scaffolds with N50 = 416 kbp. Together with transcriptomic data, we estimated that the <i>C. okamuranus</i> genome contains 13,640 protein-coding genes, approximately 94% of which have been confirmed with corresponding mRNAs. Comparisons with the <i>E. siliculosus</i> genome identified a set of <i>C. okamuranus</i> genes that encode enzymes involved in biosynthetic pathways for sulfated fucans and alginate biosynthesis. In addition, we identified <i>C. okamuranus</i> genes for enzymes involved in phlorotannin biosynthesis.

Leaf and Plant Age Affects Photosynthetic Performance and Photoprotective Capacity
<p>In this work, we studied the changes in high-light tolerance and photosynthetic activity in leaves of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) rosette throughout the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative stage of growth. We implemented an image-analysis work flow to analyze the capacity of both the whole plant and individual leaves to cope with excess excitation energy by following the changes in absorbed light energy partitioning. The data show that leaf and plant age are both important factors influencing the fate of excitation energy. During the dark-to-light transition, the age of the plant affects mostly steady-state levels of photochemical and nonphotochemical quenching, leading to an increased photosynthetic performance of its leaves. The age of the leaf affects the induction kinetics of nonphotochemical quenching. These observations were confirmed using model selection procedures. We further investigated how different leaves on a rosette acclimate to high light and show that younger leaves are less prone to photoinhibition than older leaves. Our results stress that both plant and leaf age should be taken into consideration during the quantification of photosynthetic and photoprotective traits to produce repeatable and reliable results.</p>

Clathrin Heavy Chain Subunits Coordinate Endo- and Exocytic Traffic and Affect Stomatal Movement
<p>The current model for vesicular traffic to and from the plasma membrane is accepted, but the molecular requirements for this coordination are not well defined. We have identified the <i>hot ABA-deficiency suppressor1</i> mutant, which has a stomatal function defect, as a <i>clathrin heavy chain1</i> (<i>CHC1</i>) mutant allele and show that it has a decreased rate of endocytosis and growth defects that are shared with other <i>chc1</i> mutant alleles. We used <i>chc1</i> alleles and the related <i>chc2</i> mutant as tools to investigate the effects that clathrin defects have on secretion pathways and plant growth. We show that secretion and endocytosis at the plasma membrane are sensitive to CHC1 and CHC2 function in seedling roots and that <i>chc</i> mutants have physiological defects in stomatal function and plant growth that have not been described previously. These findings suggest that clathrin supports specific functions in multiple cell types. Stomata movement and gas exchange are altered in <i>chc</i> mutants, indicating that clathrin is important for stomatal regulation. The aberrant function of <i>chc</i> mutant stomata is consistent with the growth phenotypes observed under different water and light conditions, which also are similar to those of the secretory SNARE mutant, <i>syp121</i>. The <i>syp121</i> and <i>chc</i> mutants have impaired endocytosis and exocytosis compared with the wild type, indicating a link between SYP121-dependent secretion and clathrin-dependent endocytosis at the plasma membrane. Our findings provide evidence that clathrin and SYP121 functions are important for the coordination of endocytosis and exocytosis and have an impact on stomatal function, gas exchange, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative growth in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>).</p>

Catastrophic Unbalanced Genome Rearrangements Cause Somatic Loss of Berry Color in Grapevine
<p>Grape (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) color somatic variants that can be used to develop new grapevine cultivars occasionally appear associated with deletion events of uncertain origin. To understand the mutational mechanisms generating somatic structural variation in grapevine, we compared the Tempranillo Blanco (TB) white berry somatic variant with its black berry ancestor, Tempranillo Tinto. Whole-genome sequencing uncovered a catastrophic genome rearrangement in TB that caused the hemizygous deletion of 313 genes, including the loss of the functional copy for the <i>MYB</i> transcription factors required for anthocyanin pigmentation in the berry skin. Loss of heterozygosity and decreased copy number delimited interspersed monosomic and disomic regions in the right arm of linkage groups 2 and 5. At least 11 validated clustered breakpoints involving intrachromosomal and interchromosomal translocations between three linkage groups flanked the deleted fragments, which, according to segregation analyses, are phased in a single copy of each of the affected chromosomes. These hallmarks, along with the lack of homology between breakpoint joins and the randomness of the order and orientation of the rearranged fragments, are all consistent with a chromothripsis-like pattern generated after chromosome breakage and illegitimate rejoining. This unbalanced genome reshuffling has additional consequences in reproductive development. In TB, lack of sexual transmission of rearranged chromosomes associates with low gamete viability, which compromises fruit set and decreases fruit production. Our findings show that catastrophic genome rearrangements arise spontaneously and stabilize during plant somatic growth. These dramatic rearrangements generate new interesting phenotypes that can be selected for the improvement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>atively propagated plant species.</p>

The BABY BOOM Transcription Factor Activates the LEC1-ABI3-FUS3-LEC2 Network to Induce Somatic Embryogenesis
<p>Somatic embryogenesis is an example of induced cellular totipotency, where embryos develop from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative cells rather than from gamete fusion. Somatic embryogenesis can be induced in vitro by exposing explants to growth regulators and/or stress treatments. The BABY BOOM (BBM) and LEAFY COTYLEDON1 (LEC1) and LEC2 transcription factors are key regulators of plant cell totipotency, as ectopic overexpression of either transcription factor induces somatic embryo formation from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings without exogenous growth regulators or stress treatments. Although LEC and BBM proteins regulate the same developmental process, it is not known whether they function in the same molecular pathway. We show that BBM transcriptionally regulates <i>LEC1</i> and <i>LEC2</i>, as well as the two other <i>LAFL</i> genes, <i>FUSCA3</i> (<i>FUS3</i>) and <i>ABSCISIC ACID</i> <i>INSENSITIVE3</i> (<i>ABI3</i>). LEC2 and ABI3 quantitatively regulate BBM-mediated somatic embryogenesis, while FUS3 and LEC1 are essential for this process. BBM-mediated somatic embryogenesis is dose and context dependent, and the context-dependent phenotypes are associated with differential <i>LAFL</i> expression. We also uncover functional redundancy for somatic embryogenesis among other Arabidopsis BBM-like proteins and show that one of these proteins, PLETHORA2, also regulates <i>LAFL</i> gene expression. Our data place BBM upstream of other major regulators of plant embryo identity and totipotency.</p>

The Pseudoenzyme PDX1.2 Sustains Vitamin B<sub>6</sub> Biosynthesis as a Function of Heat Stress<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plants sense temperature changes and respond by altering growth and metabolic activity to acclimate to the altered environmental conditions. The B vitamins give rise to vital coenzymes that are indispensable for growth and development but their inherent reactive nature renders them prone to destruction especially under stress conditions. Therefore, plant survival strategies would be expected to include mechanisms to sustain B vitamin supply under demanding circumstances. Here, using the example of vitamin B<sub>6</sub>, we investigate the regulation of biosynthesis across eudicot and monocot species under heat stress. Most eudicots carry a pseudoenzyme PDX1.2 that is a noncatalytic homolog of the PDX1 subunit of the vitamin B<sub>6</sub> biosynthesis protein machinery, PYRIDOXINE BIOSYNTHESIS PROTEIN1. Using Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) as models, we show that <i>PDX1</i>.<i>2</i> is transcriptionally regulated by the HSFA1 transcription factor family. Monocots only carry catalytic <i>PDX1</i> homologs that do not respond to heat stress as demonstrated for rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), suggesting fundamental differences in the regulation of vitamin B<sub>6</sub> biosynthesis across the two lineages. Investigation of the molecular mechanism of <i>PDX1</i>.<i>2</i> transcription reveals two alternative transcriptional start sites, one of which is exclusive to heat stress. Further data suggest that PDX1.2 leads to stabilization of the catalytic PDX1s under heat stress conditions, which would serve to maintain vitamin B<sub>6</sub> homeostasis in times of need in eudicots that carry this gene. Our analyses indicate an important abiotic stress tolerance strategy in several eudicots, which has not been evolutionarily adapted (or is not required) by monocots such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grass</span></strong>es.</p>

Genetic Control of Plasticity in Root Morphology and Anatomy of Rice in Response to Water Deficit
<p>Elucidating the genetic control of rooting behavior under water-deficit stress is essential to breed climate-robust rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) cultivars. Using a diverse panel of 274 <i>indica</i> genotypes grown under control and water-deficit conditions during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative growth, we phenotyped 35 traits, mostly related to root morphology and anatomy, involving 45,000 root-scanning images and nearly 25,000 cross sections from the root-shoot junction. The phenotypic plasticity of these traits was quantified as the relative change in trait value under water-deficit compared with control conditions. We then carried out a genome-wide association analysis on these traits and their plasticity, using 45,608 high-quality single-nucleotide polymorphisms. One hundred four significant loci were detected for these traits under control conditions, 106 were detected under water-deficit stress, and 76 were detected for trait plasticity. We predicted 296 (control), 284 (water-deficit stress), and 233 (plasticity) a priori candidate genes within linkage disequilibrium blocks for these loci. We identified key a priori candidate genes regulating root growth and development and relevant alleles that, upon validation, can help improve rice adaptation to water-deficit stress.</p>

Hydroxystilbenes Are Monomers in Palm Fruit Endocarp Lignins
<p>Lignin, the plant cell wall polymer that binds fibers together but makes processing difficult, is traditionally formed from three monomers, the so-called monolignols (<i>p</i>-coumaryl, coniferyl, and sinapyl alcohols). Recently, we discovered, in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grass</span></strong> lignins, a phenolic monomer that falls outside the canonical lignin biosynthetic pathway, the flavone tricin. As we show here, palm fruit (macaéíéííéíúba [<i>Acrocomia aculeata</i>], carnauba [<i>Copernicia prunifera</i>], and coconut [<i>Cocos nucifera</i>]) endocarps contain lignin polymers derived in part from a previously unconsidered class of lignin monomers, the hydroxystilbenes, including the valuable compounds piceatannol and resveratrol. Piceatannol could be released from these lignins upon derivatization followed by reductive cleavage, a degradative method that cleaves β-ether bonds, indicating that at least a fraction is incorporated through labile ether bonds. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of products from the copolymerization of piceatannol and monolignols confirms the structures in the natural polymer and demonstrates that piceatannol acts as an authentic monomer participating in coupling and cross-coupling reactions during lignification. Therefore, palm fruit endocarps contain a new class of stilbenolignin polymers, further expanding the definition of lignin and implying that compounds such as piceatannol and resveratrol are potentially available in what is now essentially a waste product.</p>

The Auxin Biosynthetic <i>TRYPTOPHAN AMINOTRANSFERASE RELATED TaTAR2.1-3A</i> Increases Grain Yield of Wheat
<p>Controlling the major auxin biosynthetic pathway to manipulate auxin content could be a target for genetic engineering of crops with desired traits, but little progress had been made because low or high auxin contents often cause developmental inhibition. Here, we performed a genome-wide analysis of bread wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) to identify the Tryptophan Aminotransferase of Arabidopsis1/Tryptophan Aminotransferase-Related (TAA1/TAR) genes that function in the tryptophan-dependent pathway of auxin biosynthesis. Sequence mining together with gene cloning identified 15 <i>TaTAR</i> genes, among which 12 and three genes were phylogenetically close to Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) AtTAR2 and AtTAR3, respectively. <i>TaTAR2.1</i> had the most abundant transcripts in the <i>TaTAR2</i> genes and was expressed mainly in roots and up-regulated by low nitrogen (N) availability. Knockdown of <i>TaTAR2.1</i> caused <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative and reproductive deficiencies and impaired lateral root (LR) growth under both high- and low-N conditions. Overexpressing <i>TaTAR2.1-3A</i> in wheat enhanced LR branching, plant height, spike number, grain yield, and aerial N accumulation under different N supply levels. In addition, overexpressing <i>TaTAR2.1-3A</i> in Arabidopsis elevated auxin accumulation in the primary root tip, LR tip, LR primordia, and cotyledon and hypocotyl and increased primary root length, visible LR number, and shoot fresh weight under high- and low-N conditions. Our results indicate that <i>TaTAR2.1</i> is critical for wheat growth and also shows potential for genetic engineering to reach the aim of improving the grain yield of wheat.</p>

An R2R3-MYB Transcription Factor Regulates Capsaicinoid Biosynthesis
<p>Capsaicinoids are responsible for the hot taste of chili peppers. They are restricted to the genus <i>Capsicum</i> and are synthesized by the acylation of the aromatic compound vanillylamine (derived from the phenylpropanoid pathway) with a branched-chain fatty acid by the catalysis of the putative enzyme capsaicinoid synthase. R2R3-MYB transcription factors have been reported in different species of plants as regulators of structural genes of the phenylpropanoid pathway; therefore, we hypothesized that MYB genes might be involved in the regulation of the biosynthesis of pungent compounds. In this study, an <i>R2R3-MYB</i> transcription factor gene, designated <i>CaMYB31</i>, was isolated and characterized in <i>Capsicum annuum</i> ‘Tampiqueíííéóéííóéíño 74’. Bioinformatic analysis suggested that <i>CaMYB31</i> could be involved in secondary metabolism, stress and plant hormone responses, and development. <i>CaMYB31</i> expression analysis from placental tissue of pungent and nonpungent chili pepper fruits showed a positive correlation with the structural genes <i>Ca4H</i>, <i>Comt</i>, <i>Kas</i>, <i>pAmt</i>, and <i>AT3</i> expression and also with the content of capsaicin and dihydrocapsacin during fruit development. However, <i>CaMYB31</i> also was expressed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative tissues (leaves, roots, and stems). Moreover, <i>CaMYB31</i> silencing significantly reduced the expression of capsaicinoid biosynthetic genes and the capsaicinoid content. Additionally, <i>CaMYB31</i> expression was affected by the plant hormones indoleacetic acid, jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, and gibberellic acid or by wounding, temperature, and light, factors known to affect the production of capsaicinoids. These findings indicate that <i>CaMYB31</i> is indeed involved in the regulation of structural genes of the capsaicinoid biosynthetic pathway.</p>

Trimethylguanosine Synthase1 (TGS1) Is Essential for Chilling Tolerance
<p>Chilling stress is a major factor limiting plant development and crop productivity. Because the plant response to chilling is so complex, we are far from understanding the genes important in the response to chilling. To identify new genes important in chilling tolerance, we conducted a novel mutant screen, combining a confirmed SALK T-DNA insertion collection with traditional forward genetics. We screened a pool of more than 3700 confirmed homozygous SALK T-DNA insertion lines for visible defects under prolonged growth at 5°C. Of the chilling-sensitive mutants we observed, mutations at one locus were characterized in detail. This gene, At1g45231, encodes an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) trimethylguanosine synthase (TGS1), previously uncharacterized in the plant kingdom. We confirmed that Arabidopsis TGS1 is a functional ortholog of other trimethylguanosine synthases based both on its in vitro methyltransferase activity and on its ability to rescue the cold-growth inhibition of a <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae tgs1Δ</i> mutant in vivo. While <i>tgs1</i> mutant plants grew normally at 22°C, their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative and reproductive growth was severely compromised under chilling conditions. When we transgenically expressed <i>TGS1</i> in the mutant plants, the chilling-sensitive phenotype was relieved, demonstrating that TGS1 is required for chilling tolerance.</p>

<i>ATX3</i>, <i>ATX4</i>, and <i>ATX5</i> Encode Putative H3K4 Methyltransferases and Are Critical for Plant Development
<p>Methylation of Lys residues in the tail of the H3 histone is a key regulator of chromatin state and gene expression, conferred by a large family of enzymes containing an evolutionarily conserved SET domain. One of the main types of SET domain proteins are those controlling H3K4 di- and trimethylation. The genome of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) encodes 12 such proteins, including five ARABIDOPSIS TRITHORAX (ATX) proteins and seven ATX-Related proteins. Here, we examined three until-now-unexplored ATX proteins, ATX3, ATX4, and ATX5. We found that they exhibit similar domain structures and expression patterns and are redundantly required for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative and reproductive development. Concurrent disruption of the <i>ATX3</i>, <i>ATX4</i>, and <i>ATX5</i> genes caused marked reduction in H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 levels genome-wide and resulted in thousands of genes expressed ectopically. Furthermore, <i>atx3</i>/<i>atx4</i>/<i>atx5</i> triple mutants resulted in exaggerated phenotypes when combined with the <i>atx2</i> mutant but not with <i>atx1</i>. Together, we conclude that <i>ATX3</i>, <i>ATX4</i>, and <i>ATX5</i> are redundantly required for H3K4 di- and trimethylation at thousands of sites located across the genome, and genomic features associated with targeted regions are different from the <i>ATXR3</i>/<i>SDG2</i>-controlled sites in Arabidopsis.</p>

Insights into the Evolution of Hydroxyproline-Rich Glycoproteins from 1000 Plant Transcriptomes
<p>The carbohydrate-rich cell walls of land plants and algae have been the focus of much interest given the value of cell wall-based products to our current and future economies. Hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs), a major group of wall glycoproteins, play important roles in plant growth and development, yet little is known about how they have evolved in parallel with the polysaccharide components of walls. We investigate the origins and evolution of the HRGP superfamily, which is commonly divided into three major multigene families: the arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs), extensins (EXTs), and proline-rich proteins. Using motif and amino acid bias, a newly developed bioinformatics pipeline, we identified HRGPs in sequences from the 1000 Plants transcriptome project (<ext-link>www.onekp.com</ext-link>). Our analyses provide new insights into the evolution of HRGPs across major evolutionary milestones, including the transition to land and the early radiation of angiosperms. Significantly, data mining reveals the origin of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored AGPs in green algae and a 3- to 4-fold increase in GPI-AGPs in liverworts and mosses. The first detection of cross-linking (CL)-EXTs is observed in bryophytes, which suggests that CL-EXTs arose though the juxtaposition of preexisting SP<sub>n</sub> EXT glycomotifs with refined Y-based motifs. We also detected the loss of CL-EXT in a few lineages, including the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grass</span></strong> family (Poaceae), that have a cell wall composition distinct from other monocots and eudicots. A key challenge in HRGP research is tracking individual HRGPs throughout evolution. Using the 1000 Plants output, we were able to find putative orthologs of Arabidopsis pollen-specific GPI-AGPs in basal eudicots.</p>

Concerted Divergence after Gene Duplication in Polycomb Repressive Complexes
<p>Duplicated genes are a major contributor to genome evolution and phenotypic novelty. There are multiple possible evolutionary fates of duplicated genes. Here, we provide an example of concerted divergence of simultaneously duplicated genes whose products function in the same complex. We studied POLYCOMB REPRESSIVE COMPLEX2 (PRC2) in Brassicaceae. The VERNALIZATION (VRN)-PRC2 complex contains VRN2 and SWINGER (SWN), and both genes were duplicated during a whole-genome duplication to generate FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT SEED2 (FIS2) and MEDEA (MEA), which function in the Brassicaceae-specific FIS-PRC2 complex that regulates seed development. We examined the expression of <i>FIS2</i>, <i>MEA</i>, and their paralogs, compared their cytosine and histone methylation patterns, and analyzed the sequence evolution of the genes. We found that <i>FIS2</i> and <i>MEA</i> have reproductive-specific expression patterns that are correlated and derived from the broadly expressed <i>VRN2</i> and <i>SWN</i> in outgroup species. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative tissues of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), repressive methylation marks are enriched in <i>FIS2</i> and <i>MEA</i>, whereas active marks are associated with their paralogs. We detected comparable accelerated amino acid substitution rates in <i>FIS2</i> and <i>MEA</i> but not in their paralogs. We also show divergence patterns of the PRC2-associated <i>VERNALIZATION5/VIN3-LIKE2</i> that are similar to <i>FIS2</i> and <i>MEA</i>. These lines of evidence indicate that <i>FIS2</i> and <i>MEA</i> have diverged in concert, resulting in functional divergence of the PRC2 complexes in Brassicaceae. This type of concerted divergence is a previously unreported fate of duplicated genes. In addition, the Brassicaceae-specific FIS-PRC2 complex modified the regulatory pathways in female gametophyte and seed development.</p>

A Plant Cryptochrome Controls Key Features of the <i>Chlamydomonas</i> Circadian Clock and Its Life Cycle
<p>Cryptochromes are flavin-binding proteins that act as blue light receptors in bacteria, fungi, plants, and insects and are components of the circadian oscillator in mammals. Animal and plant cryptochromes are evolutionarily divergent, although the unicellular alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> (<i>Chlamydomonas</i> throughout) has both an animal-like cryptochrome and a plant cryptochrome (pCRY; formerly designated CPH1). Here, we show that the pCRY protein accumulates at night as part of a complex. Functional characterization of pCRY was performed based on an insertional mutant that expresses only 11% of the wild-type pCRY level. The <i>pcry</i> mutant is defective for central properties of the circadian clock. In the mutant, the period is lengthened significantly, ultimately resulting in arrhythmicity, while blue light-based phase shifts show large deviations from what is observed in wild-type cells. We also show that pCRY is involved in gametogenesis in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>. pCRY is down-regulated in pregametes and gametes, and in the <i>pcry</i> mutant, there is altered transcript accumulation under blue light of the strictly light-dependent, gamete-specific gene <i>GAS28</i>. pCRY acts as a negative regulator for the induction of mating ability in the light and for the loss of mating ability in the dark. Moreover, pCRY is necessary for light-dependent germination, during which the zygote undergoes meiosis that gives rise to four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative cells. In sum, our data demonstrate that pCRY is a key blue light receptor in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> that is involved in both circadian timing and life cycle progression.</p>

Spatial and Temporal Mapping of Key Lipid Species in <i>Brassica napus</i> Seeds
<p>The regulation of lipid synthesis in oil seeds is still not fully understood. Oilseed rape (<i>Brassica napus</i>) is the third most productive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>able oil crop on the global market; therefore, increasing our understanding of lipid accumulation in oilseed rape seeds is of great economic, as well as intellectual, importance. Matrix-assisted laser/desorption ionization-mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) is a technique that allows the mapping of metabolites directly onto intact biological tissues, giving a spatial context to metabolism. We have used MALDI-MSI to study the spatial distribution of two major lipid species, triacylglycerols and phosphatidylcholines. A dramatic, heterogenous landscape of molecular species was revealed, demonstrating significantly different lipid compositions between the various tissue types within the seed. The embryonic axis was found to be particularly enriched in palmitic acid, while the seed coat/aleurone layer accumulated vaccenic, linoleic, and α-linoleic acids. Furthermore, the lipid composition of the inner and outer cotyledons differed from each other, a remarkable discovery given the supposed identical functionality of these two tissues. Triacylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine molecular species distribution was analyzed through a developmental time series covering early seed lipid accumulation to seed maturity. The spatial patterning of lipid molecular species did not vary significantly during seed development. Data gathered using MALDI-MSI was verified through gas chromatography analysis of dissected seeds. The distinct lipid distribution profiles observed imply differential regulation of lipid metabolism between the different tissue types of the seed. Further understanding of this differential regulation will enhance efforts to improve oilseed rape productivity and quality.</p>

Bioorthogonal Noncanonical Amino Acid Tagging (BONCAT) Enables Time-Resolved Analysis of Protein Synthesis in Native Plant Tissue
<p>Proteomic plasticity undergirds stress responses in plants, and understanding such responses requires accurate measurement of the extent to which proteins levels are adjusted to counter external stimuli. Here, we adapt bioorthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) to interrogate protein synthesis in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings. BONCAT relies on the translational incorporation of a noncanonical amino acid probe into cellular proteins. In this study, the probe is the Met surrogate azidohomoalanine (Aha), which carries a reactive azide moiety in its amino acid side chain. The azide handle in Aha can be selectively conjugated to dyes and functionalized beads to enable visualization and enrichment of newly synthesized proteins. We show that BONCAT is sensitive enough to detect Arabidopsis proteins synthesized within a 30-min interval defined by an Aha pulse and that the method can be used to detect proteins made under conditions of light stress, osmotic shock, salt stress, heat stress, and recovery from heat stress. We further establish that BONCAT can be coupled to tandem liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to identify and quantify proteins synthesized during heat stress and recovery from heat stress. Our results are consistent with a model in which, upon the onset of heat stress, translation is rapidly reprogrammed to enhance the synthesis of stress mitigators and is again altered during recovery. All experiments were carried out with commercially available reagents, highlighting the accessibility of the BONCAT method to researchers interested in stress responses as well as translational and posttranslational regulation in plants.</p>

Heteroblastic Development of Transfer Cells Is Controlled by the microRNA miR156/SPL Module
<p>We report that wall ingrowth deposition in phloem parenchyma (PP) transfer cells (TCs) in leaf veins of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) represents a novel trait of heteroblasty. Development of PP TCs involves extensive deposition of wall ingrowths adjacent to cells of the sieve element/companion cell complex. These PP TCs potentially facilitate phloem loading by enhancing efflux of symplasmic Suc for subsequent active uptake into cells of the sieve element/companion cell complex. PP TCs with extensive wall ingrowths are ubiquitous in mature cotyledons and juvenile leaves, but dramatically less so in mature adult leaves, an observation consistent with PP TC development reflecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative phase change (VPC) in Arabidopsis. Consistent with this conclusion, the abundance of PP TCs with extensive wall ingrowths varied across rosette development in three ecotypes displaying differing durations of juvenile phase, and extensive deposition of wall ingrowths was observed in rejuvenated leaves following prolonged defoliation. PP TC development across juvenile, transition, and adult leaves correlated positively with levels of miR156, a major regulator of VPC in plants, and corresponding changes in wall ingrowth deposition were observed when miR156 was overexpressed or its activity suppressed by target mimicry. Analysis of plants carrying miR156-resistant forms of <i>SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN LIKE</i> (<i>SPL</i>) genes showed that wall ingrowth deposition was increased in <i>SPL9</i>-group but not <i>SPL3</i>-group genes, indicating that <i>SPL9</i>-group genes may function as negative regulators of wall ingrowth deposition in PP TCs. Collectively, our results point to wall ingrowth deposition in PP TCs being under control of the genetic program regulating VPC.</p>

The Formation and Sequestration of Nonendogenous Ketocarotenoids in Transgenic <i>Nicotiana glauca</i>
<p>Ketolated and hydroxylated carotenoids are high-value compounds with industrial, food, and feed applications. Chemical synthesis is currently the production method of choice for these compounds, with no amenable plant sources readily available. In this study, the 4,4′ β-oxygenase (<i>crtW</i>) and 3,3′ β-hydroxylase (c<i>rtZ</i>) genes from <i>Brevundimonas</i> sp. SD-212 were expressed under constitutive transcriptional control in <i>Nicotiana glauca</i>, which has an emerging potential as a biofuel and biorefining feedstock. The transgenic lines produced significant levels of nonendogenous carotenoids in all tissues. In leaf and flower, the carotenoids (∼0.5% dry weight) included 0.3% and 0.48%, respectively, of nonendogenous ketolated and hydroxylated carotenoids. These were 4-ketolutein, echinenone (and its 3-hydroxy derivatives), canthaxanthin, phoenicoxanthin, 4-ketozeaxanthin, and astaxanthin. Stable, homozygous genotypes expressing both transgenes inherited the chemotype. Subcellular fractionation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative tissues and microscopic analysis revealed the presence of ketocarotenoids in thylakoid membranes, not predominantly in the photosynthetic complexes but in plastoglobules. Despite ketocarotenoid production and changes in cellular ultrastructure, intermediary metabolite levels were not dramatically affected. The study illustrates the utility of <i>Brevundimonas</i> sp. SD-212 CRTZ and CRTW to produce ketocarotenoids in a plant species that is being evaluated as a biorefining feedstock, the adaptation of the plastid to sequester nonendogenous carotenoids, and the robustness of plant metabolism to these changes.</p>

Molecular Regulation of Temperature-Dependent Floral Induction in <i>Tulipa gesneriana</i>
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative-to-reproductive phase change in tulip (<i>Tulipa gesneriana</i>) is promoted by increasing temperatures during spring. The warm winters of recent years interfere with this process and are calling for new adapted cultivars. A better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms would be of help, but unlike the model plant Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), very little is known about floral induction in tulip. To shed light on the gene regulatory network controlling flowering in tulip, RNA sequencing was performed on meristem-enriched tissue collected under two contrasting temperature conditions, low and high. The start of reproductive development correlated with rounding of the shoot apical meristem and induction of <i>TGSQA</i> expression, a tulip gene with a high similarity to Arabidopsis <i>APETALA1</i>. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes showed the overrepresentation of genes potentially involved in floral induction, bulb maturation, and dormancy establishment. Expression analysis revealed that <i>TERMINAL FLOWER1</i> (<i>TgTFL1</i>) and <i>SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS1-like1</i> (<i>TgSOC1-like1</i>) might be repressors, whereas <i>TgSOC1-like2</i> likely is an activator, of flowering. Subsequently, the flowering time-associated expression of eight potential flowering time genes was confirmed in three tulip cultivars grown in the field. Additionally, heterologous functional analyses in Arabidopsis resulted in flowering time phenotypes in line with <i>TgTFL1</i> being a floral repressor and <i>TgSOC1-like2</i> being a floral activator in tulip. Taken together, we have shown that long before morphological changes occur in the shoot apical meristem, the expression of floral repressors in tulip is suppressed by increased ambient temperatures, leading either directly or indirectly to the activation of potential flowering activators shortly before the commencement of the phase change.</p>

We have identified <i>AT5G01075</i> as the subtending gene encoding a small protein of 81 amino acids localized in the endoplasmic reticulum. <i>TWS1</i> is strongly expressed in seeds, where it regulates both embryo development and accumulation of storage compounds. <i>TWS1</i> loss-of-function seeds exhibit increased starch, sucrose, and protein accumulation at the detriment of fatty acids. <i>TWS1</i> is also expressed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative and reproductive tissues, where it is responsible for proper epidermal cell morphology and overall plant growth. At the cellular level, <i>TWS1</i> is responsible for cuticle deposition on epidermal cells and organization of the endomembrane system. Finally, we show that <i>TWS1</i> is a single-copy gene in Arabidopsis, and it is specifically conserved among angiosperms.</p>

A tailless aerial robotic flapper reveals that flies use torque coupling in rapid banked turns
<p>Insects are among the most agile natural flyers. Hypotheses on their flight control cannot always be validated by experiments with animals or tethered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">robot</span></strong>s. To this end, we developed a programmable and agile autonomous free-flying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">robot</span></strong> controlled through bio-inspired motion changes of its flapping wings. Despite being 55 times the size of a fruit fly, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">robot</span></strong> can accurately mimic the rapid escape maneuvers of flies, including a correcting yaw rotation toward the escape heading. Because the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">robot</span></strong>’s yaw control was turned off, we showed that these yaw rotations result from passive, translation-induced aerodynamic coupling between the yaw <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">torqu</span></strong>e and the roll and pitch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">torqu</span></strong>es produced throughout the maneuver. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">robot</span></strong> enables new methods for studying animal flight, and its flight characteristics allow for real-world flight missions.</p>

A cargo-sorting DNA robot
<p>Two critical challenges in the design and synthesis of molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">robot</span></strong>s are modularity and algorithm simplicity. We demonstrate three modular building blocks for a DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">robot</span></strong> that performs cargo sorting at the molecular level. A simple algorithm encoding recognition between cargos and their destinations allows for a simple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">robot</span></strong> design: a single-stranded DNA with one leg and two foot domains for walking, and one arm and one hand domain for picking up and dropping off cargos. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">robot</span></strong> explores a two-dimensional testing ground on the surface of DNA origami, picks up multiple cargos of two types that are initially at unordered locations, and delivers them to specified destinations until all molecules are sorted into two distinct piles. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">robot</span></strong> is designed to perform a random walk without any energy supply. Exploiting this feature, a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">robot</span></strong> can repeatedly sort multiple cargos. Localization on DNA origami allows for distinct cargo-sorting tasks to take place simultaneously in one test tube or for multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">robot</span></strong>s to collectively perform the same task.</p>

An empirical study of the wound effect on sap flux density measured with thermal dissipation probes
<p>The insertion of thermal dissipation (TD) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong>s on tree stems for sap flux density (SFD) measurements can lead to SFD underestimations due to a wound formation close to the drill hole. However, the wound effect has not been assessed experimentally for this method yet. Here, we propose an empirical approach to investigate the effect of the wound healing on measured sap flux with TD probes. The approach was performed for both, diffuse-porous (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i> (Linnaeus)) and ring-porous (<i>Quercus petraea</i> (Lieblein)) species. Thermal dissipation probes were installed on different dates along the growing season to document the effects of the dynamic wound formation. The trees were cut in autumn and additional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong>s were installed in the cut stems, therefore, without potential effects of wound development. A range of water pressures was applied to the stem segments and SFDs were simultaneously measured by TD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong>s as well as gravimetrically in the laboratory. The formation of wounds around <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong>s installed in living tree stems led to underestimation of SFD by 21.4 ± 3 and 47.5 ± 3.8% in beech and oak, respectively. The differences between SFD underestimations of diffuse-porous beech and ring-porous oak were, however, not statistically significant. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong>s with 5-, 11- and 22-week-old wounds also showed no significant differences, which implies that the influence of wound formation on SFD estimates was completed within the first few weeks after perforation. These results were confirmed by time courses of SFD measurements in the field. Field SFD values decreased immediately after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong> installation and reached stable values after ~2 weeks with similar underestimations to the ones observed in the laboratory. We therefore propose a feasible approach to correct directly field observations of SFD for potential underestimations due to the wound effect.</p>

Mechanism of transmembrane signaling by sensor histidine kinases
<p>One of the major and essential classes of transmembrane (TM) receptors, present in all domains of life, is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong> histidine kinases, parts of two-component signaling systems (TCSs). The structural mechanisms of TM signaling by these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong>s are poorly understood. We present crystal structures of the periplasmic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong> domain, the TM domain, and the cytoplasmic HAMP domain of the <i>Escherichia coli</i> nitrate/nitrite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong> histidine kinase NarQ in the ligand-bound and mutated ligand-free states. The structures reveal that the ligand binding induces rearrangements and pistonlike shifts of TM helices. The HAMP domain protomers undergo leverlike motions and convert these pistonlike motions into helical rotations. Our findings provide the structural framework for complete understanding of TM TCS signaling and for development of antimicrobial treatments targeting TCSs.</p>

Measuring the ratio of CO<sub>2</sub> efflux to O<sub>2</sub> influx in tree stem respiration
<p>In recent studies, the ratio of tree stem CO<sub>2</sub> efflux to O<sub>2</sub> influx has been defined as the apparent respiratory quotient (ARQ). The metabolism of carbohydrates, the putative respiratory substrate in trees, is expected to yield an ARQ of 1.0. However, previous studies have reported ARQ values ranging between 0.23 and 0.90. These interesting results may indicate internal transport of respired CO<sub>2</sub> within stems; yet no simple field applicable methods for ARQ measurement have been available. Here, we report on the assembly of a closed circulating system called ‘<i>Hampadah</i>’, which uses CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> analyzers to measure air samples from stem chambers. We tested the performance of the <i>Hampadah</i> with samples from 36 trees (<i>Tetragastris panamensis</i> (Engl.) Kuntze). Additionally, we showed the feasibility of measuring ARQ directly from stem chambers, using portable CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong>s, in both discrete and continuous modes of operation. The <i>Hampadah</i> measurement proved to be consistent with CO<sub>2</sub> gas standards (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.999) and with O<sub>2</sub> determined by O<sub>2</sub>/Ar measurements with a mass spectrometer (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.998). The <i>Hampadah</i> gave highly reproducible results for ARQ determination of field samples (±0.01 for duplicates). The portable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong>s measurement showed good correlation with the <i>Hampadah</i> in measuring CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub> and ARQ (<i>n</i> = 5, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.97, 0.98 and 0.91, respectively). We have demonstrated here that the <i>Hampadah</i> and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong>s’ methods enable accurate ARQ measurements for both laboratory and field research.</p>

Intracellular cavity of sensor domain controls allosteric gating of TRPA1 channel
<p>Transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) is a temperature-sensitive ion channel activated by various pungent and irritant compounds that can produce pain in humans. Its activation involves an allosteric mechanism whereby electrophilic agonists evoke interactions within cytosolic domains and open the channel pore through an integrated nexus formed by intracellular membrane proximal regions that are densely packed beneath the lower segment of the S1–S4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong> domain. Studies indicate that this part of the channel may contain residues that form a water-accessible cavity that undergoes changes in solvation during channel gating. We identified conserved polar residues facing the putative lower crevice of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong> domain that were crucial determinants of the electrophilic, voltage, and calcium sensitivity of the TRPA1 channel. This part of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong> may also comprise a domain capable of binding to membrane phosphoinositides through which gating of the channel is regulated in a state-dependent manner.</p>

The amino-terminal domain with a fold distinct among known TRP structures, together with the carboxyl-terminal region, forms a large two-layered cytosolic ring that extensively interacts with the transmembrane channel layer. The structure suggests that the menthol-binding site is located within the voltage-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong>–like domain and thus provides a structural glimpse of the design principle of the molecular transducer for cold and menthol sensation.</p>

The apo-structure of the leucine sensor Sestrin2 is still elusive
<p>Sestrin2 is a GATOR2-interacting protein that directly binds leucine and is required for the inhibition of mTORC1 under leucine deprivation, indicating that it is a leucine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong> for the mTORC1 pathway. We recently reported the structure of Sestrin2 in complex with leucine [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID, 5DJ4] and demonstrated that mutations in the leucine-binding pocket that alter the affinity of Sestrin2 for leucine result in a corresponding change in the leucine sensitivity of mTORC1 in cells. A lower resolution structure of human Sestrin2 (PDB ID, 5CUF), which was crystallized in the absence of exogenous leucine, showed Sestrin2 to be in a nearly identical conformation as the leucine-bound structure. On the basis of this observation, it has been argued that leucine binding does not affect the conformation of Sestrin2 and that Sestrin2 may not be a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong> for leucine. We show that simple analysis of the reported “apo”-Sestrin2 structure reveals the clear presence of prominent, unmodeled electron density in the leucine-binding pocket that exactly accommodates the leucine observed in the higher resolution structure. Refining the reported apo-structure with leucine eliminated the large <i>F</i><sub>obs</sub>-<i>F</i><sub>calc</sub> difference density at this position and improved the working and free R factors of the model. Consistent with this result, our own structure of Sestrin2 crystallized in the absence of exogenous leucine also contained electron density that is best explained by leucine. Thus, the structure of apo-Sestrin2 remains elusive.</p>

Architecture of the complete oxygen-sensing FixL-FixJ two-component signal transduction system
<p>The symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacterium <i>Bradyrhizobium japonicum</i> is critical to the agro-industrial production of soybean because it enables the production of high yields of soybeans with little use of nitrogenous fertilizers. The FixL and FixJ two-component system (TCS) of this bacterium ensures that nitrogen fixation is only stimulated under conditions of low oxygen. When it is not bound to oxygen, the histidine kinase FixL undergoes autophosphorylation and transfers phosphate from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to the response regulator FixJ, which, in turn, stimulates the expression of genes required for nitrogen fixation. We purified full-length <i>B. japonicum</i> FixL and FixJ proteins and defined their structures individually and in complex using small-angle x-ray scattering, crystallographic, and in silico modeling techniques. Comparison of active and inactive forms of FixL suggests that intramolecular signal transduction is driven by local changes in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong> domain and in the coiled-coil region connecting the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong> and histidine kinase domains. We also found that FixJ exhibits conformational plasticity not only in the monomeric state but also in tetrameric complexes with FixL during phosphotransfer. This structural characterization of a complete TCS contributes both a mechanistic and evolutionary understanding to TCS signal relay, specifically in the context of the control of nitrogen fixation in root nodules.</p>

The lncRNA H19 mediates breast cancer cell plasticity during EMT and MET plasticity by differentially sponging miR-200b/c and let-7b
<p>Metastasis is a multistep process by which tumor cells disseminate from their primary site and form secondary tumors at a distant site. The pathophysiological course of metastasis is mediated by the dynamic plasticity of cancer cells, which enables them to shift between epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes through a transcriptionally regulated program termed epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and its reverse process, mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET). Using a mouse model of spontaneous metastatic breast cancer, we investigated the molecular mediators of metastatic competence within a heterogeneous primary tumor and how these cells then <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manipul</span></strong>ated their epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity during the metastatic process. We isolated cells from the primary mammary tumor, the circulation, and metastatic lesions in the lung in TA2 mice and found that the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) H19 mediated EMT and MET by differentially acting as a sponge for the microRNAs miR-200b/c and let-7b. We found that this ability enabled H19 to modulate the expression of the microRNA targets <i>Git2</i> and <i>Cyth3</i>, respectively, which encode regulators of the RAS superfamily member adenosine 5′-diphosphate (ADP) ribosylation factor (ARF), a guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) that promotes cell migration associated with EMT and disseminating tumor cells. Decreasing the abundance of H19 or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manipul</span></strong>ating that of members in its axis prevented metastasis from grafts in syngeneic mice. Abundance of H19, GIT2, and CYTH3 in patient samples further suggests that H19 might be exploited as a biomarker for metastatic cells within breast tumors and perhaps as a therapeutic target to prevent metastasis.</p>

The cytotoxic type 3 secretion system 1 of <i>Vibrio</i> rewires host gene expression to subvert cell death and activate cell survival pathways
<p>Bacterial effectors potently <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manipul</span></strong>ate host signaling pathways. The marine bacterium <i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</i> (<i>V. para</i>) delivers effectors into host cells through two type 3 secretion systems (T3SSs). T3SS1 is vital for <i>V. para</i> survival in the environment, whereas T3SS2 causes acute gastroenteritis in human hosts. Although the natural host is undefined, T3SS1 effectors attack highly conserved cellular processes and pathways to orchestrate nonapoptotic cell death. To understand how the concerted action of T3SS1 effectors globally affects host cell signaling, we compared gene expression changes over time in primary fibroblasts infected with <i>V. para</i> that have a functional T3SS1 (T3SS1<sup>+</sup>) to those in cells infected with <i>V. para</i> lacking T3SS1 (T3SS1<sup>−</sup>). Overall, the host transcriptional response to both T3SS1<sup>+</sup> and T3SS1<sup>−</sup> <i>V. para</i> was rapid, robust, and temporally dynamic. T3SS1 rewired host gene expression by specifically altering the expression of 398 genes. Although T3SS1 effectors targeted host cells at the posttranslational level to cause cytotoxicity, <i>V. para</i> T3SS1 also precipitated a host transcriptional response that initially activated cell survival and repressed cell death networks. The increased expression of several key prosurvival transcripts mediated by T3SS1 depended on a host signaling pathway that is silenced posttranslationally later in infection. Together, our analysis reveals a complex interplay between the roles of T3SS1 as both a transcriptional and posttranslational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manipul</span></strong>ator of host cell signaling.</p>

We describe advances in biocuration, query interface design, and data visualization that enhance the discovery of uncharacterized biology in these pathways using this tool. Transcriptomine currently contains about 45 million data points encompassing more than 2000 experiments in a reference library of nearly 550 data sets retrieved from public archives and systematically curated. To make the underlying data points more accessible to bench biologists, we classified experimental small molecules and gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manipul</span></strong>ations into signaling pathways and experimental tissues and cell lines into physiological systems and organs. Incorporation of these mappings into Transcriptomine enables the user to readily evaluate tissue-specific regulation of gene expression by nuclear receptor signaling pathways. Data points from animal and cell model experiments and from clinical data sets elucidate the roles of nuclear receptor pathways in gene expression events accompanying various normal and pathological cellular processes. In addition, data sets targeting non-nuclear receptor signaling pathways highlight transcriptional cross-talk between nuclear receptors and other signaling pathways. We demonstrate with specific examples how data points that exist in isolation in individual data sets validate each other when connected and made accessible to the user in a single interface. In summary, Transcriptomine allows bench biologists to routinely develop research hypotheses, validate experimental data, or model relationships between signaling pathways, genes, and tissues.</p>

Stable Casimir equilibria and quantum trapping
<p>The Casimir interaction between two parallel metal plates in close proximity is usually thought of as an attractive interaction.

With such a stable Casimir equilibrium, we experimentally demonstrate passive Casimir trapping of an object in the vicinity of another at the nanometer scale, without requiring any external energy input.

Thus, the hyperfine spectrum becomes a powerful probe of the chemical environment of individual atoms and nanostructures.</p>

Cellular checkpoint control using programmable sequential logic
<p>Biological processes that require orderly progression, such as growth and differentiation, proceed via regulatory checkpoints where the cell waits for signals before continuing to the next state. Implementing such control would allow genetic engineers to divide complex tasks into stages. We present genetic circuits that encode sequential logic to instruct <i>Escherichia coli</i> to proceed through a linear or cyclical sequence of states. These are built with 11 set-reset latches, designed with repressor-based NOR gates, which can connect to each other and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong>s. The performance of circuits with up to three latches and four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong>s, including a gated D latch, closely match predictions made by using nonlinear dynamics. Checkpoint control is demonstrated by switching cells between multiple circuit states in response to external signals over days.</p>

Semisynthetic sensor proteins enable metabolic assays at the point of care
<p>Monitoring metabolites at the point of care could improve the diagnosis and management of numerous diseases. Yet for most metabolites, such assays are not available. We introduce semisynthetic, light-emitting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong> proteins for use in paper-based metabolic assays. The metabolite is oxidized by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong> changes color in the presence of the reduced cofactor, enabling metabolite quantification with the use of a digital camera. The approach makes any metabolite that can be oxidized by the cofactor a candidate for quantitative point-of-care assays, as shown for phenylalanine, glucose, and glutamate. Phenylalanine blood levels of phenylketonuria patients were analyzed at the point of care within minutes with only 0.5 microliters of blood. Results were within 15% of those obtained with standard testing methods.</p>

Metal-free three-dimensional perovskite ferroelectrics
<p>Inorganic perovskite ferroelectrics are widely used in nonvolatile memory elements, capacitors, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong>s because of their excellent ferroelectric and other properties. Organic ferroelectrics are desirable for their mechanical flexibility, low weight, environmentally friendly processing, and low processing temperatures. Although almost a century has passed since the first ferroelectric, Rochelle salt, was discovered, examples of highly desirable organic perovskite ferroelectrics are lacking. We found a family of metal-free organic perovskite ferroelectrics with the characteristic three-dimensional structure, among which MDABCO (<i>N</i>-methyl-<i>N'</i>-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octonium)–ammonium triiodide has a spontaneous polarization of 22 microcoulombs per square centimeter [close to that of barium titanate (BTO)], a high phase transition temperature of 448 kelvins (above that of BTO), and eight possible polarization directions.

Ultrafast neuronal imaging of dopamine dynamics with designed genetically encoded sensors
<p>Neuromodulatory systems exert profound influences on brain function. Understanding how these systems modify the operating mode of target circuits requires spatiotemporally precise measurement of neuromodulator release.

Improving mechanical sensor performance through larger damping
<p>Mechanical resonances are used in a wide variety of devices, from smartphone accelerometers to computer clocks and from wireless filters to atomic force microscopes. Frequency stability, a critical performance metric, is generally assumed to be tantamount to resonance quality factor (the inverse of the linewidth and of the damping). We show that the frequency stability of resonant nanomechanical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong>s can be improved by lowering the quality factor. At high bandwidths, quality-factor reduction is completely mitigated by increases in signal-to-noise ratio. At low bandwidths, notably, increased damping leads to better stability and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong> resolution, with improvement proportional to damping. We confirm the findings by demonstrating temperature resolution of 60 microkelvin at 300-hertz bandwidth. These results open the door to high-performance ultrasensitive resonators in gaseous or liquid environments, single-cell nanocalorimetry, nanoscale gas chromatography, atmospheric-pressure nanoscale mass spectrometry, and new approaches in crystal oscillator stability.</p>

The spread of true and false news online
<p>We investigated the differential diffusion of all of the verified true and false news stories distributed on Twitter from 2006 to 2017. The data comprise ~126,000 stories tweeted by ~3 million people more than 4.5 million times. We classified news as true or false using information from six independent fact-checking organizations that exhibited 95 to 98% agreement on the classifications. Falsehood diffused significantly farther, faster, deeper, and more broadly than the truth in all categories of information, and the effects were more pronounced for false political news than for false news about terrorism, natural disasters, science, urban legends, or financial information. We found that false news was more novel than true news, which suggests that people were more likely to share novel information. Whereas false stories inspired fear, disgust, and surprise in replies, true stories inspired anticipation, sadness, joy, and trust. Contrary to conventional wisdom, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">robot</span></strong>s accelerated the spread of true and false news at the same rate, implying that false news spreads more than the truth because humans, not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">robot</span></strong>s, are more likely to spread it.</p>

Phase separation of a yeast prion protein promotes cellular fitness
<p>Despite the important role of prion domains in neurodegenerative disease, their physiological function has remained enigmatic. Previous work with yeast prions has defined prion domains as sequences that form self-propagating aggregates. Here, we uncovered an unexpected function of the canonical yeast prion protein Sup35. In stressed conditions, Sup35 formed protective gels via pH-regulated liquid-like phase separation followed by gelation. Phase separation was mediated by the N-terminal prion domain and regulated by the adjacent pH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong> domain. Phase separation promoted yeast cell survival by rescuing the essential Sup35 translation factor from stress-induced damage. Thus, prion-like domains represent conserved environmental stress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong>s that facilitate rapid adaptation in unstable environments by modifying protein phase behavior.</p>

Second messenger–mediated tactile response by a bacterial rotary motor
<p>When bacteria encounter surfaces, they respond with surface colonization and virulence induction. The mechanisms of bacterial mechanosensation and downstream signaling remain poorly understood. Here, we describe a tactile sensing cascade in <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i> in which the flagellar motor acts as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong>. Surface-induced motor interference stimulated the production of the second messenger cyclic diguanylate by the motor-associated diguanylate cyclase DgcB. This led to the allosteric activation of the glycosyltransferase HfsJ to promote rapid synthesis of a polysaccharide adhesin and surface anchoring. Although the membrane-embedded motor unit was essential for surface sensing, mutants that lack external flagellar structures were hypersensitive to mechanical stimuli. Thus, the bacterial flagellar motor acts as a tetherless <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong> reminiscent of mechanosensitive channels.</p>

Phytochrome B integrates light and temperature signals in <i>Arabidopsis</i>
<p>Ambient temperature regulates many aspects of plant growth and development, but its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong>s are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the phytochrome B (phyB) photoreceptor participates in temperature perception through its temperature-dependent reversion from the active Pfr state to the inactive Pr state. Increased rates of thermal reversion upon exposing <i>Arabidopsis</i> seedlings to warm environments reduce both the abundance of the biologically active Pfr-Pfr dimer pool of phyB and the size of the associated nuclear bodies, even in daylight. Mathematical analysis of stem growth for seedlings expressing wild-type phyB or thermally stable variants under various combinations of light and temperature revealed that phyB is physiologically responsive to both signals. We therefore propose that in addition to its photoreceptor functions, phyB is a temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong> in plants.</p>

A Synthetic Oxygen Sensor for Plants Based on Animal Hypoxia Signaling
<p>Due to the involvement of oxygen in many essential metabolic reactions, all living organisms have developed molecular systems that allow adaptive physiological and metabolic transitions depending on oxygen availability. In mammals, the expression of hypoxia-response genes is controlled by the heterodimeric Hypoxia-Inducible Factor. The activity of this transcriptional regulator is linked mainly to the oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of conserved proline residues in its α-subunit, carried out by prolyl-hydroxylases, and subsequent ubiquitination via the E3 ligase von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor, which targets Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-α to the proteasome. By exploiting bioengineered versions of this mammalian oxygen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong>, we designed and optimized a synthetic device that drives gene expression in an oxygen-dependent fashion in plants. Transient assays in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mesophyll protoplasts indicated that a combination of the yeast Gal4/upstream activating sequence system and the mammalian oxygen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong> machinery can be used effectively to engineer a modular, oxygen-inducible transcriptional regulator. This synthetic device also was shown to be selectively controlled by oxygen in whole plants when its components were expressed stably in Arabidopsis seedlings. We envision the exploitation of our genetically encoded controllers to generate plants able to switch gene expression selectively depending on oxygen availability, thereby providing a proof of concept for the potential of synthetic biology to assist agricultural practices in environments with variable oxygen provision.</p>

Manipulation of a Senescence-Associated Gene Improves Fleshy Fruit Yield
<p>Senescence is the process that marks the end of a leaf’s lifespan. As it progresses, the massive macromolecular catabolism dismantles the chloroplasts and, consequently, decreases the photosynthetic capacity of these organs. Thus, senescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manipul</span></strong>ation is a strategy to improve plant yield by extending the leaf’s photosynthetically active window of time. However, it remains to be addressed if this approach can improve fleshy fruit production and nutritional quality. One way to delay senescence initiation is by regulating key transcription factors (TFs) involved in triggering this process, such as the NAC TF ORESARA1 (ORE1). Here, three senescence-related NAC TFs from tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) were identified, namely SlORE1S02, SlORE1S03, and SlORE1S06. All three genes were shown to be responsive to senescence-inducing stimuli and posttranscriptionally regulated by the microRNA <i>miR164</i>. Moreover, the encoded proteins interacted physically with the chloroplast maintenance-related TF SlGLKs. This characterization led to the selection of a putative tomato <i>ORE1</i> as target gene for RNA interference knockdown. Transgenic lines showed delayed senescence and enhanced carbon assimilation that, ultimately, increased the number of fruits and their total soluble solid content. Additionally, the fruit nutraceutical composition was enhanced. In conclusion, these data provide robust evidence that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manipul</span></strong>ation of leaf senescence is an effective strategy for yield improvement in fleshy fruit-bearing species.</p>

Understanding and Manipulating Meiotic Recombination in Plants
<p>Meiosis is a specialized cell division, essential in most reproducing organisms to halve the number of chromosomes, thereby enabling the restoration of ploidy levels during fertilization. A key step of meiosis is homologous recombination, which promotes homologous pairing and generates crossovers (COs) to connect homologous chromosomes until their separation at anaphase I. These CO sites, seen cytologically as chiasmata, represent a reciprocal exchange of genetic information between two homologous nonsister chromatids. This gene reshuffling during meiosis has a significant influence on evolution and also plays an essential role in plant breeding, because a successful breeding program depends on the ability to bring the desired combinations of alleles on chromosomes. However, the number and distribution of COs during meiosis is highly constrained. There is at least one CO per chromosome pair to ensure accurate segregation of homologs, but in most organisms, the CO number rarely exceeds three regardless of chromosome size. Moreover, their positions are not random on chromosomes but exhibit regional preference. Thus, genes in recombination-poor regions tend to be inherited together, hindering the generation of novel allelic combinations that could be exploited by breeding programs. Recently, much progress has been made in understanding meiotic recombination. In particular, many genes involved in the process in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) have been identified and analyzed. With the coming challenges of food security and climate change, and our enhanced knowledge of how COs are formed, the interest and needs in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manipul</span></strong>ating CO formation are greater than ever before. In this review, we focus on advances in understanding meiotic recombination and then summarize the attempts to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manipul</span></strong>ate CO formation. Last, we pay special attention to the meiotic recombination in polyploidy, which is a common genomic feature for many crop plants.</p>

<i>pheno</i>Seeder - A Robot System for Automated Handling and Phenotyping of Individual Seeds
<p>The enormous diversity of seed traits is an intriguing feature and critical for the overwhelming success of higher plants. In particular, seed mass is generally regarded to be key for seedling development but is mostly approximated by using scanning methods delivering only two-dimensional data, often termed seed size. However, three-dimensional traits, such as the volume or mass of single seeds, are very rarely determined in routine measurements. Here, we introduce a device named <i>pheno</i>Seeder, which enables the handling and phenotyping of individual seeds of very different sizes. The system consists of a pick-and-place <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">robot</span></strong> and a modular setup of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong>s that can be versatilely extended. Basic biometric traits detected for individual seeds are two-dimensional data from projections, three-dimensional data from volumetric measures, and mass, from which seed density is also calculated. Each seed is tracked by an identifier and, after phenotyping, can be planted, sorted, or individually stored for further evaluation or processing (e.g. in routine seed-to-plant tracking pipelines). By investigating seeds of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), rapeseed (<i>Brassica napus</i>), and barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), we observed that, even for apparently round-shaped seeds of rapeseed, correlations between the projected area and the mass of seeds were much weaker than between volume and mass. This indicates that simple projections may not deliver good proxies for seed mass. Although throughput is limited, we expect that automated seed phenotyping on a single-seed basis can contribute valuable information for applications in a wide range of wild or crop species, including seed classification, seed sorting, and assessment of seed quality.</p>

Simultaneous high-resolution pH and spectrophotometric recordings of oxygen binding in blood microvolumes

A major challenge has been to monitor oxygen binding characteristics and concomitant pH changes as they occur <i>in vivo</i>, in limited sample volumes. Here we report a technique allowing highly resolved and simultaneous monitoring of pH and blood pigment saturation in minute blood volumes. We equipped a gas diffusion chamber with a broad-range fibre-optic spectrophotometer and a micro-pH optode and recorded changes of pigment oxygenation along oxygen partial pressure (<i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) and pH gradients to test the setup. Oxygen binding parameters derived from measurements in only 15 μl of haemolymph from the cephalopod <i>Octopus vulgaris</i> showed low instrumental error (0.93%) and good agreement with published data. Broad-range spectra, each resolving 2048 data points, provided detailed insight into the complex absorbance characteristics of diverse blood types. After consideration of photobleaching and intrinsic fluorescence, pH optodes yielded accurate recordings and resolved a sigmoidal shift of 0.03 pH units in response to changing <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> from 0 to 21 kPa. Highly resolved continuous recordings along pH gradients conformed to stepwise measurements at low rates of pH changes.

Biomimetic shark skin: design, fabrication and hydrodynamic function
<p>Although the functional properties of shark skin have been of considerable interest to both biologists and engineers because of the complex hydrodynamic effects of surface roughness, no study to date has successfully fabricated a flexible biomimetic shark skin that allows detailed study of hydrodynamic function. We present the first study of the design, fabrication and hydrodynamic testing of a synthetic, flexible, shark skin membrane. A three-dimensional (3D) model of shark skin denticles was constructed using micro-CT imaging of the skin of the shortfin mako (<i>Isurus oxyrinchus</i>). Using 3D printing, thousands of rigid synthetic shark denticles were placed on flexible membranes in a controlled, linear-arrayed pattern. This flexible 3D printed shark skin model was then tested in water using a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">robot</span></strong>ic flapping device that allowed us to either hold the models in a stationary position or move them dynamically at their self-propelled swimming speed. Compared with a smooth control model without denticles, the 3D printed shark skin showed increased swimming speed with reduced energy consumption under certain motion programs. For example, at a heave frequency of 1.5 Hz and an amplitude of ±1 cm, swimming speed increased by 6.6% and the energy cost-of-transport was reduced by 5.9%. In addition, a leading-edge vortex with greater vorticity than the smooth control was generated by the 3D printed shark skin, which may explain the increased swimming speeds. The ability to fabricate synthetic biomimetic shark skin opens up a wide array of possible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manipul</span></strong>ations of surface roughness parameters, and the ability to examine the hydrodynamic consequences of diverse skin denticle shapes present in different shark species.</p>

Metabolic and Proliferative State of Vascular Adventitial Fibroblasts in Pulmonary Hypertension Is Regulated Through a MicroRNA-124/PTBP1 (Polypyrimidine Tract Binding Protein 1)/Pyruvate Kinase Muscle Axis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>An emerging metabolic theory of pulmonary hypertension (PH) suggests that cellular and mitochondrial metabolic dysfunction underlies the pathology of this disease. We and others have previously demonstrated the existence of hyperproliferative, apoptosis-resistant, proinflammatory adventitial fibroblasts from human and bovine hypertensive pulmonary arterial walls (PH-Fibs) that exhibit constitutive reprogramming of glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolism, accompanied by an increased ratio of glucose catabolism through glycolysis versus the tricarboxylic acid cycle. However, the mechanisms responsible for these metabolic alterations in PH-Fibs remain unknown. We hypothesized that in PH-Fibs microRNA-124 (miR-124) regulates PTBP1 (polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1) expression to control alternative splicing of pyruvate kinase muscle (PKM) isoforms 1 and 2, resulting in an increased PKM2/PKM1 ratio, which promotes glycolysis and proliferation even in aerobic environments.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Pulmonary adventitial fibroblasts were isolated from calves and humans with severe PH (PH-Fibs) and from normal subjects. PTBP1 gene knockdown was achieved via PTBP1-siRNA; restoration of miR-124 was performed with miR-124 mimic. TEPP-46 and shikonin were used to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manipul</span></strong>ate PKM2 glycolytic function. Histone deacetylase inhibitors were used to treat cells. Metabolic products were determined by mass spectrometry–based metabolomics analyses, and mitochondrial function was analyzed by confocal microscopy and spectrofluorometry.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We detected an increased PKM2/PKM1 ratio in PH-Fibs compared with normal subjects. PKM2 inhibition reversed the glycolytic status of PH-Fibs, decreased their cell proliferation, and attenuated macrophage interleukin-1β expression. Furthermore, normalizing the PKM2/PKM1 ratio in PH-Fibs by miR-124 overexpression or PTBP1 knockdown reversed the glycolytic phenotype (decreased the production of glycolytic intermediates and byproducts, ie, lactate), rescued mitochondrial reprogramming, and decreased cell proliferation. Pharmacological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manipul</span></strong>ation of PKM2 activity with TEPP-46 and shikonin or treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors produced similar results.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In PH, miR-124, through the alternative splicing factor PTBP1, regulates the PKM2/PKM1 ratio, the overall metabolic, proliferative, and inflammatory state of cells. This PH phenotype can be rescued with interventions at various levels of the metabolic cascade. These findings suggest a more integrated view of vascular cell metabolism, which may open unique therapeutic prospects in targeting the dynamic glycolytic and mitochondrial interactions and between mesenchymal inflammatory cells in PH.</p></sec>

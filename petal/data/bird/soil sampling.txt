Osmotic and hydraulic adjustment of mangrove saplings to extreme salinity
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salin</span></strong>ity tolerance in plant species varies widely due to adaptation and acclimation processes at the cellular and whole-plant scales. In mangroves, extreme substrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salin</span></strong>ity induces hydraulic failure and ion excess toxicity and reduces growth and survival, thus suggesting a potentially critical role for physiological acclimation to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salin</span></strong>ity. We tested the hypothesis that osmotic adjustment, a key type of plasticity that mitigates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salin</span></strong>ity shock, would take place in coordination with declines in whole-plant hydraulic conductance in a common garden experiment using saplings of three mangrove species with different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salin</span></strong>ity tolerances (<i>Avicennia germinans</i> L., <i>Rhizophora mangle</i> L. and <i>Laguncularia racemosa</i> (L.) C.F. Gaertn., ordered from higher to lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salin</span></strong>ity tolerance). For each mangrove species, four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salin</span></strong>ity treatments (1, 10, 30 and 50 practical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salin</span></strong>ity units) were established and the time trajectories were determined for leaf osmotic potential (Ψ<sub>s</sub>), stomatal conductance (<i>g</i><sub>s</sub>), whole-plant hydraulic conductance (<i>K</i><sub>plant</sub>) and predawn disequilibrium between xylem and substrate water potentials (Ψ<sub>pdd</sub>). We expected that, for all three species, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salin</span></strong>ity increments would result in coordinated declines in Ψ<sub>s</sub>, <i>g</i><sub>s</sub> and <i>K</i><sub>plant</sub>, and that the Ψ<sub>pdd</sub> would increase with substrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salin</span></strong>ity and time of exposure. In concordance with our predictions, reductions in substrate water potential promoted a coordinated decline in Ψ<sub>s</sub>, <i>g</i><sub>s</sub> and <i>K</i><sub>plant</sub>, whereas the Ψ<sub>pdd</sub> increased substantially during the first 4 days but dissipated after 7 days, indicating a time lag for equilibration after a change in substratum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salin</span></strong>ity. Our results show that mangroves confront and partially ameliorate acute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salin</span></strong>ity stress via simultaneous reductions in Ψ<sub>s</sub>, <i>g</i><sub>s</sub> and <i>K</i><sub>plant</sub>, thus developing synergistic physiological responses at the cell and whole-plant scales.</p>

Males exhibit competitive advantages over females of <i>Populus deltoides</i> under salinity stress
<p>Sexual competition among dioecious plants affects sex ratios and the spatial distribution of the sexes in different environments. At present, little is known about sexual dimorphisms induced by different competition patterns under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salin</span></strong>ity stress. We employed <i>Populus deltoides</i> as a model to investigate sex-related growth as well as physiological and biochemical responses to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salin</span></strong>ity stress under conditions of intrasexual and intersexual competition. Potted seedlings (two seedlings per pot; two females, two males, or one female and one male) were exposed to two salt levels (0 and 50 mM NaCl) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salin</span></strong>ity- and competition-driven differences in growth, assimilation rate, water use, contents of leaf pigments and osmotica, hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), and antioxidant enzyme and nitrate reductase activity were examined. In the absence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salin</span></strong>ity, no significant differences in competitive ability between males and females subjected to intrasexual competition were observed, although the growth of females was moderately greater under intersexual competition. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salin</span></strong>ity treatment significantly increased the sex differences in competitive ability, especially under intersexual competition. Under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salin</span></strong>ity stress, males showed decreased height, but displayed greater capacity for osmotic adjustment, enhancement of long-term water-use efficiency and increase in antioxidant enzyme activities. The absolute values of these traits were greater in salt-stressed males than in females under intersexual competition. In addition, salt-stressed males accumulated less Cl<sup>−</sup> and had lower H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> contents than females. These data collectively demonstrate that the competitive advantage of females in non-stressed conditions is lost under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salin</span></strong>ity. Greater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salin</span></strong>ity resistance of males growing intermixed with females under salt stress can importantly affect the sex ratio of <i>P. deltoides</i> populations.</p>

Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Frequencies of Known Haplotypes from Pooled Sequence Data
<p>DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es are often pooled, either by experimental design or because the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e itself is a mixture. For example, when population allele frequencies are of primary interest, individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es may be pooled together to lower the cost of sequencing. Alternatively, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e itself may be a mixture of multiple species or strains (e.g., bacterial species comprising a microbiome or pathogen strains in a blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e). We present an expectation–maximization algorithm for estimating haplotype frequencies in a pooled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e directly from mapped sequence reads, in the case where the possible haplotypes are known. This method is relevant to the analysis of pooled sequencing data from selection experiments, as well as the calculation of proportions of different species within a metagenomics <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e. Our method outperforms existing methods based on single-site allele frequencies, as well as simple approaches using sequence read data. We have implemented the method in a freely available open-source software tool.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
The Distinct Roles of Class I and II RPD3-Like Histone Deacetylases in Salinity Stress Response
<p>Histone acetylation is an essential process in the epigenetic regulation of diverse biological processes, including environmental stress responses in plants. Previously, our research group identified a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor (HDI) that confers salt tolerance in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). In this study, we demonstrate that class I HDAC (HDA19) and class II HDACs (HDA5/14/15/18) control responses to salt stress through different pathways. The screening of 12 different selective HDIs indicated that seven newly reported HDIs enhance salt tolerance. Genetic analysis, based on a pharmacological study, identified which HDACs function in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salin</span></strong>ity stress tolerance. In the wild-type Columbia-0 background, <i>hda19</i> plants exhibit tolerance to high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salin</span></strong>ity stress, while <i>hda5/14/15/18</i> plants exhibit hypersensitivity to salt stress. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the effect of <i>HDA19</i> deficiency on the response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salin</span></strong>ity stress is distinct from that of <i>HDA5/14/15/18</i> deficiencies. In <i>hda19</i> plants, the expression levels of stress tolerance-related genes, late embryogenesis abundant proteins that prevent protein aggregation and positive regulators such as ABI5 and NAC019 in abscisic acid signaling, were induced strongly relative to the wild type. Neither of these elements was up-regulated in the <i>hda5/14/15/18</i> plants. The mutagenesis of HDA19 by genome editing in the <i>hda5/14/15/18</i> plants enhanced salt tolerance, suggesting that suppression of HDA19 masks the phenotype caused by the suppression of class II HDACs in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salin</span></strong>ity stress response. Collectively, our results demonstrate that HDIs that inhibit class I HDACs allow the rescue of plants from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salin</span></strong>ity stress regardless of their selectivity, and they provide insight into the hierarchal regulation of environmental stress responses through HDAC isoforms.</p>

Particulate Matter Air Pollution Exposure and Heart Disease Mortality Risks by Race and Ethnicity in the United States
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Most US studies of mortality and air pollution have been conducted on largely non-Hispanic white study populations. However, many health and mortality outcomes differ by race and ethnicity, and non-Hispanic white persons experience lower air pollution exposure than those who are non-Hispanic black or Hispanic. This study examines whether associations between air pollution and heart disease mortality differ by race/ethnicity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used data from the 1997 to 2009 National Health Interview Survey linked to mortality records through December 2011 and annual estimates of fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) by census tract.

Use of a Single Baseline Versus Multiyear 24-Hour Urine Collection for Estimation of Long-Term Sodium Intake and Associated Cardiovascular and Renal Risk
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>A decrease in sodium intake has been shown to lower blood pressure, but data from cohort studies on the association with cardiovascular and renal outcomes are inconsistent. In these studies, sodium intake was often estimated with a single baseline measurement, which may be inaccurate considering day-to-day changes in sodium intake and sodium excretion.

However, relative to a single baseline measurement, 50% of the subjects had a >0.8-g (>34-mmol) difference in sodium intake with long-term estimations. As a result, 45%, 49%, and 50% of all subjects switched between tertiles of sodium intake when the 1-, 5-, or 15-year average was used, respectively.

Systematic Biology
Lateral Gene Transfer from the Dead
<p>In phylogenetic studies, the evolution of molecular sequences is assumed to have taken place along the phylogeny traced by the ancestors of extant species. In the presence of lateral gene transfer, however, this may not be the case, because the species lineage from which a gene was transferred may have gone extinct or not have been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>ed. Because it is not feasible to specify or reconstruct the complete phylogeny of all species, we must describe the evolution of genes outside the represented phylogeny by modeling the speciation dynamics that gave rise to the complete phylogeny. We demonstrate that if the number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>ed species is small compared with the total number of existing species, the overwhelming majority of gene transfers involve speciation to and evolution along extinct or un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>ed lineages. We show that the evolution of genes along extinct or un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>ed lineages can to good approximation be treated as those of independently evolving lineages described by a few global parameters. Using this result, we derive an algorithm to calculate the probability of a gene tree and recover the maximum-likelihood reconciliation given the phylogeny of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>ed species. Examining 473 near-universal gene families from 36 cyanobacteria, we find that nearly a third of transfer events (28%) appear to have topological signatures of evolution along extinct species, but only approximately 6% of transfers trace their ancestry to before the common ancestor of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>ed cyanobacteria.

A worldwide survey of neonicotinoids in honey
<p>Growing evidence for global pollinator decline is causing concern for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services maintenance. Neonicotinoid pesticides have been identified or suspected as a key factor responsible for this decline. We assessed the global exposure of pollinators to neonicotinoids by analyzing 198 honey <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es from across the world. We found at least one of five tested compounds (acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid, thiacloprid, and thiamethoxam) in 75% of all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es, 45% of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es contained two or more of these compounds, and 10% contained four or five. Our results confirm the exposure of bees to neonicotinoids in their food throughout the world. The coexistence of neonicotinoids and other pesticides may increase harm to pollinators. However, the concentrations detected are below the maximum residue level authorized for human consumption (average ± standard error for positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es: 1.8 ± 0.56 nanograms per gram).</p>

Cell-Type-Specific H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase Activity in Root Tissues Enables K<sup>+</sup> Retention and Mediates Acclimation of Barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) to Salinity Stress
<p>While the importance of cell type specificity in plant adaptive responses is widely accepted, only a limited number of studies have addressed this issue at the functional level. We have combined electrophysiological, imaging, and biochemical techniques to reveal the physiological mechanisms conferring higher sensitivity of apical root cells to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salin</span></strong>ity in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>). We show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salin</span></strong>ity application to the root apex arrests root growth in a highly tissue- and treatment-specific manner. Although <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salin</span></strong>ity-induced transient net Na<sup>+</sup> uptake was about 4-fold higher in the root apex compared with the mature zone, mature root cells accumulated more cytosolic and vacuolar Na<sup>+</sup>, suggesting that the higher sensitivity of apical cells to salt is not related to either enhanced Na<sup>+</sup> exclusion or sequestration inside the root. Rather, the above differential sensitivity between the two zones originates from a 10-fold difference in K<sup>+</sup> efflux between the mature zone and the apical region (much poorer in the root apex) of the root. Major factors contributing to this poor K<sup>+</sup> retention ability are (1) an intrinsically lower H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity in the root apex, (2) greater salt-induced membrane depolarization, and (3) a higher reactive oxygen species production under NaCl and a larger density of reactive oxygen species-activated cation currents in the apex. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salin</span></strong>ity treatment increased (2- to 5-fold) the content of 10 (out of 25 detected) amino acids in the root apex but not in the mature zone and changed the organic acid and sugar contents. The causal link between the observed changes in the root metabolic profile and the regulation of transporter activity is discussed.</p>

Measuring the ratio of CO<sub>2</sub> efflux to O<sub>2</sub> influx in tree stem respiration
<p>In recent studies, the ratio of tree stem CO<sub>2</sub> efflux to O<sub>2</sub> influx has been defined as the apparent respiratory quotient (ARQ). The metabolism of carbohydrates, the putative respiratory substrate in trees, is expected to yield an ARQ of 1.0. However, previous studies have reported ARQ values ranging between 0.23 and 0.90. These interesting results may indicate internal transport of respired CO<sub>2</sub> within stems; yet no simple field applicable methods for ARQ measurement have been available. Here, we report on the assembly of a closed circulating system called ‘<i>Hampadah</i>’, which uses CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> analyzers to measure air <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es from stem chambers. We tested the performance of the <i>Hampadah</i> with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es from 36 trees (<i>Tetragastris panamensis</i> (Engl.) Kuntze). Additionally, we showed the feasibility of measuring ARQ directly from stem chambers, using portable CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> sensors, in both discrete and continuous modes of operation. The <i>Hampadah</i> measurement proved to be consistent with CO<sub>2</sub> gas standards (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.999) and with O<sub>2</sub> determined by O<sub>2</sub>/Ar measurements with a mass spectrometer (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.998). The <i>Hampadah</i> gave highly reproducible results for ARQ determination of field <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es (±0.01 for duplicates). The portable sensors measurement showed good correlation with the <i>Hampadah</i> in measuring CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub> and ARQ (<i>n</i> = 5, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.97, 0.98 and 0.91, respectively). We have demonstrated here that the <i>Hampadah</i> and the sensors’ methods enable accurate ARQ measurements for both laboratory and field research.</p>

A Critical Role of Sodium Flux via the Plasma Membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> Exchanger SOS1 in the Salt Tolerance of Rice

The plasma membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger protein Salt Overly Sensitive 1 (SOS1) is the sole Na<sup>+</sup> efflux transporter that has been genetically characterized to date. Here, the importance of SOS1-facilitated Na<sup>+</sup> flux in the salt tolerance of rice was analyzed in a reverse-genetics approach. A <i>sos1</i> loss-of-function mutant displayed exceptional salt sensitivity that was correlated with excessive Na<sup>+</sup> intake and impaired Na<sup>+</sup> loading into the xylem, thus indicating that SOS1 controls net root Na<sup>+</sup> uptake and long-distance Na<sup>+</sup> transport to shoots. The acute Na<sup>+</sup> sensitivity of <i>sos1</i> plants at low NaCl concentrations allowed analysis of the transcriptional response to sodicity stress without effects of the osmotic stress intrinsic to high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salin</span></strong>ity treatments. In contrast with that in the wild type, <i>sos1</i> mutant roots displayed preferential down-regulation of stress-related genes in response to salt treatment, despite the greater intensity of stress experienced by the mutant. These results suggest there is impaired stress detection or an inability to mount a comprehensive response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salin</span></strong>ity in <i>sos1</i>. In summary, the plasma membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger SOS1 plays a major role in the salt tolerance of rice by controlling Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis and possibly contributing to the sensing of sodicity stress.</p>

Making Epidermal Bladder Cells Bigger: Developmental- and Salinity-Induced Endopolyploidy in a Model Halophyte
<p>Endopolyploidy occurs when DNA replication takes place without subsequent mitotic nuclear division, resulting in cell-specific ploidy levels within tissues. In plants, endopolyploidy plays an important role in sustaining growth and development, but only a few studies have demonstrated a role in abiotic stress response. In this study, we investigated the function of ploidy level and nuclear and cell size in leaf expansion throughout development and tracked cell type-specific ploidy in the halophyte <i>Mesembryanthemum crystallinum</i>. In addition to developmental endopolyploidy, we examined the effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salin</span></strong>ity stress on ploidy level. We focused specifically on epidermal bladder cells (EBC), which are modified balloon-like trichomes, due to their large size and role in salt accumulation. Our results demonstrate that ploidy increases as the leaves expand in a similar manner for each leaf type, and ploidy levels up to 512C were recorded for nuclei in EBC of leaves of adult plants. Salt treatment led to a significant increase in ploidy levels in the EBC, and these cells showed spatially related differences in their ploidy and nuclear and cell size depending on the positions on the leaf and stem surface. Transcriptome analysis highlighted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salin</span></strong>ity-induced changes in genes involved in DNA replication, cell cycle, endoreduplication, and trichome development in EBC. The increase in cell size and ploidy observed in <i>M. crystallinum</i> under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salin</span></strong>ity stress may contribute to salt tolerance by increasing the storage capacity for sodium sequestration brought about by higher metabolic activity driving rapid cell enlargement in the leaf tissue and EBC.</p>

The Glucose Sensor MdHXK1 Phosphorylates a Tonoplast Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> Exchanger to Improve Salt Tolerance
<p>Glc regulates many vital processes, including plant growth, development, metabolism, and responses to biotic and abiotic stress. However, the molecular mechanism by which Glc acts as a signal to regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salin</span></strong>ity tolerance remains unclear. In this study, we found that the apple (<i>Malus domestica</i> Borkh.) Glc sensor hexokinase1 (MdHXK1) contributes to Glc-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salin</span></strong>ity tolerance. A combination of split ubiquitin system, pull-down, co-immunoprecipitation, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays demonstrated that MdHXK1 interacts with and phosphorylates the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger MdNHX1 at its Ser-275 residue. Phosphorylation improved the stability of MdNHX1 and enhanced its Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> transport activity in <i>MdNHX1</i> overexpression transgenic apple and yeast complementation cells. Furthermore, Ser-275 of MdNHX1 was found to be crucial for MdHXK1-mediated phosphorylation. Finally, a series of transgenic analyses demonstrated that salt tolerance mediated by MdHXK1 partially depended on MdNHX1. Overall, our findings provide insights into how sugar recruits and regulates MdNHX1 in response to high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salin</span></strong>ity in plants.</p>

An NADPH-Oxidase/Polyamine Oxidase Feedback Loop Controls Oxidative Burst Under Salinity
<p>The apoplastic polyamine oxidase (PAO) catalyzes the oxidation of the higher polyamines spermidine and spermine, contributing to hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) accumulation. However, it is yet unclear whether apoplastic PAO is part of a network that coordinates the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salin</span></strong>ity or if it acts independently. Here, we unravel that NADPH oxidase and apoplastic PAO cooperate to control the accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and superoxides (O<sub>2</sub><sup>·−</sup>) in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>). To examine to what extent apoplastic PAO constitutes part of a ROS-generating network, we examined ROS accumulation in guard cells of plants overexpressing or down-regulating apoplastic PAO (lines S2.2 and A2, respectively) or down-regulating NADPH oxidase (line AS-<i>NtRbohD</i>/<i>F</i>). The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-specific probe benzene sulfonyl-H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> showed that, under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salin</span></strong>ity, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> increased in S2.2 and decreased in A2 compared with the wild type. Surprisingly, the O<sub>2</sub><sup>·−</sup>-specific probe benzene sulfonyl-So showed that O<sub>2</sub><sup>·−</sup> levels correlated positively with that of apoplastic PAO (i.e. showed high and low levels in S2.2 and A2, respectively). By using AS-<i>NtRbohD/F</i> lines and a pharmacological approach, we could show that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub><sup>·−</sup> accumulation at the onset of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salin</span></strong>ity stress was dependent on NADPH oxidase, indicating that NADPH oxidase is upstream of apoplastic PAO. Our results suggest that NADPH oxidase and the apoplastic PAO form a feed-forward ROS amplification loop, which impinges on oxidative state and culminates in the execution of programmed cell death. We propose that the PAO/NADPH oxidase loop is a central hub in the plethora of responses controlling salt stress tolerance, with potential functions extending beyond stress tolerance.</p>

Fast, Accurate and Automatic Ancient Nucleosome and Methylation Maps with epiPALEOMIX
<p>The first epigenomes from archaic hominins (AH) and ancient anatomically modern humans (AMH) have recently been characterized, based, however, on a limited number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es. The extent to which ancient genome-wide epigenetic landscapes can be reconstructed thus remains contentious. Here, we present epiPALEOMIX, an open-source and user-friendly pipeline that exploits post-mortem DNA degradation patterns to reconstruct ancient methylomes and nucleosome maps from shotgun and/or capture-enrichment data. Applying epiPALEOMIX to the sequence data underlying 35 ancient genomes including AMH, AH, equids and aurochs, we investigate the temporal, geographical and preservation range of ancient epigenetic signatures. We first assess the quality of inferred ancient epigenetic signatures within well-characterized genomic regions. We find that tissue-specific methylation signatures can be obtained across a wider range of DNA preparation types than previously thought, including when no particular experimental procedures have been used to remove deaminated cytosines prior to sequencing. We identify a large subset of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es for which DNA associated with nucleosomes is protected from post-mortem degradation, and nucleosome positioning patterns can be reconstructed. Finally, we describe parameters and conditions such as DNA damage levels and sequencing depth that limit the preservation of epigenetic signatures in ancient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es. When such conditions are met, we propose that epigenetic profiles of CTCF binding regions can be used to help data authentication. Our work, including epiPALEOMIX, opens for further investigations of ancient epigenomes through time especially aimed at tracking possible epigenetic changes during major evolutionary, environmental, socioeconomic, and cultural shifts.</p>

Adaptive evolution of fish hatching enzyme: one amino acid substitution results in differential salt dependency of the enzyme
<p>Embryos of medaka <i>Oryzias latipes</i> hatch in freshwater, while those of killifish <i>Fundulus heteroclitus</i> hatch in brackish water. Medaka and <i>Fundulus</i> possess two kinds of hatching enzymes, high choriolytic enzyme (HCE) and low choriolytic enzyme (LCE), which cooperatively digest their egg envelope at the time of hatching. Optimal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salin</span></strong>ity of medaka HCE was found in 0 mol l<sup>−1</sup> NaCl, and activity decreased with increasing salt concentrations. One of the two <i>Fundulus</i> HCEs, FHCE1, showed the highest activity in 0 mol l<sup>−1</sup> NaCl, and the other, FHCE2, showed the highest activity in 0.125 mol l<sup>−1</sup> NaCl. The results suggest that the salt dependencies of HCEs are well adapted to each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salin</span></strong>ity at the time of hatching. Different from HCE, LCEs of both species maintained the activity sufficient for egg envelope digestion in various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salin</span></strong>ities. The difference in amino acid sequence between FHCE1 and FHCE2 was found at only a single site at position 36 (Gly/Arg), suggesting that this single substitution causes the different salt dependency between the two enzymes. Superimposition of FHCE1 and FHCE2 with the 3-D structure model of medaka HCE revealed that position 36 was located on the surface of HCE molecule, far from its active site cleft. The results suggest a hypothesis that position 36 influences salt-dependent activity of HCE, not with recognition of primary structure around the cleavage site, but with recognition of higher ordered structure of egg envelope protein.</p>

Gene Capture Coupled to High-Throughput Sequencing as a Strategy for Targeted Metagenome Exploration
<p>Next-generation sequencing (NGS) allows faster acquisition of metagenomic data, but complete exploration of complex ecosystems is hindered by the extraordinary diversity of microorganisms. To reduce the environmental complexity, we created an innovative solution hybrid selection (SHS) method that is combined with NGS to characterize large DNA fragments harbouring biomarkers of interest. The quality of enrichment was evaluated after fragments containing the methyl coenzyme M reductase subunit A gene (<i>mcrA</i>), the biomarker of methanogenesis, were captured from a <i>Methanosarcina</i> strain and a metagenomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e from a meromictic lake. The methanogen diversity was compared with direct metagenome and <i>mcrA</i>-based amplicon pyrosequencing strategies<i>.</i> The SHS approach resulted in the capture of DNA fragments up to 2.5 kb with an enrichment efficiency between 41 and 100%, depending on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e complexity. Compared with direct metagenome and amplicons sequencing, SHS detected broader <i>mcrA</i> diversity, and it allowed efficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>ing of the rare biosphere and unknown sequences. In contrast to amplicon-based strategies, SHS is less biased and GC independent, and it recovered complete biomarker sequences in addition to conserved regions. Because this method can also isolate the regions flanking the target sequences, it could facilitate operon reconstructions.</p>

Fasting Versus Nonfasting and Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Accuracy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Recent recommendations favoring nonfasting lipid assessment may affect low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) estimation. The novel method of LDL-C estimation (LDL-C<sub>N</sub>) uses a flexible approach to derive patient-specific ratios of triglycerides to very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. This adaptability may confer an accuracy advantage in nonfasting patients over the fixed approach of the classic Friedewald method (LDL-C<sub>F</sub>).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used a US cross-sectional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e of 1 545  634 patients (959 153 fasting ≥10–12 hours; 586 481 nonfasting) from the second harvest of the Very Large Database of Lipids study to assess for the first time the impact of fasting status on novel LDL-C accuracy. Rapid ultracentrifugation was used to directly measure LDL-C content (LDL-C<sub>D</sub>). Accuracy was defined as the percentage of LDL-C<sub>D</sub> falling within an estimated LDL-C (LDL-C<sub>N</sub> or LDL-C<sub>F</sub>) category by clinical cut points. For low estimated LDL-C (<70 mg/dL), we evaluated accuracy by triglyceride levels. The magnitude of absolute and percent differences between LDL-C<sub>D</sub> and estimated LDL-C (LDL-C<sub>N</sub> or LDL-C<sub>F</sub>) was stratified by LDL-C and triglyceride categories.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In both fasting and nonfasting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es, accuracy was higher with the novel method across all clinical LDL-C categories (range, 87%–94%) compared with the Friedewald estimation (range, 71%–93%; <i>P</i>≤0.001). With LDL-C <70 mg/dL, nonfasting LDL-C<sub>N</sub> accuracy (92%) was superior to LDL-C<sub>F</sub> accuracy (71%; <i>P</i><0.001). In this LDL-C range, 19% of fasting and 30% of nonfasting patients had differences ≥10 mg/dL between LDL-C<sub>F</sub> and LDL-C<sub>D</sub>, whereas only 2% and 3% of patients, respectively, had similar differences with novel estimation. Accuracy of LDL-C <70 mg/dL further decreased as triglycerides increased, particularly for Friedewald estimation (range, 37%–96%) versus the novel method (range, 82%–94%). With triglycerides of 200 to 399 mg/dL in nonfasting patients, LDL-C<sub>N</sub> <70 mg/dL accuracy (82%) was superior to LDL-C<sub>F</sub> (37%; <i>P</i><0.001). In this triglyceride range, 73% of fasting and 81% of nonfasting patients had ≥10 mg/dL differences between LDL-C<sub>F</sub> and LDL-C<sub>D</sub> compared with 25% and 20% of patients, respectively, with LDL-C<sub>N</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Novel adaptable LDL-C estimation performs better in nonfasting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es than the fixed Friedewald estimation, with a particular accuracy advantage in settings of low LDL-C and high triglycerides.

Among the validated proteins that were increased within 1 hour after planned myocardial injury, 29 were also elevated in patients with spontaneous myocardial infarction (n=63; <i>P</i><6.17E-04). Many of the novel markers identified in our study are intracellular proteins not previously identified in the peripheral circulation or have functional roles relevant to myocardial injury.

CALMODULIN-BINDING TRANSCRIPTION ACTIVATOR 6: A Key Regulator of Na<sup>+</sup> Homeostasis during Germination
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salin</span></strong>ity impairs seed germination and seedling establishment. We investigated the role of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) CALMODULIN-BINDING TRANSCRIPTION ACTIVATOR 6 (CAMTA6) in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salin</span></strong>ity stress responses during early germination. Compared with the wild type, the <i>camta6-4</i> and <i>camta6-5</i> mutants were more tolerant to NaCl and abscisic acid (ABA) and accumulated less Na<sup>+</sup>. In contrast, 4- to 11-d-old <i>camta6</i> seedlings were more sensitive to NaCl. In <i>camta6</i>, expression of <i>HIGH-AFFINITY K<sup>+</sup> TRANSPORTER1</i> (<i>AtHKT1;1</i>), encoding an Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> transporter, was restricted to the radicles and was not enhanced by NaCl or ABA. During germination, the <i>camta6 hkt1</i> double mutant was as sensitive as the wild type and <i>hkt1</i> to NaCl, suggesting that HKT1;1 is crucial for the salt tolerance of <i>camta6</i>. An ABA response element in the <i>HKT1;1</i> promoter was found to be indispensable for the enhanced expression of the gene in response to NaCl and to ABA. Transcriptome analysis of the wild type and <i>camta6-5</i> with and without salt treatment revealed 1,020 up-regulated and 1,467 down-regulated salt-responsive genes in the wild type. Among these, 638 up-regulated and 1,242 down-regulated genes were classified as CAMTA6-dependent. Expression of several known salt stress-associated genes, including <i>SALT OVERLY SENSITIVE1</i> and <i>Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> ANTIPORTER</i>, was impaired in <i>camta6</i> mutants. Bioinformatics analysis of the 5′ upstream sequences of the salt-responsive CAMTA6-dependent up-regulated genes revealed the CACGTGTC motif as the most prominent element, representing an ABA response element and a potential CAMTA-binding site. We suggest that CAMTA6 regulates, directly or indirectly, the expression of most of the salt-responsive genes in germinating seeds, including genes that are crucial for Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis and salt stress tolerance.</p>

Timing and Order of the Molecular Events Marking the Onset of Berry Ripening in Grapevine
<p>Grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) is a model for the investigation of physiological and biochemical changes during the formation and ripening of nonclimacteric fleshy fruits. However, the order and complexity of the molecular events during fruit development remain poorly understood. To identify the key molecular events controlling berry formation and ripening, we created a highly detailed transcriptomic and metabolomic map of berry development, based on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es collected every week from fruit set to maturity in two grapevine genotypes for three consecutive years, resulting in 219 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es. Major transcriptomic changes were represented by coordinated waves of gene expression associated with early development, veraison (onset of ripening)/midripening, and late-ripening and were consistent across vintages. The two genotypes were clearly distinguished by metabolite profiles and transcriptional changes occurring primarily at the veraison/midripening phase. Coexpression analysis identified a core network of transcripts as well as variations in the within-module connections representing varietal differences. By focusing on transcriptome rearrangements close to veraison, we identified two rapid and successive shared transitions involving genes whose expression profiles precisely locate the timing of the molecular reprogramming of berry development. Functional analyses of two transcription factors, markers of the first transition, suggested that they participate in a hierarchical cascade of gene activation at the onset of ripening. This study defined the initial transcriptional events that mark and trigger the onset of ripening and the molecular network that characterizes the whole process of berry development, providing a framework to model fruit development and maturation in grapevine.</p>

Low Vulnerability to Xylem Embolism in Leaves and Stems of North American Oaks
<p>Although recent findings suggest that xylem embolism represents a significant, drought-induced damaging process in land plants, substantial debate surrounds the capacity of long-vesseled, ring-porous species to resist embolism. We investigated whether recent methodological developments could help resolve this controversy within <i>Quercus</i>, a long-vesseled, ring-porous temperate angiosperm genus, and shed further light on the importance of xylem vulnerability to embolism as an indicator of drought tolerance. We used the optical technique to quantify leaf and stem xylem vulnerability to embolism of eight <i>Quercus</i> species from the Mediterranean-type climate region of California to examine absolute measures of resistance to embolism as well as any potential hydraulic segmentation between tissue types. We demonstrated that our optical assessment reflected flow impairment for a subset of our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e species by quantifying changes in leaf hydraulic conductance in dehydrating branches. Air-entry water potential varied 2-fold in leaves, ranging from −1.7 ± 0.25 MPa to −3.74 ± 0.23 MPa, and 4-fold in stems, ranging from −1.17 ± 0.04 MPa to −4.91 ± 0.3 MPa. Embolism occurred earlier in leaves than in stems in only one out of eight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e species, and plants always lost turgor before experiencing stem embolism. Our results show that long-vesseled North American <i>Quercus</i> species are more resistant to embolism than previously thought and support the hypothesis that avoiding stem embolism is a critical component of drought tolerance in woody trees. Accurately quantifying xylem vulnerability to embolism is essential for understanding species distributions along aridity gradients and predicting plant mortality during drought.</p>

Scopoletin 8-Hydroxylase-Mediated Fraxetin Production Is Crucial for Iron Mobilization
<p>Iron (Fe) is an essential mineral nutrient and an important factor for the composition of natural plant communities. Low Fe availability in aerated soils with neutral or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alkalin</span></strong>e pH has led to the evolution of elaborate mechanisms that extract Fe from the soil solution. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), Fe is acquired by an orchestrated strategy that comprises mobilization, chelation, and reduction of Fe<sup>3+</sup> prior to its uptake. Here, we show that At3g12900, previously annotated as scopoletin 8-hydroxylase (S8H), participates in Fe acquisition by mediating the biosynthesis of fraxetin (7,8-dihydroxy-6-methoxycoumarin), a coumarin derived from the scopoletin pathway. S8H is highly induced in roots of Fe-deficient plants both at the transcript and protein levels. Mutants defective in the expression of <i>S8H</i> showed increased sensitivity to growth on pH 7.0 media supplemented with an immobile source of Fe and reduced secretion of fraxetin. Transgenic lines overexpressing <i>S8H</i> exhibited an opposite phenotype. Homozygous <i>s8h</i> mutants grown on media with immobilized Fe accumulated significantly more scopolin, the storage form of scopoletin, supporting the designated function of S8H in scopoletin hydroxylation. Fraxetin exhibited Fe-reducing properties in vitro with higher rates being observed at neutral relative to acidic pH. Supplementing the media containing immobile Fe with fraxetin partially rescued the <i>s8h</i> mutants. In natural Arabidopsis accessions differing in their performance on media containing immobilized Fe, the amount of secreted fraxetin was highly correlated with growth and Fe and chlorophyll content, indicating that fraxetin secretion is a decisive factor for calcicole-calcifuge behavior (i.e. the ability/inability to thrive on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alkalin</span></strong>e soils) of plants.</p>

The Long Intergenic Noncoding RNA (LincRNA) Landscape of the Soybean Genome
<p>Long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) are emerging as important regulators of diverse biological processes. However, our understanding of lincRNA abundance and function remains very limited especially for agriculturally important plants. Soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) is a major legume crop plant providing over a half of global oilseed production. Moreover, soybean can form symbiotic relationships with <i>Rhizobium</i> bacteria to fix atmospheric nitrogen. Soybean has a complex paleopolyploid genome and exhibits many vegetative and floral development complexities. Soybean cultivars have photoperiod requirements restricting its use and productivity. Molecular regulators of these legume-specific developmental processes remain enigmatic. Long noncoding RNAs may play important regulatory roles in soybean growth and development. In this study, over one billion RNA-seq read pairs from 37 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es representing nine tissues were used to discover 6,018 lincRNA loci. The lincRNAs were shorter than protein-coding transcripts and had lower expression levels and more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e specific expression. Few of the loci were found to be conserved in two other legume species (chickpea [<i>Cicer arietinum</i>] and <i>Medicago truncatula</i>), but almost 200 homeologous lincRNAs in the soybean genome were detected. Protein-coding gene-lincRNA coexpression analysis suggested an involvement of lincRNAs in stress response, signal transduction, and developmental processes. Positional analysis of lincRNA loci implicated involvement in transcriptional regulation. lincRNA expression from centromeric regions was observed especially in actively dividing tissues, suggesting possible roles in cell division. Integration of publicly available genome-wide association data with the lincRNA map of the soybean genome uncovered 23 lincRNAs potentially associated with agronomic traits.</p>

Construction and Optimization of a Large Gene Coexpression Network in Maize Using RNA-Seq Data
<p>With the emergence of massively parallel sequencing, genomewide expression data production has reached an unprecedented level. This abundance of data has greatly facilitated maize research, but may not be amenable to traditional analysis techniques that were optimized for other data types. Using publicly available data, a gene coexpression network (GCN) can be constructed and used for gene function prediction, candidate gene selection, and improving understanding of regulatory pathways. Several GCN studies have been done in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), mostly using microarray datasets. To build an optimal GCN from plant materials RNA-Seq data, parameters for expression data normalization and network inference were evaluated. A comprehensive evaluation of these two parameters and a ranked aggregation strategy on network performance, using libraries from 1266 maize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es, were conducted. Three normalization methods and 10 inference methods, including six correlation and four mutual information methods, were tested. The three normalization methods had very similar performance. For network inference, correlation methods performed better than mutual information methods at some genes. Increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e size also had a positive effect on GCN. Aggregating single networks together resulted in improved performance compared to single networks.</p>

Unique Physiological and Transcriptional Shifts under Combinations of Salinity, Drought, and Heat
<p>Climate-change-driven stresses such as extreme temperatures, water deficit, and ion imbalance are projected to exacerbate and jeopardize global food security. Under field conditions, these stresses usually occur simultaneously and cause damages that exceed single stresses. Here, we investigated the transcriptional patterns and morpho-physiological acclimations of <i>Brachypodium dystachion</i> to single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salin</span></strong>ity, drought, and heat stresses, as well as their double and triple stress combinations. Hierarchical clustering analysis of morpho-physiological acclimations showed that several traits exhibited a gradually aggravating effect as plants were exposed to combined stresses. On the other hand, other morphological traits were dominated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salin</span></strong>ity, while some physiological traits were shaped by heat stress. Response patterns of differentially expressed genes, under single and combined stresses (i.e. common stress genes), were maintained only among 37% of the genes, indicating a limited expression consistency among partially overlapping stresses. A comparison between common stress genes and genes that were uniquely expressed only under combined stresses (i.e. combination unique genes) revealed a significant shift from increased intensity to antagonistic responses, respectively. The different transcriptional signatures imply an alteration in the mode of action under combined stresses and limited ability to predict plant responses as different stresses are combined. Coexpression analysis coupled with enrichment analysis revealed that each gene subset was enriched with different biological processes. Common stress genes were enriched with known stress response pathways, while combination unique-genes were enriched with unique processes and genes with unknown functions that hold the potential to improve stress tolerance and enhance cereal productivity under suboptimal field conditions.</p>

Predictive Models of Spatial Transcriptional Response to High Salinity
<p>Plants are exposed to a variety of environmental conditions, and their ability to respond to environmental variation depends on the proper regulation of gene expression in an organ-, tissue-, and cell type-specific manner. Although our knowledge of how stress responses are regulated is accumulating, a genome-wide model of how plant transcription factors (TFs) and cis-regulatory elements control spatially specific stress response has yet to emerge. Using Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) as a model, we identified a set of 1,894 putative cis-regulatory elements (pCREs) that are associated with high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salin</span></strong>ity (salt) up-regulated genes in the root or the shoot. We used these pCREs to develop computational models that can better predict salt up-regulated genes in the root and shoot compared with models based on known TF binding motifs. In addition, we incorporated TF binding sites identified via large-scale in vitro assays, chromatin accessibility, evolutionary conservation, and pCRE combinatorial relationships in machine learning models and found that only consideration of pCRE combinations led to better performance in salt up-regulation prediction in the root and shoot. Our results suggest that the plant organ transcriptional response to high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">salin</span></strong>ity is regulated by a core set of pCREs and provide a genome-wide view of the cis-regulatory code of plant spatial transcriptional responses to environmental stress.</p>

Genomic Basis of Adaptive Evolution: The Survival of Amur Ide (<i>Leuciscu</i>s <i>waleckii</i>) in an Extremely Alkaline Environment
<p>The Amur ide (<i>Leuciscus waleckii</i>) is a cyprinid fish that is widely distributed in Northeast Asia. The Lake Dali Nur population inhabits one of the most extreme aquatic environments on Earth, with an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alkalin</span></strong>ity up to 50 mmol/L (pH 9.6), thus providing an exceptional model with which to characterize the mechanisms of genomic evolution underlying adaptation to extreme environments. Here, we developed the reference genome assembly for <i>L. waleckii</i> from Lake Dali Nur. Intriguingly, we identified unusual expanded long terminal repeats (LTRs) with higher nucleotide substitution rates than in many other teleosts, suggesting their more recent insertion into the <i>L. waleckii</i> genome. We also identified expansions in genes encoding egg coat proteins and natriuretic peptide receptors, possibly underlying the adaptation to extreme environmental stress. We further sequenced the genomes of 10 additional individuals from freshwater and 18 from Lake Dali Nur populations, and we detected a total of 7.6 million SNPs from both populations. In a genome scan and comparison of these two populations, we identified a set of genomic regions under selective sweeps that harbor genes involved in ion homoeostasis, acid-base regulation, unfolded protein response, reactive oxygen species elimination, and urea excretion. Our findings provide comprehensive insight into the genomic mechanisms of teleost fish that underlie their adaptation to extreme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alkalin</span></strong>e environments.</p>

Phylogenetic Tools for Generalized HIV-1 Epidemics: Findings from the PANGEA-HIV Methods Comparison
<p>Viral phylogenetic methods contribute to understanding how HIV spreads in populations, and thereby help guide the design of prevention interventions. So far, most analyses have been applied to well-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>ed concentrated HIV-1 epidemics in wealthy countries. To direct the use of phylogenetic tools to where the impact of HIV-1 is greatest, the Phylogenetics And Networks for Generalized HIV Epidemics in Africa (PANGEA-HIV) consortium generates full-genome viral sequences from across sub-Saharan Africa. Analyzing these data presents new challenges, since epidemics are principally driven by heterosexual transmission and a smaller fraction of cases is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>ed. Here, we show that viral phylogenetic tools can be adapted and used to estimate epidemiological quantities of central importance to HIV-1 prevention in sub-Saharan Africa. We used a community-wide methods comparison exercise on simulated data, where participants were blinded to the true dynamics they were inferring. Two distinct simulations captured generalized HIV-1 epidemics, before and after a large community-level intervention that reduced infection levels. Five research groups participated. Structured coalescent modeling approaches were most successful: phylogenetic estimates of HIV-1 incidence, incidence reductions, and the proportion of transmissions from individuals in their first 3 months of infection correlated with the true values (Pearson correlation > 90%), with small bias. However, on some simulations, true values were markedly outside reported confidence or credibility intervals. The blinded comparison revealed current limits and strengths in using HIV phylogenetics in challenging settings, provided benchmarks for future methods’ development, and supports using the latest generation of phylogenetic tools to advance HIV surveillance and prevention.</p>

Evaluating Topological Conflict in Centipede Phylogeny Using Transcriptomic Data Sets
<p>Relationships between the five extant orders of centipedes have been considered solved based on morphology. Phylogenies based on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es of up to a few dozen genes have largely been congruent with the morphological tree apart from an alternative placement of one order, the relictual Craterostigmomorpha, consisting of two species in Tasmania and New Zealand. To address this incongruence, novel transcriptomic data were generated to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e all five orders of centipedes and also used as a test case for studying gene-tree incongruence. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian mixture model analyses of a data set composed of 1,934 orthologs with 45% missing data, as well as the 389 orthologs in the least saturated, stationary quartile, retrieve strong support for a sister-group relationship between Craterostigmomorpha and all other pleurostigmophoran centipedes, of which the latter group is newly named Amalpighiata. The Amalpighiata hypothesis, which shows little gene-tree incongruence and is robust to the influence of among-taxon compositional heterogeneity, implies convergent evolution in several morphological and behavioral characters traditionally used in centipede phylogenetics, such as maternal brood care, but accords with patterns of first appearances in the fossil record.</p>

Genome-Wide Analysis of Selection on the Malaria Parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> in West African Populations of Differing Infection Endemicity
<p>Locally varying selection on pathogens may be due to differences in drug pressure, host immunity, transmission opportunities between hosts, or the intensity of between-genotype competition within hosts. Highly recombining populations of the human malaria parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> throughout West Africa are closely related, as gene flow is relatively unrestricted in this endemic region, but markedly varying ecology and transmission intensity should cause distinct local selective pressures. Genome-wide analysis of sequence variation was undertaken on a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e of 100 <i>P. falciparum</i> clinical isolates from a highly endemic region of the Republic of Guinea where transmission occurs for most of each year and compared with data from 52 clinical isolates from a previously <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>ed population from The Gambia, where there is relatively limited seasonal malaria transmission. Paired-end short-read sequences were mapped against the 3D7 <i>P. falciparum</i> reference genome sequence, and data on 136,144 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were obtained. Within-population analyses identifying loci showing evidence of recent positive directional selection and balancing selection confirm that antimalarial drugs and host immunity have been major selective agents. Many of the signatures of recent directional selection reflected by standardized integrated haplotype scores were population specific, including differences at drug resistance loci due to historically different antimalarial use between the countries. In contrast, both populations showed a similar set of loci likely to be under balancing selection as indicated by very high Tajima’s <i>D</i> values, including a significant overrepresentation of genes expressed at the merozoite stage that invades erythrocytes and several previously validated targets of acquired immunity. Between-population <i>F</i><sub>ST</sub> analysis identified exceptional differentiation of allele frequencies at a small number of loci, most markedly for five SNPs covering a 15-kb region within and flanking the <i>gdv1</i> gene that regulates the early stages of gametocyte development, which is likely related to the extreme differences in mosquito vector abundance and seasonality that determine the transmission opportunities for the sexual stage of the parasite.</p>

Simultaneous high-resolution pH and spectrophotometric recordings of oxygen binding in blood microvolumes
<p>Oxygen equilibrium curves have been widely used to understand oxygen transport in numerous organisms. A major challenge has been to monitor oxygen binding characteristics and concomitant pH changes as they occur <i>in vivo</i>, in limited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e volumes. Here we report a technique allowing highly resolved and simultaneous monitoring of pH and blood pigment saturation in minute blood volumes. We equipped a gas diffusion chamber with a broad-range fibre-optic spectrophotometer and a micro-pH optode and recorded changes of pigment oxygenation along oxygen partial pressure (<i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) and pH gradients to test the setup. Oxygen binding parameters derived from measurements in only 15 μl of haemolymph from the cephalopod <i>Octopus vulgaris</i> showed low instrumental error (0.93%) and good agreement with published data. Broad-range spectra, each resolving 2048 data points, provided detailed insight into the complex absorbance characteristics of diverse blood types. After consideration of photobleaching and intrinsic fluorescence, pH optodes yielded accurate recordings and resolved a sigmoidal shift of 0.03 pH units in response to changing <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> from 0 to 21 kPa. Highly resolved continuous recordings along pH gradients conformed to stepwise measurements at low rates of pH changes. In this study we showed that a diffusion chamber upgraded with a broad-range spectrophotometer and an optical pH sensor accurately characterizes oxygen binding with minimal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e consumption and manipulation. We conclude that the modified diffusion chamber is highly suitable for experimental biologists who demand high flexibility, detailed insight into oxygen binding as well as experimental and biological accuracy combined in a single setup.</p>

Increased Cardiac Arrhythmogenesis Associated With Gap Junction Remodeling With Upregulation of RNA-Binding Protein FXR1
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Gap junction remodeling is well established as a consistent feature of human heart disease involving spontaneous ventricular arrhythmia. The mechanisms responsible for gap junction remodeling that include alterations in the distribution of, and protein expression within, gap junctions are still debated. Studies reveal that multiple transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulatory pathways are triggered in response to cardiac disease, such as those involving RNA-binding proteins. The expression levels of FXR1 (fragile X mental retardation autosomal homolog 1), an RNA-binding protein, are critical to maintain proper cardiac muscle function; however, the connection between FXR1 and disease is not clear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To identify the mechanisms regulating gap junction remodeling in cardiac disease, we sought to identify the functional properties of FXR1 expression, direct targets of FXR1 in human left ventricle dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) biopsy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es and mouse models of DCM through BioID proximity assay and RNA immunoprecipitation, how FXR1 regulates its targets through RNA stability and luciferase assays, and functional consequences of altering the levels of this important RNA-binding protein through the analysis of cardiac-specific FXR1 knockout mice and mice injected with 3xMyc-FXR1 adeno-associated virus.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>FXR1 expression is significantly increased in tissue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es from human and mouse models of DCM via Western blot analysis. FXR1 associates with intercalated discs, and integral gap junction proteins Cx43 (connexin 43), Cx45 (connexin 45), and ZO-1 (zonula occludens-1) were identified as novel mRNA targets of FXR1 by using a BioID proximity assay and RNA immunoprecipitation. Our findings show that FXR1 is a multifunctional protein involved in translational regulation and stabilization of its mRNA targets in heart muscle. In addition, introduction of 3xMyc-FXR1 via adeno-associated virus into mice leads to the redistribution of gap junctions and promotes ventricular tachycardia, showing the functional significance of FXR1 upregulation observed in DCM.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In DCM, increased FXR1 expression appears to play an important role in disease progression by regulating gap junction remodeling.

A nationwide survey was conducted from October 2012 to December 2015 to assess the prevalence of HTN in China.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A stratified multistage random <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>ing method was used to obtain a nationally representative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e of 451 755 residents ≥18 years of age from 31 provinces in mainland China from October 2012 to December 2015. Blood pressure (BP) was measured after resting for 5 minutes by trained staff using a validated oscillometric BP monitor. HTN was defined as systolic BP (SBP) ≥140 mm Hg/or diastolic BP (DBP) ≥90 mm Hg or use of antihypertensive medication within 2 weeks. Pre-HTN was defined as SBP 120 to 139 mm Hg and DBP 80 to 89 mm Hg without antihypertensive medication. HTN control was defined as SBP <140 mm Hg and DBP<90 mm Hg. In addition, the prevalence of HTN (SBP ≥130 or DBP ≥80 mm Hg) and control rate (SBP <130 and DBP <80 mm Hg) of HTN were also estimated according to the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association High Blood Pressure Guideline.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, 23.2% (≈244.5 million) of the Chinese adult population ≥18 years of age had HTN, and another 41.3% (≈435.3 million) had pre-HTN according to the Chinese guideline. There were no significant differences of HTN prevalence between urban and rural residents (23.4% versus 23.1%, <i>P</i>=0.819). Among individuals with HTN, 46.9% were aware of their condition, 40.7% were taking prescribed antihypertensive medications, and 15.3% had controlled HTN. Calcium channel blockers were the most commonly used antihypertensive medication (46.5%) as monotherapy, and 31.7% of treated hypertensive patients used ≥2 medications. The prevalence of HTN based on the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline was twice as high as that based on 2010 Chinese guideline (46.4%), whereas the control rate fell to 3.0%.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In China, there is a high prevalence of HTN and pre-HTN, and awareness, treatment, and control of HTN were low. Management of medical therapy for HTN needs to improve.</p></sec>

Targeting Transmembrane BAX Inhibitor Motif Containing 1 Alleviates Pathological Cardiac Hypertrophy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac hypertrophy and its resultant heart failure are among the most common causes of mortality worldwide. Abnormal protein degradation, especially the impaired lysosomal degradation of large organelles and membrane proteins, is involved in the progression of cardiac hypertrophy. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We investigated cardiac transmembrane BAX inhibitor motif containing 1 (TMBIM1) mRNA and protein expression levels in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es from patients with heart failure and mice with aortic banding (AB)–induced cardiac hypertrophy. We generated cardiac-specific <i>Tmbim1</i> knockout mice and cardiac-specific <i>Tmbim1</i>-overexpressing transgenic mice and then challenged them with AB surgery. We used microarray, confocal image, and coimmunoprecipitation analyses to identify the downstream targets of TMBIM1 in cardiac hypertrophy. <i>Tmbim1</i>/<i>Tlr4</i> double-knockout mice were generated to investigate whether the effects of TMBIM1 on cardiac hypertrophy were Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) dependent. Finally, lentivirus-mediated <i>TMBIM1</i> overexpression in a monkey AB model was performed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of TMBIM1.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>TMBIM1 expression was significantly downregulated on hypertrophic stimuli in both human and mice heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es. Silencing cardiac <i>Tmbim1</i> aggravated AB-induced cardiac hypertrophy. This effect was blunted by <i>Tmbim1</i> overexpression. Transcriptome profiling revealed that the TLR4 signaling pathway was disrupted dramatically by manipulation of <i>Tmbim1</i>. The effects of TMBIM1 on cardiac hypertrophy were shown to be dependent on TLR4 in double-knockout mice. Fluorescent staining indicated that TMBIM1 promoted the lysosome-mediated degradation of activated TLR4. Coimmunoprecipitation assays confirmed that TMBIM1 directly interacted with tumor susceptibility gene 101 via a PTAP motif and accelerated the formation of multivesicular bodies that delivered TLR4 to the lysosomes. Finally, lentivirus-mediated <i>TMBIM1</i> overexpression reversed AB-induced cardiac hypertrophy in monkeys.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>TMBIM1 protects against pathological cardiac hypertrophy through promoting the lysosomal degradation of activated TLR4. Our findings reveal the central role of TMBIM1 as a multivesicular body regulator in the progression of pathological cardiac hypertrophy, as well as the role of vesicle trafficking in signaling regulation during cardiac hypertrophy. Moreover, targeting TMBIM1 could be a novel therapeutic strategy for treating cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure.</p></sec>

Genetic Architecture of the Cardiovascular Risk Proteome
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>We recently identified 156 proteins in human plasma that were each associated with the net Framingham Cardiovascular Disease Risk Score using an aptamer-based proteomic platform in Framingham Heart Study Offspring participants. Here we hypothesized that performing genome-wide association studies and exome array analyses on the levels of each of these 156 proteins might identify genetic determinants of risk-associated circulating factors and provide insights into early cardiovascular pathophysiology.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied the association of genetic variants with the plasma levels of each of the 156 Framingham Cardiovascular Disease Risk Score–associated proteins using linear mixed-effects models in 2 population-based cohorts. We performed discovery analyses on plasma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es from 759 participants of the Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort, an observational study of the offspring of the original Framingham Heart Study and their spouses, and validated these findings in plasma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es from 1421 participants of the MDCS (Malmö Diet and Cancer Study). To evaluate the utility of this strategy in identifying new biological pathways relevant to cardiovascular disease pathophysiology, we performed studies in a cell-model system to experimentally validate the functional significance of an especially novel genetic association with circulating apolipoprotein E levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified 120 locus-protein associations in genome-wide analyses and 41 associations in exome array analyses, the majority of which have not been described previously. These loci explained up to 66% of interindividual plasma protein-level variation and, on average, accounted for 3 times the amount of variation explained by common clinical factors, such as age, sex, and diabetes mellitus status. We described overlap among many of these loci and cardiovascular disease genetic risk variants. Finally, we experimentally validated a novel association between circulating apolipoprotein E levels and the transcription factor phosphatase 1G. Knockdown of phosphatase 1G in a human liver cell model resulted in decreased apolipoprotein E transcription and apolipoprotein E protein levels in cultured supernatants.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We identified dozens of novel genetic determinants of proteins associated with the Framingham Cardiovascular Disease Risk Score and experimentally validated a new role for phosphatase 1G in lipoprotein biology. Further, genome-wide and exome array data for each protein have been made publicly available as a resource for cardiovascular disease research.</p></sec>

Improving Assessment of Drug Safety Through Proteomics
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Early detection of adverse effects of novel therapies and understanding of their mechanisms could improve the safety and efficiency of drug development. We have retrospectively applied large-scale proteomics to blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es from ILLUMINATE (Investigation of Lipid Level Management to Understand its Impact in Atherosclerotic Events), a trial of torcetrapib (a cholesterol ester transfer protein inhibitor), that involved 15 067 participants at high cardiovascular risk. ILLUMINATE was terminated at a median of 550 days because of significant absolute increases of 1.2% in cardiovascular events and 0.4% in mortality with torcetrapib. The aims of our analysis were to determine whether a proteomic analysis might reveal biological mechanisms responsible for these harmful effects and whether harmful effects of torcetrapib could have been detected early in the ILLUMINATE trial with proteomics.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A nested case-control analysis of paired plasma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es at baseline and at 3 months was performed in 249 participants assigned to torcetrapib plus atorvastatin and 223 participants assigned to atorvastatin only. Within each treatment arm, cases with events were matched to controls 1:1. Main outcomes were a survey of 1129 proteins for discovery of biological pathways altered by torcetrapib and a 9-protein risk score validated to predict myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, or death.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Plasma concentrations of 200 proteins changed significantly with torcetrapib. Their pathway analysis revealed unexpected and widespread changes in immune and inflammatory functions, as well as changes in endocrine systems, including in aldosterone function and glycemic control. At baseline, 9-protein risk scores were similar in the 2 treatment arms and higher in participants with subsequent events. At 3 months, the absolute 9-protein derived risk increased in the torcetrapib plus atorvastatin arm compared with the atorvastatin-only arm by 1.08% (<i>P</i>=0.0004). Thirty-seven proteins changed in the direction of increased risk of 49 proteins previously associated with cardiovascular and mortality risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Heretofore unknown effects of torcetrapib were revealed in immune and inflammatory functions. A protein-based risk score predicted harm from torcetrapib within just 3 months. A protein-based risk assessment embedded within a large proteomic survey may prove to be useful in the evaluation of therapies to prevent harm to patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Tryptophan-Derived 3-Hydroxyanthranilic Acid Contributes to Angiotensin II–Induced Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Formation in Mice In Vivo
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Abnormal amino acid metabolism is associated with vascular disease. However, the causative link between dysregulated tryptophan metabolism and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism. Mice with deficiencies in both apolipoprotein e (Apoe) and IDO (Apoe<sup>–/–</sup>/IDO<sup>–/–</sup>) were generated by cross-breeding IDO<sup>–/–</sup> mice with Apoe<sup>–/–</sup> mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The acute infusion of angiotensin II markedly increased the incidence of AAA in Apoe<sup>–/–</sup> mice, but not in Apoe<sup>–/–</sup>/IDO<sup>–/–</sup> mice, which presented decreased elastic lamina degradation and aortic expansion. These features were not altered by the reconstitution of bone marrow cells from IDO<sup>+/+</sup> mice. Moreover, angiotensin II infusion instigated interferon-γ, which induced the expression of IDO and kynureninase and increased 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HAA) levels in the plasma and aortas of Apoe<sup>–/–</sup> mice, but not in IDO<sup>–/–</sup> mice. Both IDO and kynureninase controlled the production of 3-HAA in vascular smooth muscle cells. 3-HAA upregulated matrix metallopeptidase 2 via transcription factor nuclear factor-κB. Furthermore, kynureninase knockdown in mice restrained 3-HAA, matrix metallopeptidase 2, and resultant AAA formation by angiotensin II infusion. Intraperitoneal injections of 3-HAA into Apoe<sup>–/–</sup> and Apoe<sup>–/–</sup>/IDO<sup>–/–</sup> mice for 6 weeks increased the expression and activity of matrix metallopeptidase 2 in aortas without affecting metabolic parameters. Finally, human AAA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es had stronger staining with the antibodies against 3-HAA, IDO, and kynureninase than those in adjacent nonaneurysmal aortic sections of human AAA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These data define a previously undescribed causative role for 3-HAA, which is a product of tryptophan metabolism, in AAA formation. Furthermore, these findings suggest that 3-HAA reduction may be a new target for treating cardiovascular diseases.</p></sec>

Tomo-Seq Identifies SOX9 as a Key Regulator of Cardiac Fibrosis During Ischemic Injury
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac ischemic injury induces a pathological remodeling response, which can ultimately lead to heart failure. Detailed mechanistic insights into molecular signaling pathways relevant for different aspects of cardiac remodeling will support the identification of novel therapeutic targets.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Although genome-wide transcriptome analysis on diseased tissues has greatly advanced our understanding of the regulatory networks that drive pathological changes in the heart, this approach has been disadvantaged by the fact that the signals are derived from tissue homogenates. Here we used tomo-seq to obtain a genome-wide gene expression signature with high spatial resolution spanning from the infarcted area to the remote to identify new regulators of cardiac remodeling. Cardiac tissue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es from patients suffering from ischemic heart disease were used to validate our findings.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Tracing transcriptional differences with a high spatial resolution across the infarcted heart enabled us to identify gene clusters that share a comparable expression profile. The spatial distribution patterns indicated a separation of expressional changes for genes involved in specific aspects of cardiac remodeling, such as fibrosis, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, and calcium handling (<i>Col1a2</i>, <i>Nppa</i>, and <i>Serca2</i>). Subsequent correlation analysis allowed for the identification of novel factors that share a comparable transcriptional regulation pattern across the infarcted tissue. The strong correlation between the expression levels of these known marker genes and the expression of the coregulated genes could be confirmed in human ischemic cardiac tissue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es. Follow-up analysis identified SOX9 as common transcriptional regulator of a large portion of the fibrosis-related genes that become activated under conditions of ischemic injury. Lineage-tracing experiments indicated that the majority of COL1-positive fibroblasts stem from a pool of SOX9-expressing cells, and in vivo loss of <i>Sox9</i> blunted the cardiac fibrotic response on ischemic injury. The colocalization between SOX9 and COL1 could also be confirmed in patients suffering from ischemic heart disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Based on the exact local expression cues, tomo-seq can serve to reveal novel genes and key transcription factors involved in specific aspects of cardiac remodeling. Using tomo-seq, we were able to unveil the unknown relevance of SOX9 as a key regulator of cardiac fibrosis, pointing to SOX9 as a potential therapeutic target for cardiac fibrosis.</p></sec>

Heart Failure Stages Among Older Adults in the Community
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although heart failure (HF) disproportionately affects older adults, little data exist regarding the prevalence of American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association HF stages among older individuals in the community. Additionally, the role of contemporary measures of longitudinal strain and diastolic dysfunction in defining HF stages is unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>HF stages were classified in 6118 participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study (67–91 years of age) at the fifth study visit as follows: A (asymptomatic with HF risk factors but no cardiac structural or functional abnormalities), B (asymptomatic with structural abnormalities, defined as left ventricular hypertrophy, dilation or dysfunction, or significant valvular disease), C1 (clinical HF without prior hospitalization), and C2 (clinical HF with earlier hospitalization).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Using the traditional definitions of HF stages, only 5% of examined participants were free of HF risk factors or structural heart disease (Stage 0), 52% were categorized as Stage A, 30% Stage B, 7% Stage C1, and 6% Stage C2. Worse HF stage was associated with a greater risk of incident HF hospitalization or death at a median follow-up of 608 days. Left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction was preserved in 77% and 65% in Stages C1 and C2, respectively. Incorporation of longitudinal strain and diastolic dysfunction into the Stage B definition reclassified 14% of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e from Stage A to B and improved the net reclassification index (<i>P</i>=0.028) and integrated discrimination index (<i>P</i>=0.016). Abnormal LV structure, systolic function (based on LV ejection fraction and longitudinal strain), and diastolic function (based on e’, E/e’, and left atrial volume index) were each independently and additively associated with risk of incident HF hospitalization or death in Stage A and B participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The majority of older adults in the community are at risk for HF (Stages A or B), appreciably more compared with previous reports in younger community-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es. LV ejection fraction is robustly preserved in at least two-thirds of older adults with prevalent HF (Stage C), highlighting the burden of HF with preserved LV ejection fraction in the elderly. LV diastolic function and longitudinal strain provide incremental prognostic value beyond conventional measures of LV structure and LV ejection fraction in identifying persons at risk for HF hospitalization or death.</p></sec>

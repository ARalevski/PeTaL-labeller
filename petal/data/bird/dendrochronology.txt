U-Pb constraints on pulsed eruption of the Deccan Traps across the end-Cretaceous mass extinction
<p>Temporal correlation between some continental flood basalt eruptions and mass extinctions has been proposed to indicate causality, with eruptive volatile release driving environmental degradation and extinction. We tested this model for the Deccan Traps flood basalt province, which, along with the Chicxulub bolide impact, is implicated in the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction approximately 66 million years ago. We estimated Deccan eruption rates with uranium-lead (U-Pb) zircon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geochronolog</span></strong>y and resolved four high-volume eruptive periods. According to this model, maximum eruption rates occurred before and after the K-Pg extinction, with one such pulse initiating tens of thousands of years prior to both the bolide impact and extinction. These findings support extinction models that incorporate both catastrophic events as drivers of environmental deterioration associated with the K-Pg extinction and its aftermath.</p>

Regional and global sea-surface temperatures during the last interglaciation
<p>The last interglaciation (LIG, 129 to 116 thousand years ago) was the most recent time in Earth’s history when global mean sea level was substantially higher than it is at present. However, reconstructions of LIG global temperature remain uncertain, with estimates ranging from no significant difference to nearly 2°C warmer than present-day temperatures. Here we use a network of sea-surface temperature (SST) records to reconstruct spatiotemporal variability in regional and global SSTs during the LIG. Our results indicate that peak LIG global mean annual SSTs were 0.5 ± 0.3°C warmer than the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climatolog</span></strong>ical mean from 1870 to 1889 and indistinguishable from the 1995 to 2014 mean. LIG warming in the extratropical latitudes occurred in response to boreal insolation and the bipolar seesaw, whereas tropical SSTs were slightly cooler than the 1870 to 1889 mean in response to reduced mean annual insolation.</p>

Ocean mixing and ice-sheet control of seawater <sup>234</sup>U/<sup>238</sup>U during the last deglaciation
<p>Seawater <sup>234</sup>U/<sup>238</sup>U provides global-scale information about continental weathering and is vital for marine uranium-series <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geochronolog</span></strong>y. Existing evidence supports an increase in <sup>234</sup>U/<sup>238</sup>U since the last glacial period, but the timing and amplitude of its variability has been poorly constrained. Here we report two seawater <sup>234</sup>U/<sup>238</sup>U records based on well-preserved deep-sea corals from the low-latitude Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The Atlantic <sup>234</sup>U/<sup>238</sup>U started to increase before major sea-level rise and overshot the modern value by 3 per mil during the early deglaciation. Deglacial <sup>234</sup>U/<sup>238</sup>U in the Pacific converged with that in the Atlantic after the abrupt resumption of Atlantic meridional overturning. We suggest that ocean mixing and early deglacial release of excess <sup>234</sup>U from enhanced subglacial melting of the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets have driven the observed <sup>234</sup>U/<sup>238</sup>U evolution.</p>

Xylem Sap Surface Tension May Be Crucial for Hydraulic Safety
<p>The surface tension (γ) of xylem sap plays a key role in stabilizing air-water interfaces at the pits between water- and gas-filled conduits to avoid air seeding at low water potentials. We studied seasonal changes in xylem sap γ in <i>Picea abies</i> and <i>Pinus mugo</i> growing at the alpine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">timberlin</span></strong>e. We analyzed their vulnerability to drought-induced embolism using solutions of different γ and estimated the potential effect of seasonal changes in γ on hydraulic vulnerability. In both species, xylem sap γ showed distinct seasonal courses between about 50 and 68 m<sc>n</sc> m<sup>−1</sup>. Solutions with low γ caused higher vulnerability to drought-induced xylem embolism. The water potential at 50% loss of hydraulic conductivity in <i>P. abies</i> and <i>P. mugo</i> was −3.35 and −3.86 MPa at γ of 74 m<sc>n</sc> m<sup>−1</sup> but −2.11 and −2.09 MPa at 45 m<sc>n</sc> m<sup>−1</sup>. This indicates up to about 1 MPa seasonal variation in 50% loss of hydraulic conductivity. The results revealed pronounced effects of changes in xylem sap γ on the hydraulic safety of trees in situ. These effects also are relevant in vulnerability analyses, where the use of standard solutions with high γ overestimates hydraulic safety. Thus, γ should be considered carefully in hydraulic studies.</p>

Monitoring of Freezing Dynamics in Trees: A Simple Phase Shift Causes Complexity
<p>During winter, trees have to cope with harsh conditions, including extreme freeze-thaw stress. This study focused on ice nucleation and propagation, related water shifts and xylem cavitation, as well as cell damage and was based on in situ monitoring of xylem (thermocouples) and surface temperatures (infrared imaging), ultrasonic emissions, and dendrometer analysis. Field experiments during late winter on <i>Picea abies</i> growing at the alpine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">timberlin</span></strong>e revealed three distinct freezing patterns: (1) from the top of the tree toward the base, (2) from thin branches toward the main stem’s top and base, and (3) from the base toward the top. Infrared imaging showed freezing within branches from their base toward distal parts. Such complex freezing causes dynamic and heterogenous patterns in water potential and probably in cavitation. This study highlights the interaction between environmental conditions upon freezing and thawing and demonstrates the enormous complexity of freezing processes in trees. Diameter shrinkage, which indicated water fluxes within the stem, and acoustic emission analysis, which indicated cavitation events near the ice front upon freezing, were both related to minimum temperature and, upon thawing, related to vapor pressure deficit and soil temperature. These complex patterns, emphasizing the common mechanisms between frost and drought stress, shed new light on winter tree physiology.</p>

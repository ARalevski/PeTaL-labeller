Root Tip Shape Governs Root Elongation Rate under Increased Soil Strength
<p>Increased soil strength due to soil compaction or soil drying is a major limitation to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth and crop productivity. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s need to exert higher penetration force, resulting in increased penetration stress when elongating in soils of greater strength. This study aimed to quantify how the genotypic diversity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> tip geometry and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> diameter influences <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> elongation under different levels of soil strength and to determine the extent to which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s adjust to increased soil strength. Fourteen wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) varieties were grown in soil columns packed to three bulk densities representing low, moderate, and high soil strength. Under moderate and high soil strength, smaller <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> tip radius-to-length ratio was correlated with higher genotypic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> elongation rate, whereas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> diameter was not related to genotypic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> elongation. Based on cavity expansion theory, it was found that smaller <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> tip radius-to-length ratio reduced penetration stress, thus enabling higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> elongation rates in soils with greater strength. Furthermore, it was observed that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s could only partially adjust to increased soil strength. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> thickening was bounded by a maximum diameter, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> tips did not become more acute in response to increased soil strength. The obtained results demonstrated that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> tip geometry is a pivotal trait governing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> penetration stress and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> elongation rate in soils of greater strength. Hence, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> tip shape needs to be taken into account when selecting for crop varieties that may tolerate high soil strength.</p>

A New Phenotyping Pipeline Reveals Three Types of Lateral Roots and a Random Branching Pattern in Two Cereals
<p>Recent progress in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> phenotyping has focused mainly on increasing throughput for genetic studies, while identifying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> developmental patterns has been comparatively underexplored. We introduce a new phenotyping pipeline for producing high-quality spatiotemporal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> system development data and identifying developmental patterns within these data. The Smart<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> image-analysis system and temporal and spatial statistical models were applied to two cereals, pearl millet (<i>Pennisetum glaucum</i>) and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). Semi-Markov switching linear models were used to cluster lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s based on their growth rate profiles. These models revealed three types of lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s with similar characteristics in both species. The first type corresponds to fast and accelerating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s, the second to rapidly arrested <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s, and the third to an intermediate type where <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s cease elongation after a few days. These types of lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s were retrieved in different proportions in a maize mutant affected in auxin signaling, while the first most vigorous type was absent in maize plants exposed to severe shading. Moreover, the classification of growth rate profiles was mirrored by a ranking of anatomical traits in pearl millet. Potential dependencies in the succession of lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> types along the primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> were then analyzed using variable-order Markov chains. The lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> type was not influenced by the shootward neighbor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> type or by the distance from this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>. This random branching pattern of primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s was remarkably conserved, despite the high variability of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> systems in both species. Our phenotyping pipeline opens the door to exploring the genetic variability of lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> developmental patterns.</p>

Adaption of Roots to Nitrogen Deficiency Revealed by 3D Quantification and Proteomic Analysis
<p>Rapeseed (<i>Brassica napus</i>) is an important oil crop worldwide. However, severe inhibition of rapeseed production often occurs in the field due to nitrogen (N) deficiency. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> system is the main organ to acquire N for plant growth, but little is known about the mechanisms underlying rapeseed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> adaptions to N deficiency. Here, dynamic changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> architectural traits of N-deficient rapeseed plants were evaluated by 3D in situ quantification. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> proteome responses to N deficiency were analyzed by the tandem mass tag-based proteomics method, and related proteins were characterized further. Under N deficiency, rapeseed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s become longer, with denser cells in the meristematic zone and larger cells in the elongation zone of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> tips, and also become softer with reduced solidity. A total of 171 and 755 differentially expressed proteins were identified in short- and long-term N-deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s, respectively. The abundance of proteins involved in cell wall organization or biogenesis was highly enhanced, but most identified peroxidases were reduced in the N-deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s. Notably, peroxidase activities also were decreased, which might promote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> elongation while lowering the solidity of N-deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s. These results were consistent with the cell wall components measured in the N-deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s. Further functional analysis using transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants demonstrated that the two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>-related differentially expressed proteins contribute to the enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth under N deficiency conditions. These results provide insights into the global changes of rapeseed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> responses to N deficiency and may facilitate the development of rapeseed cultivars with high N use efficiency through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>-based genetic improvements.</p>

Root diameter variations explained by anatomy and phylogeny of 50 tropical and temperate tree species
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> diameter, a critical indicator of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> physiological function, varies greatly among tree species, but the underlying mechanism of this high variability is unclear. Here, we sampled 50 tree species across tropical and temperate zones in China, and measured <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> morphological and anatomical traits along the first five branch orders in each species. Our objectives were (i) to reveal the relationships between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> diameter, cortical thickness and stele diameter among tree species in tropical and temperate forests, and (ii) to investigate the relationship of both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> morphological and anatomical traits with divergence time during species radiation. The results showed that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> diameter was strongly affected by cortical thickness but less by stele diameter in both tropical and temperate species. Changes in cortical thickness explained over 90% of variation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> diameter for the first order, and ∼74–87% for the second and third orders. Thicker <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s displayed greater cortical thickness and more cortical cell layers than thinner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> diameter, cortical thickness and number of cortical cell layers significantly correlated with divergence time at the family level, showing similar variation trends in geological time. The results also suggested that trees tend to decrease their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> cortical thickness rather than stele diameter during species radiation. The close linkage of variations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> morphology and anatomy to phylogeny as demonstrated by the data from the 50 tree species should provide some insights into the mechanism of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> diameter variability among tree species.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Root Bending Is Antagonistically Affected by Hypoxia and ERF-Mediated Transcription via Auxin Signaling
<p>When plants encounter soil water logging or flooding, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s are the first organs to be confronted with reduced gas diffusion resulting in limited oxygen supply. Since <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s do not generate photosynthetic oxygen, they are rapidly faced with oxygen shortage rendering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s particularly prone to damage. While metabolic adaptations to low oxygen conditions, which ensure basic energy supply, have been well characterized, adaptation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth and development have received less attention. In this study, we show that hypoxic conditions cause the primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> to grow sidewise in a low oxygen environment, possibly to escape soil patches with reduced oxygen availability. This growth behavior is reversible in that gravitropic growth resumes when seedlings are returned to normoxic conditions. Hypoxic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> bending is inhibited by the group VII ethylene response factor (ERFVII) RAP2.12, as <i>rap2.12-1</i> seedlings show exaggerated primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> bending. Furthermore, overexpression of the ERFVII member <i>HRE2</i> inhibits <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> bending, suggesting that primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth direction at hypoxic conditions is antagonistically regulated by hypoxia and hypoxia-activated ERFVIIs. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> bending is preceded by the establishment of an auxin gradient across the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> tip as quantified with DII-VENUS and is synergistically enhanced by hypoxia and the auxin transport inhibitor naphthylphthalamic acid. The protein abundance of the auxin efflux carrier PIN2 is reduced at hypoxic conditions, a response that is suppressed by RAP2.12 overexpression, suggesting antagonistic control of auxin flux by hypoxia and ERFVII. Taken together, we show that hypoxia triggers an escape response of the primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> that is controlled by ERFVII activity and mediated by auxin signaling in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> tip.</p>

RSL Class II Transcription Factors Guide the Nuclear Localization of RHL1 to Regulate Root Hair Development
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hairs are important for absorption of nutrients and water from the rhizosphere. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> Hair Defective-Six Like (RSL) Class II family of transcription factors is expressed preferentially in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hairs and has a conserved role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair development in land plants. We functionally characterized the seven members of the RSL Class II subfamily in the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) genome. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hairs, six of these genes were preferentially expressed and four were strongly expressed. Phenotypic analysis of each mutant revealed that <i>Os07g39940</i> plays a major role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair formation, based on observations of a short <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair phenotype in those mutants. Overexpression (OX) for each of four family members in rice resulted in an increase in the density and length of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hairs. These four members contain a transcription activation domain and are targeted to the nucleus. They interact with rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> Hairless1 (OsRHL1), a key regulator of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair development. When heterologously expressed in epidermal cells of <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaves, OsRHL1 was predominantly localized to the cytoplasm. When coexpressed with each of the four RSL Class II members, however, OsRLH1 was translocated to the nucleus. Transcriptome analysis using <i>Os07g39940-</i>OX plants revealed that 86 genes, including Class III peroxidases, were highly up-regulated. Furthermore, reactive oxygen species levels in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hairs were increased in <i>Os07g39940-</i>OX plants but were drastically reduced in the <i>os07g39940</i> and <i>rhl1</i> mutants. Our results demonstrate that RSL Class II members function as essential regulators of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair development in rice.</p>

Mechanical Failure of Fine Root Cortical Cells Initiates Plant Hydraulic Decline during Drought
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> systems perform the crucial task of absorbing water from the soil to meet the demands of a transpiring canopy. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s are thought to operate like electrical fuses, which break when carrying an excessive load under conditions of drought stress. Yet the exact site and sequence of this dysfunction in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s remain elusive. Using in vivo x-ray computed microtomography, we found that drought-induced mechanical failure (i.e. lacunae formation) in fine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> cortical cells is the initial and primary driver of reduced fine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hydraulic conductivity (Lp<sub>r</sub>) under mild to moderate drought stress. Cortical lacunae started forming under mild drought stress (−0.6 MPa Ψ<sub>stem</sub>), coincided with a dramatic reduction in Lp<sub>r</sub>, and preceded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> shrinkage or significant xylem embolism. Only under increased drought stress was embolism formation observed in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> xylem, and it appeared first in the fine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s (50% loss of hydraulic conductivity [P<sub>50</sub>] reached at −1.8 MPa) and then in older, coarse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s (P<sub>50</sub> = −3.5 MPa). These results suggest that cortical cells in fine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s function like hydraulic fuses that decouple plants from drying soil, thus preserving the hydraulic integrity of the plant’s vascular system under early stages of drought stress. Cortical lacunae formation led to permanent structural damage of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> cortex and nonrecoverable Lp<sub>r</sub>, pointing to a role in fine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> mortality and turnover under drought stress.</p>

ANN1 and ANN2 Function in Post-Phloem Sugar Transport in Root Tips to Affect Primary Root Growth
<p>Annexins are a multigene family of calcium-dependent membrane-binding proteins that play important roles in plant cell signaling. Annexins are multifunctional proteins, and their function in plants is not comprehensively understood. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) annexins ANN1 and ANN2 are 64% identical in their primary structure, and both are highly expressed in seedlings. Here, we showed that <i>ann-mutant</i> seedlings grown in the absence of sugar show decreased primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth and altered columella cells in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> caps; however, these mutant defects are rescued by Suc, Glc, or Fru. In seedlings grown without sugar, significant up-regulation of photosynthetic gene expression and chlorophyll accumulation was found in <i>ann-mutant</i> cotyledons compared to that in wild type, which indicates potential sugar starvation in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s of <i>ann-mutant</i> seedlings. Unexpectedly, the overall sugar content of <i>ann-mutant</i> primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s was significantly higher than that of wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s when grown without sugar. To examine the diffusion of sugar along the entire <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> tip, we examined the unloading pattern of carboxyfluorescein dye and found that post-phloem sugar transport was impaired in <i>ann-mutant</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> tips compared to that in wild type. Increased levels of ROS and callose were detected in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> tips of <i>ann-mutant</i> seedlings grown without Suc, the latter of which would restrict plasmodesmal sugar transport to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> tips. Our results indicate that ANN1 and ANN2 play an important role in post-phloem sugar transport to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> tip, which in turn indirectly influences photosynthetic rates in cotyledons. This study expands our understanding of the function of annexins in plants.</p>

Auxin Efflux Carrier ZmPGP1 Mediates Root Growth Inhibition under Aluminum Stress
<p>Auxin has been shown to enhance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth inhibition under aluminum (Al) stress in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). However, in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), auxin may play a negative role in the Al-induced inhibition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth. In this study, we identified mutants deficient in the maize auxin efflux carrier P-glycoprotein (ZmPGP1) after ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis and used them to elucidate the contribution of ZmPGP1 to Al-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth inhibition. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth in the <i>zmpgp1</i> mutant, which forms shortened <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s and is hyposensitive to auxin, was less inhibited by Al stress than that in the inbred line B73. In the <i>zmpgp1</i> mutants, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> tips displayed higher auxin accumulation and enhanced auxin signaling under Al stress, which was also consistent with the increased expression of auxin-responsive genes. Based on the behavior of the auxin-responsive marker transgene, <i>DR5rev:RFP</i>, we concluded that Al stress reduced the level of auxin in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> tip, which contrasts with the tendency of Al stress-induced Arabidopsis plants to accumulate more auxin in their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> tips. In addition, Al stress induced the expression of <i>ZmPGP1</i>. Therefore, in maize, Al stress is associated with reduced auxin accumulation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> tips, a process that is regulated by ZmPGP1 and thus causes inhibition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth. This study provides further evidence about the role of auxin and auxin polar transport in Al-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth regulation in maize.</p>

The Deubiquitinase OTU5 Regulates Root Responses to Phosphate Starvation
<p>Phosphorus, taken up by plants as inorganic phosphate (Pi), is an essential but often growth-limiting mineral nutrient for plants. As part of an orchestrated response to improve its acquisition, insufficient Pi supply triggers alterations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> architecture and epidermal cell morphogenesis. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants defective in the expression of the <i>OVARIAN TUMOR DOMAIN-CONTAINING DEUBIQUITINATING ENZYME5</i> (<i>OTU5</i>) exhibited a constitutive Pi deficiency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> phenotype, comprising the formation of long and dense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hairs and attenuated primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth. Quantitative protein profiling of <i>otu5</i> and wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s using the isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification methodology revealed genotype- and Pi-dependent alterations in protein profiles. In <i>otu5</i> plants, Pi starvation caused a short-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>-hair phenotype and decreased abundance of a suite of Pi-responsive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair-related proteins. Mutant plants also showed the accumulation of proteins involved in chromatin remodeling and altered distribution of reactive oxygen species along the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>, which may be causative for the alterations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair morphogenesis. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair phenotype of <i>otu5</i> was synergistic to that of <i>actin-related protein6</i> (<i>arp6</i>), harboring a mutation in the SWR1 chromatin-remodeling complex. Genetic analysis of <i>otu5/arp6</i> double mutants suggests independent but functionally related roles of the two proteins in chromatin organization. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair phenotype of <i>otu5</i> is not caused by a general up-regulation of the Pi starvation response, indicating that OTU5 acts downstream of or interacts with Pi signaling. It is concluded that OTU5 is involved in the interpretation of environmental information, probably by altering chromatin organization and maintaining redox homeostasis.</p>

Reduction in Root Secondary Growth as a Strategy for Phosphorus Acquisition
<p>We tested the hypothesis that reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> secondary growth of dicotyledonous species improves phosphorus acquisition. Functional-structural modeling in Sim<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> indicates that, in common bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>), reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> secondary growth reduces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> metabolic costs, increases <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> length, improves phosphorus capture, and increases shoot biomass in low-phosphorus soil. Observations from the field and greenhouse confirm that, under phosphorus stress, resource allocation is shifted from secondary to primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth, genetic variation exists for this response, and reduced secondary growth improves phosphorus capture from low-phosphorus soil. Under low phosphorus in greenhouse mesocosms, genotypes with reduced secondary growth had 39% smaller <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> cross-sectional area, 60% less <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> respiration, 27% greater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> length, 78% greater shoot phosphorus content, and 68% greater shoot mass than genotypes with advanced secondary growth. In the field under low phosphorus, these genotypes had 43% smaller <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> cross-sectional area, 32% greater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> length, 58% greater shoot phosphorus content, and 80% greater shoot mass than genotypes with advanced secondary growth. Secondary growth eliminated arbuscular mycorrhizal associations as cortical tissue was destroyed. These results support the hypothesis that reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> secondary growth is an adaptive response to low phosphorus availability and merits investigation as a potential breeding target.</p>

Shoot Removal Induces Chloroplast Development in Roots via Cytokinin Signaling
<p>The development of plant chloroplasts is regulated by various developmental, environmental, and hormonal cues. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), chloroplast development is repressed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s via auxin signaling. However, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s develop chloroplasts when they are detached from the shoot. In contrast to auxin, cytokinin positively affects chloroplast development in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s, but the role and signaling pathway of cytokinin in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> greening response remain unclear. To understand the regulatory pathways of chloroplast development in the plant stress response, we examined the mechanisms underlying the conditional greening of detached <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s. In wild-type Arabidopsis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s, shoot removal activates type B ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR (ARR)-mediated cytokinin signaling and induces chlorophyll accumulation and photosynthetic remodeling. ARR1 and ARR12 are essential for up-regulating nucleus- and plastid-encoded genes associated with chloroplast development in detached <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s. In this process, WOUND INDUCED DEDIFFERENTIATION1 and class B GATA transcription factors (B-GATAs) act upstream and downstream of ARRs, respectively. Overexpression of B-GATAs promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> greening, as does shoot removal, dependent on a light signaling transcription factor, LONG HYPOCOTYL5. Auxin represses the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> greening response independent of ARR signaling. <i>GNC-LIKE</i> (<i>GNL</i>), a B-GATA, is strongly up-regulated in detached <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s via ARR1 and ARR12 but is repressed by auxin, so <i>GNL</i> may function at the point of convergence of cytokinin and auxin signaling in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> greening response.</p>

Cell-Type-Specific H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase Activity in Root Tissues Enables K<sup>+</sup> Retention and Mediates Acclimation of Barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) to Salinity Stress
<p>While the importance of cell type specificity in plant adaptive responses is widely accepted, only a limited number of studies have addressed this issue at the functional level. We have combined electrophysiological, imaging, and biochemical techniques to reveal the physiological mechanisms conferring higher sensitivity of apical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> cells to salinity in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>). We show that salinity application to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> apex arrests <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth in a highly tissue- and treatment-specific manner. Although salinity-induced transient net Na<sup>+</sup> uptake was about 4-fold higher in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> apex compared with the mature zone, mature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> cells accumulated more cytosolic and vacuolar Na<sup>+</sup>, suggesting that the higher sensitivity of apical cells to salt is not related to either enhanced Na<sup>+</sup> exclusion or sequestration inside the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>. Rather, the above differential sensitivity between the two zones originates from a 10-fold difference in K<sup>+</sup> efflux between the mature zone and the apical region (much poorer in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> apex) of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>. Major factors contributing to this poor K<sup>+</sup> retention ability are (1) an intrinsically lower H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> apex, (2) greater salt-induced membrane depolarization, and (3) a higher reactive oxygen species production under NaCl and a larger density of reactive oxygen species-activated cation currents in the apex. Salinity treatment increased (2- to 5-fold) the content of 10 (out of 25 detected) amino acids in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> apex but not in the mature zone and changed the organic acid and sugar contents. The causal link between the observed changes in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> metabolic profile and the regulation of transporter activity is discussed.</p>

Going with the Flow: Multiscale Insights into the Composite Nature of Water Transport in Roots
<p>As water often limits crop production, a more complete understanding of plant water capture and transport is necessary. Here, we developed MECHA, a mathematical model that computes the flow of water across the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> at the scale of walls, membranes, and plasmodesmata of individual cells, and used it to test hypotheses related to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> water transport in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). The model uses detailed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> anatomical descriptions and a minimal set of experimental cell properties, including the conductivity of plasma membranes, cell walls, and plasmodesmata, which yield quantitative and scale-consistent estimations of water pathways and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> radial hydraulic conductivity (<i>k</i><sub>r</sub>). MECHA revealed that the mainstream hydraulic theories derived independently at the cell and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> segment scales are compatible only if osmotic potentials within the apoplastic domains are uniform. The results suggested that the convection-diffusion of apoplastic solutes explained most of the offset between estimated <i>k</i><sub>r</sub> in pressure clamp and osmotic experiments, while the contribution of water-filled intercellular spaces was limited. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses quantified the relative impact of cortex and endodermis cell conductivity of plasma membranes on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> <i>k</i><sub>r</sub> and suggested that only the latter contributed substantially to <i>k</i><sub>r</sub> due to the composite nature of water flow across <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s. The explicit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hydraulic anatomy framework brings insights into contradictory interpretations of experiments from the literature and suggests experiments to efficiently address questions pertaining to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> water relations. Its scale consistency opens avenues for cross-scale communication in the world of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hydraulics.</p>

Jasmonic Acid Enhances Al-Induced Root Growth Inhibition<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>Phytohormones such as ethylene and auxin are involved in the regulation of the aluminum (Al)-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth inhibition. Although jasmonate (JA) has been reported to play a crucial role in the regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth and development in response to environmental stresses through interplay with ethylene and auxin, its role in the regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth response to Al stress is not yet known. In an attempt to elucidate the role of JA, we found that exogenous application of JA enhanced the Al-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth inhibition. Furthermore, phenotype analysis with mutants defective in either JA biosynthesis or signaling suggests that JA is involved in the regulation of Al-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth inhibition. The expression of the JA receptor CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 (COI1) and the key JA signaling regulator MYC2 was up-regulated in response to Al stress in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> tips. This process together with COI1-mediated Al-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth inhibition under Al stress was controlled by ethylene but not auxin. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that many responsive genes under Al stress were regulated by JA signaling. The differential responsive of microtubule organization-related genes between the wild-type and <i>coi1-2</i> mutant is consistent with the changed depolymerization of cortical microtubules in <i>coi1</i> under Al stress. In addition, ALMT-mediated malate exudation and thus Al exclusion from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s in response to Al stress was also regulated by COI1-mediated JA signaling. Together, this study suggests that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth inhibition is regulated by COI1-mediated JA signaling independent from auxin signaling and provides novel insights into the phytohormone-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth inhibition in response to Al stress.</p>

Transcription Factors WOX11/12 Directly Activate <i>WOX5/7</i> to Promote Root Primordia Initiation and Organogenesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>De novo organogenesis, which gives rise to adventitious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s and shoots, is a type of plant regeneration for survival after wounding. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), two main cell fate transition steps are required to establish the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> primordium during de novo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> organogenesis from leaf explants. The first step from regeneration-competent cells to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> founder cells involves activation of <i>WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX11</i> (<i>WOX11</i>) and <i>WOX12</i> (<i>WOX11</i>/<i>12</i>) expression by auxin. However, the molecular mechanism controlling the second step of fate transition from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> founder cells to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> primordium is poorly understood. In this study, we show that the expression levels of <i>WOX11</i>/<i>12</i> decrease while those of <i>WOX5</i> and <i>7</i> (<i>WOX5</i>/<i>7</i>) increase during the transition from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> founder cells to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> primordium. <i>WOX11</i>/<i>12</i> function genetically upstream of <i>WOX5</i>/<i>7</i>, and the WOX11/12 proteins directly bind to the promoters of <i>WOX5</i>/<i>7</i> to activate their transcription. Mutations in <i>WOX5</i>/<i>7</i> result in defective primordium formation. Overall, our data indicate that the expression switch from <i>WOX11</i>/<i>12</i> to <i>WOX5</i>/<i>7</i> is critical for initiation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> primordium during de novo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> organogenesis.</p>

Nitrogen uptake over entire root systems of tree seedlings
<p>Uptake of nitrogen (N) by sequential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> regions in six tree species was measured in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s of 16- to 26-month-old seedlings at 50 and 1500 µM NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> concentration, at the cell level using oscillating microelectrodes and at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> region level using enriched <sup>15</sup>N application. Our objective was to determine the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> regions making the greatest contribution to total N uptake in each species as measured by the two contrasting techniques. White and condensed tannin zones were the regions with the smallest surface area in all species, but these zones often had the highest net flux of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>. For most species, little variation was found among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> regions in N flux calculated using a <sup>15</sup>N mass balance approach, but where significant differences existed, high N flux was observed in white, cork or woody zones. When N fluxes measured by each of the two methods were multiplied by the estimated surface area or biomass of each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> region, the effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> region size had the greatest influence on regional N uptake. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> regions of greatest overall N uptake were the cork and woody zones, on average. Total N uptake may thus be greatest in older regions of tree seedling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s, despite low rates of uptake per unit area.</p>

A Transcription Factor, OsMADS57, Regulates Long-Distance Nitrate Transport and Root Elongation
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> nitrate uptake adjusts to the plant’s nitrogen demand for growth. Here, we report that OsMADS57, a MADS-box transcription factor, modulates nitrate translocation from rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s to shoots under low-nitrate conditions. <i>OsMADS57</i> is abundantly expressed in xylem parenchyma cells of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> stele and is induced by nitrate. Compared with wild-type rice plants supplied with 0.2 mM nitrate, <i>osmads57</i> mutants had 31% less xylem loading of nitrate, while overexpression lines had 2-fold higher levels. Shoot-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> <sup>15</sup>N content ratios were 40% lower in the mutants and 76% higher in the overexpression lines. Rapid NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> influx experiments showed that mutation of <i>OsMADS57</i> did not affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> nitrate uptake. Reverse transcription quantitative PCR analysis of <i>OsNRT2</i> nitrate transporter genes showed that after 5 min in 0.2 mM nitrate, only <i>OsNRT2.3a</i> (a vascular-specific high-affinity nitrate transporter) had reduced (by two-thirds) expression levels. At 60 min of nitrate treatment, lower expression levels were also observed for three additional <i>NRT2</i> genes (<i>OsNRT2.1/2.2/2.4</i>). Conversely, in the overexpression lines, four <i>NRT2</i> genes had much higher expression profiles at all time points tested. As previously reported, <i>OsNRT2.3a</i> functions in nitrate translocation, indicating the possible interaction between <i>OsMADS57</i> and <i>OsNRT2.3a</i>. Yeast one-hybrid and transient expression assays demonstrated that OsMADS57 binds to the CArG motif (CATTTTATAG) within the <i>OsNRT2.3a</i> promoter. Moreover, seminal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> elongation was inhibited in <i>osmads57</i> mutants, which may be associated with higher auxin levels in and auxin polar transport to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> tips of mutant plants. Taken together, these results suggest that OsMADS57 has a role in regulating nitrate translocation from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> to shoot via OsNRT2.3a.</p>

An in Vivo Imaging Assay Detects Spatial Variability in Glucose Release from Plant Roots
<p>Plants secrete a plethora of metabolites into the rhizosphere that allow them to obtain nutrients necessary for growth and modify microbial communities around the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s. Plants release considerable amounts of photosynthetically fixed carbon into the rhizosphere; hence, it is important to understand how carbon moves from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s into the rhizosphere. Approaches used previously to address this question involved radioactive tracers, fluorescent probes, and biosensors to study sugar movement in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s and into the rhizosphere. Although quite effective for studying sugar movement, it has been challenging to obtain data on spatial and temporal variability in sugar exudation using these techniques. In this study, we developed a gel-based enzyme-coupled colorimetric and fluorometric assay to image glucose (Glc) in vivo and used this assay to show that there is spatial variability in Glc release from plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s. We found that the primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s of maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) released more Glc from the base of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> than from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> tip and that the Glc release rate is reduced in response to water stress. These findings were confirmed independently by quantifying Glc release in well-watered and water-stressed maize primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s using high-performance anion-exchange chromatography. Additionally, we demonstrated differential patterns of Glc exudation in different monocot and eudicot plant species. These findings and their implications on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>-rhizosphere interactions are discussed.</p>

Boron Alleviates Aluminum Toxicity by Promoting Root Alkalization in Transition Zone via Polar Auxin Transport
<p>Boron (B) alleviates aluminum (Al) toxicity in higher plants; however, the underlying mechanisms behind this phenomenon remain unknown. Here, we used bromocresol green pH indicator, noninvasive microtest, and microelectrode ion flux estimation techniques to demonstrate that B promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> surface pH gradients in pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s, leading to alkalization in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> transition zone and acidification in the elongation zone, while Al inhibits these pH gradients. B significantly decreased Al accumulation in the transition zone (∼1.0–2.5 mm from the apex) of lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s, thereby alleviating Al-induced inhibition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> elongation. Net indole acetic acid (IAA) efflux detected by an IAA-sensitive platinum microelectrode showed that polar auxin transport, which peaked in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> transition zone, was inhibited by Al toxicity, while it was partially recovered by B. Electrophysiological experiments using the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) auxin transporter mutants (<i>auxin resistant1-7</i>; <i>pin-formed2</i> [<i>pin2</i>]) and the specific polar auxin transporter inhibitor1-naphthylphthalamic acid showed that PIN2-based polar auxin transport is involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> surface alkalization in the transition zone. Our results suggest that B promotes polar auxin transport driven by the auxin efflux transporter PIN2 and leads to the downstream regulation of the plasma membrane-H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, resulting in elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> surface pH, which is essential to decrease Al accumulation in this Al-targeted apical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> zone. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the role of exogenous B in alleviation of Al accumulation and toxicity in plants.</p>

Comparative Analysis of Arabidopsis Ecotypes Reveals a Role for Brassinosteroids in Root Hydrotropism
<p>Plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s respond to soil moisture gradients and remodel their growth orientation toward water through hydrotropism, a process vital for acclimation to a changing soil environment. Mechanisms underlying the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hydrotropic response, however, remain poorly understood. Here, we examined hydrotropism in 31 Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) ecotypes collected from different parts of the world and grown along moisture gradients in a specially designed soil-simulation system. Comparative transcriptome profiling and physiological analyses were carried out on three selected ecotypes, Wassilewskija (Ws), Columbia (Col-0) (strongly hydrotropic), Col-0 (moderately hydrotropic), and C24 (weakly hydrotropic), and in mutant lines with altered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hydrotropic responses. We show that H<sup>+</sup> efflux, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, redox homeostasis, epigenetic regulation, and phytohormone signaling may contribute to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hydrotropism. Among phytohormones, the role of brassinosteroids (BRs) was examined further. In the presence of an inhibitor of BR biosynthesis, the strong hydrotropic response observed in Ws was reduced. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> H<sup>+</sup> efflux and primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> elongation also were inhibited when compared with C24, an ecotype that showed a weak hydrotropic response. The BR-insensitive mutant <i>bri1-5</i> displayed higher rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth inhibition and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> curvature on moisture gradients in vertical or oblique orientation when compared with wild-type Ws. We also demonstrate that BRI1 (a BR receptor) interacts with AHA2 (a plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase) and that their expression patterns are highly coordinated. This synergistic action may contribute to the strong hydrotropism observed in Ws. Our results suggest that BR-associated H<sup>+</sup> efflux is critical in the hydrotropic response of Arabidopsis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s.</p>

Regulation of Hormonal Control, Cell Reprogramming, and Patterning during De Novo Root Organogenesis
<p>Body regeneration through formation of new organs is a major question in developmental biology. We investigated de novo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> formation using whole leaves of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Our results show that local cytokinin biosynthesis and auxin biosynthesis in the leaf blade followed by auxin long-distance transport to the petiole leads to proliferation of J0121-marked xylem-associated tissues and others through signaling of INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID INDUCIBLE28 (IAA28), CRANE (IAA18), WOODEN LEG, and ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATORS1 (ARR1), ARR10, and ARR12. Vasculature proliferation also involves the cell cycle regulator KIP-RELATED PROTEIN2 and ABERRANT LATERAL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> FORMATION4, resulting in a mass of cells with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>ing competence that resembles callus formation. Endogenous callus formation precedes specification of postembryonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> founder cells, from which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s are initiated through the activity of SHORT-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>, PLETHORA1 (PLT1), and PLT2. Primordia initiation is blocked in <i>shr plt1 plt2</i> mutant. Stem cell regulators SCHIZORIZA, JACKDAW, BLUEJAY, and SCARECROW also participate in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> initiation and are required to pattern the new organ, as mutants show disorganized and reduced number of layers and tissue initials resulting in reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>ing.

MtLAX2, a Functional Homologue of the Arabidopsis Auxin Influx Transporter AUX1, Is Required for Nodule Organogenesis
<p>Most legume plants can form nodules, specialized lateral organs that form on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s, and house nitrogen-fixing bacteria collectively called rhizobia. The uptake of the phytohormone auxin into cells is known to be crucial for development of lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s. To test the role of auxin influx in nodulation we used the auxin influx inhibitors 1-naphthoxyacetic acid (1-NOA) and 2-NOA, which we found reduced nodulation of <i>Medicago truncatula.</i> This suggested the possible involvement of the AUX/LAX family of auxin influx transporters in nodulation. Gene expression studies identified <i>MtLAX2</i>, a paralogue of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>AUX1</i>, as being induced at early stages of nodule development. <i>MtLAX2</i> is expressed in nodule primordia, the vasculature of developing nodules, and at the apex of mature nodules. The <i>MtLAX2</i> promoter contains several auxin response elements, and treatment with indole-acetic acid strongly induces <i>MtLAX2</i> expression in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s. <i>mtlax2</i> mutants displayed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> phenotypes similar to Arabidopsis <i>aux1</i> mutants, including altered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> gravitropism, fewer lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s, shorter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hairs, and auxin resistance. In addition, the activity of the synthetic DR5-GUS auxin reporter was strongly reduced in <i>mtlax2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s. Following inoculation with rhizobia, <i>mtlax2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s developed fewer nodules, had decreased DR5-GUS activity associated with infection sites, and had decreased expression of the early auxin responsive gene <i>ARF16a</i>. Our data indicate that MtLAX2 is a functional analog of Arabidopsis AUX1 and is required for the accumulation of auxin during nodule formation in tissues underlying sites of rhizobial infection.</p>

Due to the difficulties associated with visualization and data analysis, there is currently a poor understanding of the genetic players and molecular mechanisms involved in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> architecture of apple trees under drought conditions.

In this study, we found that MdMYB88 and MdMYB124 play important roles in maintaining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hydraulic conductivity under long-term drought conditions and therefore contribute toward adaptive drought tolerance.

Root Engineering in Barley: Increasing Cytokinin Degradation Produces a Larger Root System, Mineral Enrichment in the Shoot and Improved Drought Tolerance
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> size and architecture are important crop plant traits, as they determine access to water and soil nutrients. The plant hormone cytokinin is a negative regulator of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth and branching. Here, we generated transgenic barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) plants with an enlarged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> system by enhancing cytokinin degradation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s to explore the potential of cytokinin modulations in improving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> functions. This was achieved through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>-specific expression of a <i>CYTOKININ OXIDASE/DEHYDROGENASE</i> gene. Enhanced biomass allocation to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s did not penalize shoot growth or seed yield, indicating that these plants were not source limited. In leaves of transgenic lines, the concentrations of several macroelements and microelements were increased, particularly those with low soil mobility (phosphorus, manganese, and zinc). Importantly, seeds contained up to 44% more zinc, which is beneficial for human nutrition. Transgenic lines also demonstrated dampened stress responses to long-term drought conditions, indicating lower drought sensitivity. Taken together, this work demonstrates that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> engineering of cereals is a promising strategy to improve nutrient efficiency, biofortification, and drought tolerance.</p>

Maize recombinant inbred lines with contrasting CN were evaluated under suboptimal P availability in greenhouse mesocosms and the field. Under P stress in mesocosms, the large-CN phenotype had 48% greater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> respiration, 24% shallower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>ing depth, 32% greater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> length density in the topsoil, 37% greater leaf P concentration, 48% greater leaf photosynthesis, 33% greater stomatal conductance, and 44% greater shoot biomass than the small-CN phenotype. Under P stress in the field, the large-CN phenotype had 32% shallower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>ing depth, 51% greater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> length density in the topsoil, 44% greater leaf P concentration, 18% greater leaf photosynthesis, 21% greater stomatal conductance, 23% greater shoot biomass at anthesis, and 28% greater yield than the small-CN phenotype. These results support the hypothesis that large CN improves plant P acquisition from low-P soils by reducing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>ing depth and increasing topsoil foraging. The large-CN phenotype merits consideration as a selection target to improve P capture in maize and possibly other cereal crops.</p>

Branch angle phenotypes previously associated with single <i>LAZY</i> genes were here studied in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s and shoots of single and higher-order <i>atlazy</i> mutants. The results identify the major contributors to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> and shoot branch angles and gravitropic behavior of seedling hypocotyls and primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s. <i>AtLAZY1</i> is the principal determinant of inflorescence branch angle. The weeping inflorescence phenotype of <i>atlazy1</i>,<i>2</i>,<i>4</i> mutants may be due at least in part to a reversal in the gravitropism mechanism. <i>AtLAZY2</i> and <i>AtLAZY4</i> determined lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> branch angle. Lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s of the <i>atlazy2</i>,<i>4</i> double mutant emerged slightly upward, approximately 10° greater than perpendicular to the primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> axis, and they were agravitropic. Etiolated hypocotyls of the quadruple <i>atlazy1</i>,<i>2</i>,<i>3</i>,<i>4</i> mutant were essentially agravitropic, but their phototropic response was robust. In light-grown seedlings, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> of the <i>atlazy2</i>,<i>3</i>,<i>4</i> mutant was also agravitropic but when adapted to dim red light it displayed a reversed gravitropic response. A reversed auxin gradient across the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> visualized by a fluorescent signaling reporter explained the reversed, upward bending response. We propose that AtLAZY proteins control plant architecture by coupling gravity sensing to the formation of auxin gradients that override a LAZY-independent mechanism that creates an opposing gravity-induced auxin gradient.</p>

Root Cortical Senescence Improves Growth under Suboptimal Availability of N, P, and K
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> cortical senescence (RCS) in Triticeae reduces nutrient uptake, nutrient content, respiration, and radial hydraulic conductance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> tissue. We used the functional-structural model <i>Sim<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong></i> to evaluate the functional implications of RCS in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) under suboptimal nitrate, phosphorus, and potassium availability. The utility of RCS was evaluated using sensitivity analyses in contrasting nutrient regimes. At flowering (80 d), RCS increased simulated plant growth by up to 52%, 73%, and 41% in nitrate-, phosphorus-, and potassium-limiting conditions, respectively. Plants with RCS had reduced nutrient requirement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> tissue for optimal plant growth, reduced total cumulative cortical respiration, and increased total carbon reserves. Nutrient reallocation during RCS had a greater effect on simulated plant growth than reduced respiration or nutrient uptake. Under low nutrient availability, RCS had greater benefit in plants with fewer tillers. RCS had greater benefit in phenotypes with fewer lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s at low nitrate availability, but the opposite was true in low phosphorus or potassium availability. Additionally, RCS was quantified in field-grown barley in different nitrogen regimes. Field and virtual soil coring simulation results demonstrated that living cortical volume per <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> length (an indicator of RCS) decreased with depth in younger plants, while <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s of older plants had very little living cortical volume per <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> length. RCS may be an adaptive trait for nutrient acquisition by reallocating nutrients from senescing tissue and secondarily by reducing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> respiration. These simulated results suggest that RCS merits investigation as a breeding target for enhanced soil resource acquisition and edaphic stress tolerance.</p>

Diversification of Root Hair Development Genes in Vascular Plants
<p>The molecular genetic program for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair development has been studied intensively in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). To understand the extent to which this program might operate in other plants, we conducted a large-scale comparative analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair development genes from diverse vascular plants, including eudicots, monocots, and a lycophyte. Combining phylogenetics and transcriptomics, we discovered conservation of a core set of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair genes across all vascular plants, which may derive from an ancient program for unidirectional cell growth coopted for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair development during vascular plant evolution. Interestingly, we also discovered preferential diversification in the structure and expression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair development genes, relative to other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair- and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>-expressed genes, among these species. These differences enabled the definition of sets of genes and gene functions that were acquired or lost in specific lineages during vascular plant evolution. In particular, we found substantial divergence in the structure and expression of genes used for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair patterning, suggesting that the Arabidopsis transcriptional regulatory mechanism is not shared by other species. To our knowledge, this study provides the first comprehensive view of gene expression in a single plant cell type across multiple species.</p>

The Microtubule-Associated Protein MAP18 Affects ROP2 GTPase Activity during Root Hair Growth
<p>Establishment and maintenance of the polar site are important for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair tip growth. We previously reported that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN18 (MAP18) functions in controlling the direction of pollen tube growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair elongation. Additionally, the Rop GTPase ROP2 was reported as a positive regulator of both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair initiation and tip growth in Arabidopsis. Both loss of function of <i>ROP2</i> and knockdown of <i>MAP18</i> lead to a decrease in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair length, whereas overexpression of either <i>MAP18</i> or <i>ROP2</i> causes multiple tips or a branching hair phenotype. However, it is unclear whether MAP18 and ROP2 coordinately regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair growth. In this study, we demonstrate that MAP18 and ROP2 interact genetically and functionally. MAP18 interacts physically with ROP2 in vitro and in vivo and preferentially binds to the inactive form of the ROP2 protein. MAP18 promotes ROP2 activity during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair tip growth. Further investigation revealed that MAP18 competes with RhoGTPase GDP DISSOCIATION INHIBITOR1/SUPERCENTIPEDE1 for binding to ROP2, in turn affecting the localization of active ROP2 in the plasma membrane of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair tip. These results reveal a novel function of MAP18 in the regulation of ROP2 activation during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair growth.</p>

Phytoglobins Improve Hypoxic Root Growth by Alleviating Apical Meristem Cell Death
<p>Hypoxic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) is influenced by the expression of phytoglobins (<i>ZmPgbs</i>). Relative to the wild type, suppression of <i>ZmPgb1.1</i> or <i>ZmPgb1.2</i> inhibits the growth of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s exposed to 4% oxygen, causing structural abnormalities in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> apical meristems. These effects were accompanied by increasing levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), possibly through the transcriptional induction of four <i>Respiratory Burst Oxidase Homologs</i>. TUNEL-positive nuclei in meristematic cells indicated the involvement of programmed cell death (PCD) in the process. These cells also accumulated nitric oxide and stained heavily for ethylene biosynthetic transcripts. A sharp increase in the expression level of several 1-aminocyclopropane synthase (<i>ZmAcs2</i>, <i>ZmAcs6</i>, and <i>ZmAcs7</i>), 1-aminocyclopropane oxidase (<i>Aco15</i>, <i>Aco20</i>, <i>Aco31</i>, and <i>Aco35</i>), and ethylene-responsive (<i>ZmErf2</i> and <i>ZmEbf1</i>) genes was observed in hypoxic <i>ZmPgb</i>-suppressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s, which overproduced ethylene. Inhibiting ROS synthesis with diphenyleneiodonium or ethylene perception with 1-methylcyclopropene suppressed PCD, increased <i>BAX inhibitor-1</i>, an effective attenuator of the death programs in eukaryotes, and restored <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth. Hypoxic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s overexpressing <i>ZmPgbs</i> had the lowest level of ethylene and showed a reduction in ROS staining and TUNEL-positive nuclei in the meristematic cells. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s retained functional meristems and exhibited the highest growth performance when subjected to hypoxic conditions. Collectively, these results suggest a novel function of Pgbs in protecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> apical meristems from hypoxia-induced PCD through mechanisms initiated by nitric oxide and mediated by ethylene via ROS.</p>

Root Gravitropism Is Regulated by a Crosstalk between <i>para</i>-Aminobenzoic Acid, Ethylene, and Auxin
<p>Plants respond to gravitational force through directional growth along the gravity vector. Although auxin is the central component of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> graviresponse, it works in concert with other plant hormones. Here, we show that the folate precursor <i>para</i>-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) is a key modulator of the auxin-ethylene interplay during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> gravitropism in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). In gravistimulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s, PABA promotes an asymmetric auxin response, which causes the asymmetric growth responsible for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> curvature. This activity requires the auxin response transcription factors AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR7 (ARF7) and ARF19 as well as ethylene biosynthesis and signaling, indicating that PABA activity requires both auxin and ethylene pathways. Similar to ethylene, exogenous PABA reverses the agravitropic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth of the auxin transport mutant <i>pin-formed2</i> (<i>pin2</i>) and the auxin biosynthetic double mutant with loss of function of <i>weak ethylene insensitive</i> (<i>wei</i>) genes, <i>wei8wei2</i>, but not the <i>pin2wei8wei2</i> triple mutant. This finding suggests that PABA regulates the ethylene-dependent reciprocal compensation between auxin transport and biosynthesis. Furthermore, manipulation of endogenous free PABA levels by modulating the expression of the gene encoding its glucosylation enzyme, UDP-GLYCOSYL TRANSFERASE75B1, impacts the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> graviresponse, suggesting that endogenous free PABA levels may play a crucial role in modulating the auxin-ethylene cross talk necessary for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> gravitropism.</p>

The ARF7 and ARF19 Transcription Factors Positively Regulate <i>PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE1</i> in Arabidopsis Roots
<p>PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE1 (PHR1) is a key regulatory component of the response to phosphate (Pi) starvation. However, the regulation of <i>PHR1</i> in this response remains poorly understood. Here, we report that <i>PHR1</i> is a target of the transcription factors AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR7 (ARF7) and ARF19 and is positively regulated by auxin signaling in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s. <i>PHR1</i> expression was induced by exogenous auxin and suppressed by auxin transport inhibitors in Arabidopsis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s. In the <i>PHR1</i> promoter, three auxin-response elements, which are bound directly by ARF7 and ARF19, were shown to be essential for <i>PHR1</i> expression. The <i>arf7</i>, <i>arf19</i>, and <i>arf7 arf19</i> mutants showed down-regulated expression of <i>PHR1</i> and downstream Pi starvation-induced genes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s; they also exhibited defective Pi uptake in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s and overaccumulation of anthocyanin in shoots. The induction of lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> formation in response to low Pi and to exogenous auxin was decreased in the <i>phr1</i> mutant, whereas the expression of <i>LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES-DOMAIN16</i> (<i>LBD16</i>) and <i>LBD29</i> was not changed significantly. PHR1 acted independently of LBD16 and LBD29 in the regulation of lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> formation in response to low Pi. Under low-Pi conditions, lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> impairment in the <i>arf7 arf19</i> mutant was partially rescued by constitutive expression of <i>PHR1</i>, demonstrating that reduced <i>PHR1</i> expression contributed to the <i>arf7 arf19</i> phenotype. In addition to <i>PHR1</i>, other genes encoding MYB-CC members also were targets of ARF7 and ARF19. Our work thus reveals a mechanism coordinating auxin signaling and the PHR1 regulon in Arabidopsis responses to Pi deficiency.</p>

EZ-Root-VIS: A Software Pipeline for the Rapid Analysis and Visual Reconstruction of Root System Architecture
<p>If we want to understand how the environment has shaped the appearance and behavior of living creatures, we need to compare groups of individuals that differ in genetic makeup and environment experience. For complex phenotypic features, such as body posture or facial expression in humans, comparison is not straightforward because some of the contributing factors cannot easily be quantified or averaged across individuals. Therefore, computational methods are used to reconstruct representative prototypes using a range of algorithms for filling in missing information and calculating means. The same problem applies to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> system architecture (RSA) of plants. Several computer programs are available for extracting numerical data from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> images, but they usually do not offer customized data analysis or visual reconstruction of RSA. We developed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>-VIS, a free software tool that facilitates the determination of means and variance of many different RSA features across user-selected sets of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> images. Furthermore, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>-VIS offers several options to generate visual reconstructions of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> systems from the averaged data to enable screening and modeling. We confirmed the suitability of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>-VIS, combined with a new version of EZ-Rhizo, for the rapid characterization of genotype-environment interactions and gene discovery through genome-wide association studies in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>).</p>

Deubiquitinating Enzyme OTU5 Contributes to DNA Methylation Patterns and Is Critical for Phosphate Nutrition Signals
<p>Phosphate (Pi) starvation induces a suite of adaptive responses aimed at recalibrating cellular Pi homeostasis. Plants harboring a mutation in <i>OVARIAN TUMOR DOMAIN-CONTAINING DEUBIQUITINATING ENZYME5</i> (<i>OTU5</i>) showed altered DNA methylation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair-related genes and altered Pi-responsive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> traits. Unlike the wild type, homozygous <i>otu5</i> mutants did not respond to Pi starvation by increased lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> formation and increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair length but formed very short <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hairs when grown on low-Pi media. Under Pi-replete conditions, <i>otu5</i> plants developed more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hairs than the wild type due to attenuated primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth, a phenotype that resembled that of Pi-deficient plants. Growth of plants on low-Pi media altered both H3K4 and H3K27 trimethylation levels at the transcriptional start site of a subset of genes encoding key players in Pi homeostasis, which was correlated with mRNA abundance changes of these genes. Pi starvation had a minor impact on DNA methylation. Differentially methylated regions were enriched in transposable elements, suggesting that DNA methylation associated with low Pi supply is required for maintaining genome integrity. It is concluded that DNA methylation and histone methylation constitute critical, interdependent regulatory components that orchestrate the activity of a subset of Pi-responsive genes.</p>

Iron-Nicotianamine Transporters Are Required for Proper Long Distance Iron Signaling
<p>The mechanisms of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> iron uptake and the transcriptional networks that control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>-level regulation of iron uptake have been well studied, but the mechanisms by which shoots signal iron status to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s remain opaque. Here, we characterize an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) double mutant, <i>yellow stripe1-like yellow stripe3-like</i> (<i>ysl1ysl3</i>), which has lost the ability to properly regulate iron deficiency-influenced gene expression in both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s and shoots. In spite of markedly low tissue levels of iron, the double mutant does not up- and down-regulate iron deficiency-induced and -repressed genes. We have used grafting experiments to show that wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s grafted to <i>ysl1ysl3</i> shoots do not initiate iron deficiency-induced gene expression, indicating that the <i>ysl1ysl3</i> shoots fail to send an appropriate long-distance signal of shoot iron status to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s. We present a model to explain how impaired iron localization in leaf veins results in incorrect signals of iron sufficiency being sent to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s and affecting gene expression there. Improved understanding of the mechanism of long-distance iron signaling will allow improved strategies for the engineering of staple crops to accumulate additional bioavailable iron in edible parts, thus improving the iron nutrition of the billions of people worldwide whose inadequate diet causes iron deficiency anemia.</p>

A Magnesium Transporter OsMGT1 Plays a Critical Role in Salt Tolerance in Rice
<p>Salt stress is one of the major factors limiting rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) production globally. Although several transporters involved in salt tolerance have been identified in rice, the mechanisms regulating their transport activity are still poorly understood. Here, we show evidence that a rice Mg transporter OsMGT1 is required for salt tolerance probably by regulating transport activity of OsHKT1;5, a key transporter for the removal of Na<sup>+</sup> from the xylem sap at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> mature zone. Knockout of <i>OsMGT1</i> did not affect total Na uptake, but increased Na concentration in the shoots and xylem sap, resulting in a significant increase in salt sensitivity at low external Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration (20–200 μ<sc>m</sc>). However, such differences were abolished at a higher Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration (2 m<sc>m</sc>), although the total Na uptake was not altered. <i>OsMGT1</i> was expressed in both the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s and shoots, but only that in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s was moderately up-regulated by salt stress. Spatial expression analysis revealed that <i>OsMGT1</i> was expressed in all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> cells of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> tips but was highly expressed in the pericycle of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> mature zone. <i>OsMGT1</i> was also expressed in the phloem region of basal node, leaf blade, and sheath. When expressed in <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes, the transport activity of OsHKT1;5 was enhanced by elevating external Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration. Furthermore, knockout of <i>OsHKT1;5</i> in <i>osmgt1</i> mutant background did not further increase its salt sensitivity. Taken together, our results suggest that Mg<sup>2+</sup> transported by OsMGT1 in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> mature zone is required for enhancing OsHKT1;5 activity, thereby restricting Na accumulation to the shoots.</p>

ABA Suppresses Root Hair Growth via the OBP4 Transcriptional Regulator
<p>Plants modify organ growth and tune morphogenesis in response to various endogenous and environmental cues. At the cellular level, organ growth is often adjusted by alterations in cell growth, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this control remain poorly understood. In this study, we identify the DNA BINDING WITH ONE FINGER (DOF)-type transcription regulator OBF BINDING PROTEIN4 (OBP4) as a repressor of cell growth. Ectopic expression of <i>OBP4</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) inhibits cell growth, resulting in severe dwarfism and the repression of genes involved in the regulation of water transport, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair development, and stress responses. Among the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors known to control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair growth, OBP4 binds the <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> HAIR DEFECTIVE6-LIKE2</i> (<i>RSL2</i>) promoter to repress its expression. The accumulation of OBP4 proteins is detected in expanding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> epidermal cells, and its expression level is increased by the application of abscisic acid (ABA) at concentrations sufficient to inhibit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair growth. ABA-dependent induction of <i>OBP4</i> is associated with the reduced expression of <i>RSL2</i>. Furthermore, ectopic expression of <i>OBP4</i> or loss of <i>RSL2</i> function results in ABA-insensitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair growth. Taken together, our results suggest that OBP4-mediated transcriptional repression of <i>RSL2</i> contributes to the ABA-dependent inhibition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair growth in Arabidopsis.</p>

A Methyltransferase Trio Essential for Phosphatidylcholine Biosynthesis and Growth
<p>Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is a primary class of membrane lipids in most eukaryotes. In plants, the primary PC biosynthetic pathway and its role in plant growth and development remain elusive due to lack of a mutant model with substantially decreased PC content. Recently, a double mutant of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) PHOSPHO-BASE <i>N</i>-METHYLTRANSFERASE 1 (PMT1) and PMT3 was reported with reduced PC content and defective plant growth. However, residual PC content as well as the nonlethal phenotype of the mutant suggests an additional enzyme contributes to PC biosynthesis. In this article, we report on the role of three PMTs in PC biosynthesis and plant development, with a focus on PMT2. <i>PMT2</i> had the highest expression level among the three PMTs, and it was highly expressed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s. The <i>pmt1 pmt2</i> double mutant enhanced the defects in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth, cell viability, and PC content of <i>pmt1</i>, suggesting that PMT2 functions together with PMT1 in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s. Chemical inhibition of PMT activity in wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s reproduced the short <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> phenotype observed in <i>pmt1 pmt2</i>, suggesting that PMT1 and PMT2 are the major PMT isoforms in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s. In shoots, <i>pmt1 pmt2 pmt3</i> enhanced the phenotype of <i>pmt1 pmt3</i>, showing seedling lethality and further reduced PC content without detectable de novo PC biosynthesis. These results suggest that PMTs catalyze an essential reaction step in PC biosynthesis and that the three PMTs have differential tissue-specific functions in PC biosynthesis and plant growth.</p>

Genetic Dissection of Fe-Dependent Signaling in Root Developmental Responses to Phosphate Deficiency
<p>The inhibition of primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> (PR) growth is a major developmental response of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) to phosphate (Pi) deficiency. Previous studies have independently uncovered key roles of the LOW PHOSPHATE RESPONSE1 (LPR1) ferroxidase, the tonoplast-localized ALUMINUM SENSITIVE3 (ALS3)/SENSITIVE TO ALUMINUM RHIZOTOXICITY1 (STAR1) transporter complex, and the SENSITIVE TO PROTON RHIZOTOXICITY1 (STOP1; a transcription factor)-ALUMINUM-ACTIVATED MALATE TRANSPORTER1 (ALMT1; a malate transporter) regulatory module in mediating this response by controlling iron (Fe) homeostasis in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s, but how these three components interact to regulate PR growth under Pi deficiency remains unknown. Here, we dissected genetic relationships among these three key components and found that (1) STOP1, ALMT1, and LPR1 act downstream of ALS3/STAR1 in controlling PR growth under Pi deficiency; (2) ALS3/STAR1 inhibits the STOP1-ALMT1 pathway by repressing STOP1 protein accumulation in the nucleus; and (3) STOP1-ALMT1 and LPR1 control PR growth under Pi deficiency in an interdependent manner involving the promotion of malate-dependent Fe accumulation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s. Furthermore, this malate-mediated Fe accumulation depends on external Pi availability. We also performed a detailed analysis of the dynamic changes in the tissue-specific Fe accumulation patterns in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> tips of plants exposed to Pi deficiency. The results indicate that the degree of inhibition of PR growth induced by Pi deficiency is not linked to the level of Fe accumulated in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> apical meristem or the elongation zone. Our work provides insights into the molecular mechanism that regulates the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> developmental response to Pi deficiency.</p>

Identification of Transcriptional and Receptor Networks That Control Root Responses to Ethylene<xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>Transcriptomic analyses with high temporal resolution provide substantial new insight into hormonal response networks. This study identified the kinetics of genome-wide transcript abundance changes in response to elevated levels of the plant hormone ethylene in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s from light-grown Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings, which were overlaid on time-matched developmental changes. Functional annotation of clusters of transcripts with similar temporal patterns revealed rapidly induced clusters with known ethylene function and more slowly regulated clusters with novel predicted functions linked to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> development. In contrast to studies with dark-grown seedlings, where the canonical ethylene response transcription factor, EIN3, is central to ethylene-mediated development, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s of <i>ein3</i> and <i>eil1</i> single and double mutants still respond to ethylene in light-grown seedlings. Additionally, a subset of these clusters of ethylene-responsive transcripts were enriched in targets of EIN3 and ERFs. These results are consistent with EIN3-independent developmental and transcriptional changes in light-grown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s. Examination of single and multiple gain-of-function and loss-of-function receptor mutants revealed that, of the five ethylene receptors, ETR1 controls lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hair initiation and elongation and the synthesis of other receptors. These results provide new insight into the transcriptional and developmental responses to ethylene in light-grown seedlings.</p>

The Brassicaceae Family Displays Divergent, Shoot-Skewed NLR Resistance Gene Expression
<p>Nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat resistance genes (NLRs) allow plants to detect microbial effectors. We hypothesized that NLR expression patterns could reflect organ-specific differences in effector challenge and tested this by carrying out a meta-analysis of expression data for 1,235 NLRs from nine plant species. We found stable NLR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>/shoot expression ratios within species, suggesting organ-specific hardwiring of NLR expression patterns in anticipation of distinct challenges. Most monocot and dicot plant species preferentially expressed NLRs in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s. In contrast, Brassicaceae species, including oilseed rape (<i>Brassica napus</i>) and the model plant Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), were unique in showing NLR expression skewed toward the shoot across multiple phylogenetically distinct groups of NLRs. The Brassicaceae are also outliers in the sense that they have lost the common symbiosis signaling pathway, which enables intracellular infection by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> symbionts. While it is unclear if these two events are related, the NLR expression shift identified here suggests that the Brassicaceae may have evolved unique pattern-recognition receptors and antimicrobial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> metabolites to substitute for NLR protection. Such innovations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> protection could potentially be exploited in crop rotation schemes or for enhancing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> defense systems of non-Brassicaceae crops.</p>

Division Plane Orientation Defects Revealed by a Synthetic Double Mutant Phenotype
<p>TANGLED1 (TAN1) and AUXIN-INDUCED-IN-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>S9 (AIR9) are microtubule-binding proteins that localize to the division site in plants. Their function in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) remained unclear because neither <i>tan1</i> nor <i>air9</i> single mutants have a strong phenotype. We show that <i>tan1 air9</i> double mutants have a synthetic phenotype consisting of short, twisted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s with disordered cortical microtubule arrays that are hypersensitive to a microtubule-depolymerizing drug. The <i>tan1 air9</i> double mutants have significant defects in division plane orientation due to failures in placing the new cell wall at the correct division site. Full-length TAN1 fused to yellow fluorescent protein, <i>TAN1-YFP</i>, and several deletion constructs were transformed into the double mutant to assess which regions of TAN1 are required for its function in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> twisting, and division plane orientation. <i>TAN1-YFP</i> expressed in <i>tan1 air9</i> significantly rescued the double mutant phenotype in all three respects. Interestingly, TAN1 missing the first 126 amino acids, TAN1-ΔI-YFP, failed to rescue the double mutant phenotype, while TAN1 missing a conserved middle region, TAN1-ΔII-YFP, significantly rescued the mutant phenotype in terms of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth and division plane orientation but not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> twisting. We use the <i>tan1 air9</i> double mutant to discover new functions for TAN1 and AIR9 during phragmoplast guidance and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> morphogenesis.</p>

RopGEF1 Plays a Critical Role in Polar Auxin Transport in Early Development
<p>Polar auxin transport, facilitated by the combined activities of auxin influx and efflux carriers to maintain asymmetric auxin distribution, is essential for plant growth and development. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>RopGEF1</i>, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor and activator of Rho GTPases of plants (ROPs), is critically involved in polar distribution of auxin influx carrier AUX1 and differential accumulation of efflux carriers PIN7 and PIN2 and is important for embryo and early seedling development when RopGEF1 is prevalently expressed. Knockdown or knockout of <i>RopGEF1</i> induces embryo defects, cotyledon vein breaks, and delayed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> gravity responses. Altered expression from the auxin response reporter <i>DR5rev:GFP</i> in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> pole of <i>RopGEF1</i>-deficient embryos and loss of asymmetric distribution of <i>DR5rev:GFP</i> in their gravistimulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> tips suggest that auxin distribution is affected in <i>ropgef1</i> mutants. This is reflected by the polarity of AUX1 being altered in <i>ropgef1</i> embryos and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s, shifting from the normal apical membrane location to a basal location in embryo central vascular and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> protophloem cells and also reduced PIN7 accumulation at embryos and altered PIN2 distribution in gravistimulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s of mutant seedlings. In establishing that RopGEF1 is critical for AUX1 localization and PIN differential accumulation, our results reveal a role for RopGEF1 in cell polarity and polar auxin transport whereby it imapcts auxin-mediated plant growth and development.</p>

The MicroRNA390/TAS3 Pathway Mediates Symbiotic Nodulation and Lateral Root Growth
<p>Legume <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s form two types of postembryonic organs, lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s and symbiotic nodules. Nodule formation is the result of the interaction of legumes with rhizobia and requires the mitotic activation and differentiation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> cells as well as an independent, but coordinated, program that allows infection by rhizobia. MicroRNA390 (miR390) is an evolutionarily conserved microRNA that targets the <i>Trans-Acting Short Interference RNA3</i> (<i>TAS3</i>) transcript. Cleavage of <i>TAS3</i> by ARGONAUTE7 results in the production of trans-acting small interference RNAs, which target mRNAs encoding AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR2 (ARF2), ARF3, and ARF4. Here, we show that activation of the miR390/<i>TAS3</i> regulatory module by overexpression of miR390 in <i>Medicago truncatula</i> promotes lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> growth but prevents nodule organogenesis, rhizobial infection, and the induction of two key nodulation genes, <i>Nodulation Signaling Pathway1</i> (<i>NSP1</i>) and <i>NSP2</i>. Accordingly, inactivation of the miR390/<i>TAS3</i> module, either by expression of a miR390 target mimicry construct or mutations in <i>ARGONAUTE7</i>, enhances nodulation and rhizobial infection, alters the spatial distribution of the nodules, and increases the percentage of nodules with multiple meristems. Our results revealed a key role of the miR390/<i>TAS3</i> pathway in legumes as a modulator of lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> organs, playing opposite roles in lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> and nodule development.</p>

The HvNramp5 Transporter Mediates Uptake of Cadmium and Manganese, But Not Iron
<p>The Natural Resistance Associated Macrophage Protein (Nramp) represents a transporter family for metal ions in all organisms. Here, we functionally characterized a member of Nramp family in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), HvNramp5. This member showed different expression patterns, transport substrate specificity, and cellular localization from its close homolog in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), OsNramp5, although HvNramp5 was also localized to the plasma membrane. <i>HvNramp5</i> was mainly expressed in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s and its expression was not affected by Cd and deficiency of Zn, Cu, and Mn, but slightly up-regulated by Fe deficiency. Spatial expression analysis showed that the expression of <i>HvNramp5</i> was higher in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> tips than that in the basal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> regions. Furthermore, analysis with laser microdissection revealed higher expression of <i>HvNramp5</i> in the outer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> cell layers. HvNramp5 showed transport activity for both Mn<sup>2+</sup> and Cd<sup>2+</sup>, but not for Fe<sup>2+</sup> when expressed in yeast. Immunostaining with a HvNramp5 antibody showed that this protein was localized in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> epidermal cells without polarity. Knockdown of <i>HvNramp5</i> in barley resulted in a significant reduction in the seedling growth at low Mn supply, but this reduction was rescued at high Mn supply. The concentration of Mn and Cd, but not other metals including Cu, Zn, and Fe, was decreased in both the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s and shoots of knockdown lines compared with the wild-type barley. These results indicate that HvNramp5 is a transporter required for uptake of Mn and Cd, but not for Fe, and that barley has a distinct uptake system from rice.</p>

A Legume TOR Protein Kinase Regulates <i>Rhizobium</i> Symbiosis and Is Essential for Infection and Nodule Development
<p>The target of rapamycin (<i>TOR</i>) protein kinase regulates metabolism, growth, and life span in yeast, animals, and plants in coordination with nutrient status and environmental conditions. The nutrient-dependent nature of <i>TOR</i> functionality makes this kinase a putative regulator of symbiotic associations involving nutrient acquisition. However, <i>TOR</i>’s role in these processes remains to be understood. Here, we uncovered the role of <i>TOR</i> during the bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>)-<i>Rhizobium tropici</i> (<i>Rhizobium</i>) symbiotic interaction. <i>TOR</i> was expressed in all tested bean tissues, with higher transcript levels in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> meristems and senesced nodules. We showed <i>TOR</i> promoter expression along the progressing infection thread and in the infected cells of mature nodules. Posttranscriptional gene silencing of <i>TOR</i> using RNA interference (RNAi) showed that this gene is involved in lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> elongation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> cell organization and also alters the density, size, and number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> hairs. The suppression of <i>TOR</i> transcripts also affected infection thread progression and associated cortical cell divisions, resulting in a drastic reduction of nodule numbers. <i>TOR</i>-RNAi resulted in reduced reactive oxygen species accumulation and altered <i>CyclinD1</i> and <i>CyclinD3</i> expression, which are crucial factors for infection thread progression and nodule organogenesis. Enhanced expression of <i>TOR</i>-regulated <i>ATG</i> genes in <i>TOR</i>-RNAi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong>s suggested that <i>TOR</i> plays a role in the recognition of <i>Rhizobium</i> as a symbiont. Together, these data suggest that <i>TOR</i> plays a vital role in the establishment of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> nodule symbiosis in the common bean.</p>

A ratio of aortic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> area over height was calculated (cm<sup>2</sup>/m) on tomography, and a cutoff of 10 cm<sup>2</sup>/m was chosen as abnormal, on the basis of previous reports.

Inherited aortopathies, moderate to severe aortic regurgitation, and severe aortic stenosis were seen in 7%, 18%, and 2%, whereas 91% and 54% were on β-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, respectively. Aortic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> area/height ratio was ≥10 cm<sup>2</sup>/m in 24%. The Society of Thoracic Surgeons score and right ventricular systolic pressure were 3.3±3 and 31±7 mm Hg, respectively. At 7.8 years (interquartile range, 6.6–8.9), 280 (36%) patients underwent aortic surgery (76% within 1 year) and 130 (17%) died (1% in-hospital postoperative mortality).

Identification of Genes Encoding Enzymes Catalyzing the Early Steps of Carrot Polyacetylene Biosynthesis
<p>Polyacetylenic lipids accumulate in various Apiaceae species after pathogen attack, suggesting that these compounds are naturally occurring pesticides and potentially valuable resources for crop improvement. These compounds also promote human health and slow tumor growth. Even though polyacetylenic lipids were discovered decades ago, the biosynthetic pathway underlying their production is largely unknown. To begin filling this gap and ultimately enable polyacetylene engineering, we studied polyacetylenes and their biosynthesis in the major Apiaceae crop carrot (<i>Daucus carota</i> subsp. <i>sativus</i>). Using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, we identified three known polyacetylenes and assigned provisional structures to two novel polyacetylenes. We also quantified these compounds in carrot leaf, petiole, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> xylem, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> phloem, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> periderm extracts. Falcarindiol and falcarinol predominated and accumulated primarily in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> periderm. Since the multiple double and triple carbon-carbon bonds that distinguish polyacetylenes from ubiquitous fatty acids are often introduced by Δ12 oleic acid desaturase (FAD2)-type enzymes, we mined the carrot genome for <i>FAD2</i> genes. We identified a <i>FAD2</i> family with an unprecedented 24 members and analyzed public, tissue-specific carrot RNA-Seq data to identify coexpressed members with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">root</span></strong> periderm-enhanced expression. Six candidate genes were heterologously expressed individually and in combination in yeast and Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), resulting in the identification of one canonical FAD2 that converts oleic to linoleic acid, three divergent FAD2-like acetylenases that convert linoleic into crepenynic acid, and two bifunctional FAD2s with Δ12 and Δ14 desaturase activity that convert crepenynic into the further desaturated dehydrocrepenynic acid, a polyacetylene pathway intermediate. These genes can now be used as a basis for discovering other steps of falcarin-type polyacetylene biosynthesis, to modulate polyacetylene levels in plants, and to test the in planta function of these molecules.</p>

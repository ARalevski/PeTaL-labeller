Transformation of bulk alloys to oxide nanowires
<p>One dimensional (1D) nanostructures offer prospects for enhancing the electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties of a broad range of functional materials and composites, but their synthesis methods are typically elaborate and expensive. We demonstrate a direct transformation of bulk materials into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanowir</span></strong>es under ambient conditions without the use of catalysts or any external stimuli. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanowir</span></strong>es form via minimization of strain energy at the boundary of a chemical reaction front. We show the transformation of multimicrometer-sized particles of aluminum or magnesium alloys into alkoxide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanowir</span></strong>es of tunable dimensions, which are converted into oxide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanowir</span></strong>es upon heating in air. Fabricated separators based on aluminum oxide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanowir</span></strong>es enhanced the safety and rate capabilities of lithium-ion batteries. The reported approach allows ultralow-cost scalable synthesis of 1D materials and membranes.</p>

Ultrafine jagged platinum nanowires enable ultrahigh mass activity for the oxygen reduction reaction
<p>Improving the platinum (Pt) mass activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) requires optimization of both the specific activity and the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA). We found that solution-synthesized Pt/NiO core/shell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanowir</span></strong>es can be converted into PtNi alloy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanowir</span></strong>es through a thermal annealing process and then transformed into jagged Pt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanowir</span></strong>es via electrochemical dealloying. The jagged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanowir</span></strong>es exhibit an ECSA of 118 square meters per gram of Pt and a specific activity of 11.5 milliamperes per square centimeter for ORR (at 0.9 volts versus reversible hydrogen electrode), yielding a mass activity of 13.6 amperes per milligram of Pt, nearly double previously reported best values. Reactive molecular dynamics simulations suggest that highly stressed, undercoordinated rhombus-rich surface configurations of the jagged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanowir</span></strong>es enhance ORR activity versus more relaxed surfaces.</p>

Majorana bound state in a coupled quantum-dot hybrid-nanowire system
<p>Hybrid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanowir</span></strong>es combining semiconductor and superconductor materials appear well suited for the creation, detection, and control of Majorana bound states (MBSs). We demonstrate the emergence of MBSs from coalescing Andreev bound states (ABSs) in a hybrid InAs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanowir</span></strong>e with epitaxial Al, using a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">quantum dot</span></strong> at the end of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanowir</span></strong>e as a spectrometer. Electrostatic gating tuned the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanowir</span></strong>e density to a regime of one or a few ABSs. In an applied axial magnetic field, a topological phase emerges in which ABSs move to zero energy and remain there, forming MBSs. We observed hybridization of the MBS with the end-dot bound state, which is in agreement with a numerical model. The ABS/MBS spectra provide parameters that are useful for understanding topological superconductivity in this system.</p>

In Situ TEM Observation of a Microcrucible Mechanism of Nanowire Growth
<sec><title><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanowir</span></strong>e Growth Observed</title><p>In the hypothetical microcrucible growth mechanism for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanowir</span></strong>es, a molten catalytic particle located in a pore on a substrate continually feeds the outward growth of the wire. To observe such a mechanism requires the ability to examine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanowir</span></strong>e growth in situ. <bold>Boston <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 623) studied various stages of Y<sub>2</sub>BaCuO<sub>5</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanowir</span></strong>e growth using transmission electron microscopy and were able to observe a microcrucible growth mechanism directly.</p></sec>

Purcell effect for active tuning of light scattering from semiconductor optical antennas
<p>Subwavelength, high–refractive index semiconductor nanostructures support optical resonances that endow them with valuable antenna functions. Control over the intrinsic properties, including their complex refractive index, size, and geometry, has been used to manipulate fundamental light absorption, scattering, and emission processes in nanostructured optoelectronic devices. In this study, we harness the electric and magnetic resonances of such antennas to achieve a very strong dependence of the optical properties on the external environment. Specifically, we illustrate how the resonant scattering wavelength of single silicon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanowir</span></strong>es is tunable across the entire visible spectrum by simply moving the height of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanowir</span></strong>es above a metallic mirror. We apply this concept by using a nanoelectromechanical platform to demonstrate active tuning.</p>

Epitaxial lift-off of electrodeposited single-crystal gold foils for flexible electronics
<p>We introduce a simple and inexpensive procedure for epitaxial lift-off of wafer-size flexible and transparent foils of single-crystal gold using silicon as a template. Lateral electrochemical undergrowth of a sacrificial SiO<i><sub>x</sub></i> layer was achieved by photoelectrochemically oxidizing silicon under light irradiation. A 28-nanometer-thick gold foil with a sheet resistance of 7 ohms per square showed only a 4% increase in resistance after 4000 bending cycles. A flexible organic light-emitting diode based on tris(bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) that was spin-coated on a foil exploited the transmittance and flexibility of the gold foil. Cuprous oxide as an inorganic semiconductor that was epitaxially electrodeposited onto the gold foils exhibited a diode quality factor <i>n</i> of 1.6 (where <i>n</i> = 1.0 for an ideal diode), compared with a value of 3.1 for a polycrystalline deposit. Zinc oxide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanowir</span></strong>es electrodeposited epitaxially on a gold foil also showed flexibility, with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanowir</span></strong>es intact up to 500 bending cycles.</p>

Nanoscale chiral valley-photon interface through optical spin-orbit coupling
<p>The emergence of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide materials has sparked intense activity in valleytronics, as their valley information can be encoded and detected with the spin angular momentum of light. We demonstrate the valley-dependent directional coupling of light using a plasmonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanowir</span></strong>e–tungsten disulfide (WS<sub>2</sub>) layers system. We show that the valley pseudospin in WS<sub>2</sub> couples to transverse optical spin of the same handedness with a directional coupling efficiency of 90 ± 1%. Our results provide a platform for controlling, detecting, and processing valley and spin information with precise optical control at the nanoscale.</p>

Single-stranded DNA and RNA origami
<p>Self-folding of an information-carrying polymer into a defined structure is foundational to biology and offers attractive potential as a synthetic strategy. Although multicomponent self-assembly has produced complex synthetic nanostructures, unimolecular folding has seen limited progress. We describe a framework to design and synthesize a single DNA or RNA strand to self-fold into a complex yet unknotted structure that approximates an arbitrary user-prescribed shape. We experimentally construct diverse multikilobase single-stranded structures, including a ~10,000-nucleotide (nt) DNA structure and a ~6000-nt RNA structure. We demonstrate facile replication of the strand in vitro and in living cells. The work here thus establishes unimolecular folding as a general strategy for constructing complex and replicable nucleic acid nanostructures, and expands the design space and material scalability for bottom-up <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanotechnolog</span></strong>y.</p>

Self-assembled three-dimensional chiral colloidal architecture
<p>Although stereochemistry has been a central focus of the molecular sciences since Pasteur, its province has previously been restricted to the nanometric scale. We have programmed the self-assembly of micron-sized colloidal clusters with structural information stemming from a nanometric arrangement. This was done by combining DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanotechnolog</span></strong>y with colloidal science. Using the functional flexibility of DNA origami in conjunction with the structural rigidity of colloidal particles, we demonstrate the parallel self-assembly of three-dimensional microconstructs, evincing highly specific geometry that includes control over position, dihedral angles, and cluster chirality.</p>

Atomic structure of sensitive battery materials and interfaces revealed by cryo–electron microscopy
<p>Whereas standard transmission electron microscopy studies are unable to preserve the native state of chemically reactive and beam-sensitive battery materials after operation, such materials remain pristine at cryogenic conditions. It is then possible to atomically resolve individual lithium metal atoms and their interface with the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). We observe that dendrites in carbonate-based electrolytes grow along the <111> (preferred), <110>, or <211> directions as faceted, single-crystalline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanowir</span></strong>es. These growth directions can change at kinks with no observable crystallographic defect. Furthermore, we reveal distinct SEI nanostructures formed in different electrolytes.</p>

Mechanochemical unzipping of insulating polyladderene to semiconducting polyacetylene
<p>Biological systems sense and respond to mechanical stimuli in a complex manner. In an effort to develop synthetic materials that transduce mechanical force into multifold changes in their intrinsic properties, we report on a mechanochemically responsive nonconjugated polymer that converts to a conjugated polymer via an extensive rearrangement of the macromolecular structure in response to force. Our design is based on the facile mechanochemical unzipping of polyladderene, a polymer inspired by a lipid natural product structure and prepared via direct metathesis polymerization. The resultant polyacetylene block copolymers exhibit long conjugation length and uniform trans-configuration and self-assemble into semiconducting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanowir</span></strong>es. Calculations support a tandem unzipping mechanism of the ladderene units.</p>

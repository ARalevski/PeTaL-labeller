Mexican blind cavefish use mouth suction to detect obstacles
<p>Fish commonly use their lateral line system to detect moving bodies such as prey and predators. A remarkable case is the Mexican blind cavefish <i>Astyanax fasciatus</i>, which evolved the ability to detect non-moving obstacles. The swimming body of <i>A. fasciatus</i> generates fluid disturbances, the alteration of which by an obstacle can be sensed by the fish's lateral line system. It is generally accepted that these alterations can provide information on the distance to the obstacle. We observed that <i>A. fasciatus</i> swimming in an unfamiliar environment open and close their mouths at high frequency (0.7–4.5 Hz) in order to generate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suction</span></strong> flows. We hypothesized that repeated mouth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suction</span></strong> generates a hydrodynamic velocity field, which is altered by an obstacle, inducing pressure gradients in the neuromasts of the lateral line and corresponding strong lateral line stimuli. We observed that the frequency and rate of mouth-opening events varied with the fish's distance to obstacles, a hallmark of pulse-based navigation mechanisms such as echolocation. We formulated a mathematical model of this hitherto unrecognized mechanism of obstacle detection and parameterized it experimentally. This model suggests that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suction</span></strong> flows induce lateral line stimuli that are weakly dependent on the fish's speed, and may be an order of magnitude stronger than the correspondent stimuli induced by the fish's gliding body. We illustrate that <i>A. fasciatus</i> can navigate non-visually using a combination of two deeply ancestral and highly conserved mechanisms of ray-finned fishes: the mechanism of sensing water motion by the lateral line system and the mechanism of generating water motion by mouth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suction</span></strong>.</p>

Conserved spatio-temporal patterns of suction-feeding flows across aquatic vertebrates: a comparative flow visualization study
<p><bold>Highlighted Article:</bold> Flow visualization reveals that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suction</span></strong> flow speeds increase with mouth diameter, whereas other flow characteristics remain conserved across aquatic vertebrates. Therefore, trophic diversity is not supported by variation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suction</span></strong> flows.</p>

Comparative feeding strategies and kinematics in phocid seals: suction without specialized skull morphology
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Behavioral and kinematic differences exist between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suction</span></strong> feeding and biting in seals. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suction</span></strong> feeding is common in seals and can occur without specialized skull morphology.</p>

Hawaiian monk seals exhibit behavioral flexibility when targeting prey of different size and shape
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Hawaiian monk seals use biting and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suction</span></strong> feeding, and these strategies are behaviorally and kinematically distinct. Prey size and shape affect how frequently each feeding strategy is used.</p>

Drought-Enhanced Xylem Sap Sulfate Closes Stomata by Affecting ALMT12 and Guard Cell ABA Synthesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Water limitation of plants causes stomatal closure to prevent water loss by transpiration. For this purpose, progressing soil water deficit is communicated from roots to shoots. Abscisic acid (ABA) is the key signal in stress-induced stomatal closure, but ABA as an early xylem-delivered signal is still a matter of debate. In this study, poplar plants (<i>Populus × canescens</i>) were exposed to water stress to investigate xylem sap sulfate and ABA, stomatal conductance, and sulfate transporter (<i>SULTR</i>) expression. In addition, stomatal behavior and expression of ABA receptors, drought-responsive genes, transcription factors, and <i>NCED3</i> were studied after feeding sulfate and ABA to detached poplar leaves and epidermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peel</span></strong>s of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The results show that increased xylem sap sulfate is achieved upon drought by reduced xylem unloading by PtaSULTR3;3a and PtaSULTR1;1, and by enhanced loading from parenchyma cells into the xylem via PtaALMT3b. Sulfate application caused stomatal closure in excised leaves and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peel</span></strong>ed epidermis. In the loss of sulfate-channel function mutant, At<i>almt12</i>, sulfate-triggered stomatal closure was impaired. The QUAC1/ALMT12 anion channel heterologous expressed in oocytes was gated open by extracellular sulfate. Sulfate up-regulated the expression of <i>NCED3</i>, a key step of ABA synthesis, in guard cells. In conclusion, xylem-derived sulfate seems to be a chemical signal of drought that induces stomatal closure via QUAC1/ALMT12 and/or guard cell ABA synthesis.</p>

Proximalisation of the tibial tubercle gives a good outcome in patients undergoing revision total knee arthroplasty who have pseudo patella baja
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to compare the outcome of revision   total knee arthroplasty (TKA) with and without proximalisation of   the tibial tubercle in patients with a failed primary TKA who have   pseudo patella baja.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>All revision TKAs, performed between January 2008 and November   2013 at a tertiary referral University Orthopaedic Department were   retrospectively reviewed. Pseudo patella baja was defined using   the modified Insall-Salvati and the Blackburne-Peel ratios. A proximalisation   of the tibial tubercle was performed in 13 patients with pseudo   patella baja who were matched with a control group of 13 patients   for gender, age, height, weight, body mass index, length of surgery   and Blackburne-Peel ratio. Outcome was assessed two years post-operatively   using the Knee Society Score (KSS).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The increase in KSS was significantly higher in the osteotomy   group compared with the control group. The outcome was statistically   better in patients in whom proximalisation of > 1 cm had been achieved   compared with those in whom the proximalisation was < 1 cm.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this retrospective case-control study, a proximal transfer   of the tibial tubercle at revision TKA in patients with pseudo patella   baja gives good outcomes without major complications.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:912–16.</p></sec>

Natural Variation Underlies Differences in ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR17 Activity in Fruit Peel Degreening
<p>Through natural or human selection, many fleshy fruits have evolved vivid external or internal coloration, which often develops during ripening. Such developmental changes in color are associated with the biosynthesis of pigments as well as with degreening through chlorophyll degradation. Here, we demonstrated that natural variation in the coding region of the gene <i>ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR17</i> (<i>ERF17</i>) contributes to apple (<i>Malus domestica</i>) fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peel</span></strong> degreening. Specifically, <i>ERF17</i> mutant alleles with different serine (Ser) repeat insertions in the coding region exhibited enhanced transcriptional regulation activity in a dual-luciferase reporter assay when more Ser repeats were present. Notably, surface plasmon resonance analysis showed that the number of Ser repeats affected the binding activity of ERF17 to the promoter sequences of chlorophyll degradation-related genes. In addition, overexpression of <i>ERF17</i> in evergreen apples altered the accumulation of chlorophyll. Furthermore, we demonstrated that <i>ERF17</i> has been under selection since the origin of apple tree cultivation. Taken together, these results reveal allelic variation underlying an important fruit quality trait and a molecular genetic mechanism associated with apple domestication.</p>

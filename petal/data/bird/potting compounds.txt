Identification and Metabolite Profiling of Chemical Activators of Lipid Accumulation in Green Algae
<p>Microalgae are proposed as feedstock organisms useful for producing biofuels and coproducts. However, several limitations must be overcome before algae-based production is economically feasible. Among these is the ability to induce lipid accumulation and storage without affecting biomass yield. To overcome this barrier, a chemical genetics approach was employed in which 43,783 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s were screened against <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, and 243 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s were identified that increase triacylglyceride (TAG) accumulation without terminating growth. Identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s were classified by structural similarity, and 15 were selected for secondary analyses addressing impacts on growth fitness, photosynthetic pigments, and total cellular protein and starch concentrations. TAG accumulation was verified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry quantification of total fatty acids, and targeted TAG and galactolipid measurements were performed using liquid chromatography-multiple reaction monitoring/mass spectrometry. These results demonstrated that TAG accumulation does not necessarily proceed at the expense of galactolipid. Untargeted metabolite profiling provided important insights into pathway shifts due to five different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong> treatments and verified the anabolic state of the cells with regard to the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, Calvin cycle, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and amino acid biosynthetic pathways. Metabolite patterns were distinct from nitrogen starvation and other abiotic stresses commonly used to induce oil accumulation in algae. The efficacy of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s also was demonstrated in three other algal species. These lipid-inducing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s offer a valuable set of tools for delving into the biochemical mechanisms of lipid accumulation in algae and a direct means to improve algal oil content independent of the severe growth limitations associated with nutrient deprivation.</p>

Topological insulator laser: Theory
<p>Topological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insul</span></strong>ators are phases of matter characterized by topological edge states that propagate in a unidirectional manner that is robust to imperfections and disorder. These attributes make topological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insul</span></strong>ator systems ideal candidates for enabling applications in quantum computation and spintronics. We propose a concept that exploits topological effects in a unique way: the topological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insul</span></strong>ator laser. These are lasers whose lasing mode exhibits topologically protected transport without magnetic fields. The underlying topological properties lead to a highly efficient laser, robust to defects and disorder, with single-mode lasing even at very high gain values. The topological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insul</span></strong>ator laser alters current understanding of the interplay between disorder and lasing, and at the same time opens exciting possibilities in topological physics, such as topologically protected transport in systems with gain. On the technological side, the topological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insul</span></strong>ator laser provides a route to arrays of semiconductor lasers that operate as one single-mode high-power laser coupled efficiently into an output port.</p>

Bumblebees are not deterred by ecologically relevant concentrations of nectar toxins
<p>Bees visit flowers to collect nectar and pollen that contain nutrients and simultaneously facilitate plant sexual reproduction. Paradoxically, nectar produced to attract pollinators often contains deterrent or toxic plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s associated with herbivore defence. The functional significance of these nectar toxins is not fully understood, but they may have a negative impact on pollinator behaviour and health, and, ultimately, plant pollination. This study investigates whether a generalist bumblebee, <i>Bombus terrestris</i>, can detect naturally occurring concentrations of nectar toxins. Using paired-choice experiments, we identified deterrence thresholds for five <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s found in the nectar of bee-pollinated plants: quinine, caffeine, nicotine, amygdalin and grayanotoxin. The deterrence threshold was determined when bumblebees significantly preferred a sucrose solution over a sucrose solution containing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>. Bumblebees had the lowest deterrence threshold for the alkaloid quinine (0.01 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>); all other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s had higher deterrence thresholds, above the natural concentration range in floral nectar. Our data, combined with previous work using honeybees, suggest that generalist bee species have poor acuity for the detection of nectar toxins. The fact that bees do not avoid nectar-relevant concentrations of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s likely indicates that it is difficult for them to learn to associate floral traits with the presence of toxins, thus maintaining this trait in plant populations.</p>

Covalent inhibitors of EGFR family protein kinases induce degradation of human Tribbles 2 (TRIB2) pseudokinase in cancer cells
<p>A major challenge associated with biochemical and cellular analysis of pseudokinases is a lack of target-validated small-molecule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s with which to probe function. Tribbles 2 (TRIB2) is a cancer-associated pseudokinase with a diverse interactome, including the canonical AKT signaling module. There is substantial evidence that human TRIB2 promotes survival and drug resistance in solid tumors and blood cancers and therefore is of interest as a therapeutic target. The unusual TRIB2 pseudokinase domain contains a unique cysteine-rich C-helix and interacts with a conserved peptide motif in its own carboxyl-terminal tail, which also supports its interaction with E3 ubiquitin ligases. We found that TRIB2 is a target of previously described small-molecule protein kinase inhibitors, which were originally designed to inhibit the canonical kinase domains of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase family members. Using a thermal shift assay, we discovered TRIB2-binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s within the Published Kinase Inhibitor Set (PKIS) and used a drug repurposing approach to classify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s that either stabilized or destabilized TRIB2 in vitro. TRIB2 destabilizing agents, including the covalent drug afatinib, led to rapid TRIB2 degradation in human AML cancer cells, eliciting tractable effects on signaling and survival. Our data reveal new drug leads for the development of TRIB2-degrading <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s, which will also be invaluable for unraveling the cellular mechanisms of TRIB2-based signaling. Our study highlights that small molecule–induced protein down-regulation through drug “off-targets” might be relevant for other inhibitors that serendipitously target pseudokinases.</p>

Isostructural metal-insulator transition in VO<sub>2</sub>
<p>The metal-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insul</span></strong>ator transition in correlated materials is usually coupled to a symmetry-lowering structural phase transition. This coupling not only complicates the understanding of the basic mechanism of this phenomenon but also limits the speed and endurance of prospective electronic devices. We demonstrate an isostructural, purely electronically driven metal-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insul</span></strong>ator transition in epitaxial heterostructures of an archetypal correlated material, vanadium dioxide. A combination of thin-film synthesis, structural and electrical characterizations, and theoretical modeling reveals that an interface interaction suppresses the electronic correlations without changing the crystal structure in this otherwise correlated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insul</span></strong>ator. This interaction stabilizes a nonequilibrium metallic phase and leads to an isostructural metal-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insul</span></strong>ator transition. This discovery will provide insights into phase transitions of correlated materials and may aid the design of device functionalities.</p>

Electrically tunable low-density superconductivity in a monolayer topological insulator
<p>Turning on superconductivity in a topologically nontrivial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insul</span></strong>ator may provide a route to search for non-Abelian topological states. However, existing demonstrations of superconductor-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insul</span></strong>ator switches have involved only topologically trivial systems.

Fabricated into a van der Waals field-effect transistor, the monolayer’s ground state can be continuously gate-tuned from the topological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insul</span></strong>ating to the superconducting state, with critical temperatures <i>T</i><sub>c</sub> up to ~1 kelvin.

Wallpaper fermions and the nonsymmorphic Dirac insulator
<p>Materials whose gapless surface states are protected by crystal symmetries include mirror topological crystalline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insul</span></strong>ators and nonsymmorphic hourglass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insul</span></strong>ators. There exists only a very limited set of possible surface crystal symmetries, captured by the 17 “wallpaper groups.” Here we show that a consideration of symmetry-allowed band degeneracies in the wallpaper groups can be used to understand previously described topological crystalline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insul</span></strong>ators and to predict phenomenologically distinct examples. In particular, the two wallpaper groups with multiple glide lines, <i>pgg</i> and <i>p</i>4<i>g</i>, allow for a topological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insul</span></strong>ating phase whose surface spectrum consists of only a single, fourfold-degenerate, true Dirac fermion, representing an exception to a symmetry-enhanced fermion-doubling theorem.

Current-induced strong diamagnetism in the Mott insulator Ca<sub>2</sub>RuO<sub>4</sub>
<p>Mott <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insul</span></strong>ators can host a surprisingly diverse set of quantum phenomena when their frozen electrons are perturbed by various stimuli. Superconductivity, metal-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insul</span></strong>ator transition, and colossal magnetoresistance induced by element substitution, pressure, and magnetic field are prominent examples. Here we report strong diamagnetism in the Mott <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insul</span></strong>ator calcium ruthenate (Ca<sub>2</sub>RuO<sub>4</sub>) induced by dc electric current. The application of a current density of merely 1 ampere per centimeter squared induces diamagnetism stronger than that in other nonsuperconducting materials. This change is coincident with changes in the transport properties as the system becomes semimetallic. These findings suggest that dc current may be a means to control the properties of materials in the vicinity of a Mott <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insul</span></strong>ating transition.</p>

MOF-derived cobalt nanoparticles catalyze a general synthesis of amines

Functional Diversification of Kaurene Synthase-Like Genes in <i>Isodon rubescens</i><xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p><i>Ent</i>-kaurene diterpenoids are the largest group of known <i>Isodon</i> diterpenoids. Among them, oridonin is accumulated in the leaves, and is the most frequently studied <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong> because of its antitumor and antibacterial activities. We have identified five copalyl diphosphate synthase (CPS) and six kaurene synthase-like (KSL) genes by transcriptome profiling of <i>Isodon rubescens</i> leaves. An in vitro assay assigns ten of them to five different diterpene biosynthesis pathways, except IrCPS3 that has a mutation in the catalytic motif. The Lamiaceae-specific clade genes (IrCPS1 and IrCPS2) synthesize the intermediate copalyl diphosphate (normal-CPP), while IrCPS4 and IrCPS5 synthesize the intermediate <i>ent</i>-copalyl diphosphate (<i>ent</i>-CPP). IrKSL2, IrKSL4, and IrKSL5 react with <i>ent</i>-CPP to produce an <i>ent</i>-isopimaradiene-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>, <i>ent</i>-atiserene and <i>ent</i>-kaurene, respectively. Correspondingly, the Lamiaceae-specific clade genes IrKSL1 or IrKSL3 combined with normal-CPP led to the formation of miltiradiene. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong> then underwent aromatization and oxidization with a cytochrome P450 forming two related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s, abietatriene and ferruginol, which were detected in the root bark. IrKSL6 reacts with normal-CPP to produce isopimaradiene. IrKSL3 and IrKSL6 have the γβα tridomain structure, as these proteins tend to possess the bidomain structure of IrKSL1, highlighting the evolutionary history of KSL gene domain loss and further elucidating chemical diversity evolution from a macroevolutionary stance in Lamiaceae.</p>

Multiplex quantitative assays indicate a need for reevaluating reported small-molecule TrkB agonists
<p>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor, tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB), have emerged as key regulators of brain plasticity and represent disease-modifying targets for several brain disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease and major depressive disorder. Because of poor pharmacokinetic properties of BDNF, the interest in small-molecule TrkB agonists and modulators is high.

Although BDNF and other neurotrophic factors elicited robust and dose-dependent receptor activation and downstream signaling, we were unable to reproduce these activities using the reported small-molecule TrkB agonists. Our findings indicate that experimental results obtained with these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s must be carefully interpreted and highlight the challenge of developing reliable pharmacological activators of this key molecular target.</p>

Quantum oscillations of electrical resistivity in an insulator

Methane production from coal by a single methanogen

Mechanism-Based Covalent Neuraminidase Inhibitors with Broad-Spectrum Influenza Antiviral Activity

CYP79D73 Participates in Biosynthesis of Floral Scent Compound 2-Phenylethanol in <i>Plumeria rubra</i>
<p>Plumeria (<i>Plumeria rubra</i>), well known for its brightly colored and fragrant flowers, emits a number of floral volatile organic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s (VOCs). Plumeria flowers emit a total of 43 VOCs including nine phenylpropanoids/benzenoids, such as 2-phenylethanol (2PE), benzaldehyde, 2-phenylacetaldehyde (PAld), (<i>E/Z</i>)<i>-</i>phenylacetaldoxime (PAOx), benzyl nitrile (BN), and 2-phenylnitroethane (PN). To identify genes and pathways involved in the production of the major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong> 2PE, we analyzed the plumeria floral transcriptome and found a highly expressed, flower-specific gene encoding a cytochrome P450 family 79D protein (PrCYP79D73), which catalyzed the formation of (<i>E/Z</i>)-PAOx. Feeding experiments with deuterated phenylalanine or deuterated (<i>E/Z</i>)-PAOx showed that (<i>E/Z</i>)-PAOx is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of 2PE, as are two nitrogen-containing volatiles, BN and PN, in plumeria flowers. Crude enzyme extracts from plumeria flowers converted <sc>l</sc>-phenylalanine to (<i>E/Z</i>)-PAOx, PAld, 2PE, BN, and PN. The biosynthesis of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s increased with addition of PrCYP79D73-enriched microsomes but was blocked by pretreatment with 4-phenylimidazole, an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 enzymes. Moreover, overexpression of <i>PrCYP79D73</i> in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> resulted in the emission of (<i>E/Z</i>)-PAOx as well as PAld, 2PE, BN, and PN, all of which were also found among plumeria floral VOCs. Taken together, our results demonstrate that PrCYP79D73 is a crucial player in the biosynthesis of the major floral VOC 2PE and other nitrogen-containing volatiles. These volatiles may be required for plant defense as well as to attract pollinators for the successful reproduction of plumeria.</p>

Identification of Genes Encoding Enzymes Catalyzing the Early Steps of Carrot Polyacetylene Biosynthesis
<p>Polyacetylenic lipids accumulate in various Apiaceae species after pathogen attack, suggesting that these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s are naturally occurring pesticides and potentially valuable resources for crop improvement. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s also promote human health and slow tumor growth. Even though polyacetylenic lipids were discovered decades ago, the biosynthetic pathway underlying their production is largely unknown. To begin filling this gap and ultimately enable polyacetylene engineering, we studied polyacetylenes and their biosynthesis in the major Apiaceae crop carrot (<i>Daucus carota</i> subsp. <i>sativus</i>). Using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, we identified three known polyacetylenes and assigned provisional structures to two novel polyacetylenes. We also quantified these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s in carrot leaf, petiole, root xylem, root phloem, and root periderm extracts. Falcarindiol and falcarinol predominated and accumulated primarily in the root periderm. Since the multiple double and triple carbon-carbon bonds that distinguish polyacetylenes from ubiquitous fatty acids are often introduced by Δ12 oleic acid desaturase (FAD2)-type enzymes, we mined the carrot genome for <i>FAD2</i> genes. We identified a <i>FAD2</i> family with an unprecedented 24 members and analyzed public, tissue-specific carrot RNA-Seq data to identify coexpressed members with root periderm-enhanced expression. Six candidate genes were heterologously expressed individually and in combination in yeast and Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), resulting in the identification of one canonical FAD2 that converts oleic to linoleic acid, three divergent FAD2-like acetylenases that convert linoleic into crepenynic acid, and two bifunctional FAD2s with Δ12 and Δ14 desaturase activity that convert crepenynic into the further desaturated dehydrocrepenynic acid, a polyacetylene pathway intermediate. These genes can now be used as a basis for discovering other steps of falcarin-type polyacetylene biosynthesis, to modulate polyacetylene levels in plants, and to test the in planta function of these molecules.</p>

Screening for Biologically Annotated Drugs That Trigger Triacylglycerol Accumulation in the Diatom <i>Phaeodactylum</i>
<p>Microalgae are a promising feedstock for the production of triacylglycerol (TAG) for a variety of potential applications, ranging from food and human health to biofuels and green chemistry. However, obtaining high TAG yields is challenging. A phenotypic assay for the accumulation of oil droplets was developed to screen a library of 1,200 drugs, annotated with pharmacology information, to select <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s that trigger TAG accumulation in the diatom <i>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</i>. Using this screen, we identified 34 molecules acting in a dose-dependent manner. Previously characterized targets of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s include cell division and cell signaling effectors, membrane receptors and transporters, and sterol metabolism. Among the five <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s possibly acting on sterol metabolism, we focused our study on ethynylestradiol, a synthetic form of estrogen that is used in contraceptive pills and known for its ecological impact as an endocrine disruptor. Ethynylestradiol impaired the production of very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, destabilized the galactolipid versus phospholipid balance, and triggered the recycling of fatty acids from membrane lipids to TAG. The <i>P. tricornutum</i> transcriptomic response to treatment with ethynylestradiol was consistent with the reallocation of carbon from sterols to acetyl-coenzyme A and TAG. The mode of action and catabolism of ethynylestradiol are unknown but might involve several up-regulated cytochrome P450 proteins. A fatty acid elongase, Δ6-ELO-B1, might be involved in the impairment of very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids and fatty acid turnover. This phenotypic screen opens new perspectives for the exploration of novel bioactive molecules, potential target genes, and pathways controlling TAG biosynthesis. It also unraveled the sensitivity of diatoms to endocrine disruptors, highlighting an impact of anthropogenic pollution on phytoplankton.</p>

Transcription Factor-Mediated Control of Anthocyanin Biosynthesis in Vegetative Tissues
<p>Plants accumulate secondary metabolites to adapt to environmental conditions. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s, here exemplified by the purple-colored anthocyanins, are accumulated upon high temperatures, UV-light, drought, and nutrient deficiencies, and may contribute to tolerance to these stresses. Producing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s is often part of a more broad response of the plant to changes in the environment. Here we investigate how a transcription-factor-mediated program for controlling anthocyanin biosynthesis also has effects on formation of specialized cell structures and changes in the plant root architecture. A systems biology approach was developed in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) for coordinated induction of biosynthesis of anthocyanins, in a tissue- and development-independent manner. A transcription factor couple from <i>Antirrhinum</i> that is known to control anthocyanin biosynthesis was introduced in tomato under control of a dexamethasone-inducible promoter. By application of dexamethasone, anthocyanin formation was induced within 24 h in vegetative tissues and in undifferentiated cells. Profiles of metabolites and gene expression were analyzed in several tomato tissues. Changes in concentration of anthocyanins and other phenolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s were observed in all tested tissues, accompanied by induction of the biosynthetic pathways leading from Glc to anthocyanins. A number of pathways that are not known to be involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis were observed to be regulated. Anthocyanin-producing plants displayed profound physiological and architectural changes, depending on the tissue, including root branching, root epithelial cell morphology, seed germination, and leaf conductance. The inducible anthocyanin-production system reveals a range of phenomena that accompanies anthocyanin biosynthesis in tomato, including adaptions of the plants architecture and physiology.</p>

Carnosic Acid and Carnosol, Two Major Antioxidants of Rosemary, Act through Different Mechanisms
<p>Carnosic acid, a phenolic diterpene specific to the Lamiaceae family, is highly abundant in rosemary (<i>Rosmarinus officinalis</i>). Despite numerous industrial and medicinal/pharmaceutical applications of its antioxidative features, this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong> in planta and its antioxidant mechanism have received little attention, except a few studies of rosemary plants under natural conditions. In vitro analyses, using high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet and luminescence imaging, revealed that carnosic acid and its major oxidized derivative, carnosol, protect lipids from oxidation. Both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s preserved linolenic acid and monogalactosyldiacylglycerol from singlet oxygen and from hydroxyl radical. When applied exogenously, they were both able to protect thylakoid membranes prepared from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves against lipid peroxidation. Different levels of carnosic acid and carnosol in two contrasting rosemary varieties correlated with tolerance to lipid peroxidation. Upon reactive oxygen species (ROS) oxidation of lipids, carnosic acid was consumed and oxidized into various derivatives, including into carnosol, while carnosol resisted, suggesting that carnosic acid is a chemical quencher of ROS. The antioxidative function of carnosol relies on another mechanism, occurring directly in the lipid oxidation process. Under oxidative conditions that did not involve ROS generation, carnosol inhibited lipid peroxidation, contrary to carnosic acid. Using spin probes and electron paramagnetic resonance detection, we confirmed that carnosic acid, rather than carnosol, is a ROS quencher. Various oxidized derivatives of carnosic acid were detected in rosemary leaves in low light, indicating chronic oxidation of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>, and accumulated in plants exposed to stress conditions, in parallel with a loss of carnosic acid, confirming that chemical quenching of ROS by carnosic acid takes place in planta.</p>

Spatial Mapping and Profiling of Metabolite Distributions during Germination
<p>Germination is a highly complex process by which seeds begin to develop and establish themselves as viable organisms. In this study, we utilize a combination of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, liquid chromatography-fluorescence, and mass spectrometry imaging approaches to profile and visualize the metabolic distributions of germinating seeds from two different inbreds of maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) seeds, B73 and Mo17. Gas chromatography and liquid chromatography analyses demonstrate that the two inbreds are highly differentiated in their metabolite profiles throughout the course of germination, especially with regard to amino acids, sugar alcohols, and small organic acids. Crude dissection of the seed followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of polar metabolites also revealed that many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s were highly sequestered among the various seed tissue types. To further localize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging was utilized to visualize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s in fine detail in their native environments over the course of germination. Most notably, the fatty acyl chain-dependent differential localization of phospholipids and triacylglycerols was observed within the embryo and radicle, showing correlation with the heterogeneous distribution of fatty acids. Other interesting observations include unusual localization of ceramides on the endosperm/scutellum boundary and subcellular localization of ferulate in the aleurone.</p>

Enhanced Therapeutic and Long-Term Dynamic Vascularization Effects of Human Pluripotent Stem Cell–Derived Endothelial Cells Encapsulated in a Nanomatrix Gel
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)–derived endothelial cells (ECs) have limited clinical utility because of undefined components in the differentiation system and poor cell survival in vivo. Here, we aimed to develop a fully defined and clinically compatible system to differentiate hPSCs into ECs. Furthermore, we aimed to enhance cell survival, vessel formation, and therapeutic potential by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">encapsul</span></strong>ating hPSC-ECs with a peptide amphiphile (PA) nanomatrix gel.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We induced differentiation of hPSCs into the mesodermal lineage by culturing on collagen-coated plates with a glycogen synthase kinase 3β inhibitor. Next, vascular endothelial growth factor, endothelial growth factor, and basic fibroblast growth factor were added for endothelial lineage differentiation, followed by sorting for CDH5 (VE-cadherin). We constructed an extracellular matrix–mimicking PA nanomatrix gel (PA-RGDS) by incorporating the cell adhesive ligand Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS) and a matrix metalloproteinase-2–degradable sequence. We then evaluated whether the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">encapsul</span></strong>ation of hPSC-CDH5<sup>+</sup> cells in PA-RGDS could enhance long-term cell survival and vascular regenerative effects in a hind-limb ischemia model with laser Doppler perfusion imaging, bioluminescence imaging, real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction, and histological analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The resultant hPSC-derived CDH5<sup>+</sup> cells (hPSC-ECs) showed highly enriched and genuine EC characteristics and proangiogenic activities. When injected into ischemic hind limbs, hPSC-ECs showed better perfusion recovery and higher vessel-forming capacity compared with media-, PA-RGDS–, or human umbilical vein EC–injected groups. However, the group receiving the PA-RGDS–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">encapsul</span></strong>ated hPSC-ECs showed better perfusion recovery, more robust and longer cell survival (> 10 months), and higher and prolonged angiogenic and vascular incorporation capabilities than the bare hPSC-EC–injected group. Surprisingly, the engrafted hPSC-ECs demonstrated previously unknown sustained and dynamic vessel-forming behavior: initial perivascular concentration, a guiding role for new vessel formation, and progressive incorporation into the vessels over 10 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We generated highly enriched hPSC-ECs via a clinically compatible system. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that a biocompatible PA-RGDS nanomatrix gel substantially improved long-term survival of hPSC-ECs in an ischemic environment and improved neovascularization effects of hPSC-ECs via prolonged and unique angiogenic and vessel-forming properties. This PA-RGDS–mediated transplantation of hPSC-ECs can serve as a novel platform for cell-based therapy and investigation of long-term behavior of hPSC-ECs.</p></sec>

Non-specificity of Pitstop 2 in clathrin-mediated endocytosis
<p>Small molecule inhibitors of clathrin-mediated endocytosis are highly desired for the dissection of membrane trafficking pathways in the lab and for potential use as anti-infectives in the clinic. One inhibition strategy is to prevent clathrin from contacting adaptor proteins so that clathrin-mediated endocytosis cannot occur. “Pitstop” <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s have been developed that block only one of the four functional interaction sites on the N-terminal domain of clathrin heavy chain. Despite this limitation, Pitstop 2 causes profound inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. In this study, we probed for non-specific activity of Pitstop 2 by examining its action in cells expressing clathrin heavy chain harbouring mutations in the N-terminal domain interaction sites. We conclude that the inhibition observed with this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong> is due to non-specificity, i.e. it causes inhibition away from its proposed mode of action. We recommend that these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s be used with caution in cells and that they should not be used to conclude anything of the function of clathrin's N-terminal domain.</p>

Torsional instability in the single-chain limit of a transition metal trichalcogenide
<p>The scientific bounty resulting from the successful isolation of few to single layers of two-dimensional materials suggests that related new physics resides in the few- to single-chain limit of one-dimensional materials. We report the synthesis of the quasi–one-dimensional transition metal trichalcogenide NbSe<sub>3</sub> (niobium triselenide) in the few-chain limit, including the realization of isolated single chains. The chains are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">encapsul</span></strong>ated in protective boron nitride or carbon nanotube sheaths to prevent oxidation and to facilitate characterization. Transmission electron microscopy reveals static and dynamic structural torsional waves not found in bulk NbSe<sub>3</sub> crystals. Electronic structure calculations indicate that charge transfer drives the torsional wave instability. Very little covalent bonding is found between the chains and the nanotube sheath, leading to relatively unhindered longitudinal and torsional dynamics for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">encapsul</span></strong>ated chains.</p>

Evidence for a quantum dipole liquid state in an organic quasi–two-dimensional material

Electrons localized on molecular dimer lattice sites form electric dipoles that do not order at low temperatures and fluctuate with frequency detected experimentally in our Raman spectroscopy experiments. The heat capacity and Raman scattering response are consistent with a scenario in which the composite spin and electric dipole degrees of freedom remain fluctuating down to the lowest measured temperatures.</p>

Modular radical cross-coupling with sulfones enables access to sp<sup>3</sup>-rich (fluoro)alkylated scaffolds
<p>Cross-coupling chemistry is widely applied to carbon-carbon bond formation in the synthesis of medicines, agrochemicals, and other functional materials.

CRMP2-binding compound, edonerpic maleate, accelerates motor function recovery from brain damage

We found that a small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>, edonerpic maleate, facilitated experience-driven synaptic glutamate AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic-acid) receptor delivery and resulted in the acceleration of motor function recovery after motor cortex cryoinjury in mice in a training-dependent manner through cortical reorganization. Edonerpic bound to collapsin-response-mediator-protein 2 (CRMP2) and failed to augment recovery in CRMP2-deficient mice. Edonerpic maleate enhanced motor function recovery from internal capsule hemorrhage in nonhuman primates.

Topological insulator laser: Experiments
<p>Physical systems exhibiting topological invariants are naturally endowed with robustness against perturbations, as manifested in topological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insul</span></strong>ators—materials exhibiting robust electron transport, immune from scattering by defects and disorder. Recent years have witnessed intense efforts toward exploiting these phenomena in photonics. Here we demonstrate a nonmagnetic topological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">insul</span></strong>ator laser system exhibiting topologically protected transport in the cavity. Its topological properties give rise to single-mode lasing, robustness against defects, and considerably higher slope efficiencies compared to the topologically trivial counterparts. We further exploit the properties of active topological platforms by assembling the system from <i>S</i>-chiral microresonators, enforcing predetermined unidirectional lasing without magnetic fields. This work paves the way toward active topological devices with exciting properties and functionalities.</p>

Tunable excitons in bilayer graphene

We observed two prominent excitonic resonances with narrow line widths that are tunable from the mid-infrared to the terahertz range. These excitons obey optical selection rules distinct from those in conventional semiconductors and feature an electron pseudospin winding number of 2. An external magnetic field induces a large splitting of the valley excitons, corresponding to a <i>g</i>-factor of about 20. These findings open up opportunities to explore exciton physics with pseudospin texture in electrically tunable graphene systems.</p>

Plasmepsins IX and X are essential and druggable mediators of malaria parasite egress and invasion

We found at least one of five tested <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s (acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid, thiacloprid, and thiamethoxam) in 75% of all samples, 45% of samples contained two or more of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s, and 10% contained four or five. Our results confirm the exposure of bees to neonicotinoids in their food throughout the world. The coexistence of neonicotinoids and other pesticides may increase harm to pollinators.

Robust spin-polarized midgap states at step edges of topological crystalline insulators

A minimal toy model and realistic tight-binding calculations identify them as spin-polarized flat bands connecting two Dirac points.

Biosynthesis of 2-Phenylethanol in Rose Petals Is Linked to the Expression of One Allele of <i>RhPAAS</i>
<p>Floral scent is one of the most important characters in horticultural plants. Roses (<i>Rosa</i> spp.) have been cultivated for their scent since antiquity. However, probably by selecting for cultivars with long vase life, breeders have lost the fragrant character in many modern roses, especially the ones bred for the cut flower market. The genetic inheritance of scent characters has remained elusive so far. In-depth knowledge of this quantitative trait is thus very much needed to breed more fragrant commercial cultivars. Furthermore, rose hybrids harbor a composite genomic structure, which complexifies quantitative trait studies. To understand rose scent inheritance, we characterized a segregating population from two diploid cultivars, <i>Rosa</i> × <i>hybrida</i> cv H190 and <i>Rosa wichurana</i>, which have contrasting scent profiles. Several quantitative trait loci for the major volatile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s in this progeny were identified. One among these loci contributing to the production of 2-phenylethanol, responsible for the characteristic odor of rose, was found to be colocalized with a candidate gene belonging to the 2-phenylethanol biosynthesis pathway: the <i>PHENYLACETALDEHYDE SYNTHASE</i> gene <i>RhPAAS</i>. An in-depth allele-specific expression analysis in the progeny demonstrated that only one allele was highly expressed and was responsible for the production of 2-phenylethanol. Unexpectedly, its expression was found to start early during flower development, before the production of the volatile 2-phenylethanol, leading to the accumulation of glycosylated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s in petals.</p>

ARSENATE INDUCED CHLOROSIS 1/ TRANSLOCON AT THE OUTER ENVOLOPE MEMBRANE OF CHLOROPLASTS 132 Protects Chloroplasts from Arsenic Toxicity
<p>Arsenic (As) is highly toxic to plants and detoxified primarily through complexation with phytochelatins (PCs) and other thiol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s. To understand the mechanisms of As toxicity and detoxification beyond PCs, we isolated an arsenate-sensitive mutant of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), <i>arsenate induced chlorosis1</i> (<i>aic1</i>), in the background of the PC synthase-defective mutant <i>cadmium-sensitive1-3</i> (<i>cad1-3</i>). Under arsenate stress, <i>aic1 cad1-3</i> showed larger decreases in chlorophyll content and the number and size of chloroplasts than <i>cad1-3</i> and a severely distorted chloroplast structure. The <i>aic1</i> single mutant also was more sensitive to arsenate than the wild type (Columbia-0). As concentrations in the roots, shoots, and chloroplasts were similar between <i>aic1 cad1-3</i> and <i>cad1-3</i>. Using genome resequencing and complementation, <i>TRANSLOCON AT THE OUTER ENVOLOPE MEMBRANE OF CHLOROPLAST132</i> (<i>TOC132</i>) was identified as the mutant gene, which encodes a translocon protein involved in the import of preproteins from the cytoplasm into the chloroplasts. Proteomic analysis showed that the proteome of <i>aic1 cad1-3</i> chloroplasts was more affected by arsenate stress than that of <i>cad1-3</i>. A number of proteins related to chloroplast ribosomes, photosynthesis, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong> synthesis, and thioredoxin systems were less abundant in <i>aic1 cad1-3</i> than in <i>cad1-3</i> under arsenate stress. Our results indicate that chloroplasts are a sensitive target of As toxicity and that AIC1/Toc132 plays an important role in protecting chloroplasts from As toxicity.</p>

Infrared Nanospectroscopy Reveals the Chemical Nature of Pit Membranes in Water-Conducting Cells of the Plant Xylem
<p>In the xylem of angiosperm plants, microscopic pits through the secondary cell walls connect the water-conducting vessels. Cellulosic meshes originated from primary walls, and middle lamella between adjacent vessels, called the pit membrane, separates one conduit from another. The intricate structure of the nano-sized pores in pit membranes enables the passage of water under negative pressure without hydraulic failure due to obstruction by gas bubbles (i.e. embolism) under normal conditions or mild drought stress. Since the chemical composition of pit membranes affects embolism formation and bubble behavior, we directly measured pit membrane composition in <i>Populus nigra</i> wood. Here, we characterized the chemical composition of cell wall structures by synchrotron infrared nanospectroscopy and atomic force microscopy-infrared nanospectroscopy with high spatial resolution. Characteristic peaks of cellulose, phenolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s, and proteins were found in the intervessel pit membranes of <i>P. nigra</i> wood. In addition, the vessel to parenchyma pit membranes and developing cell walls of the vascular cambium showed clear signals of cellulose, proteins, and pectin. We did not find a distinct peak of lignin and other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s in these structures. Our investigation of the complex chemical composition of intervessel pit membranes furthers our understanding of the flow of water and bubbles between neighboring conduits. The advances presented here pave the way for further label-free studies related to the nanochemistry of plant cell components.</p>

Sulforaphane Modifies Histone H3, Unpacks Chromatin, and Primes Defense
<p>Modern crop production calls for agrochemicals that prime plants for enhanced defense. Reliable test systems for spotting priming-inducing chemistry, however, are rare. We developed an assay for the high-throughput search for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s that prime microbial pattern-induced secretion of antimicrobial furanocoumarins (phytoalexins) in cultured parsley cells. The screen produced 1-isothiocyanato-4-methylsulfinylbutane (sulforaphane; SFN), a secondary metabolite in many crucifers, as a novel defense priming <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>. While elucidating SFN’s mode of action in defense priming, we found that in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis</i> <i>thaliana</i>) the isothiocyanate provokes covalent modification (K4me3, K9ac) of histone H3 in the promoter and promoter-proximal region of defense genes <i>WRKY6</i> and <i>PDF1</i>.<i>2</i>, but not <i>PR1</i>. SFN-triggered H3K4me3 and H3K9ac coincide with chromatin unpacking in the <i>WRKY6</i> and <i>PDF1</i>.<i>2</i> regulatory regions, primed <i>WRKY6</i> expression, unprimed <i>PDF1</i>.<i>2</i> activation, and reduced susceptibility to downy mildew disease (<i>Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis</i>). Because SFN also directly inhibits <i>H</i>. <i>arabidopsidis</i> and other plant pathogens, the isothiocyanate is promising for the development of a plant protectant with a dual mode of action.</p>

Signal Dynamics and Interactions during Flooding Stress
<p>Flooding is detrimental for nearly all higher plants, including crops. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong> stress elicited by slow gas exchange and low light levels under water is responsible for both a carbon and an energy crisis ultimately leading to plant death. The endogenous concentrations of four gaseous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s, oxygen, carbon dioxide, ethylene, and nitric oxide, change during the submergence of plant organs in water. These gases play a pivotal role in signal transduction cascades, leading to adaptive processes such as metabolic adjustments and anatomical features. Of these gases, ethylene is seen as the most consistent, pervasive, and reliable signal of early flooding stress, most likely in tight interaction with the other gases. The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in plant cells during flooding and directly after subsidence, during which the plant is confronted with high light and oxygen levels, is characteristic for this abiotic stress. Low, well-controlled levels of ROS are essential for adaptive signaling pathways, in interaction with the other gaseous flooding signals. On the other hand, excessive uncontrolled bursts of ROS can be highly damaging for plants. Therefore, a fine-tuned balance is important, with a major role for ROS production and scavenging. Our understanding of the temporal dynamics of the four gases and ROS is basal, whereas it is likely that they form a signature readout of prevailing flooding conditions and subsequent adaptive responses.</p>

Coexpression Analysis Identifies Two Oxidoreductases Involved in the Biosynthesis of the Monoterpene Acid Moiety of Natural Pyrethrin Insecticides in <i>Tanacetum cinerariifolium</i>
<p>Flowers of <i>Tanacetum cinerariifolium</i> produce a set of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s known collectively as pyrethrins, which are commercially important pesticides that are strongly toxic to flying insects but not to most vertebrates. A pyrethrin molecule is an ester consisting of either trans-chrysanthemic acid or its modified form, pyrethric acid, and one of three alcohols, jasmolone, pyrethrolone, and cinerolone, that appear to be derived from jasmonic acid. Chrysanthemyl diphosphate synthase (CDS), the first enzyme involved in the synthesis of trans-chrysanthemic acid, was characterized previously and its gene isolated. <i>TcCDS</i> produces free trans-chrysanthemol in addition to trans-chrysanthemyl diphosphate, but the enzymes responsible for the conversion of trans-chrysanthemol to the corresponding aldehyde and then to the acid have not been reported. We used an RNA sequencing-based approach and coexpression correlation analysis to identify several candidate genes encoding putative trans-chrysanthemol and trans-chrysanthemal dehydrogenases. We functionally characterized the proteins encoded by these genes using a combination of in vitro biochemical assays and heterologous expression in planta to demonstrate that <i>TcADH2</i> encodes an enzyme that oxidizes trans-chrysanthemol to trans-chrysanthemal, while <i>TcALDH1</i> encodes an enzyme that oxidizes trans-chrysanthemal into trans-chrysanthemic acid. Transient coexpression of <i>TcADH2</i> and <i>TcALDH1</i> together with <i>TcCDS</i> in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaves results in the production of trans-chrysanthemic acid as well as several other side products. The majority (58%) of trans-chrysanthemic acid was glycosylated or otherwise modified. Overall, these data identify key steps in the biosynthesis of pyrethrins and demonstrate the feasibility of metabolic engineering to produce components of these defense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s in a heterologous host.</p>

Different Routes for Conifer- and Sinapaldehyde and Higher Saccharification upon Deficiency in the Dehydrogenase CAD1
<p>In the search for renewable energy sources, genetic engineering is a promising strategy to improve plant cell wall composition for biofuel and bioproducts generation. Lignin is a major factor determining saccharification efficiency and, therefore, is a prime target to engineer. Here, lignin content and composition were modified in poplar (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus alba</i>) by specifically down-regulating <i>CINNAMYL ALCOHOL DEHYDROGENASE1</i> (<i>CAD1</i>) by a hairpin-RNA-mediated silencing approach, which resulted in only 5% residual <i>CAD1</i> transcript abundance. These transgenic lines showed no biomass penalty despite a 10% reduction in Klason lignin content and severe shifts in lignin composition. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and thioacidolysis revealed a strong increase (up to 20-fold) in sinapaldehyde incorporation into lignin, whereas coniferaldehyde was not increased markedly. Accordingly, ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based phenolic profiling revealed a more than 24,000-fold accumulation of a newly identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong> made from 8-8 coupling of two sinapaldehyde radicals. However, no additional cinnamaldehyde coupling products could be detected in the CAD1-deficient poplars. Instead, the transgenic lines accumulated a range of hydroxycinnamate-derived metabolites, of which the most prominent accumulation (over 8,500-fold) was observed for a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong> that was identified by purification and nuclear magnetic resonance as syringyl lactic acid hexoside. Our data suggest that, upon down-regulation of <i>CAD1</i>, coniferaldehyde is converted into ferulic acid and derivatives, whereas sinapaldehyde is either oxidatively coupled into S′(8-8)S′ and lignin or converted to sinapic acid and derivatives. The most prominent sink of the increased flux to hydroxycinnamates is syringyl lactic acid hexoside. Furthermore, low-extent saccharification assays, under different pretreatment conditions, showed strongly increased glucose (up to +81%) and xylose (up to +153%) release, suggesting that down-regulating <i>CAD1</i> is a promising strategy for improving lignocellulosic biomass for the sugar platform industry.</p>

Hydroxystilbenes Are Monomers in Palm Fruit Endocarp Lignins
<p>Lignin, the plant cell wall polymer that binds fibers together but makes processing difficult, is traditionally formed from three monomers, the so-called monolignols (<i>p</i>-coumaryl, coniferyl, and sinapyl alcohols). Recently, we discovered, in grass lignins, a phenolic monomer that falls outside the canonical lignin biosynthetic pathway, the flavone tricin. As we show here, palm fruit (macaéíéííéíúba [<i>Acrocomia aculeata</i>], carnauba [<i>Copernicia prunifera</i>], and coconut [<i>Cocos nucifera</i>]) endocarps contain lignin polymers derived in part from a previously unconsidered class of lignin monomers, the hydroxystilbenes, including the valuable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s piceatannol and resveratrol. Piceatannol could be released from these lignins upon derivatization followed by reductive cleavage, a degradative method that cleaves β-ether bonds, indicating that at least a fraction is incorporated through labile ether bonds. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of products from the copolymerization of piceatannol and monolignols confirms the structures in the natural polymer and demonstrates that piceatannol acts as an authentic monomer participating in coupling and cross-coupling reactions during lignification. Therefore, palm fruit endocarps contain a new class of stilbenolignin polymers, further expanding the definition of lignin and implying that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s such as piceatannol and resveratrol are potentially available in what is now essentially a waste product.</p>

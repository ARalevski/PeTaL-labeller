Tailored semiconductors for high-harmonic optoelectronics
<p>The advent of high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harmon</span></strong>ic generation in gases 30 years ago set the foundation for attosecond science and facilitated ultrafast spectroscopy in atoms, molecules, and solids. We explore high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harmon</span></strong>ic generation in the solid state by means of nanostructured and ion-implanted semiconductors. We use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>length</span></strong>-selective microscopic imaging to map enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harmon</span></strong>ic emission and show that the generation medium and the driving field can be locally tailored in solids by modifying the chemical composition and morphology. This enables the control of high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harmon</span></strong>ic technology within precisely engineered solid targets. We demonstrate customized high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harmon</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> fields with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>length</span></strong>s down to 225 nanometers (ninth-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harmon</span></strong>ic order of 2-micrometer laser pulses) and present an integrated Fresnel zone plate target in silicon, which leads to diffraction-limited self-focusing of the generated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harmon</span></strong>ics down to 1-micrometer spot sizes.</p>

Direct measurements of two-way wave-particle energy transfer in a collisionless space plasma
<p>Particle acceleration by plasma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s and spontaneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> generation are fundamental energy and momentum exchange processes in collisionless plasmas. Such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>-particle interactions occur ubiquitously in space. We present ultrafast measurements in Earth’s magnetosphere by the Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft that enabled quantitative evaluation of energy transfer in interactions associated with electromagnetic ion cyclotron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s. The observed ion distributions are not symmetric around the magnetic field direction but are in phase with the plasma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> fields. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>-ion phase relations demonstrate that a cyclotron resonance transferred energy from hot protons to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s, which in turn nonresonantly accelerated cold He<sup>+</sup> to energies up to ~2 kilo–electron volts. These observations provide direct quantitative evidence for collisionless energy transfer in plasmas between distinct particle populations via <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>-particle interactions.</p>

Intertidal sea stars (<i>Pisaster ochraceus</i>) alter body shape in response to wave action
<p>Sea stars are some of the largest mobile animals able to live in the harsh flow environment of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>-exposed, rocky intertidal shores. In addition, some species, such as the northeastern Pacific <i>Pisaster ochraceus</i>, are ecologically significant predators in a broad range of environments, from sheltered lagoons to the most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>-exposed shorelines. How they function and survive under such an extreme range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> exposures remains a puzzle. Here we examine the ability of <i>P. ochraceus</i> to alter body form in response to variation in flow conditions. We found that sea stars in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>-exposed sites had narrower arms and were lighter per unit arm length than those from sheltered sites. Body form was tightly correlated with maximum velocity of breaking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s across four sites and also varied over time. In addition, field transplant experiments showed that these differences in shape were due primarily to phenotypic plasticity. Sea stars transplanted from a sheltered site to a more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>-exposed site became lighter per unit arm length, and developed narrower arms, after 3 months. The tight correlation between water flow and morphology suggests that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> force must be a significant selective factor acting on body shape. On exposed shores, narrower arms probably reduce both lift and drag in breaking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s. On protected shores, fatter arms may provide more thermal inertia to resist overheating, or more body volume for gametes. Such plastic changes in body shape represent a unique method by which sea stars adapt to spatial, seasonal and possibly short-term variation in flow conditions.</p>

Apoptosis propagates through the cytoplasm as trigger waves
<p>Apoptosis is an evolutionarily conserved form of programmed cell death critical for development and tissue homeostasis in animals. The apoptotic control network includes several positive feedback loops that may allow apoptosis to spread through the cytoplasm in self-regenerating trigger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s. We tested this possibility in cell-free <i>Xenopus laevis</i> egg extracts and observed apoptotic trigger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s with speeds of ~30 micrometers per minute. Fractionation and inhibitor studies implicated multiple feedback loops in generating the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s. Apoptotic oocytes and eggs exhibited surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s with speeds of ~30 micrometers per minute, which were tightly correlated with caspase activation. Thus, apoptosis spreads through trigger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s in both extracts and intact cells. Our findings show how apoptosis can spread over large distances within a cell and emphasize the general importance of trigger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s in cell signaling.</p>

Topological origin of equatorial waves
<p>Topology sheds new light on the emergence of unidirectional edge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s in a variety of physical systems, from condensed matter to artificial lattices. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s observed in geophysical flows are also robust to perturbations, which suggests a role for topology. We show a topological origin for two well-known equatorially trapped <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s, the Kelvin and Yanai modes, owing to the breaking of time-reversal symmetry by Earth’s rotation. The nontrivial structure of the bulk PoincaréÉééé <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> modes encoded through the first Chern number of value 2 guarantees the existence of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s.

Global drainage patterns and the origins of topographic relief on Earth, Mars, and Titan
<p>Rivers have eroded the topography of Mars, Titan, and Earth, creating diverse landscapes. However, the dominant processes that generated topography on Titan (and to some extent on early Mars) are not well known. We analyzed drainage patterns on all three bodies and found that large drainages, which record interactions between deformation and erosional modification, conform much better to long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>length</span></strong> topography on Titan and Mars than on Earth. We use a numerical landscape evolution model to demonstrate that short-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>length</span></strong> deformation causes drainage directions to diverge from long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>length</span></strong> topography, as observed on Earth.

Attosecond dynamics through a Fano resonance: Monitoring the birth of a photoelectron
<p>The dynamics of quantum systems are encoded in the amplitude and phase of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> packets. However, the rapidity of electron dynamics on the attosecond scale has precluded the complete characterization of electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> packets in the time domain. Using spectrally resolved electron interferometry, we were able to measure the amplitude and phase of a photoelectron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> packet created through a Fano autoionizing resonance in helium. In our setup, replicas obtained by two-photon transitions interfere with reference <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> packets that are formed through smooth continua, allowing the full temporal reconstruction, purely from experimental data, of the resonant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> packet released in the continuum. In turn, this resolves the buildup of the autoionizing resonance on an attosecond time scale. Our results, in excellent agreement with ab initio time-dependent calculations, raise prospects for detailed investigations of ultrafast photoemission dynamics governed by electron correlation, as well as coherent control over structured electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> packets.</p>

Shear properties of Earth’s inner core constrained by a detection of <i>J</i> waves in global correlation wavefield
<p>Seismic <i>J</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s, shear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s that traverse Earth’s inner core, provide direct constraints on the inner core’s solidity and shear properties. However, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s have been elusive in the direct seismic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>field because of their small amplitudes. We devised a new method to detect <i>J</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s in the earthquake coda correlation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>field. They manifest through the similarity with other compressional core-sensitive signals. The inner core is solid, but relatively soft, with shear-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> speeds and shear moduli of 3.42 ± 0.02 kilometers per second and 149.0 ± 1.6 gigapascals (GPa) near the inner core boundary and 3.58 ± 0.02 kilometers per second and 167.4 ± 1.6 GPa in Earth’s center. The values are 2.5% lower than the widely used Preliminary Earth Reference Model. This provides new constraints on the dynamical interpretation of Earth’s inner core.</p>

Hippocampal ripples down-regulate synapses
<p>The specific effects of sleep on synaptic plasticity remain unclear. We report that mouse hippocampal sharp-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> ripple oscillations serve as intrinsic events that trigger long-lasting synaptic depression. Silencing of sharp-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> ripples during slow-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> states prevented the spontaneous down-regulation of net synaptic weights and impaired the learning of new memories. The synaptic down-regulation was dependent on the <i>N</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate receptor and selective for a specific input pathway. Thus, our findings are consistent with the role of slow-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> states in refining memory engrams by reducing recent memory-irrelevant neuronal activity and suggest a previously unrecognized function for sharp-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> ripples.</p>

Magnetic field–induced pair density wave state in the cuprate vortex halo

Although routinely labeled a charge density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> (CDW), this DW state could actually be an electron-pair density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> (PDW).

Anti–parity-time symmetry in diffusive systems
<p>Various concepts related to parity-time symmetry, including anti–parity-time symmetry, have found broad applications in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> physics. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> systems are fundamentally described by Hermitian operators, whereas their unusual properties are introduced by incorporation of gain and loss. We propose that the related physics need not be restricted to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> dynamics, and we consider systems described by diffusive dynamics. We study the heat transfer in two countermoving media and show that this system exhibits anti–parity-time symmetry. The spontaneous symmetry breaking results in a phase transition from motionless temperature profiles, despite the mechanical motion of the background, to moving temperature profiles. Our results extend the concepts of parity-time symmetry beyond <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> physics and may offer opportunities to manipulate heat and mass transport.</p>

Electromagnetic evidence that SSS17a is the result of a binary neutron star merger

We synthesize the optical to near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy of SSS17a collected by the One-Meter Two-Hemisphere collaboration, finding that SSS17a is unlike other known transients. The source is best described by theoretical models of a kilonova consisting of radioactive elements produced by rapid neutron capture (the r-process).

Coherent imaging of an attosecond electron wave packet
<p>Electrons detached from atoms or molecules by photoionization carry information about the quantum state from which they originate, as well as the continuum states into which they are released. Generally, the photoelectron momentum distribution is composed of a coherent sum of angular momentum components, each with an amplitude and phase. Here we show, by using photoionization of neon, that a train of attosecond pulses synchronized with an infrared laser field can be used to disentangle these angular momentum components. Two-color, two-photon ionization via a Stark-shifted intermediate state creates an almost pure f-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> with a magnetic quantum number of zero. Interference of the f-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> with a spherically symmetric s-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> provides a holographic reference that enables phase-resolved imaging of the f-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>.</p>

Importance of Fluctuations in Light on Plant Photosynthetic Acclimation
<p>The acclimation of plants to light has been studied extensively, yet little is known about the effect of dynamic fluctuations in light on plant phenotype and acclimatory responses. We mimicked natural fluctuations in light over a diurnal period to examine the effect on the photosynthetic processes and growth of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). High and low light intensities, delivered via a realistic dynamic fluctuating or square <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> pattern, were used to grow and assess plants. Plants subjected to square <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> light had thicker leaves and greater photosynthetic capacity compared with fluctuating light-grown plants. This, together with elevated levels of proteins associated with electron transport, indicates greater investment in leaf structural components and photosynthetic processes. In contrast, plants grown under fluctuating light had thinner leaves, lower leaf light absorption, but maintained similar photosynthetic rates per unit leaf area to square <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>-grown plants. Despite high light use efficiency, plants grown under fluctuating light had a slow growth rate early in development, likely due to the fact that plants grown under fluctuating conditions were not able to fully utilize the light energy absorbed for carbon fixation. Diurnal leaf-level measurements revealed a negative feedback control of photosynthesis, resulting in a decrease in total diurnal carbon assimilated of at least 20%. These findings highlight that growing plants under square <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> growth conditions ultimately fails to predict plant performance under realistic light regimes and stress the importance of considering fluctuations in incident light in future experiments that aim to infer plant productivity under natural conditions in the field.</p>

A dust-enshrouded tidal disruption event with a resolved radio jet in a galaxy merger

Atmospheric blocking as a traffic jam in the jet stream
<p>Atmospheric blocking due to anomalous, persistent meandering of the jet stream often causes weather extremes in the mid-latitudes. Despite the ubiquity of blocking, the onset mechanism is not well understood. Here we demonstrate a close analogy between blocking and traffic congestion on a highway by using meteorological data and show that blocking and traffic congestion can be described by a common mathematical theory. The theory predicts that the jet stream has a capacity for the flux of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> activity (a measure of meandering), just as the highway has traffic capacity, and when the capacity is exceeded, blocking manifests as congestion. Stationary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s modulate the jet stream’s capacity for transient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s and localize block formation. Climate change likely affects blocking frequency by modifying the jet stream’s proximity to capacity.</p>

The strong intrinsic attenuation in the asthenosphere obtained at higher frequency (~3 hertz) is comparable to that constrained at lower frequency (~100 seconds) by surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s and suggests frequency-independent anelasticity, whereas the intrinsic attenuation in the lithosphere is frequency dependent. This difference in frequency dependence indicates that the strong and broad peak dissipation recently observed in the laboratory exists only in the asthenosphere and provides new insight into what distinguishes the asthenosphere from the lithosphere.</p>

Giant nonlinear response at a plasmonic nanofocus drives efficient four-wave mixing
<p>Efficient optical frequency mixing typically must accumulate over large interaction lengths because nonlinear responses in natural materials are inherently weak. This limits the efficiency of mixing processes owing to the requirement of phase matching. Here, we report efficient four-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> mixing (FWM) over micrometer-scale interaction lengths at telecommunications <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>length</span></strong>s on silicon. We used an integrated plasmonic gap <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>guide that strongly confines light within a nonlinear organic polymer. The gap <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>guide intensifies light by nanofocusing it to a mode cross-section of a few tens of nanometers, thus generating a nonlinear response so strong that efficient FWM accumulates over <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>length</span></strong>-scale distances. This technique opens up nonlinear optics to a regime of relaxed phase matching, with the possibility of compact, broadband, and efficient frequency mixing integrated with silicon photonics.</p>

High-harmonic generation in graphene enhanced by elliptically polarized light excitation
<p>The electronic properties of graphene can give rise to a range of nonlinear optical responses. One of the most desirable nonlinear optical processes is high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harmon</span></strong>ic generation (HHG) originating from coherent electron motion induced by an intense light field. Here, we report on the observation of up to ninth-order <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harmon</span></strong>ics in graphene excited by mid-infrared laser pulses at room temperature. The HHG in graphene is enhanced by an elliptically polarized laser excitation, and the resultant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harmon</span></strong>ic radiation has a particular polarization. The observed ellipticity dependence is reproduced by a fully quantum mechanical treatment of HHG in solids. The zero-gap nature causes the unique properties of HHG in graphene, and our findings open up the possibility of investigating strong-field and ultrafast dynamics and nonlinear behavior of massless Dirac fermions.</p>

<p>The Grotthuss mechanism explains the anomalously high proton mobility in water as a sequence of proton transfers along a hydrogen-bonded (H-bonded) network. However, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vibrat</span></strong>ional spectroscopic signatures of this process are masked by the diffuse nature of the key bands in bulk water. Here we report how the much simpler <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vibrat</span></strong>ional spectra of cold, composition-selected heavy water clusters, D<sup>+</sup>(D<sub>2</sub>O)<i><sub>n</sub></i>, can be exploited to capture clear markers that encode the collective reaction coordinate along the proton-transfer event. By complexing the solvated hydronium “Eigen” cluster [D<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>(D<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>3</sub>] with increasingly strong H-bond acceptor molecules (D<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, CO, and D<sub>2</sub>O), we are able to track the frequency of every O-D stretch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vibrat</span></strong>ion in the complex as the transferring hydron is incrementally pulled from the central hydronium to a neighboring water molecule.</p>

Observation of a nematic quantum Hall liquid on the surface of bismuth
<p>Nematic quantum fluids with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> functions that break the underlying crystalline symmetry can form in interacting electronic systems. We examined the quantum Hall states that arise in high magnetic fields from anisotropic hole pockets on the Bi(111) surface. Spectroscopy performed with a scanning tunneling microscope showed that a combination of single-particle effects and many-body Coulomb interactions lift the six-fold Landau level (LL) degeneracy to form three valley-polarized quantum Hall states. We imaged the resulting anisotropic LL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> functions and found that they have a different orientation for each broken-symmetry state. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> functions correspond to those expected from pairs of hole valleys and provide a direct spatial signature of a nematic electronic phase.</p>

Spiral density waves in a young protoplanetary disk
<p>Gravitational forces are expected to excite spiral density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s in protoplanetary disks, disks of gas and dust orbiting young stars. However, previous observations that showed spiral structure were not able to probe disk midplanes, where most of the mass is concentrated and where planet formation takes place. Using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, we detected a pair of trailing symmetric spiral arms in the protoplanetary disk surrounding the young star Elias 2-27. The arms extend to the disk outer regions and can be traced down to the midplane. These millimeter-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> observations also reveal an emission gap closer to the star than the spiral arms. We argue that the observed spirals trace shocks of spiral density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s in the midplane of this young disk.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Starch Turnover and Metabolism during Flower and Early Embryo Development
<p>The accumulation of starch within photosynthetic tissues and within dedicated storage organs has been characterized extensively in many species, and a function in buffering carbon availability or in fueling later growth phases, respectively, has been proposed. However, developmentally regulated starch turnover within heterotrophic tissues other than dedicated storage organs is poorly characterized, and its function is not well understood. Here, we report on the characterization of starch turnover during flower, early embryo, and silique development in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) using a combined clearing-staining technique on whole-mount tissue. Besides the two previously documented <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s of transient starch accumulation in the stamen envelope, occurring during meiosis and pollen mitosis I, we identified a novel, third <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> of starch amylogenesis/amylolysis during the last stages of stamen development. To gain insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms, we analyzed publicly available microarray data, which revealed a developmentally coordinated expression of carbohydrate transport and metabolism genes during these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s of transient starch accumulation. Based on this analysis, we characterized starch dynamics in mutants affecting hexose phosphate metabolism and translocation, and identified the Glc-6-phosphate/phosphate antiporter GPT1 as the putative translocator of Glc-6-phosphate for starch biosynthesis in reproductive tissues. Based on these results, we propose a model of starch synthesis within the pollen grain and discuss the nutrient transport route feeding the embryo within the developing seed.</p>

Correlations in high-harmonic generation of matter-wave jets revealed by pattern recognition

In a strongly driven Bose-Einstein condensate, we observe the high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harmon</span></strong>ic generation of matter-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> jets with complex correlations as a result of bosonic stimulation. Based on a pattern recognition scheme, we identify a pattern of correlations that reveals the underlying secondary scattering processes and higher-order correlations. We show that pattern recognition offers a versatile strategy to visualize and analyze the quantum dynamics of a many-body system.</p>

The low-frequency source of Saturn’s kilometric radiation
<p>Understanding how auroral radio emissions are produced by magnetized bodies requires in situ measurements within their source region. Saturn’s kilometric radiation (SKR) has been widely used as a remote proxy of Saturn’s magnetosphere. We present <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> and plasma measurements from the Cassini spacecraft during its ring-grazing high-inclination orbits, which passed three times through the high-altitude SKR emission region. Northern dawn-side, narrow-banded radio sources were encountered at frequencies of 10 to 20 kilohertz, within regions of upward currents mapping to the ultraviolet auroral oval. The kilometric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s were produced on the extraordinary mode by the cyclotron maser instability from 6– to 12–kilo–electron volt electron beams and radiated quasi-perpendicularly to the auroral magnetic field lines. The SKR low-frequency sources appear to be strongly controlled by time-variable magnetospheric electron densities.</p>

Suppressing spatiotemporal lasing instabilities with wave-chaotic microcavities
<p>Spatiotemporal instabilities are widespread phenomena resulting from complexity and nonlinearity. In broad-area edge-emitting semiconductor lasers, the nonlinear interactions of multiple spatial modes with the active medium can result in filamentation and spatiotemporal chaos. These instabilities degrade the laser performance and are extremely challenging to control. We demonstrate a powerful approach to suppress spatiotemporal instabilities using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>-chaotic or disordered cavities. The interference of many propagating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s with random phases in such cavities disrupts the formation of self-organized structures such as filaments, resulting in stable lasing dynamics. Our method provides a general and robust scheme to prevent the formation and growth of nonlinear instabilities for a large variety of high-power lasers.</p>

Abrupt cloud clearing of marine stratocumulus in the subtropical southeast Atlantic
<p>We document rapid and abrupt clearings of large portions of the subtropical marine low cloud deck that have implications for the global radiation balance and climate sensitivity. Over the southeast Atlantic, large areas of stratocumulus are quickly eroded, yielding partial or complete clearing along sharp transitions hundreds to thousands of kilometers in length that move westward at 8 to 12 meters per second and travel as far as 1000+ kilometers from the African coast. The westward-moving cloudiness reductions have an annual peak in occurrence in the period from April through June. The cloud erosion boundaries reduce cloud at ≈10-kilometer scale in less than 15 minutes, move approximately perpendicular to the mean flow, and are often accompanied by small-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> features. Observations suggest that the cloud erosion is caused by atmospheric gravity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s.</p>

Torsional instability in the single-chain limit of a transition metal trichalcogenide

We report the synthesis of the quasi–one-dimensional transition metal trichalcogenide NbSe<sub>3</sub> (niobium triselenide) in the few-chain limit, including the realization of isolated single chains. The chains are encapsulated in protective boron nitride or carbon nanotube sheaths to prevent oxidation and to facilitate characterization. Transmission electron microscopy reveals static and dynamic structural torsional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s not found in bulk NbSe<sub>3</sub> crystals. Electronic structure calculations indicate that charge transfer drives the torsional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> instability.

The ability to control and read out the state of individual spins provides direct access to several order parameters, which we used to determine the lattice’s magnetic phases as well as critical disorder and one of its universal exponents. By tuning the degree of disorder and effective transverse magnetic field, we observed phase transitions between a paramagnetic, an antiferromagnetic, and a spin-glass phase.</p>

Magnetic seismology of interstellar gas clouds: Unveiling a hidden dimension

Probing optically silent superfluid stripes in cuprates
<p>Unconventional superconductivity in the cuprates coexists with other types of electronic order. However, some of these orders are invisible to most experimental probes because of their symmetry. For example, the possible existence of superfluid stripes is not easily validated with linear optics, because the stripe alignment causes interlayer superconducting tunneling to vanish on average. Here we show that this frustration is removed in the nonlinear optical response. A giant terahertz third <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harmon</span></strong>ic, characteristic of nonlinear Josephson tunneling, is observed in La<sub>1.885</sub>Ba<sub>0.115</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> above the transition temperature <i>T</i><sub>c</sub> = 13 kelvin and up to the charge-ordering temperature <i>T</i><sub>co</sub> = 55 kelvin. We model these results by hypothesizing the presence of a pair density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> condensate, in which nonlinear mixing of optically silent tunneling modes drives large dipole-carrying supercurrents.</p>

Attosecond-resolved photoionization of chiral molecules
<p>Chiral light-matter interactions have been investigated for two centuries, leading to the discovery of many chiroptical processes used for discrimination of enantiomers. Whereas most chiroptical effects result from a response of bound electrons, photoionization can produce much stronger chiral signals that manifest as asymmetries in the angular distribution of the photoelectrons along the light-propagation axis. We implemented self-referenced attosecond photoelectron interferometry to measure the temporal profile of the forward and backward electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> packets emitted upon photoionization of camphor by circularly polarized laser pulses. We measured a delay between electrons ejected forward and backward, which depends on the ejection angle and reaches 24 attoseconds. The asymmetric temporal shape of electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> packets emitted through an autoionizing state further reveals the chiral character of strongly correlated electronic dynamics.</p>

Stripe order in the underdoped region of the two-dimensional Hubbard model
<p>Competing inhomogeneous orders are a central feature of correlated electron materials, including the high-temperature superconductors. The two-dimensional Hubbard model serves as the canonical microscopic physical model for such systems. Multiple orders have been proposed in the underdoped part of the phase diagram, which corresponds to a regime of maximum numerical difficulty. By combining the latest numerical methods in exhaustive simulations, we uncover the ordering in the underdoped ground state. We find a stripe order that has a highly compressible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>length</span></strong> on an energy scale of a few kelvin, with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>length</span></strong> fluctuations coupled to pairing order. The favored filled stripe order is different from that seen in real materials.

Nonreciprocal lasing in topological cavities of arbitrary geometries

Quantum control of molecular collisions at 1 kelvin
<p>Measurement of vector correlations in molecular scattering is an indispensable tool for mapping out interaction potentials. In a coexpanded supersonic beam, we have studied the rotationally inelastic process wherein deuterium hydride (HD) (<i>v </i>= 1, <i>j </i>= 2) collides with molecular deuterium (D<sub>2</sub>) to form HD (<i>v </i>= 1, <i>j </i>= 1), where <i>v</i> and <i>j</i> are the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vibrat</span></strong>ional and rotational quantum numbers, respectively. HD (<i>v </i>= 1, <i>j </i>= 2) was prepared by Stark-induced adiabatic Raman passage, with its bond axis aligned preferentially parallel or perpendicular to the lab-fixed relative velocity. The coexpansion brought the collision temperature down to 1 kelvin, restricting scattering to s and p partial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s. Scattering angular distributions showed a dramatic stereodynamic preference (~3:1) for perpendicular versus parallel alignment. The four-vector correlation measured between the initial and final velocities and the initial and final rotational angular momentum vectors of HD provides insight into the strong anisotropic forces present in the collision process.</p>

Breaking Lorentz reciprocity to overcome the time-bandwidth limit in physics and engineering
<p>A century-old tenet in physics and engineering asserts that any type of system, having bandwidth Δω, can interact with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> over only a constrained time period Δ<i>t</i> inversely proportional to the bandwidth (Δ<i>t</i>·Δω ~ 2π). This law severely limits the generic capabilities of all types of resonant and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>-guiding systems in photonics, cavity quantum electrodynamics and optomechanics, acoustics, continuum mechanics, and atomic and optical physics but is thought to be completely fundamental, arising from basic Fourier reciprocity. We propose that this “fundamental” limit can be overcome in systems where Lorentz reciprocity is broken. As a system becomes more asymmetric in its transport properties, the degree to which the limit can be surpassed becomes greater. By way of example, we theoretically demonstrate how, in an astutely designed magnetized semiconductor heterostructure, the above limit can be exceeded by orders of magnitude by using realistic material parameters. Our findings revise prevailing paradigms for linear, time-invariant resonant systems, challenging the doctrine that high-quality resonances must invariably be narrowband and providing the possibility of developing devices with unprecedentedly high time-bandwidth performance.</p>

Superficial layers of the medial entorhinal cortex replay independently of the hippocampus
<p>The hippocampus is thought to initiate systems-wide mnemonic processes through the reactivation of previously acquired spatial and episodic memory traces, which can recruit the entorhinal cortex as a first stage of memory redistribution to other brain areas. Hippocampal reactivation occurs during sharp <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>–ripples, in which synchronous network firing encodes sequences of places. We investigated the coordination of this replay by recording assembly activity simultaneously in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and superficial layers of the medial entorhinal cortex. We found that entorhinal cell assemblies can replay trajectories independently of the hippocampus and sharp <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>–ripples. This suggests that the hippocampus is not the sole initiator of spatial and episodic memory trace reactivation. Memory systems involved in these processes may include nonhierarchical, parallel components.</p>

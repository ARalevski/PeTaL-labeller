Genome-Wide Prediction of Metabolic Enzymes, Pathways, and Gene Clusters in Plants
<p>Plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism underpins many traits of ecological and agronomic importance. Plants produce numerous compounds to cope with their environments but the biosynthetic pathways for most of these compounds have not yet been elucidated. To engineer and improve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic traits, we need comprehensive and accurate knowledge of the organization and regulation of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism at the genome scale. Here, we present a computational pipeline to identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic enzymes, pathways, and gene clusters from a sequenced genome. Using this pipeline, we generated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic pathway databases for 22 species and identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic gene clusters from 18 species. This unified resource can be used to conduct a wide array of comparative studies of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism. Using the resource, we discovered a widespread occurrence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic gene clusters in plants: 11,969 clusters from 18 species. The prevalence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic gene clusters offers an intriguing possibility of an untapped source for uncovering new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s pathways. For example, more than 1,700 clusters contain enzymes that could generate a specialized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ite scaffold (signature enzymes) and enzymes that modify the scaffold (tailoring enzymes). In four species with sufficient gene expression data, we identified 43 highly coexpressed clusters that contain signature and tailoring enzymes, of which eight were characterized previously to be functional pathways. Finally, we identified patterns of genome organization that implicate local gene duplication and, to a lesser extent, single gene transposition as having played roles in the evolution of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic gene clusters.</p>

Primary Metabolism during Biosynthesis of Secondary Wall Polymers of Protoxylem Vessel Elements
<p>Xylem vessels, the water-conducting cells in vascular plants, undergo characteristic secondary wall deposition and programmed cell death. These processes are regulated by the VASCULAR-RELATED NAC-DOMAIN (VND) transcription factors. Here, to identify changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism that occur during protoxylem vessel element differentiation, we subjected tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) BY-2 suspension culture cells carrying an inducible <i>VND7</i> system to liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based wide-target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ome analysis and transcriptome analysis. Time-course data for 128 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites showed dynamic changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites related to amino acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s. The concentration of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, an important intermediate of the glycolysis pathway, immediately decreased in the initial stages of cell differentiation. As cell differentiation progressed, specific amino acids accumulated, including the shikimate-related amino acids and the translocatable nitrogen-rich amino acid arginine. Transcriptome data indicated that cell differentiation involved the active up-regulation of genes encoding the enzymes catalyzing fructose 6-phosphate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s from glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s from oxaloacetate, and phenylalanine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s, which includes shikimate pathway enzymes. Concomitantly, active changes in the amount of fructose 6-phosphate and phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate were detected during cell differentiation. Taken together, our results show that protoxylem vessel element differentiation is associated with changes in primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism, which could facilitate the production of polysaccharides and lignin monomers and, thus, promote the formation of the secondary cell wall. Also, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic shifts correlate with the active transcriptional regulation of specific enzyme genes. Therefore, our observations indicate that primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism is actively regulated during protoxylem vessel element differentiation to alter the cell’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic activity for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s of secondary wall polymers.</p>

The metabolic cost of communicative sound production in bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>)
<p>Bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>) produce various communicative sounds that are important for social behavior, maintaining group cohesion and coordinating foraging. For example, whistle production increases during disturbances, such as separations of mother–calf pairs and vessel approaches. It is clear that acoustic communication is important to the survival of these marine mammals, yet the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic cost of producing whistles and other socials sounds and the energetic consequences of modifying these sounds in response to both natural and anthropogenic disturbance are unknown. We used flow-through respirometry to determine whether the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic cost of sound production could be quantified in two captive dolphins producing social sounds (whistles and squawks). On average, we found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic rates measured during 2 min periods of sound production were 1.2 times resting values. Up to 7 min were required for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism to return to resting values following vocal periods. The total <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic cost (over resting values) of the 2 min vocal period plus the required recovery period (163.3 to 2995.9 ml O<sub>2</sub> or 3279.6 to 60,166.7 J) varied by individual as well as by mean duration of sounds produced within the vocal period. Observed variation in received cumulative sound energy levels of vocalizations was not related to total <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic costs. Furthermore, our empirical findings did not agree with previous theoretical estimates of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic cost of whistles. This study provides the first empirical data on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic cost of sound production in dolphins, which can be used to estimate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic costs of vocal responses to environmental perturbations in wild dolphins.</p>

Exercise-Induced Changes in Glucose Metabolism Promote Physiological Cardiac Growth
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Exercise promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic remodeling in the heart, which is associated with physiological cardiac growth; however, it is not known whether or how physical activity–induced changes in cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism cause myocardial remodeling. In this study, we tested whether exercise-mediated changes in cardiomyocyte glucose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism are important for physiological cardiac growth.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used radiometric, immunologic, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>omic, and biochemical assays to measure changes in myocardial glucose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism in mice subjected to acute and chronic treadmill exercise. To assess the relevance of changes in glycolytic activity, we determined how cardiac-specific expression of mutant forms of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase affect cardiac structure, function, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism, and gene programs relevant to cardiac remodeling. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>omic and transcriptomic screenings were used to identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic pathways and gene sets regulated by glycolytic activity in the heart.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Exercise acutely decreased glucose utilization via glycolysis by modulating circulating substrates and reducing phosphofructokinase activity; however, in the recovered state following exercise adaptation, there was an increase in myocardial phosphofructokinase activity and glycolysis. In mice, cardiac-specific expression of a kinase-deficient 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase transgene (Glyco<sup>Lo</sup> mice) lowered glycolytic rate and regulated the expression of genes known to promote cardiac growth. Hearts of Glyco<sup>Lo</sup> mice had larger myocytes, enhanced cardiac function, and higher capillary-to-myocyte ratios. Expression of phosphatase-deficient 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase in the heart (Glyco<sup>Hi</sup> mice) increased glucose utilization and promoted a more pathological form of hypertrophy devoid of transcriptional activation of the physiological cardiac growth program. Modulation of phosphofructokinase activity was sufficient to regulate the glucose–fatty acid cycle in the heart; however, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic inflexibility caused by invariantly low or high phosphofructokinase activity caused modest mitochondrial damage.

Metabolic and Proliferative State of Vascular Adventitial Fibroblasts in Pulmonary Hypertension Is Regulated Through a MicroRNA-124/PTBP1 (Polypyrimidine Tract Binding Protein 1)/Pyruvate Kinase Muscle Axis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>An emerging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic theory of pulmonary hypertension (PH) suggests that cellular and mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic dysfunction underlies the pathology of this disease. We and others have previously demonstrated the existence of hyperproliferative, apoptosis-resistant, proinflammatory adventitial fibroblasts from human and bovine hypertensive pulmonary arterial walls (PH-Fibs) that exhibit constitutive reprogramming of glycolytic and mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism, accompanied by an increased ratio of glucose catabolism through glycolysis versus the tricarboxylic acid cycle. However, the mechanisms responsible for these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic alterations in PH-Fibs remain unknown. We hypothesized that in PH-Fibs microRNA-124 (miR-124) regulates PTBP1 (polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1) expression to control alternative splicing of pyruvate kinase muscle (PKM) isoforms 1 and 2, resulting in an increased PKM2/PKM1 ratio, which promotes glycolysis and proliferation even in aerobic environments.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Pulmonary adventitial fibroblasts were isolated from calves and humans with severe PH (PH-Fibs) and from normal subjects. PTBP1 gene knockdown was achieved via PTBP1-siRNA; restoration of miR-124 was performed with miR-124 mimic. TEPP-46 and shikonin were used to manipulate PKM2 glycolytic function. Histone deacetylase inhibitors were used to treat cells. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic products were determined by mass spectrometry–based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>omics analyses, and mitochondrial function was analyzed by confocal microscopy and spectrofluorometry.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We detected an increased PKM2/PKM1 ratio in PH-Fibs compared with normal subjects. PKM2 inhibition reversed the glycolytic status of PH-Fibs, decreased their cell proliferation, and attenuated macrophage interleukin-1β expression. Furthermore, normalizing the PKM2/PKM1 ratio in PH-Fibs by miR-124 overexpression or PTBP1 knockdown reversed the glycolytic phenotype (decreased the production of glycolytic intermediates and byproducts, ie, lactate), rescued mitochondrial reprogramming, and decreased cell proliferation. Pharmacological manipulation of PKM2 activity with TEPP-46 and shikonin or treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors produced similar results.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In PH, miR-124, through the alternative splicing factor PTBP1, regulates the PKM2/PKM1 ratio, the overall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic, proliferative, and inflammatory state of cells. This PH phenotype can be rescued with interventions at various levels of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic cascade. These findings suggest a more integrated view of vascular cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism, which may open unique therapeutic prospects in targeting the dynamic glycolytic and mitochondrial interactions and between mesenchymal inflammatory cells in PH.</p></sec>

Separating host and microbiome contributions to drug pharmacokinetics and toxicity
<p>The gut microbiota is implicated in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism of many medical drugs, with consequences for interpersonal variation in drug efficacy and toxicity. However, quantifying microbial contributions to drug <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism is challenging, particularly in cases where host and microbiome perform the same <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic transformation. We combined gut commensal genetics with gnotobiotics to measure brivudine drug <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism across tissues in mice that vary in a single microbiome-encoded enzyme. Informed by these measurements, we built a pharmacokinetic model that quantitatively predicts microbiome contributions to systemic drug and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ite exposure, as a function of bioavailability, host and microbial drug-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>izing activity, drug and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ite absorption, and intestinal transit kinetics.

A Connection between Lysine and Serotonin Metabolism in Rice Endosperm
<p>Cereal endosperms produce a vast array of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites, including the essential amino acid lysine (Lys). Enhanced accumulation of Lys has been achieved via <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic engineering in cereals, but the potential connection between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic engineering and Lys fortification is unclear. In mature seeds of engineered High Free Lysine (HFL) rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), the endosperm takes on a characteristic dark-brown appearance. In this study, we use an integrated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>omic and transcriptomic approach combined with functional validation to elucidate the key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites responsible for the dark-brown phenotype. Importantly, we found that serotonin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s was elevated dramatically and closely linked with dark-brown endosperm color in HFL rice. A functional connection between serotonin and endosperm color was confirmed via overexpression of TDC3, a key enzyme of serotonin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s. Furthermore, we show that both the jasmonate signaling pathway and <i>TDC</i> expression were strongly induced in the late stage of endosperm development of HFL rice, coinciding with serotonin accumulation and dark-brown pigmentation. We propose a model for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic connection between Lys and serotonin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism in which elevated 2-aminoadipate from Lys catabolism may play a key role in the connection between the jasmonate signaling pathway, serotonin accumulation, and the brown phenotype in rice endosperm. Our data provide a deeper understanding of amino acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism in rice. In addition, the finding that both Lys and serotonin accumulate in HFL rice grains should promote efforts to create a nutritionally favorable crop.</p>

Glutathione Transferase U13 Functions in Pathogen-Triggered Glucosinolate Metabolism<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Glutathione (GSH) and indole glucosinolates (IGs) exert key functions in the immune system of the model plant Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Appropriate GSH levels are important for execution of both pre- and postinvasive disease resistance mechanisms to invasive pathogens, whereas an intact PENETRATION2 (PEN2)-pathway for IG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism is essential for preinvasive resistance in this species. Earlier indirect evidence suggested that the latter pathway involves conjugation of GSH with unstable products of IG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and further processing of the resulting adducts to biologically active molecules. Here we describe the identification of Glutathione-<i>S</i>-Transferase class-tau member 13 (GSTU13) as an indispensable component of the PEN2 immune pathway for IG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism. <i>gstu13</i> mutant plants are defective in the pathogen-triggered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s of end products of the PEN2 pathway, including 4-O-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosyl-indol-3-yl formamide, indole-3-ylmethyl amine, and raphanusamic acid. In line with this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic defect, lack of functional GSTU13 results in enhanced disease susceptibility toward several fungal pathogens including <i>Erysiphe pisi</i>, <i>Colletotrichum gloeosporioides</i>, and <i>Plectosphaerella cucumerina</i>. Seedlings of <i>gstu13</i> plants fail also to deposit the (1,3)-β-glucan cell wall polymer, callose, after recognition of the bacterial flg22 epitope. We show that GSTU13 mediates specifically the role of GSH in IG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism without noticeable impact on other immune functions of this tripeptide. We postulate that GSTU13 connects GSH with the pathogen-triggered PEN2 pathway for IG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism to deliver <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites that may have numerous functions in the innate immune system of Arabidopsis.</p>

Class II Cytochrome P450 Reductase Governs the Biosynthesis of Alkaloids
<p>Expansion of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s of plant specialized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites notably results from the massive recruitment of cytochrome P450s that catalyze multiple types of conversion of biosynthetic intermediates. For catalysis, P450s require a two-electron transfer catalyzed by shared cytochrome P450 oxidoreductases (CPRs), making these auxiliary proteins an essential component of specialized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism. CPR isoforms usually group into two distinct classes with different proposed roles, namely involvement in primary and basal specialized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>isms for class I and inducible specialized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism for class II. By studying the role of CPRs in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s of monoterpene indole alkaloids, we provide compelling evidence of an operational specialization of CPR isoforms in <i>Catharanthus roseus</i> (Madagascar periwinkle). Global analyses of gene expression correlation combined with transcript localization in specific leaf tissues and gene-silencing experiments of both classes of CPR all point to the strict requirement of class II CPRs for monoterpene indole alkaloid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s with a minimal or null role of class I. Direct assays of interaction and reduction of P450s in vitro, however, showed that both classes of CPR performed equally well. Such high specialization of class II CPRs in planta highlights the evolutionary strategy that ensures an efficient reduction of P450s in specialized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism.</p>

Altered lipid homeostasis in <i>Drosophila</i> InsP<sub>3</sub> receptor mutants leads to obesity and hyperphagia
<p>Obesity is a complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic disorder that often manifests with a strong genetic component in humans. However, the genetic basis for obesity and the accompanying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic syndrome is poorly defined. At a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic level, obesity arises from an imbalance between the nutritional intake and energy utilization of an organism. Mechanisms that sense the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic state of the individual and convey this information to satiety centers help achieve this balance. Mutations in genes that alter or modify such signaling mechanisms are likely to lead to either obese individuals, who in mammals are at high risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease, or excessively thin individuals with accompanying health problems. Here we show that <i>Drosophila</i> mutants for an intracellular calcium signaling channel, the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP<sub>3</sub>R) store excess triglycerides in their fat bodies and become unnaturally obese on a normal diet. Although excess insulin signaling can rescue obesity in InsP<sub>3</sub>R mutants to some extent, we show that it is not the only cause of the defect. Through mass spectrometric analysis of lipids we find that homeostasis of storage and membrane lipids are altered in InsP<sub>3</sub>R mutants. Possibly as a compensatory mechanism, InsP<sub>3</sub>R mutant adults also feed excessively. Thus, reduced InsP<sub>3</sub>R function alters lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and causes hyperphagia in adults. Together, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic and behavioral changes lead to obesity. Our results implicate altered InsP<sub>3</sub> signaling as a previously unknown causative factor for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic syndrome in humans. Importantly, our studies also suggest preventive dietary interventions.</p>

Darkened Leaves Use Different Metabolic Strategies for Senescence and Survival
<p>In plants, an individually darkened leaf initiates senescence much more rapidly than a leaf from a whole darkened plant. Combining transcriptomic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>omic approaches in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), we present an overview of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic strategies that are employed in response to different darkening treatments. Under darkened plant conditions, the perception of carbon starvation drove a profound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic readjustment in which branched-chain amino acids and potentially monosaccharides released from cell wall loosening became important substrates for maintaining minimal ATP production. Concomitantly, the increased accumulation of amino acids with a high nitrogen-carbon ratio may provide a safety mechanism for the storage of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ically derived cytotoxic ammonium and a pool of nitrogen for use upon returning to typical growth conditions. Conversely, in individually darkened leaf, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic profiling that followed our <sup>13</sup>C-enrichment assays revealed a temporal and differential exchange of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites, including sugars and amino acids, between the darkened leaf and the rest of the plant. This active transport could be the basis for a progressive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic shift in the substrates fueling mitochondrial activities, which are central to the catabolic reactions facilitating the retrieval of nutrients from the senescing leaf. We propose a model illustrating the specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic strategies employed by leaves in response to these two darkening treatments, which support either rapid senescence or a strong capacity for survival.</p>

A Comprehensively Curated Genome-Scale Two-Cell Model for the Heterocystous Cyanobacterium <i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120
<p><i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120 is a nitrogen-fixing filamentous cyanobacterium. Under nitrogen-limiting conditions, a fraction of the vegetative cells in each filament terminally differentiate to nongrowing heterocysts. Heterocysts are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ically and structurally specialized to enable O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive nitrogen fixation. The functionality of the filament, as an association of vegetative cells and heterocysts, is postulated to depend on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic exchange of electrons, carbon, and fixed nitrogen. In this study, we compile and evaluate a comprehensive curated stoichiometric model of this two-cell system, with the objective function based on the growth of the filament under diazotrophic conditions. The predicted growth rate under nitrogen-replete and -deplete conditions, as well as the effect of external carbon and nitrogen sources, was thereafter verified. Furthermore, the model was utilized to comprehensively evaluate the optimality of putative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic exchange reactions between heterocysts and vegetative cells. The model suggested that optimal growth requires at least four exchange <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites. Several combinations of exchange <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites resulted in predicted growth rates that are higher than growth rates achieved by only considering exchange of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites previously suggested in the literature.

Distinct Mechanisms of the ORANGE Protein in Controlling Carotenoid Flux
<p>β-Carotene adds nutritious value and determines the color of many fruits, including melon (<i>Cucumis melo</i>). In melon mesocarp, β-carotene accumulation is governed by the <i>Orange</i> gene (<i>CmOr</i>) golden single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) through a yet to be discovered mechanism. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), OR increases carotenoid levels by posttranscriptionally regulating phytoene synthase (PSY). Here, we identified a <i>CmOr</i> nonsense mutation (<i>Cmor</i>-lowβ) that lowered fruit β-carotene levels with impaired chromoplast biogenesis. <i>Cmor</i>-lowβ exerted a minimal effect on <i>PSY</i> transcripts but dramatically decreased PSY protein levels and enzymatic activity, leading to reduced carotenoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic flux and accumulation. However, the golden SNP was discovered to not affect PSY protein levels and carotenoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic flux in melon fruit, as shown by carotenoid and immunoblot analyses of selected melon genotypes and by using chemical pathway inhibitors. The high β-carotene accumulation in golden SNP melons was found to be due to a reduced further <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism of β-carotene. This was revealed by genetic studies with double mutants including <i>carotenoid isomerase</i> (<i>yofi</i>), a carotenoid-isomerase nonsense mutant, which arrests the turnover of prolycopene.

MerTK signaling in macrophages promotes the synthesis of inflammation resolution mediators by suppressing CaMKII activity
<p>Inflammation resolution counterbalances excessive inflammation and restores tissue homeostasis after injury. Failure of resolution contributes to the pathology of numerous chronic inflammatory diseases. Resolution is mediated by endogenous specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs), which are derived from long-chain fatty acids by lipoxygenase (LOX) enzymes. 5-LOX plays a critical role in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s of two classes of SPMs: lipoxins and resolvins. Cytoplasmic localization of the nonphosphorylated form of 5-LOX is essential for SPM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s, whereas nuclear localization of phosphorylated 5-LOX promotes proinflammatory leukotriene production. We previously showed that MerTK, an efferocytosis receptor on macrophages, promotes SPM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s by increasing the abundance of nonphosphorylated, cytoplasmic 5-LOX. We now show that activation of MerTK in human macrophages led to ERK-mediated expression of the gene encoding sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2 (SERCA2), which decreased the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration and suppressed the activity of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). This, in turn, reduced the activities of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 and the kinase MK2, resulting in the increased abundance of the nonphosphorylated, cytoplasmic form of 5-LOX and enhanced SPM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s. In a zymosan-induced peritonitis model, an inflammatory setting in which macrophage MerTK activation promotes resolution, inhibition of ERK activation delayed resolution, which was characterized by an increased number of neutrophils and decreased amounts of SPMs in tissue exudates. These findings contribute to our understanding of how MerTK signaling induces 5-LOX–derived SPM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s and suggest a therapeutic strategy to boost inflammation resolution in settings where defective resolution promotes disease progression.</p>

A MYB Triad Controls Primary and Phenylpropanoid Metabolites for Pollen Coat Patterning
<p>The pollen wall is a complex, durable structure essential for plant reproduction. A substantial portion of phenylpropanoids (e.g. flavonols) produced by pollen grain tapetal cells are deposited in the pollen wall. Transcriptional regulation of pollen wall formation has been studied extensively, and a specific regulatory mechanism for Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) pollen flavonol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s has been postulated. Here, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ome and transcriptome analyses of anthers from mutant and overexpression genotypes revealed that Arabidopsis MYB99, a putative ortholog of the petunia (<i>Petunia hybrida</i>) floral scent regulator ODORANT1 (ODO1), controls the exclusive production of tapetum diglycosylated flavonols and hydroxycinnamic acid amides. We discovered that MYB99 acts in a regulatory triad with MYB21 and MYB24, orthologs of emission of benzenoids I and II, which together with ODO1 coregulate petunia scent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s genes. Furthermore, promoter-activation assays showed that MYB99 directs precursor supply from the Calvin cycle and oxidative pentose-phosphate pathway in primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism to phenylpropanoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s by controlling <i>TRANSKETOLASE2</i> expression. We provide a model depicting the relationship between the Arabidopsis MYB triad and structural genes from primary and phenylpropanoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and compare this mechanism with petunia scent control. The discovery of orthologous protein triads producing related secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites suggests that analogous regulatory modules exist in other plants and act to regulate various branches of the intricate phenylpropanoid pathway.</p>

Branched-Chain Amino Acid Catabolism Impacts Triacylglycerol Homeostasis in <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>
<p>Nitrogen (N) starvation-induced triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis, and its complex relationship with starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism in algal cells, has been intensively studied; however, few studies have examined the interaction between amino acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and TAG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s. Here, via a forward genetic screen for TAG homeostasis, we isolated a <i>Chlamydomonas</i> (<i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>) mutant (<i>bkdE1α</i>) that is deficient in the E1α subunit of the branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) complex. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>omics analysis revealed a defect in the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids in <i>bkdE1α</i>. Furthermore, this mutant accumulated 30% less TAG than the parental strain during N starvation and was compromised in TAG remobilization upon N resupply. Intriguingly, the rate of mitochondrial respiration was 20% to 35% lower in <i>bkdE1α</i> compared with the parental strains. Three additional knockout mutants of the other components of the BCKDH complex exhibited phenotypes similar to that of <i>bkdE1α</i>. Transcriptional responses of <i>BCKDH</i> to different N status were consistent with its role in TAG homeostasis. Collectively, these results indicate that branched-chain amino acid catabolism contributes to TAG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism by providing carbon precursors and ATP, thus highlighting the complex interplay between distinct subcellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>isms for oil storage in green microalgae.</p>

Ascorbic Acid Integrates the Antagonistic Modulation of Ethylene and Abscisic Acid in the Accumulation of Reactive Oxygen Species
<p>During plant growth and development, ethylene and abscisic acid (ABA) play important roles and exert synergistic or antagonistic effects on various biological processes, but the detailed mechanism underlying the interaction of the two phytohormones, especially in the regulation of the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), is largely unclear. Here, we report that ethylene inhibits but ABA promotes the accumulation of ROS in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings. Furthermore, changes in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s of ascorbic acid (AsA) act as a key factor in integrating the interaction of ethylene and ABA in the regulation of ROS levels. We found that ethylene and ABA antagonistically regulate AsA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s via ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3) and ABA INSENSITIVE4 (ABI4), which are key factors in the ethylene and ABA signaling pathways, respectively. In addition, <i>ABI4</i> is transcriptionally repressed by EIN3 in ethylene-regulated AsA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s. Via transcriptome analysis and molecular and genetic experiments, we identified <i>VITAMIN C DEFECTIVE2</i>as the direct target of ABI4 in the regulation of AsA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s and ROS accumulation. Thus, the EIN3-ABI4- <i>VITAMIN C DEFECTIVE2</i> transcriptional cascade involves a mechanism by which ethylene and ABA antagonistically regulate AsA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s and ROS accumulation in response to complex environmental stimuli.</p>

A Methyltransferase Trio Essential for Phosphatidylcholine Biosynthesis and Growth
<p>Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is a primary class of membrane lipids in most eukaryotes. In plants, the primary PC biosynthetic pathway and its role in plant growth and development remain elusive due to lack of a mutant model with substantially decreased PC content. Recently, a double mutant of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) PHOSPHO-BASE <i>N</i>-METHYLTRANSFERASE 1 (PMT1) and PMT3 was reported with reduced PC content and defective plant growth. However, residual PC content as well as the nonlethal phenotype of the mutant suggests an additional enzyme contributes to PC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s. In this article, we report on the role of three PMTs in PC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s and plant development, with a focus on PMT2. <i>PMT2</i> had the highest expression level among the three PMTs, and it was highly expressed in roots. The <i>pmt1 pmt2</i> double mutant enhanced the defects in root growth, cell viability, and PC content of <i>pmt1</i>, suggesting that PMT2 functions together with PMT1 in roots. Chemical inhibition of PMT activity in wild-type roots reproduced the short root phenotype observed in <i>pmt1 pmt2</i>, suggesting that PMT1 and PMT2 are the major PMT isoforms in roots. In shoots, <i>pmt1 pmt2 pmt3</i> enhanced the phenotype of <i>pmt1 pmt3</i>, showing seedling lethality and further reduced PC content without detectable de novo PC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s. These results suggest that PMTs catalyze an essential reaction step in PC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s and that the three PMTs have differential tissue-specific functions in PC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s and plant growth.</p>

GhCPK33 Negatively Regulates Defense against <i>Verticillium dahliae</i> by Phosphorylating GhOPR3
<p><i>Verticillium</i> wilt, caused by the soil-borne fungus <i>Verticillium dahliae</i>, is a destructive vascular disease in plants. Approximately 200 dicotyledonous plant species in temperate and subtropical regions are susceptible to this notorious pathogen. Previous studies showed that jasmonic acid (JA) plays a crucial role in plant-<i>V. dahliae</i> interactions. <i>V. dahliae</i> infection generally induces significant JA accumulation in local and distal tissues of the plant. Although JA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s and the associated enzymes have been studied intensively, the precise mechanism regulating JA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s upon <i>V. dahliae</i> infection remains unknown. Here, we identified the calcium-dependent protein kinase GhCPK33 from upland cotton (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>) as a negative regulator of resistance to <i>V. dahliae</i> that directly manipulates JA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s. Knockdown of <i>GhCPK33</i> by <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i>-mediated virus-induced gene silencing constitutively activated JA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s and JA-mediated defense responses and enhanced resistance to <i>V</i>. <i>dahliae</i>. Further analysis revealed that GhCPK33 interacts with 12-oxophytodienoate reductase3 (GhOPR3) in peroxisomes. GhCPK33 phosphorylates GhOPR3 at threonine-246, leading to decreased stability of GhOPR3, which consequently limits JA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s. We propose that GhCPK33 is a potential molecular target for improving resistance to <i>Verticillium</i> wilt disease in cotton.</p>

EIN3-LIKE1, MYB1, and ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR3 Act in a Regulatory Loop That Synergistically Modulates Ethylene Biosynthesis and Anthocyanin Accumulation
<p>Ethylene regulates climacteric fruit ripening, and EIN3-LIKE1 (EIL1) plays an important role in this process. In apple (<i>Malus domestica</i>), fruit coloration is accompanied by ethylene release during fruit ripening, but the molecular mechanism that underlies these two physiological processes is unknown. In this study, we found that ethylene treatment markedly induced fruit coloration as well as the expression of <i>MdMYB1</i>, a positive regulator of anthocyanin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s and fruit coloration. In addition, we found that MdEIL1 directly bound to the promoter of <i>MdMYB1</i> and transcriptionally activated its expression, which resulted in anthocyanin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s and fruit coloration. Furthermore, MdMYB1 interacted with the promoter of <i>ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR3</i>, a key regulator of ethylene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s, thereby providing a positive feedback for ethylene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s regulation.

Two Tabersonine 6,7-Epoxidases Initiate Lochnericine-Derived Alkaloid Biosynthesis in <i>Catharanthus roseus</i>
<p>Lochnericine is a major monoterpene indole alkaloid (MIA) in the roots of Madagascar periwinkle (<i>Catharanthus roseus</i>). Lochnericine is derived from the stereoselective C6,C7-epoxidation of tabersonine and can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ized further to generate other complex MIAs. While the enzymes responsible for its downstream modifications have been characterized, those involved in lochnericine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s remain unknown. By combining gene correlation studies, functional assays, and transient gene inactivation, we identified two highly conserved P450s that efficiently catalyze the epoxidation of tabersonine: tabersonine 6,7-epoxidase isoforms 1 and 2 (TEX1 and TEX2). Both proteins are quite divergent from the previously characterized tabersonine 2,3-epoxidase and are more closely related to tabersonine 16-hydroxylase, involved in vindoline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s in leaves. Biochemical characterization of TEX1/2 revealed their strict substrate specificity for tabersonine and their inability to epoxidize 19-hydroxytabersonine, indicating that they catalyze the first step in the pathway leading to horhammericine production. <i>TEX1</i> and <i>TEX2</i> displayed complementary expression profiles, with <i>TEX1</i> expressed mainly in roots and <i>TEX2</i> in aerial organs. Our results suggest that <i>TEX1</i> and <i>TEX2</i> originated from a gene duplication event and later acquired divergent, organ-specific regulatory elements for lochnericine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s throughout the plant, as supported by the presence of lochnericine in flowers. Finally, through the sequential expression of <i>TEX1</i> and up to four other MIA biosynthetic genes in yeast, we reconstituted the 19-acetylhorhammericine biosynthetic pathway and produced tailor-made MIAs by mixing enzymatic modules that are naturally spatially separated in the plant. These results lay the groundwork for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic engineering of tabersonine/lochnericine derivatives of pharmaceutical interest.</p>

Transcription Factor-Mediated Control of Anthocyanin Biosynthesis in Vegetative Tissues
<p>Plants accumulate secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites to adapt to environmental conditions. These compounds, here exemplified by the purple-colored anthocyanins, are accumulated upon high temperatures, UV-light, drought, and nutrient deficiencies, and may contribute to tolerance to these stresses. Producing compounds is often part of a more broad response of the plant to changes in the environment. Here we investigate how a transcription-factor-mediated program for controlling anthocyanin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s also has effects on formation of specialized cell structures and changes in the plant root architecture. A systems biology approach was developed in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) for coordinated induction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s of anthocyanins, in a tissue- and development-independent manner. A transcription factor couple from <i>Antirrhinum</i> that is known to control anthocyanin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s was introduced in tomato under control of a dexamethasone-inducible promoter. By application of dexamethasone, anthocyanin formation was induced within 24 h in vegetative tissues and in undifferentiated cells. Profiles of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites and gene expression were analyzed in several tomato tissues. Changes in concentration of anthocyanins and other phenolic compounds were observed in all tested tissues, accompanied by induction of the biosynthetic pathways leading from Glc to anthocyanins. A number of pathways that are not known to be involved in anthocyanin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s were observed to be regulated. Anthocyanin-producing plants displayed profound physiological and architectural changes, depending on the tissue, including root branching, root epithelial cell morphology, seed germination, and leaf conductance. The inducible anthocyanin-production system reveals a range of phenomena that accompanies anthocyanin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s in tomato, including adaptions of the plants architecture and physiology.</p>

Predicting Dynamic Metabolic Demands in the Photosynthetic Eukaryote <i>Chlorella vulgaris</i>
<p>Phototrophic organisms exhibit a highly dynamic proteome, adapting their biomass composition in response to diurnal light/dark cycles and nutrient availability. Here, we used experimentally determined biomass compositions over the course of growth to determine and constrain the biomass objective function (BOF) in a genome-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic model of <i>Chlorella vulgaris</i> UTEX 395 over time. Changes in the BOF, which encompasses all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites necessary to produce biomass, influence the state of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic network thus directly affecting predictions. Simulations using dynamic BOFs predicted distinct proteome demands during heterotrophic or photoautotrophic growth. Model-driven analysis of extracellular nitrogen concentrations and predicted nitrogen uptake rates revealed an intracellular nitrogen pool, which contains 38% of the total nitrogen provided in the medium for photoautotrophic and 13% for heterotrophic growth. Agreement between flux and gene expression trends was determined by statistical comparison. Accordance between predicted flux trends and gene expression trends was found for 65% of multisubunit enzymes and 75% of allosteric reactions. Reactions with the highest agreement between simulations and experimental data were associated with energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism, terpenoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s, fatty acids, nucleotides, and amino acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism.

Impaired Malate and Fumarate Accumulation Due to the Mutation of the Tonoplast Dicarboxylate Transporter Has Little Effects on Stomatal Behavior
<p>Malate is a central <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ite involved in a multiplicity of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic pathways, being associated with mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and playing significant roles in stomatal movements. Vacuolar malate transport has been characterized at the molecular level and is performed by at least one carrier protein and two channels in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) vacuoles. The absence of the Arabidopsis tonoplast Dicarboxylate Transporter (tDT) in the <i>tdt</i> knockout mutant was associated previously with an impaired accumulation of malate and fumarate in leaves. Here, we investigated the consequences of this lower accumulation on stomatal behavior and photosynthetic capacity as well as its putative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic impacts. Neither the stomatal conductance nor the kinetic responses to dark, light, or high CO<sub>2</sub> were highly affected in <i>tdt</i> plants. In addition, we did not observe any impact on stomatal aperture following incubation with abscisic acid, malate, or citrate. Furthermore, an effect on photosynthetic capacity was not observed in the mutant lines. However, leaf mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism was affected in the <i>tdt</i> plants. Levels of the intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle were altered, and increases in both light and dark respiration were observed. We conclude that manipulation of the tonoplastic organic acid transporter impacted mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism, while the overall stomatal and photosynthetic capacity were unaffected.</p>

The Pseudoenzyme PDX1.2 Sustains Vitamin B<sub>6</sub> Biosynthesis as a Function of Heat Stress<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plants sense temperature changes and respond by altering growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic activity to acclimate to the altered environmental conditions. The B vitamins give rise to vital coenzymes that are indispensable for growth and development but their inherent reactive nature renders them prone to destruction especially under stress conditions. Therefore, plant survival strategies would be expected to include mechanisms to sustain B vitamin supply under demanding circumstances. Here, using the example of vitamin B<sub>6</sub>, we investigate the regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s across eudicot and monocot species under heat stress. Most eudicots carry a pseudoenzyme PDX1.2 that is a noncatalytic homolog of the PDX1 subunit of the vitamin B<sub>6</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s protein machinery, PYRIDOXINE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>S PROTEIN1. Using Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) as models, we show that <i>PDX1</i>.<i>2</i> is transcriptionally regulated by the HSFA1 transcription factor family. Monocots only carry catalytic <i>PDX1</i> homologs that do not respond to heat stress as demonstrated for rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), suggesting fundamental differences in the regulation of vitamin B<sub>6</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s across the two lineages. Investigation of the molecular mechanism of <i>PDX1</i>.<i>2</i> transcription reveals two alternative transcriptional start sites, one of which is exclusive to heat stress. Further data suggest that PDX1.2 leads to stabilization of the catalytic PDX1s under heat stress conditions, which would serve to maintain vitamin B<sub>6</sub> homeostasis in times of need in eudicots that carry this gene. Our analyses indicate an important abiotic stress tolerance strategy in several eudicots, which has not been evolutionarily adapted (or is not required) by monocots such as grasses.</p>

Gametophyte Development Needs Mitochondrial Coproporphyrinogen III Oxidase Function
<p>Tetrapyrrole <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s is one of the most essential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic pathways in almost all organisms. Coproporphyrinogen III oxidase (CPO) catalyzes the conversion of coproporphyrinogen III into protoporphyrinogen IX in this pathway. Here, we report that mutation in the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) CPO-coding gene <i>At5g63290</i> (<i>AtHEMN1</i>) adversely affects silique length, ovule number, and seed set. <i>Athemn1</i> mutant alleles were transmitted via both male and female gametes, but homozygous mutants were never recovered. Plants carrying <i>Athemn1</i> mutant alleles showed defects in gametophyte development, including nonviable pollen and embryo sacs with unfused polar nuclei. Improper differentiation of the central cell led to defects in endosperm development. Consequently, embryo development was arrested at the globular stage. The mutant phenotype was completely rescued by transgenic expression of <i>AtHEMN1</i>. Promoter and transcript analyses indicated that <i>AtHEMN1</i> is expressed mainly in floral tissues and developing seeds. AtHEMN1-green fluorescent protein fusion protein was found targeted to mitochondria. Loss of <i>AtHEMN1</i> function increased coproporphyrinogen III level and reduced protoporphyrinogen IX level, suggesting the impairment of tetrapyrrole <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s. Blockage of tetrapyrrole <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s in the <i>AtHEMN1</i> mutant led to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation in anthers and embryo sacs, as evidenced by nitroblue tetrazolium staining. Our results suggest that the accumulated ROS disrupts mitochondrial function by altering their membrane polarity in floral tissues. This study highlights the role of mitochondrial ROS homeostasis in gametophyte and seed development and sheds new light on tetrapyrrole/heme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s in plant mitochondria.</p>

Dissecting the Metabolic Role of Mitochondria during Developmental Leaf Senescence
<p>The functions of mitochondria during leaf senescence, a type of programmed cell death aimed at the massive retrieval of nutrients from the senescing organ to the rest of the plant, remain elusive. Here, combining experimental and analytical approaches, we showed that mitochondrial integrity in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) is conserved until the latest stages of leaf senescence, while their number drops by 30%. Adenylate phosphorylation state assays and mitochondrial respiratory measurements indicated that the leaf energy status also is maintained during this time period. Furthermore, after establishing a curated list of genes coding for products targeted to mitochondria, we analyzed in isolation their transcript profiles, focusing on several key mitochondrial functions, such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle, mitochondrial electron transfer chain, iron-sulfur cluster <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s, transporters, as well as catabolic pathways. In tandem with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>omic approach, our data indicated that mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism was reorganized to support the selective catabolism of both amino acids and fatty acids. Such adjustments would ensure the replenishment of α-ketoglutarate and glutamate, which provide the carbon backbones for nitrogen remobilization. Glutamate, being the substrate of the strongly up-regulated cytosolic glutamine synthase, is likely to become a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ically limiting factor in the latest stages of developmental leaf senescence. Finally, an evolutionary age analysis revealed that, while branched-chain amino acid and proline catabolism are very old mitochondrial functions particularly enriched at the latest stages of leaf senescence, auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism appears to be rather newly acquired. In summation, our work shows that, during developmental leaf senescence, mitochondria orchestrate catabolic processes by becoming increasingly central energy and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic hubs.</p>

The modulation of phenylpropanoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism clearly distinguished the behavior of genotypes, with stilbene accumulation as the major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic event, although the transient accumulation/depletion of anthocyanins and flavonols was the prevalent variation in genotypes that do not accumulate stilbenes. The modulation of genes related to phenylpropanoid/stilbene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism highlighted the distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>omic plasticity of genotypes, allowing for the identification of candidate structural and regulatory genes. In addition to genotype-specific responses, a core set of genes was consistently modulated in all genotypes, representing the common features of berries undergoing dehydration and/or commencing senescence. This included genes controlling ethylene and auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism as well as genes involved in oxidative and osmotic stress, defense responses, anaerobic respiration, and cell wall and carbohydrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism. Several transcription factors were identified that may control these shared processes in the postharvest berry. Changes representing both common and genotype-specific responses to postharvest conditions shed light on the cellular processes taking place in harvested berries stored under dehydrating conditions for several months.</p>

Increased homeothermy during reproduction in a basal placental mammal
<p>Homeothermic endothermy, the maintenance of a high and stable body temperature (<i>T</i><sub>b</sub>) using heat produced by elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism, is energetically expensive. There is increasing evidence that the earliest endotherms were heterotherms that, rather than maintaining strict homeothermy, allowed <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> to fluctuate with large variations between active and rest-phase <i>T</i><sub>b</sub>. The high level of homeothermy observed in modern mammals is therefore likely to have evolved from an ancestral heterothermic state. One of the hypotheses for the evolution of endothermy is that homeothermy allows for greater energetic output during reproduction (parental care model). We tested this hypothesis by measuring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic rates over a range of ambient temperatures in both reproductive and non-reproductive greater hedgehog tenrecs (<i>Setifer setosus</i>), a physiologically primitive mammal from Madagascar. Tenrecs have some of the lowest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic rates and highest levels of <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> variability of any mammal and are therefore good models of the ancestral eutherian state. During pregnancy and lactation, there was an increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> below the thermoneutral zone, accompanied by a decrease in <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> variability. The lower critical limit of the thermoneutral zone was estimated at ~25°C. However, whereas increases in resting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism were substantial below 20°C (up to 150% higher during reproduction), daytime rest-phase ambient temperatures at the study site rarely reached equivalent low levels. Thus, <i>S. setosus</i> provide an example for how relatively low-cost increases in homeothermy could have led to substantial increases in fitness by allowing for the faster production of young. The mechanisms necessary for increases in thermogenesis during reproduction would have further benefited the development of homeothermy in mammals.</p>

Inhibition of Endothelial Notch Signaling Impairs Fatty Acid Transport and Leads to Metabolic and Vascular Remodeling of the Adult Heart
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Nutrients are transported through endothelial cells before being <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ized in muscle cells. However, little is known about the regulation of endothelial transport processes. Notch signaling is a critical regulator of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and angiogenesis during development. Here, we studied how genetic and pharmacological manipulation of endothelial Notch signaling in adult mice affects endothelial fatty acid transport, cardiac angiogenesis, and heart function.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Endothelial-specific Notch inhibition was achieved by conditional genetic inactivation of Rbp-jκ in adult mice to analyze fatty acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and heart function. Wild-type mice were treated with neutralizing antibodies against the Notch ligand Delta-like 4. Fatty acid transport was studied in cultured endothelial cells and transgenic mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Treatment of wild-type mice with Delta-like 4 neutralizing antibodies for 8 weeks impaired fractional shortening and ejection fraction in the majority of mice. Inhibition of Notch signaling specifically in the endothelium of adult mice by genetic ablation of Rbp-jκ caused heart hypertrophy and failure. Impaired heart function was preceded by alterations in fatty acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and an increase in cardiac blood vessel density. Endothelial Notch signaling controlled the expression of endothelial lipase, Angptl4, CD36, and Fabp4, which are all needed for fatty acid transport across the vessel wall. In endothelial-specific Rbp-jκ–mutant mice, lipase activity and transendothelial transport of long-chain fatty acids to muscle cells were impaired. In turn, lipids accumulated in the plasma and liver. The attenuated supply of cardiomyocytes with long-chain fatty acids was accompanied by higher glucose uptake, increased concentration of glycolysis intermediates, and mTOR-S6K signaling. Treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin or displacing glucose as cardiac substrate by feeding a ketogenic diet prolonged the survival of endothelial-specific Rbp-jκ–deficient mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This study identifies Notch signaling as a novel regulator of fatty acid transport across the endothelium and as an essential repressor of angiogenesis in the adult heart. The data imply that the endothelium controls cardiomyocyte <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and function.</p></sec>

MicroRNA-146a was either genetically or pharmacologically knocked out or genetically overexpressed in cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, overexpression of dihydrolipoyl succinyltransferase (DLST) in the murine heart was performed by means of an adeno-associated virus.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>MicroRNA-146a was upregulated in whole heart tissue in multiple murine pressure overload models. Also, microRNA-146a levels were moderately increased in left ventricular biopsies of patients with aortic stenosis. Overexpression of microRNA-146a in cardiomyocytes provoked cardiac hypertrophy and left ventricular dysfunction in vivo, whereas genetic knockdown or pharmacological blockade of microRNA-146a blunted the hypertrophic response and attenuated cardiac dysfunction in vivo. Mechanistically, microRNA-146a reduced its target DLST—the E2 subcomponent of the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, a rate-controlling tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme. DLST protein levels significantly decreased on pressure overload in wild-type mice, paralleling a decreased oxidative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism, whereas DLST protein levels and hence oxidative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism were partially maintained in microRNA-146a knockout mice.

Transcriptome Analysis Identifies a Zinc Finger Protein Regulating Starch Degradation in Kiwifruit
<p>Ripening, including softening, is a critical factor in determining the postharvest shelf-life of fruit and is controlled by enzymes involved in cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism, starch degradation, and hormone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism. Here, we used a transcriptomics-based approach to identify transcriptional regulatory components associated with texture, ethylene, and starch degradation in ripening kiwifruit (<i>Actinidia deliciosa</i>). Twelve differentially expressed structural genes, including seven involved in cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism, four in ethylene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s, and one in starch degradation, and 14 transcription factors (TFs) induced by exogenous ethylene treatment and inhibited by the ethylene signaling inhibitor 1-methylcyclopropene were identified as changing in transcript levels during ripening. Moreover, analysis of the regulatory effects of differentially expressed genes identified a zinc finger TF, DNA BINDING WITH ONE FINGER (AdDof3), which showed significant transactivation on the <i>AdBAM3L</i> (β-amylase) promoter. AdDof3 interacted physically with the <i>AdBAM3L</i> promoter, and stable overexpression of <i>AdBAM3L</i> resulted in lower starch content in transgenic kiwifruit leaves, suggesting that <i>AdBAM3L</i> is a key gene for starch degradation. Moreover, transient overexpression analysis showed that AdDof3 up-regulated <i>AdBAM3L</i> expression in kiwifruit. Thus, transcriptomics analysis not only allowed the prediction of some ripening-regulating genes but also facilitated the characterization of a TF, AdDof3, and a key structural gene, <i>AdBAM3L</i>, in starch degradation.</p>

Starch Deficiency Enhances Lipid Biosynthesis and Turnover in Leaves
<p>Starch and lipids represent two major forms of carbon and energy storage in plants and play central roles in diverse cellular processes. However, whether and how starch and lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic pathways interact to regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and growth are poorly understood. Here, we show that lipids can partially compensate for the lack of function of transient starch during normal growth and development in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Disruption of starch synthesis resulted in a significant increase in fatty acid synthesis via posttranslational regulation of the plastidic acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase and a concurrent increase in the synthesis and turnover of membrane lipids and triacylglycerol. Genetic analysis showed that blocking fatty acid peroxisomal β-oxidation, the sole pathway for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic breakdown of fatty acids in plants, significantly compromised or stunted the growth and development of mutants defective in starch synthesis under long days or short days, respectively. We also found that the combined disruption of starch synthesis and fatty acid turnover resulted in increased accumulation of membrane lipids, triacylglycerol, and soluble sugars and altered fatty acid flux between the two lipid biosynthetic pathways compartmentalized in either the chloroplast or the endoplasmic reticulum. Collectively, our findings provide insight into the role of fatty acid β-oxidation and the regulatory network controlling fatty acid synthesis, and they reveal the mechanistic basis by which starch and lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic pathways interact and undergo cross talk to modulate carbon allocation, energy homeostasis, and plant growth.</p>

The Ancient Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase Signaling System Is a Master Regulator of Energy and Carbon Metabolism in Algae
<p>Algae undergo a complete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic transformation under stress by arresting cell growth, inducing autophagy and hyper-accumulating biofuel precursors such as triacylglycerols and starch. However, the regulatory mechanisms behind this stress-induced transformation are still unclear. Here, we use biochemical, mutational, and “omics” approaches to demonstrate that PI3K signaling mediates the homeostasis of energy molecules and influences carbon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism in algae. In <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, the inhibition and knockdown (KD) of algal class III PI3K led to significantly decreased cell growth, altered cell morphology, and higher lipid and starch contents. Lipid profiling of wild-type and PI3K KD lines showed significantly reduced membrane lipid breakdown under nitrogen starvation (−N) in the KD. RNA-seq and network analyses showed that under −N conditions, the KD line carried out lipogenesis rather than lipid hydrolysis by initiating de novo fatty acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s, which was supported by tricarboxylic acid cycle down-regulation and via acetyl-CoA synthesis from glycolysis. Remarkably, autophagic responses did not have primacy over inositide signaling in algae, unlike in mammals and vascular plants. The mutant displayed a fundamental shift in intracellular energy flux, analogous to that in tumor cells. The high free fatty acid levels and reduced mitochondrial ATP generation led to decreased cell viability. These results indicate that the PI3K signal transduction pathway is the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic gatekeeper restraining biofuel yields, thus maintaining fitness and viability under stress in algae. This study demonstrates the existence of homeostasis between starch and lipid synthesis controlled by lipid signaling in algae and expands our understanding of such processes, with biotechnological and evolutionary implications.</p>

The Extra-Pathway Interactome of the TCA Cycle: Expected and Unexpected Metabolic Interactions
<p>The plant tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle provides essential precursors for respiration, amino acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s, and general nitrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism; moreover, it is closely involved in biotic stress responses and cellular redox homeostasis. To further understand the in vivo function of the TCA cycle enzymes, we combined affinity purification with proteomics to generate a comprehensive extra-pathway protein-protein interaction network of the plant TCA cycle. We identified 125 extra-pathway interactions in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mostly related to the mitochondrial electron transport complex/ATP synthesis and amino acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism but also to proteins associated with redox stress. We chose three high-scoring and two low-scoring interactions for complementary bimolecular fluorescence complementation and yeast two-hybrid assays, which highlighted the reliability of our approach, supported the intimate involvement of TCA cycle enzymes within many biological processes, and reflected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic changes reported previously for the corresponding mutant lines. To analyze the function of a subset of these interactions, we selected two mutants of mitochondrial glutaredoxin S15 and Amidase, which have not yet been analyzed with respect to their TCA cycle function, and performed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ite profiling and flux analysis. Consistent with their interactions identified in this study, TCA cycle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites and the relative TCA flux of the two mutants were altered significantly.</p>

A Specific Glycogen Mobilization Strategy Enables Rapid Awakening of Dormant Cyanobacteria from Chlorosis
<p>Many organisms survive stressful conditions via entry into a dormant state that can be rapidly exited when the stressor disappears; this ability provides a strong selective advantage. In the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803, the exit from nitrogen chlorosis takes less than 48 h and is enabled by the impressive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic flexibility of these cyanobacteria, which pass through heterotrophic and mixotrophic phases before reentering photoautotrophic growth. Switching between these states requires delicate coordination of carbohydrate oxidation, CO<sub>2</sub> fixation, and photosynthesis. Here, we investigated the contribution of the different carbon catabolic routes by assessing mutants of these pathways during nitrogen chlorosis and resuscitation. The addition of nitrate to nitrogen-starved cells rapidly starts the awakening program. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism switches from maintenance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism, characterized by residual photosynthesis and low cellular ATP levels, to an initial heterotrophic phase, characterized by respiration and an immediate increase in ATP levels. This respiration relies on glycogen breakdown catalyzed by the glycogen phosphorylase GlgP2. In the following transient mixotrophic phase, photosynthesis and CO<sub>2</sub> fixation restart and glycogen is consumed. During the mixotrophic phase, parallel operation of the oxidative pentose phosphate cycle and the Entner-Doudoroff pathway is required for resuscitation to proceed; the glycolytic route via the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway has minor importance. Our data suggest that, during resuscitation, only the Entner-Doudoroff and oxidative pentose phosphate pathways supply the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic intermediates necessary for the anabolic reactions required to reconstitute a vegetative cell. Intriguingly, the key enzymes for glycogen catabolism are already expressed during the preceding chlorotic phase, in apparent preparation for rapid resuscitation.</p>

Reduced Arogenate Dehydratase Expression: Ramifications for Photosynthesis and Metabolism
<p>Arogenate dehydratase (ADT) catalyzes the final step of phenylalanine (Phe) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s. Previous work showed that ADT-deficient Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants had significantly reduced lignin contents, with stronger reductions in lines that had deficiencies in more ADT isoforms. Here, by analyzing Arabidopsis <i>ADT</i> mutants using our phenomics facility and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>omics, we describe the effects of the modulation of ADT on photosynthetic parameters and secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism. Our data indicate that a reduced carbon flux into Phe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s in <i>ADT</i> mutants impairs the consumption of photosynthetically produced ATP, leading to an increased ATP/ADP ratio, the overaccumulation of transitory starch, and lower electron transport rates. The effect on electron transport rates is caused by an increase in proton motive force across the thylakoid membrane that down-regulates photosystem II activity by the high-energy quenching mechanism. Furthermore, quantitation of secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites in <i>ADT</i> mutants revealed reduced flavonoid, phenylpropanoid, lignan, and glucosinolate contents, including glucosinolates that are not derived from aromatic amino acids, and significantly increased contents of putative galactolipids and apocarotenoids. Additionally, we used real-time atmospheric monitoring mass spectrometry to compare respiration and carbon fixation rates between the wild type and <i>adt3/4/5/6</i>, our most extreme <i>ADT</i> knockout mutant, which revealed no significant difference in both night- and day-adapted plants. Overall, these data reveal the profound effects of altered ADT activity and Phe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism on secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites and photosynthesis with implications for plant improvement.</p>

Trehalose 6-Phosphate Regulates Photosynthesis and Assimilate Partitioning in Reproductive Tissue<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Transgenic maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) that expresses rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) <i>TREHALOSE PHOSPHATE PHOSPHATASE1</i> (<i>TPP1</i>) from the rice <i>MADS6</i> promoter, which is active over the flowering period, produces higher yields than wild type. This yield increase occurs with or without drought conditions during flowering. To understand the mechanistic basis of the increased yield, we characterized gene expression and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ite profiles in leaves and developing female reproductive tissue, comprising florets, node, pith, and shank, over the flowering period with and without drought. The <i>MADS6</i> promoter was most active in the vasculature, particularly phloem companion cells in florets and pith, consistent with the largest decreases in trehalose 6-phosphate (T6P) levels (2- to 3-fold) being found in pith and florets. Low T6P led to decreased gene expression for primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and increased gene expression for secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism, particularly lipid-related pathways. Despite similar changes in gene expression, the pith and floret displayed opposing assimilate profiles: sugars, sugar phosphates, amino acids, and lipids increased in florets, but decreased in pith. Possibly explaining this assimilate distribution, seven <i>SWEET</i> genes were found to be up-regulated in the transgenic plants. SnRK1 activity and the expression of the gene for the SnRK1 beta subunit, expression of SnRK1 marker genes, and endogenous trehalose pathway genes were also altered. Furthermore, leaves of the transgenic maize maintained a higher photosynthetic rate for a longer period compared to wild type. In conclusion, we found that decreasing T6P in reproductive tissues down-regulates primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and up-regulates secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism, resulting in different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ite profiles in component tissues. Our data implicate T6P/ SnRK1 as a major regulator of whole-plant resource allocation for crop yield improvement.</p>

Thioredoxin and NADPH-Dependent Thioredoxin Reductase C Regulation of Tetrapyrrole Biosynthesis
<p>In chloroplasts, thioredoxin (TRX) isoforms and NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase C (NTRC) act as redox regulatory factors involved in multiple plastid biogenesis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic processes. To date, less is known about the functional coordination between TRXs and NTRC in chlorophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s. In this study, we aimed to explore the potential functions of TRX m and NTRC in the regulation of the tetrapyrrole <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s (TBS) pathway. Silencing of three genes, <i>TRX m1</i>, <i>TRX m2</i>, and <i>TRX m4</i> (<i>TRX ms</i>), led to pale-green leaves, a significantly reduced 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA)-synthesizing capacity, and reduced accumulation of chlorophyll and its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic intermediates in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The contents of ALA dehydratase, protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase, the I subunit of Mg-chelatase, Mg-protoporphyrin IX methyltransferase (CHLM), and NADPH-protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase were decreased in triple <i>TRX m-</i>silenced seedlings compared with the wild type, although the transcript levels of the corresponding genes were not altered significantly. Protein-protein interaction analyses revealed a physical interaction between the TRX m isoforms and CHLM. 4-Acetoamido-4-maleimidylstilbene-2,2-disulfonate labeling showed the regulatory impact of TRX ms on the CHLM redox status. Since CHLM also is regulated by NTRC (Richter et al., 2013), we assessed the concurrent functions of TRX m and NTRC in the control of CHLM. Combined deficiencies of three TRX m isoforms and NTRC led to a cumulative decrease in leaf pigmentation, TBS intermediate contents, ALA synthesis rate, and CHLM activity. We discuss the coordinated roles of TRX m and NTRC in the redox control of CHLM stability with its corollary activity in the TBS pathway.</p>

Phospholipid:Diacylglycerol Acyltransferase-Mediated Triacylglyerol Synthesis Augments Basal Thermotolerance
<p>High temperatures rapidly induce a genetically programmed heat-shock response (HSR) that is essential to establish short-term acquired thermotolerance. In addition, an immediate HSR-independent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic response is triggered, resulting in an accumulation of unsaturated triacylglycerols (TAGs) in the cytosol. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic processes involved in heat-induced TAG formation in plants and their physiological significance remain to be clarified. Lipidomic analyses of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings indicated that during heat stress, polyunsaturated fatty acids from thylakoid galactolipids are incorporated into cytosolic TAGs. In addition, rapid conversion of plastidic monogalactosyl diacylglycerols (MGDGs) into oligogalactolipids, acylated MGDGs, and diacylglycerols (DAGs), the direct precursor of TAGs, was observed. For TAG synthesis, DAG requires a fatty acid from the acyl-CoA pool or phosphatidylcholine. Since seedlings deficient in PHOSPHOLIPID:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1 (PDAT1) were unable to accumulate TAGs after heat stress, phosphatidylcholine appears to be the major fatty acid donor. Results suggest that rapid plastid lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism drives TAG accumulation during heat stress. PDAT1-mediated TAG accumulation was found to increase heat resistance, since nonacclimated <i>pdat1</i> mutant seedlings were more sensitive to severe heat stress, as indicated by a more dramatic decline of the maximum efficiency of PSII and lower seedling survival compared to wild-type seedlings. In contrast, nonacclimated <i>trigalactosyldiacylglycerol1</i> (<i>tgd1</i>) mutants overaccumulating TAGs and oligogalactolipids were more resistant to heat stress. Hence, thylakoid lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism and TAG formation increases thermotolerance in addition to the genetically encoded HSR.</p>

Cytokinin Biosynthesis Promotes Cortical Cell Responses during Nodule Development
<p>Legume mutants have shown the requirement for receptor-mediated cytokinin signaling in symbiotic nodule organogenesis. While the receptors are central regulators, cytokinin also is accumulated during early phases of symbiotic interaction, but the pathways involved have not yet been fully resolved. To identify the source, timing, and effect of this accumulation, we followed transcript levels of the cytokinin biosynthetic pathway genes in a sliding developmental zone of <i>Lotus japonicus</i> roots. <i>LjIpt2</i> and <i>LjLog4</i> were identified as the major contributors to the first cytokinin burst. The genetic dependence and Nod factor responsiveness of these genes confirm that cytokinin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s is a key target of the common symbiosis pathway. The accumulation of <i>LjIpt2</i> and <i>LjLog4</i> transcripts occurs independent of the <i>LjLhk1</i> receptor during nodulation. Together with the rapid repression of both genes by cytokinin, this indicates that <i>LjIpt2</i> and <i>LjLog4</i> contribute to, rather than respond to, the initial cytokinin buildup. Analysis of the cytokinin response using the synthetic cytokinin sensor, <i>TCSn</i>, showed that this response occurs in cortical cells before spreading to the epidermis in <i>L. japonicus</i>. While mutant analysis identified redundancy in several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s families, we found that mutation of <i>LjIpt4</i> limits nodule numbers. Overexpression of <i>LjIpt3</i> or <i>LjLog4</i> alone was insufficient to produce the robust formation of spontaneous nodules. In contrast, overexpressing a complete cytokinin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s pathway leads to large, often fused spontaneous nodules. These results show the importance of cytokinin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s in initiating and balancing the requirement for cortical cell activation without uncontrolled cell proliferation.</p>

3-Hydroxyisobutyrate Dehydrogenase Is Involved in Both, Valine and Isoleucine Degradation in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>In plants, amino acid catabolism is especially relevant in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic stress situations (e.g. limited carbohydrate availability during extended darkness). Under these conditions, amino acids are used as alternative substrates for respiration. Complete oxidation of the branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) leucine, isoleucine (Ile), and valine (Val) in the mitochondria efficiently allows the formation of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. However, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic pathways for BCAA breakdown are largely unknown so far in plants. A systematic search for Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) genes encoding proteins resembling enzymes involved in BCAA catabolism in animals, fungi, and bacteria as well as proteomic analyses of mitochondrial fractions from Arabidopsis allowed the identification of a putative 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase, AtHDH1 (At4g20930), involved in Val degradation. Systematic substrate screening analyses revealed that the protein uses 3-hydroxyisobutyrate but additionally 3-hydroxypropionate as substrates. This points to a role of the enzyme not only in Val but possibly also in Ile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism. At4g20930 knockdown plants were characterized to test this conclusion. Root toxicity assays revealed increased root growth inhibition of the mutants if cultivated in the presence of Val or Ile but not in the presence of leucine. We conclude that AtHDH1 has a dual role in BCAA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism in plants.</p>

Autophagy Deficiency Compromises Alternative Pathways of Respiration following Energy Deprivation in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>Under heterotrophic conditions, carbohydrate oxidation inside the mitochondrion is the primary energy source for cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism. However, during energy-limited conditions, alternative substrates are required to support respiration. Amino acid oxidation in plant cells plays a key role in this by generating electrons that can be transferred to the mitochondrial electron transport chain via the electron transfer flavoprotein/ubiquinone oxidoreductase system. Autophagy, a catabolic mechanism for macromolecule and protein recycling, allows the maintenance of amino acid pools and nutrient remobilization. Although the association between autophagy and alternative respiratory substrates has been suggested, the extent to which autophagy and primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism interact to support plant respiration remains unclear. To investigate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic importance of autophagy during development and under extended darkness, Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants with disruption of autophagy (<i>atg</i> mutants) were used. Under normal growth conditions, <i>atg</i> mutants showed lower growth and seed production with no impact on photosynthesis. Following extended darkness, <i>atg</i> mutants were characterized by signatures of early senescence, including decreased chlorophyll content and maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II coupled with increases in dark respiration. Transcript levels of genes involved in alternative pathways of respiration and amino acid catabolism were up-regulated in <i>atg</i> mutants. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ite profiles of dark-treated leaves revealed an extensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic reprogramming in which increases in amino acid levels were partially compromised in <i>atg</i> mutants. Although an enhanced respiration in <i>atg</i> mutants was observed during extended darkness, autophagy deficiency compromises protein degradation and the generation of amino acids used as alternative substrates to the respiration.</p>

Enhanced Secondary- and Hormone Metabolism in Leaves of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal <i>Medicago truncatula</i>
<p>Arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM) are the most common symbiotic associations between a plant’s root compartment and fungi. They provide nutritional benefit (mostly inorganic phosphate [P<sub>i</sub>]), leading to improved growth, and nonnutritional benefits, including defense responses to environmental cues throughout the host plant, which, in return, delivers carbohydrates to the symbiont. However, how transcriptional and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic changes occurring in leaves of AM plants differ from those induced by P<sub>i</sub> fertilization is poorly understood. We investigated systemic changes in the leaves of mycorrhized <i>Medicago truncatula</i> in conditions with no improved P<sub>i</sub> status and compared them with those induced by high-P<sub>i</sub> treatment in nonmycorrhized plants. Microarray-based genome-wide profiling indicated up-regulation by mycorrhization of genes involved in flavonoid, terpenoid, jasmonic acid (JA), and abscisic acid (ABA) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s as well as enhanced expression of <i>MYC2</i>, the master regulator of JA-dependent responses. Accordingly, total anthocyanins and flavonoids increased, and most flavonoid species were enriched in AM leaves. Both the AM and P<sub>i</sub> treatments corepressed iron homeostasis genes, resulting in lower levels of available iron in leaves. In addition, higher levels of cytokinins were found in leaves of AM- and P<sub>i</sub>-treated plants, whereas the level of ABA was increased specifically in AM leaves. Foliar treatment of nonmycorrhized plants with either ABA or JA induced the up-regulation of <i>MYC2</i>, but only JA also induced the up-regulation of flavonoid and terpenoid biosynthetic genes. Based on these results, we propose that mycorrhization and P<sub>i</sub> fertilization share cytokinin-mediated improved shoot growth, whereas enhanced ABA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s and JA-regulated flavonoid and terpenoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s in leaves are specific to mycorrhization.</p>

Two Glycerol-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases from <i>Chlamydomonas</i> Have Distinct Roles in Lipid Metabolism
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism of glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) is important for environmental stress responses by eukaryotic microalgae. G3P is an essential precursor for glycerolipid synthesis and the accumulation of triacylglycerol (TAG) in response to nutrient starvation. G3P dehydrogenase (GPDH) mediates G3P synthesis, but the roles of specific GPDH isoforms are currently poorly understood. Of the five GPDH enzymes in the model alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, <i>GPD2</i> and <i>GPD3</i> were shown to be induced by nutrient starvation and/or salt stress. Heterologous expression of GPD2, a putative chloroplastic GPDH, and GPD3, a putative cytosolic GPDH, in a yeast <i>gpd1</i>Δ mutant demonstrated the functionality of both enzymes. <i>C. reinhardtii</i> knockdown mutants for <i>GPD2</i> and <i>GPD3</i> showed no difference in growth but displayed significant reduction in TAG concentration compared with the wild type in response to phosphorus or nitrogen starvation. Overexpression of <i>GPD2</i> and <i>GPD3</i> in <i>C. reinhardtii</i> gave distinct phenotypes. <i>GPD2</i> overexpression lines showed only subtle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic phenotypes and no significant alteration in growth. In contrast, <i>GPD3</i> overexpression lines displayed significantly inhibited growth and chlorophyll concentration, reduced glycerol concentration, and changes to lipid composition compared with the wild type, including increased abundance of phosphatidic acids but reduced abundance of diglycerides, triglycerides, and phosphatidylglycerol lipids. This may indicate a block in the downstream glycerolipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism pathway in <i>GPD3</i> overexpression lines. Thus, lipid engineering by GPDH modification may depend on the activities of other downstream enzyme steps. These results also suggest that GPD2 and GPD3 GPDH isoforms are important for nutrient starvation-induced TAG accumulation but have distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic functions.</p>

Monogalactosyldiacylglycerol Facilitates Synthesis of Photoactive Protochlorophyllide in Etioplasts
<p>Cotyledon cells of dark-germinated angiosperms develop etioplasts that are plastids containing unique internal membranes called prolamellar bodies (PLBs). Protochlorophyllide (Pchlide), a precursor of chlorophyll, accumulates in PLBs and forms a ternary complex with NADPH and light-dependent NADPH:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (LPOR), which allows for the rapid formation of chlorophyll after illumination while avoiding photodamage. PLBs are 3D lattice structures formed by the lipid bilayer rich in monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG). Although MGDG was found to be required for the formation and function of the thylakoid membrane in chloroplasts in various plants, the roles of MGDG in PLB formation and etioplast development are largely unknown. To analyze the roles of MGDG in etioplast development, we suppressed <i>MGD1</i> encoding the major isoform of MGDG synthase by using a dexamethasone-inducible artificial microRNA in etiolated Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings. Strong <i>MGD1</i> suppression caused a 36% loss of MGDG in etiolated seedlings, together with a 41% decrease in total Pchlide content. The loss of MGDG perturbed etioplast membrane structures and impaired the formation of the photoactive Pchlide-LPOR-NADPH complex and its oligomerization, without affecting LPOR accumulation. The <i>MGD1</i> suppression also impaired the formation of Pchlide from protoporphyrin IX via multiple enzymatic reactions in etioplast membranes, which suggests that MGDG is required for the membrane-associated processes in the Pchlide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s pathway. Suppressing <i>MGD1</i> at several germination stages revealed that MGDG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s at an early germination stage is particularly important for Pchlide accumulation. MGDG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s may provide a lipid matrix for Pchlide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biosynthesi</span></strong>s and the formation of Pchlide-LPOR complexes as an initial step of etioplast development.</p>

Repression of CYSTATHIONINE <i>γ</i>-SYNTHASE in Seeds Recruits the <i>S</i>-Methylmethionine Cycle
<p><i>S</i>-Methylmethionine (SMM) was suggested previously to participate in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism of methionine (Met) in seeds. To further reveal its roles, we had previously produced transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) RNA interference (RNAi) seeds with lower transcript expression of CYSTATHIONINE γ-SYNTHASE (<i>AtCGS</i>), Met’s main regulatory enzyme. Unexpectedly, these seeds accumulated significantly higher levels of Met compared with control seeds through an as yet unknown mechanism. Here, transcript and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic analyses coupled with isotope-labeled [<sup>13</sup>C]SMM and [<sup>13</sup>C]Met feeding experiments enabled us to reveal that SMM that was synthesized in rosette leaves of RNAi plants significantly contributed to the accumulation of Met in their seeds at late stages of development. Seed-specific repression of <i>AtCGS</i> in RNAi seeds triggered the induction of genes operating in the SMM cycle of rosette leaves, leading to elevated transport of SMM toward the seeds, where higher reconversion rates of SMM to Met were detected. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic rearrangements in RNAi seeds resulted in an altered sulfur-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism, such as lower amounts of Cys and glutathione, as well as a differential composition of glucosinolates. Together, the data propose a novel cross talk existing between seeds and rosette leaves along with mutual effects between the Asp family and SMM pathways operating in these tissues. They also shed light on the effects of higher Met levels on seed physiology and behavior.</p>

ChloroKB: A Web Application for the Integration of Knowledge Related to Chloroplast Metabolic Network
<p>Higher plants, as autotrophic organisms, are effective sources of molecules. They hold great promise for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic engineering, but the behavior of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ism at the network level is still incompletely described. Although structural models (stoichiometry matrices) and pathway databases are extremely useful, they cannot describe the complexity of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic context, and new tools are required to visually represent integrated biocurated knowledge for use by both humans and computers. Here, we describe ChloroKB, a Web application (<ext-link>http://chlorokb.fr/</ext-link>) for visual exploration and analysis of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ic network in the chloroplast and related cellular pathways. The network was manually reconstructed through extensive biocuration to provide transparent traceability of experimental data. Proteins and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metabol</span></strong>ites were placed in their biological context (spatial distribution within cells, connectivity in the network, participation in supramolecular complexes, and regulatory interactions) using CellDesigner software. The network contains 1,147 reviewed proteins (559 localized exclusively in plastids, 68 in at least one additional compartment, and 520 outside the plastid), 122 proteins awaiting biochemical/genetic characterization, and 228 proteins for which genes have not yet been identified. The visual presentation is intuitive and browsing is fluid, providing instant access to the graphical representation of integrated processes and to a wealth of refined qualitative and quantitative data. ChloroKB will be a significant support for structural and quantitative kinetic modeling, for biological reasoning, when comparing novel data with established knowledge, for computer analyses, and for educational purposes. ChloroKB will be enhanced by continuous updates following contributions from plant researchers.</p>

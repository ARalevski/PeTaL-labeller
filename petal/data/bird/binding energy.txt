Mapping the stochastic sequence of individual ligand-receptor binding events to cellular activation: T cells act on the rare events
<p>T cell receptor (TCR) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing to agonist peptide major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) triggers signaling events that initiate T cell responses. This system is remarkably sensitive, requiring only a few <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing events to successfully activate a cellular response. On average, activating pMHC ligands exhibit mean dwell times of at least a few seconds when bound to the TCR. However, a T cell accumulates pMHC-TCR interactions as a stochastic series of discrete, single-molecule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing events whose individual dwell times are broadly distributed. With activation occurring in response to only a handful of such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing events, individual cells are unlikely to experience the average <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing time. Here, we mapped the ensemble of pMHC-TCR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing events in space and time while simultaneously monitoring cellular activation. Our findings revealed that T cell activation hinges on rare, long–dwell time <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing events that are an order of magnitude longer than the average agonist pMHC-TCR dwell time. Furthermore, we observed that short pMHC-TCR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing events that were spatially correlated and temporally sequential led to cellular activation. These observations indicate that T cell antigen discrimination likely occurs by sensing the tail end of the pMHC-TCR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing dwell time distribution rather than its average properties.</p>

The Target of β-Expansin EXPB1 in Maize Cell Walls from Binding and Solid-State NMR Studies<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The wall-loosening actions of β-expansins are known primarily from studies of EXPB1 extracted from maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) pollen. EXPB1 selectively loosens cell walls (CWs) of grasses, but its specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing target is unknown. We characterized EXPB1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing to sequentially extracted maize CWs, finding that the protein primarily <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s glucuronoarabinoxylan (GAX), the major matrix polysaccharide in grass CWs. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing is strongly reduced by salts, indicating that it is predominantly electrostatic in nature. For direct molecular evidence of EXPB1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing, we conducted solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance experiments using paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE), which is sensitive to distances between unpaired electrons and nuclei. By mixing <sup>13</sup>C-enriched maize CWs with EXPB1 functionalized with a Mn<sup>2+</sup> tag, we measured Mn<sup>2+</sup>-induced PRE. Strong <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C PREs were observed for the carboxyls of GAX, followed by more moderate PREs for carboxyl groups in homogalacturonan and rhamnogalacturonan-I, indicating that EXPB1 preferentially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s GAX. In contrast, no PRE was observed for cellulose, indicating very weak interaction of EXPB1 with cellulose. Dynamics experiments show that EXPB1 changes GAX mobility in a complex manner: the rigid fraction of GAX became more rigid upon EXPB1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing while the dynamic fraction became more mobile. Combining these data with previous results, we propose that EXPB1 loosens grass CWs by disrupting noncovalent junctions between highly substituted GAX and GAX of low substitution, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s cellulose. This study provides molecular evidence of β-expansin’s target in grass CWs and demonstrates a new strategy for investigating ligand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing for proteins that are difficult to express heterologously.</p>

Harvesting electrical energy from carbon nanotube yarn twist
<p>Mechanical energy harvesters are needed for diverse applications, including self-powered wireless sensors, structural and human health monitoring systems, and the extraction of energy from ocean waves. We report carbon nanotube yarn harvesters that electrochemically convert tensile or torsional mechanical energy into electrical energy without requiring an external bias voltage. Stretching coiled yarns generated 250 watts per kilogram of peak electrical power when cycled up to 30 hertz, as well as up to 41.2 joules per kilogram of electrical energy per mechanical cycle, when normalized to harvester yarn weight. These energy harvesters were used in the ocean to harvest wave energy, combined with thermally driven artificial muscles to convert temperature fluctuations to electrical energy, sewn into textiles for use as self-powered respiration sensors, and used to power a light-emitting diode and to charge a storage capacitor.</p>

VAMP721 Conformations Unmask an Extended Motif for K<sup>+</sup> Channel Binding and Gating Control
<p>Soluble <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins play a major role in membrane fusion and contribute to cell expansion, signaling, and polar growth in plants. The SNARE SYP121 of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> that facilitates vesicle fusion at the plasma membrane also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s with, and regulates, K<sup>+</sup> channels already present at the plasma membrane to affect K<sup>+</sup> uptake and K<sup>+</sup>-dependent growth. Here, we report that its cognate partner VAMP721, which assembles with SYP121 to drive membrane fusion, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s to the KAT1 K<sup>+</sup> channel via two sites on the protein, only one of which contributes to channel-gating control. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing to the VAMP721 SNARE domain suppressed channel gating. By contrast, interaction with the amino-terminal longin domain conferred specificity on VAMP721 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing without influencing gating. Channel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing was defined by a linear motif within the longin domain. The SNARE domain is thought to wrap around this structure when not assembled with SYP121 in the SNARE complex. Fluorescence lifetime analysis showed that mutations within this motif, which suppressed channel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing and its effects on gating, also altered the conformational displacement between the VAMP721 SNARE and longin domains. The presence of these two channel-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing sites on VAMP721, one also required for SNARE complex assembly, implies a well-defined sequence of events coordinating K<sup>+</sup> uptake and the final stages of vesicle traffic. It suggests that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing begins with VAMP721, and subsequently with SYP121, thereby coordinating K<sup>+</sup> channel gating during SNARE assembly and vesicle fusion. Thus, our findings also are consistent with the idea that the K<sup>+</sup> channels are nucleation points for SNARE complex assembly.</p>

Converging Light, Energy and Hormonal Signaling Control Meristem Activity, Leaf Initiation, and Growth<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>The development of leaf primordia is subject to light control of meristematic activity. Light regulates the expression of thousands of genes with roles in cell proliferation, organ development, and differentiation of photosynthetic cells. Previous work has highlighted roles for hormone homeostasis and the energy-dependent Target of Rapamycin (TOR) kinase in meristematic activity, yet a picture of how these two regulatory mechanisms depend on light perception and interact with each other has yet to emerge. Their relevance beyond leaf initiation also is unclear. Here, we report the discovery that the dark-arrested meristematic region of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) experiences a local energy deprivation state and confirm previous findings that the PIN1 auxin transporter is diffusely localized in the dark. Light triggers a rapid removal of the starvation state and the establishment of PIN1 polar membrane localization consistent with auxin export, both preceding the induction of cell cycle- and cytoplasmic growth-associated genes. We demonstrate that shoot meristematic activity can occur in the dark through the manipulation of auxin and cytokinin activity as well as through the activation of energy signaling, both targets of photomorphogenesis action, but the organ developmental outcomes differ: while TOR-dependent energy signals alone stimulate cell proliferation, the development of a normal leaf lamina requires photomorphogenesis-like hormonal responses. We further show that energy signaling adjusts the extent of cell cycle activity and growth of young leaves non-cellautonomously to available photosynthates and leads to organs constituted of a greater number of cells developing under higher irradiance. This makes energy signaling perhaps the most important biomass growth determinant under natural, unstressed conditions.</p>

Structure of eIF4E in Complex with an eIF4G Peptide Supports a Universal Bipartite Binding Mode for Protein Translation
<p>The association-dissociation of the cap-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing protein eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) with eIF4G is a key control step in eukaryotic translation. The paradigm on the eIF4E-eIF4G interaction states that eIF4G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s to the dorsal surface of eIF4E through a single canonical alpha-helical motif, while metazoan eIF4E-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing proteins (m4E-BPs) advantageously compete against eIF4G via bimodal interactions involving this canonical motif and a second noncanonical motif of the eIF4E surface. Metazoan eIF4Gs share this extended <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing interface with m4E-BPs, with significant implications on the understanding of translation regulation and the design of therapeutic molecules. Here we show the high-resolution structure of melon (<i>Cucumis melo</i>) eIF4E in complex with a melon eIF4G peptide and propose the first eIF4E-eIF4G structural model for plants. Our structural data together with functional analyses demonstrate that plant eIF4G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s to eIF4E through both the canonical and noncanonical motifs, similarly to metazoan eIF4E-eIF4G complexes. As in the case of metazoan eIF4E-eIF4G, this may have very important practical implications, as plant eIF4E-eIF4G is also involved in a significant number of plant diseases. In light of our results, a universal eukaryotic bipartite mode of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing to eIF4E is proposed.</p>

9-cis-Neoxanthin in Light Harvesting Complexes of Photosystem II Regulates the Binding of Violaxanthin and Xanthophyll Cycle
<p>The light-harvesting chlorophyll <i>a/b</i> complex of photosystem II (LHCII) is able to switch to multiple functions under different light conditions (i.e. harvesting solar energy for photosynthesis and dissipating excess excitation energy for photoprotection). The role of the different carotenoids bound to LHCII in regulating the structure and function of the complex is a long-lasting question in photosynthesis research. 9-cis-Neoxanthin (Nx) is one of the important carotenoids, which can only be found in the LHCIIs. High-resolution structural analysis of LHCII shows that Nx is located between different monomeric LHCIIs, with one side protruding into the lipid membrane. In this study, the various functional significances of this unique feature of Nx <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing in LHCII are studied with the in vitro reconstituted LHCIIs both with and without Nx and the native complexes isolated either from wild-type Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) or from its mutant <i>aba4-3</i> lacking Nx. Our results reveal that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing of Nx affects the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing affinity of violaxanthin (Vx) to LHCII significantly. In the absence of Nx, Vx has a much higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing affinity to trimeric LHCII. The strong coordination between Nx and Vx at the interfaces of adjacent monomers of LHCII plays an important role both in operating the xanthophyll cycle and in the transient modulation of nonphotochemical quenching.</p>

Molecular and functional characterization of hemocyanin of the giant African millipede, <i>Archispirostreptus gigas</i>
<p>In contrast to other terrestrial arthropods, where gaseous O<sub>2</sub> that fuels aerobic metabolism diffuses to the tissues in tracheal tubes, and most other metazoans, where O<sub>2</sub> is transported to tissues by circulating respiratory proteins, the myriapods (millipedes and centipedes) strikingly have tracheal systems as well as circulating hemocyanin (Hc). In order to elucidate the evolutionary origin and biological significance of millipede Hc, we report the molecular structure (subunit composition and amino acid sequence) of multimeric (36-mer) Hc from the forest floor-dwelling giant African millipede <i>Archispirostreptus gigas</i> and its allosteric oxygen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing properties under various physico-chemical conditions. <i>Archispirostreptus gigas</i> Hc consists of only a single subunit type with differential glycosylation. Phylogenic analysis revealed that millipede Hc is a sister group to centipede HcA, which supports an early divergence of distinct Hc subunits in myriapods and an ancient origin of multimeric Hcs. <i>Archispirostreptus gigas</i> Hc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s O<sub>2</sub> with a high affinity and shows a strong Bohr effect. O<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing is, moreover, modulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, which increase the O<sub>2</sub> affinity of the Hc in the tense (T; deoxygenated) as well as the relaxed (R; oxygenated) states, and by (<sc>l</sc>)-lactate, which modulates Hc–O<sub>2</sub> affinity by changing the allosteric equilibrium constant, <i>L</i>. Cooperativity in O<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing at half O<sub>2</sub> saturation (<i>n</i><sub>50</sub>) is pH dependent and maximal at ~pH 7.4, and the number of interacting O<sub>2</sub>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing sites (<i>q</i>) is markedly increased by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing Ca<sup>2+</sup>.

Moderate excess of pyruvate augments osteoclastogenesis
<p>Cell differentiation leads to adaptive changes in energy metabolism. Conversely, hyperglycemia induces malfunction of many body systems, including bone, suggesting that energy metabolism reciprocally affects cell differentiation. We investigated how the differentiation of bone-resorbing osteoclasts, large polykaryons formed through fusion and growth of cells of monocytic origin, is affected by excess of energy substrate pyruvate and how energy metabolism changes during osteoclast differentiation. Surprisingly, small increases in pyruvate (1–2 mM above basal levels) augmented osteoclastogenesis <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, while larger increases were not effective <i>in vitro</i>. Osteoclast differentiation increased cell mitochondrial activity and ATP levels, which were further augmented in energy-rich conditions. Conversely, the inhibition of respiration significantly reduced osteoclast number and size. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) acts as a metabolic sensor, which is inhibited in energy-rich conditions. We found that osteoclast differentiation was associated with an increase in AMPK levels and a change in AMPK isoform composition. Increased osteoclast size induced by pyruvate (1 mM above basal levels) was prevented in the presence of AMPK activator 5-amino-4-imidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR). In keeping, inhibition of AMPK using dorsomorphin or siRNA to AMPKγ increased osteoclast size in control cultures to the level observed in the presence of pyruvate. Thus, we have found that a moderate excess of pyruvate enhances osteoclastogenesis, and that AMPK acts to tailor osteoclastogenesis to a cell's bioenergetics capacity.</p>

Mitotic phosphorylation regulates Hsp72 spindle localization by uncoupling ATP binding from substrate release
<p>Hsp72 is a member of the 70-kDa heat shock family of molecular chaperones (Hsp70s) that comprise a nucleotide-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing domain (NBD) and a substrate-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing domain (SBD) connected by a linker that couples the exchange of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) with the release of the protein substrate. Mitotic phosphorylation of Hsp72 by the kinase NEK6 at Thr<sup>66</sup> located in the NBD promotes the localization of Hsp72 to the mitotic spindle and is required for efficient spindle assembly and chromosome congression and segregation. We determined the crystal structure of the Hsp72 NBD containing a genetically encoded phosphoserine at position 66. This revealed structural changes that stabilized interactions between subdomains within the NBD. ATP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing to the NBD of unmodified Hsp72 resulted in the release of substrate from the SBD, but phosphorylated Hsp72 retained substrate in the presence of ATP. Mutations that prevented phosphorylation-dependent subdomain interactions restored the connection between ATP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing and substrate release. Thus, phosphorylation of Thr<sup>66</sup> is a reversible mechanism that decouples the allosteric connection between nucleotide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing and substrate release, providing further insight into the regulation of the Hsp70 family. We propose that phosphorylation of Hsp72 on Thr<sup>66</sup> by NEK6 during mitosis promotes its localization to the spindle by stabilizing its interactions with components of the mitotic spindle.</p>

Suppressing corrosion in primary aluminum–air batteries via oil displacement
<p>Primary aluminum–air batteries boast high theoretical energy densities, but negative electrode corrosion irreversibly limits their shelf life. Most corrosion mitigation methods are insufficient or compromise power and energy density. We suppressed open-circuit corrosion by displacing electrolyte from the electrode surface with a nonconducting oil during battery standby. High power and energy density are enabled by displacing the oil with electrolyte for battery discharge. The underwater-oleophobic wetting properties of the designed cell surfaces allow for reversible oil displacement. We demonstrate this method in an aluminum–air cell that achieves a 420% increase in usable energy density and 99.99% reduction in corrosion, which lowers self-discharge to a rate of 0.02% a month and enables system energy densities of 700 watt-hours per liter and 900 watt-hours per kilogram.</p>

Direct measurements of two-way wave-particle energy transfer in a collisionless space plasma

Such wave-particle interactions occur ubiquitously in space. We present ultrafast measurements in Earth’s magnetosphere by the Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft that enabled quantitative evaluation of energy transfer in interactions associated with electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves. The observed ion distributions are not symmetric around the magnetic field direction but are in phase with the plasma wave fields. The wave-ion phase relations demonstrate that a cyclotron resonance transferred energy from hot protons to waves, which in turn nonresonantly accelerated cold He<sup>+</sup> to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">energi</span></strong>es up to ~2 kilo–electron volts. These observations provide direct quantitative evidence for collisionless energy transfer in plasmas between distinct particle populations via wave-particle interactions.</p>

Multimessenger observations of a flaring blazar coincident with high-energy neutrino IceCube-170922A
<p>Previous detections of individual astrophysical sources of neutrinos are limited to the Sun and the supernova 1987A, whereas the origins of the diffuse flux of high-energy cosmic neutrinos remain unidentified. On 22 September 2017, we detected a high-energy neutrino, IceCube-170922A, with an energy of ~290 tera–electron volts. Its arrival direction was consistent with the location of a known γ-ray blazar, TXS 0506+056, observed to be in a flaring state. An extensive multiwavelength campaign followed, ranging from radio frequencies to γ-rays. These observations characterize the variability and energetics of the blazar and include the detection of TXS 0506+056 in very-high-energy γ-rays. This observation of a neutrino in spatial coincidence with a γ-ray–emitting blazar during an active phase suggests that blazars may be a source of high-energy neutrinos.</p>

Targeting an energy sensor to treat diabetes
<p>Obesity occurs when whole-body energy intake exceeds energy expenditure for prolonged periods. This is a major public health issue because obesity increases the risk of disorders such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The liver and muscle store excess energy in the form of fat, leading to resistance to the hormone insulin. Released when blood glucose rises after meals, insulin normally promotes glucose uptake by muscle and represses glucose production by the liver, thus rapidly returning blood glucose to normal. However, this process is impaired in insulin-resistant individuals, who may eventually develop persistently elevated blood glucose (i.e., T2DM), which can cause debilitating or life-threatening complications. Because the energy sensor AMPK (adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase) promotes muscle glucose uptake by insulin-independent mechanisms, it was proposed in 1999 that AMPK-activating drugs might represent a novel approach to treating T2DM (<i>1</i>). Representing the culmination of more than 15 years of developing this concept, a study by Myers <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) on page 507 of this issue and a study by Cokorinos <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) show that compounds that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong> to a unique site on AMPK can promote glucose uptake by muscle, and hence reverse elevated blood glucose in animal models of T2DM.</p>

Vibrationally Promoted Dissociation of Water on Ni(111)

Dual Sites for SEC11 on the SNARE SYP121 Implicate a Binding Exchange during Secretory Traffic
<p>SNARE (soluble <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) proteins facilitate vesicle traffic through their assembly in a heteromeric complex that drives membrane fusion. Much of vesicle traffic at the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plasma membrane is subject to the Sec1/Munc18 protein SEC11, which, along with plasma membrane K<sup>+</sup> channels, selectively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s with the SNARE SYP121 to regulate its assembly in complex. How SEC11 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing is coordinated with the K<sup>+</sup> channels is poorly understood, as both SEC11 and the channels are thought to compete for the same SNARE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing site. Here, we identify a second <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing motif within the N terminus of SYP121 and demonstrate that this motif affects SEC11 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing independently of the F<sup>9</sup>xRF motif that is shared with the K<sup>+</sup> channels. This second, previously unrecognized motif is centered on residues R<sup>20</sup>R<sup>21</sup> of SYP121 and is essential for SEC11 interaction with SYP121. Mutation of the R<sup>20</sup>R<sup>21</sup> motif blocked vesicle traffic without uncoupling the effects of SYP121 on solute and K<sup>+</sup> uptake associated with the F<sup>9</sup>xRF motif; the mutation also mimicked the effects on traffic block observed on coexpression of the dominant-negative SEC11<sup>Δ149</sup> fragment. We conclude that the R<sup>20</sup>R<sup>21</sup> motif represents a secondary site of interaction for the Sec1/Munc18 protein during the transition of SYP121 from the occluded to the open conformation that leads to SNARE complex assembly.</p>

Targeted Endoplasmic Reticulum Localization of Storage Protein mRNAs Requires the RNA-Binding Protein RBP-L
<p>The transport and targeting of glutelin and prolamine mRNAs to distinct subdomains of the cortical endoplasmic reticulum is a model for mRNA localization in plants. This process requires a number of RNA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing proteins (RBPs) that recognize and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong> to mRNA cis-localization (zipcode) elements to form messenger ribonucleoprotein complexes, which then transport the RNAs to their destination sites at the cortical endoplasmic reticulum. Here, we present evidence that the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) RNA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing protein, RBP-L, like its interacting RBP-P partner, specifically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s to glutelin and prolamine zipcode RNA sequences and is required for proper mRNA localization in rice endosperm cells. A transfer DNA insertion in the 3′ untranslated region resulted in reduced expression of the <i>RBP</i>-<i>L</i> gene to 10% to 25% of that in the wild-type. Reduced amounts of RBP-L caused partial mislocalization of glutelin and prolamine RNAs and conferred other general growth defects, including dwarfism, late flowering, and smaller seeds. Transcriptome analysis showed that RBP-L knockdown greatly affected the expression of prolamine family genes and several classes of transcription factors. Collectively, these results indicate that RBP-L, like RBP-P, is a key RBP involved in mRNA localization in rice endosperm cells. Moreover, distinct from RBP-P, RBP-L exhibits additional regulatory roles in development, either directly through its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing to corresponding RNAs or indirectly through its effect on transcription factors.</p>

Free-swimming northern elephant seals have low field metabolic rates that are sensitive to an increased cost of transport
<p>Widely ranging marine predators often adopt stereotyped, energy-saving behaviours to minimize the energetic cost of transport while maximizing energy gain. Environmental and anthropogenic disturbances can disrupt energy balance by prompting avoidance behaviours that increase transport costs, thereby decreasing foraging efficiency. We examined the ability of 12 free-ranging, juvenile northern elephant seals (<i>Mirounga angustirostris</i>) to mitigate the effects of experimentally increased transport costs by modifying their behaviour and/or energy use in a compensatory manner. Under normal locomotion, elephant seals had low energy requirements (106.5±28.2 kJ kg<sup>−1</sup> day<sup>−1</sup>), approaching or even falling below predictions of basal requirements. Seals responded to a small increase in locomotion costs by spending more time resting between dives (149±44 s) compared with matched control treatments (102±11 s; <i>P</i><0.01). Despite incurred costs, most other dive and transit behaviours were conserved across treatments, including fixed, rhythmic swimming gaits. Because of this, and because each flipper stroke had a predictable effect on total costs (<i>P</i><0.001), total energy expenditure was strongly correlated with time spent at sea under both treatments (<i>P</i><0.0001). These results suggest that transiting elephant seals have a limited capacity to modify their locomotory behaviour without increasing their transport costs. Based on this, we conclude that elephant seals and other ocean predators occupying similar niches may be particularly sensitive to increased transport costs incurred when avoiding unanticipated disturbances.</p>

Glycolysis plays an important role in energy transfer from the base to the distal end of the flagellum in mouse sperm
<p>Many studies have been conducted to elucidate the relationship between energy metabolic pathways (glycolysis and respiration) and flagellar motility in mammalian sperm, but the contribution of glycolysis to sperm motility has not yet been fully elucidated. In the present study, we performed detailed analysis of mouse sperm flagellar motility for further understanding of the contribution of glycolysis to mammalian sperm motility. Mouse sperm maintained vigorous motility in the presence of substrates either for glycolysis or for respiration. By contrast, inhibition of glycolysis by alpha-chlorohydrine caused a significant decrease in the bend angle of the flagellar bending wave, sliding velocity of outer doublet microtubules and ATP content even in the presence of respiratory substrates (pyruvate or β-hydroxybutyrate). The decrease of flagellar bend angle and sliding velocity are prominent in the distal part of the flagellum, indicating that glycolysis inhibition caused the decrease in ATP concentration threrein. These results suggest that glycolysis potentially acts as a spatial ATP buffering system, transferring energy (ATP) synthesized by respiration at the mitochondria located in the basal part of the flagellum to the distal part. In order to validate that glycolytic enzymes can transfer high energy phosphoryls, we calculated intraflagellar concentration profiles of adenine nucleotides along the flagellum by computer simulation analysis. The result demonstrated the involvement of glycolysis for maintaining the ATP concentration at the tip of the flagellum. It is likely that glycolysis plays a key role in energy homeostasis in mouse sperm not only through ATP production but also through energy transfer.</p>

Aurora B opposes PP1 function in mitosis by phosphorylating the conserved PP1-binding RVxF motif in PP1 regulatory proteins
<p>Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) is a highly conserved protein phosphatase that performs most of the serine- and threonine-dephosphorylation reactions in eukaryotes and opposes the actions of a diverse set of serine and threonine (Ser-Thr) protein kinases. PP1 gains substrate specificity through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing to a large number (>200) of regulatory proteins that control PP1 localization, activity, and interactions with substrates. PP1 recognizes the well-characterized RVxF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing motif that is present in many of these regulatory proteins, thus generating a multitude of distinct PP1 holoenzymes. We showed that a subset of the RVxF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing motifs, in which x is a phosphorylatable amino acid (RV[S/T]F), was phosphorylated specifically during mitosis and that this phosphorylation event abrogated the interaction of PP1 with the regulatory protein. We determined that this phosphorylation was primarily governed by the mitotic protein kinase Aurora B and that high phosphorylation site stoichiometry of these sites maintained the phosphorylation of PP1 substrates during mitosis by disrupting the assembly of PP1 holoenzymes. We generated an antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated form of the RV[S/T]F motif (RVp[S/T]F) and used it to identify known PP1 regulatory proteins (KNL1, CDCA2, and RIF1) and multiple proteins that could potentially act as PP1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing partners (UBR5, ASPM, SEH1, and ELYS) governed by this mechanism. Together, these data suggest a general regulatory mechanism by which the coordinated activities of Aurora B and PP1 control mitotic progression.</p>

Isolation of isoform-specific binding proteins (Affimers) by phage display using negative selection

Dimerization of the adaptor Gads facilitates antigen receptor signaling by promoting the cooperative binding of Gads to the adaptor LAT
<p>The accurate assembly of signalosomes centered on the adaptor protein LAT (linker of activated T cells) is required for antigen receptor signaling in T cells and mast cells. During signalosome assembly, members of the growth factor receptor–bound protein 2 (Grb2) family of cytosolic adaptor proteins <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong> cooperatively to LAT through interactions with its phosphorylated tyrosine (pTyr) residues. We demonstrated the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain–mediated dimerization of the Grb2 family member, Grb2-related adaptor downstream of Shc (Gads). Gads dimerization was mediated by an SH2 domain interface, which is distinct from the pTyr <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing pocket and which promoted cooperative, preferential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing of paired Gads to LAT. This SH2 domain–intrinsic mechanism of cooperativity, which we quantified by mathematical modeling, enabled Gads to discriminate between dually and singly phosphorylated LAT molecules. Mutational inactivation of the dimerization interface reduced cooperativity and abrogated Gads signaling in T cells and mast cells. The dimerization-dependent, cooperative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing of Gads to LAT may increase antigen receptor sensitivity by reducing signalosome formation at incompletely phosphorylated LAT molecules, thereby prioritizing the formation of complete signalosomes.</p>

Genome-wide identification and characterization of Notch transcription complex–binding sequence-paired sites in leukemia cells

We found that SPSs contributed to the regulation of about a third of direct Notch target genes. Although originally described in promoters, SPSs are present mainly in long-range enhancers, including an enhancer containing a newly described SPS that regulates <i>HES5</i> expression. Our work provides a general method for identifying SPSs in genome-wide data sets and highlights the widespread role of NTC dimerization in Notch-transformed leukemia cells.</p>

Mechanism of allosteric modulation of P-glycoprotein by transport substrates and inhibitors
<p>The ATP-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1) multidrug transporter P-glycoprotein plays a central role in clearance of xenobiotics in humans and is implicated in cancer resistance to chemotherapy. We used double electron electron resonance spectroscopy to uncover the basis of stimulation of P-glycoprotein adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis by multiple substrates and illuminate how substrates and inhibitors differentially affect its transport function. Our results reveal that substrate-induced acceleration of ATP hydrolysis correlates with stabilization of a high-energy, post-ATP hydrolysis state characterized by structurally asymmetric nucleotide-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing sites. By contrast, this state is destabilized in the substrate-free cycle and by high-affinity inhibitors in favor of structurally symmetric nucleotide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing sites. Together with previous data, our findings lead to a general model of substrate and inhibitor coupling to P-glycoprotein.</p>

Chemically reversible isomerization of inorganic clusters
<p>Structural transformations in molecules and solids have generally been studied in isolation, whereas intermediate systems have eluded characterization. We show that a pair of cadmium sulfide (CdS) cluster isomers provides an advantageous experimental platform to study isomerization in well-defined, atomically precise systems. The clusters coherently interconvert over an ~1–electron volt energy barrier with a 140–milli–electron volt shift in their excitonic energy gaps. There is a diffusionless, displacive reconfiguration of the inorganic core (solid-solid transformation) with first order (isomerization-like) transformation kinetics. Driven by a distortion of the ligand-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing motifs, the presence of hydroxyl species changes the surface energy via physisorption, which determines “phase” stability in this system. This reaction possesses essential characteristics of both solid-solid transformations and molecular isomerizations and bridges these disparate length scales.</p>

We present biophysical studies on the photosystems from a cyanobacterium grown in far-red light (750 nm). The few long-wavelength chlorophylls present are well resolved from each other and from the majority pigment, chlorophyll a. Charge separation in photosystem I and II uses chlorophyll f at 745 nm and chlorophyll f (or d) at 727 nm, respectively. Each photosystem has a few even longer-wavelength chlorophylls f that collect light and pass excitation energy uphill to the photochemically active pigments. These photosystems function beyond the red limit using far-red pigments in only a few key positions.</p>

High-temperature pairing in a strongly interacting two-dimensional Fermi gas
<p>The nature of the normal phase of strongly correlated fermionic systems is an outstanding question in quantum many-body physics. We used spatially resolved radio-frequency spectroscopy to measure pairing energy of fermions across a wide range of temperatures and interaction strengths in a two-dimensional gas of ultracold fermionic atoms. We observed many-body pairing at temperatures far above the critical temperature for superfluidity. In the strongly interacting regime, the pairing energy in the normal phase considerably exceeds the intrinsic two-body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing energy of the system and shows a clear dependence on local density. This implies that pairing in this regime is driven by many-body correlations, rather than two-body physics.

The turbulent cascade in five dimensions
<p>To the naked eye, turbulent flows exhibit whirls of many different sizes. To each size, or scale, corresponds a fraction of the total energy resulting from a cascade in five dimensions: scale, time, and three-dimensional space. Understanding this process is critical to strategies for modeling geophysical and industrial flows. By tracking the flow regions containing energy in different scales, we have detected the statistical predominance of a cross-scale link whereby fluid lumps of energy at scale Δ appear within lumps of scale 2Δ and die within those of scale Δ/2. Our approach uncovers the energy cascade in a simple water-like fluid, offering insights for turbulence models while paving the way for similar analyses in conducting fluids, quantum fluids, and plasmas.</p>

High-performance light-emitting diodes based on carbene-metal-amides
<p>Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) promise highly efficient lighting and display technologies. We introduce a new class of linear donor-bridge-acceptor light-emitting molecules, which enable solution-processed OLEDs with near-100% internal quantum efficiency at high brightness. Key to this performance is their rapid and efficient utilization of triplet states. Using time-resolved spectroscopy, we establish that luminescence via triplets occurs within 350 nanoseconds at ambient temperature, after reverse intersystem crossing to singlets. We find that molecular geometries exist at which the singlet-triplet energy gap (exchange energy) is close to zero, so that rapid interconversion is possible. Calculations indicate that exchange energy is tuned by relative rotation of the donor and acceptor moieties about the bridge. Unlike other systems with low exchange energy, substantial oscillator strength is sustained at the singlet-triplet degeneracy point.</p>

TZAP: A telomere-associated protein involved in telomere length control
<p>Telomeres are found at the end of chromosomes and are important for chromosome stability. Here we describe a specific telomere-associated protein: TZAP (telomeric zinc finger–associated protein).

One of the first paradigm systems for understanding how polypeptide hormones <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong> and activate their receptors was human growth hormone (hGH). The molecular details of how hGH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s to its receptor and activates components within the cell started to illuminate over 20 years ago based on biophysical, mutational, and high-resolution structural studies showing that a single hGH molecule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s to two identical molecules of the hGH receptor (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). On page 710 of this issue, Brooks <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) propose a fascinating multistep scissor-like mechanical model in which clamping, rotating, tilting, and the splaying apart of different regions of the transmembrane receptor dimer ultimately lead to receptor activation.</p>

Sucrose Nonfermenting 1-Related Protein Kinase 1 Phosphorylates a Geminivirus Rep Protein to Impair Viral Replication and Infection
<p>Geminiviruses are single-stranded DNA viruses that infect a wide variety of plants and cause severe crop losses worldwide. The geminivirus replication initiator protein (Rep) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s to the viral replication origin and catalyzes DNA cleavage and ligation to initiate rolling circle replication. In this study, we found that the <i>Tomato golden mosaic virus</i> (TGMV) Rep is phosphorylated at serine-97 by sucrose nonfermenting 1-related protein kinase 1 (SnRK1), a master regulator of plant energy homeostasis and metabolism. Phosphorylation of Rep or the phosphomimic S97D mutation impaired Rep <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing to viral DNA. A TGMV DNA-A replicon containing the Rep S97D mutation replicated less efficiently in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) protoplasts than in wild-type or Rep phosphorylation-deficient replicons. The TGMV Rep-S97D mutant also was less infectious than the wild-type virus in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> and was unable to infect tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>). Nearly all geminivirus Rep proteins have a serine residue at the position equivalent to TGMV Rep serine-97. SnRK1 phosphorylated the equivalent serines in the Rep proteins of <i>Tomato mottle virus</i> and <i>Tomato yellow leaf curl virus</i> and reduced DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing, suggesting that SnRK1 plays a key role in combating geminivirus infection. These results established that SnRK1 phosphorylates Rep and interferes with geminivirus replication and infection, underscoring the emerging role for SnRK1 in the host defense response against plant pathogens.</p>

STOREKEEPER RELATED1/G-Element Binding Protein (STKR1) Interacts with Protein Kinase SnRK1
<p>Sucrose nonfermenting related kinase1 (SnRK1) is a conserved energy sensor kinase that regulates cellular adaptation to energy deficit in plants. Activation of SnRK1 leads to the down-regulation of ATP-consuming biosynthetic processes and the stimulation of energy-generating catabolic reactions by transcriptional reprogramming and posttranslational modifications. Although considerable progress has been made during the last years in understanding the SnRK1 signaling pathway, many of its components remain unidentified. Here, we show that the catalytic α-subunits KIN10 and KIN11 of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) SnRK1 complex interact with the STOREKEEPER RELATED1/G-Element Binding Protein (STKR1) inside the plant cell nucleus. Overexpression of STKR1 in transgenic Arabidopsis plants led to reduced growth, a delay in flowering, and strongly attenuated senescence. Metabolite profiling revealed that the transgenic lines exhausted their carbohydrates during the dark period to a greater extent than the wild type and accumulated a range of amino acids. At the global transcriptome level, genes affected by STKR1 overexpression were broadly associated with systemic acquired resistance, and transgenic plants showed enhanced resistance toward a virulent strain of the biotrophic oomycete pathogen <i>Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis</i> Noco2. We discuss a possible connection of STKR1 function, SnRK1 signaling, and plant immunity.</p>

DELLA-GAF1 Complex Is a Main Component in Gibberellin Feedback Regulation of GA20 Oxidase 2
<p>Gibberellins (GAs) are phytohormones that regulate many aspects of plant growth and development, including germination, elongation, flowering, and floral development. Negative feedback regulation contributes to homeostasis of the GA level. DELLAs are negative regulators of GA signaling and are rapidly degraded in the presence of GAs. DELLAs regulate many target genes, including <i>AtGA20ox2</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), encoding the GA-biosynthetic enzyme GA 20-oxidase. As DELLAs do not have an apparent DNA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing motif, transcription factors that act in association with DELLA are necessary for regulating the target genes. Previous studies have identified GAI-ASSOCIATED FACTOR1 (GAF1) as such a DELLA interactor, with which DELLAs act as coactivators, and <i>AtGA20ox2</i> was identified as a target gene of the DELLA-GAF1 complex. In this study, electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that four GAF1-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing sites exist in the <i>AtGA20ox2</i> promoter. Using transgenic plants, we further evaluated the contribution of the DELLA-GAF1 complex to GA feedback regulation. Mutations in four GAF1-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing sites abolished the negative feedback of <i>AtGA20ox2</i> in transgenic plants. Our results showed that GAF1-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing sites are necessary for GA feedback regulation of <i>AtGA20ox2</i>, suggesting that the DELLA-GAF1 complex is a main component of the GA feedback regulation of <i>AtGA20ox2</i>.</p>

Target RNA Secondary Structure Is a Major Determinant of miR159 Efficacy
<p>In plants, microRNA (miRNA)-target complementarity has long been considered the predominant factor determining the silencing outcome of the miRNA-target interaction, although the efficacy of such interactions have rarely been appraised in plants. Here, we perform in planta silencing efficacy assays on seven Arabidopsis <i>MYB</i> genes, all of which contain conserved miR159-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing sites of analogous complementarity. These genes were found to be differentially silenced by miR159; <i>MYB81</i>, <i>MYB97</i>, <i>MYB101</i>, <i>MYB104</i>, and <i>DUO1</i> were all poorly silenced, whereas <i>MYB33</i> and <i>MYB65</i> were strongly silenced. Curiously, this is consistent with previous genetic analysis defining <i>MYB33</i> and <i>MYB65</i> as the major functional targets of miR159. Neither the free energy of miR159-target complementarity, nor miRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing site accessibility, as determined by flanking region AU content, could fully explain the discrepancy of miR159 silencing efficacy. Instead, we found that <i>MYB33</i> and <i>MYB65</i> were both predicted to contain a distinctive RNA secondary structure abutting the miR159 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing site. The structure is composed of two stem-loops (SLs) that are predicted to form in <i>MYB33</i>/65 homologs of species as evolutionary distant as gymnosperms. Functional analysis found that the RNA structure in <i>MYB33</i> correlated with strong silencing efficacy; introducing mutations to disrupt either SL attenuated miR159 efficacy, while introducing complementary mutations to restore the SLs, but not the sequence, restored strong miR159-mediated silencing. Therefore, it appears that this RNA secondary structure demarcates <i>MYB33</i>/<i>65</i> as sensitive targets of miR159, which underpins the narrow functional specificity of Arabidopsis miR159.</p>

A Novel Chemical Inhibitor of ABA Signaling Targets All ABA Receptors
<p>Abscisic acid (ABA), the most important stress-induced phytohormone, regulates seed dormancy, germination, plant senescence, and the abiotic stress response. ABA signaling is repressed by group A type 2C protein phosphatases (PP2Cs), and then ABA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s to its receptor of the ACTIN RESISTANCE1 (PYR1), PYR1-LIKE (PYL), and REGULATORY COMPONENTS OF ABA RECEPTORS (RCAR) family, which, in turn, inhibits PP2Cs and activates downstream ABA signaling. The agonist/antagonist of ABA receptors have the potential to reveal the ABA signaling machinery and to become lead compounds for agrochemicals; however, until now, no broad-spectrum antagonists of ABA receptors blocking all PYR/PYL-PP2C interactions have been identified. Here, using chemical genetics screenings, we identified ABA ANTAGONIST1 (AA1), the first broad-spectrum antagonist of ABA receptors in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Physiological analyses revealed that AA1 is sufficiently active to block ABA signaling. AA1 interfered with all the PYR/PYL-HAB1 interactions, and the diminished PYR/PYL-HAB1 interactions, in turn, restored the activity of HAB1. AA1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s to all 13 members. Molecular dockings, the non-AA1-bound PYL2 variant, and competitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing assays demonstrated that AA1 enters into the ligand-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing pocket of PYL2. Using AA1, we tested the genetic relationships of ABA receptors with other core components of ABA signaling, demonstrating that AA1 is a powerful tool with which to sidestep this genetic redundancy of PYR/PYLs. In addition, the application of AA1 delays leaf senescence. Thus, our study developed an efficient broad-spectrum antagonist of ABA receptors and demonstrated that plant senescence can be chemically controlled through AA1, with a simple and easy-to-synthesize structure, allowing its availability and utility as a chemical probe synthesized in large quantities, indicating its potential application in agriculture.</p>

Plant-Specific Preprotein and Amino Acid Transporter Proteins Are Required for tRNA Import into Mitochondria
<p>A variety of eukaryotes, in particular plants, do not contain the required number of tRNAs to support the translation of mitochondria-encoded genes and thus need to import tRNAs from the cytosol. This study identified two Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) proteins, Tric1 and Tric2 (for tRNA import component), which on simultaneous inactivation by T-DNA insertion lines displayed a severely delayed and chlorotic growth phenotype and significantly reduced tRNA import capacity into isolated mitochondria. The predicted tRNA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing domain of Tric1 and Tric2, a sterile-α-motif at the C-terminal end of the protein, was required to restore tRNA uptake ability in mitochondria of complemented plants. The purified predicted tRNA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing domain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s the T-arm of the tRNA for alanine with conserved lysine residues required for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing. T-DNA inactivation of both Tric proteins further resulted in an increase in the in vitro rate of in organello protein synthesis, which was mediated by a reorganization of the nuclear transcriptome, in particular of genes encoding a variety of proteins required for mitochondrial gene expression at both the transcriptional and translational levels. The characterization of Tric1/2 provides mechanistic insight into the process of tRNA import into mitochondria and supports the theory that the tRNA import pathway resulted from the repurposing of a preexisting protein import apparatus.</p>

Simultaneous high-resolution pH and spectrophotometric recordings of oxygen binding in blood microvolumes
<p>Oxygen equilibrium curves have been widely used to understand oxygen transport in numerous organisms. A major challenge has been to monitor oxygen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing characteristics and concomitant pH changes as they occur <i>in vivo</i>, in limited sample volumes. Here we report a technique allowing highly resolved and simultaneous monitoring of pH and blood pigment saturation in minute blood volumes. We equipped a gas diffusion chamber with a broad-range fibre-optic spectrophotometer and a micro-pH optode and recorded changes of pigment oxygenation along oxygen partial pressure (<i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) and pH gradients to test the setup. Oxygen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing parameters derived from measurements in only 15 μl of haemolymph from the cephalopod <i>Octopus vulgaris</i> showed low instrumental error (0.93%) and good agreement with published data. Broad-range spectra, each resolving 2048 data points, provided detailed insight into the complex absorbance characteristics of diverse blood types. After consideration of photobleaching and intrinsic fluorescence, pH optodes yielded accurate recordings and resolved a sigmoidal shift of 0.03 pH units in response to changing <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> from 0 to 21 kPa. Highly resolved continuous recordings along pH gradients conformed to stepwise measurements at low rates of pH changes. In this study we showed that a diffusion chamber upgraded with a broad-range spectrophotometer and an optical pH sensor accurately characterizes oxygen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing with minimal sample consumption and manipulation. We conclude that the modified diffusion chamber is highly suitable for experimental biologists who demand high flexibility, detailed insight into oxygen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing as well as experimental and biological accuracy combined in a single setup.</p>

Is gastrointestinal plasticity in king quail (<i>Coturnix chinensis</i>) elicited by diet-fibre or diet-energy dilution?
<p>Phenotypic plasticity of organ size allows some animals to manage fluctuations of resource quality or availability. Here, we examined the phenotypic plasticity of the gastrointestinal tract of king quail (<i>Coturnix chinensis</i>) in a diet-fibre manipulation study. Quail were offered either a control low-fibre (high-quality) food (8.5% neutral-detergent fibre; NDF), or one of two experimental diets of higher fibre contents of 16% NDF (i.e. low-quality food). To examine whether phenotypic plasticity of organ size was associated with the fibre content per se, or as a consequence of diluting the diet energy contents by adding fibre, one of the high-fibre feeds was ‘balanced’ with additional energy to match that of the low-fibre control diet. Total empty dry mass of the gastrointestinal tract was significantly heavier among birds offered the unbalanced high-fibre diet as compared with those offered the control diet, with birds offered the fibrous but energy-balanced diet having guts of intermediate size. The heavier entire-gut mass (dry) of quail offered the unbalanced high-fibre diet was associated mainly with these birds having significantly heavier gizzards. Notably, the larger gizzard in the birds offered the unbalanced high-fibre diet was associated with marked increases in their metabolisability (digestion) of diet fibre. Our findings suggest that the available energy in the diet may be more important for eliciting phenotypic changes in the gut of these herbivorous birds rather than simple physical effects of diet fibre on feed intakes or on muscular compensation to fibrous ingesta.</p>

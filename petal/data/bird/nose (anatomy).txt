The Genomes of Two Bat Species with Long Constant Frequency Echolocation Calls
<p>Bats can perceive the world by using a wide range of sensory systems, and some of the systems have become highly specialized, such as auditory sensory perception. Among bat species, the Old World leaf-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nose</span></strong>d bats and horseshoe bats (rhinolophoid bats) possess the most sophisticated echolocation systems. Here, we reported the whole-genome sequencing and <i>de novo</i> assembles of two rhinolophoid bats—the great leaf-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nose</span></strong>d bat (<i>Hipposideros armiger</i>) and the Chinese rufous horseshoe bat (<i>Rhinolophus sinicus</i>). Comparative genomic analyses revealed the adaptation of auditory sensory perception in the rhinolophoid bat lineages, probably resulting from the extreme selectivity used in the auditory processing by these bats. Pseudogenization of some vision-related genes in rhinolophoid bats was observed, suggesting that these genes have undergone relaxed natural selection. An extensive contraction of olfactory receptor gene repertoires was observed in the lineage leading to the common ancestor of bats. Further extensive gene contractions can be observed in the branch leading to the rhinolophoid bats. Such concordance suggested that molecular changes at one sensory gene might have direct consequences for genes controlling for other sensory modalities. To characterize the population genetic structure and patterns of evolution, we re-sequenced the genome of 20 great leaf-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nose</span></strong>d bats from four different geographical locations of China. The result showed similar sequence diversity values and little differentiation among populations. Moreover, evidence of genetic adaptations to high altitudes in the great leaf-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nose</span></strong>d bats was observed. Taken together, our work provided a useful resource for future research on the evolution of bats.</p>

Physical Activity and Heart Rate Variability in Older Adults
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Cardiac mortality and electrophysiological dysfunction both increase with age. Heart rate variability (HRV) provides indices of autonomic function and electrophysiology that are associated with cardiac risk. How habitual physical activity among older adults prospectively relates to HRV, including nonlinear indices of erratic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sinus</span></strong> patterns, is not established. We hypothesized that increasing the levels of both total leisure-time activity and walking would be prospectively associated with more favorable time-domain, frequency-domain, and nonlinear HRV measures in older adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We evaluated serial longitudinal measures of both physical activity and 24-hour Holter HRV over 5 years among 985 older US adults in the community-based Cardiovascular Health Study. After multivariable adjustment, greater total leisure-time activity, walking distance, and walking pace were each prospectively associated with specific, more favorable HRV indices, including higher 24-hour standard deviation of all normal-to-normal intervals (<i>P</i><sub>trend</sub>=0.009, 0.02, 0.06, respectively) and ultralow-frequency power (<i>P</i><sub>trend</sub>=0.02, 0.008, 0.16, respectively). Greater walking pace was also associated with a higher short-term fractal scaling exponent (<i>P</i><sub>trend</sub>=0.003) and lower Poincaré ratio (<i>P</i><sub>trend</sub>=0.02), markers of less erratic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sinus</span></strong> patterns.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Greater total leisure-time activity, and walking alone, as well, were prospectively associated with more favorable and specific indices of autonomic function in older adults, including several suggestive of more normal circadian fluctuations and less erratic sinoatrial firing. Our results suggest potential mechanisms that might contribute to lower cardiovascular mortality with habitual physical activity later in life.</p></sec>

<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Respiratory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sinus</span></strong> arrhythmia constitutes a major component of heart rate variability (HRV) in remotely monitored rattlesnakes. Detection of HRV is posited as a reliable indicator of recovery from trauma in animals.</p>

Avoiding topsy-turvy: how Anna's hummingbirds (<i>Calypte anna</i>) fly through upward gusts
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Hummingbirds flying through intense upward gusts experience pronounced downward pitching motions (i.e. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nose</span></strong> dives). In response, they interrupt flapping, hold the wings dorsally, and angle and fan the tail.</p>

Directionality of nose-emitted echolocation calls from bats without a nose leaf (<i>Plecotus auritus</i>)
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Nose-emitting bats without an obvious means of emitting a narrow bio-sonar beam still emit a highly directional beam, potentially by emitting sound through the mouth as well as the nostrils.</p>

Effect of Distinct Lifestyle Interventions on Mobilization of Fat Storage Pools
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>We aimed to assess whether distinct lifestyle strategies can differentially affect specific body adipose depots.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed an 18-month randomized controlled trial among 278 sedentary adults with abdominal obesity (75%) or dyslipidemia in an isolated workplace with a monitored provided lunch. Participants were randomized to isocaloric low-fat or Mediterranean/low-carbohydrate (MED/LC) diet+28 g walnuts/day with/without added moderate physical activity (PA; 80% aerobic; supervised/free gym membership). Overall primary outcome was body fat redistribution, and the main specific end point was visceral adipose tissue (VAT). We further followed the dynamics of different fat depots (deep and superficial subcutaneous, liver, pericardial, muscle, pancreas, and renal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sinus</span></strong>) by magnetic resonance imaging.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 278 participants (age, 48 years, 89% men, body mass index, 30.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), 86% completed the trial with good adherence. The low-fat group preferentially decreased reported fat intake (−21.0% versus −11.5% for the MED/LC; <i>P</i><0.001), and the MED/LC group decreased reported carbohydrates intake (−39.5% versus −21.3% for the low-fat group; <i>P</i><0.001). The PA<sup>+</sup> groups significantly increased the metabolic equivalents per week versus the PA<sup>−</sup> groups (19.0 versus 2.1; <i>P</i>=0.009). Whereas final moderate weight loss was indifferent, exercise attenuated the waist circumference rebound with the greatest effect in the MED/LC<sup>PA+</sup> group (<i>P</i><0.05). VAT (−22%), intrahepatic (−29%), and intrapericardial (−11%) fats declines were higher than pancreatic and femur intermuscular fats (1% to 2%) loss. Independent of weight loss, PA<sup>+</sup> with either diet had a significantly greater effect on decreasing VAT (mean of difference, −6.67cm<sup>2</sup>; 95% confidence interval, −14.8 to −0.45) compared with PA<sup>−</sup>. The MED/LC diet was superior to the low-fat diet in decreasing intrahepatic, intrapericardial, and pancreatic fats (<i>P</i><0.05 for all). In contrast, renal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sinus</span></strong> and femoral intermuscular fats were not differentially altered by lifestyle interventions but by weight loss per se. In multivariate models further adjusted for weight loss, losing VAT or intrahepatic fat was independently associated with improved lipid profile, losing deep subcutaneous adipose tissue with improved insulin sensitivity, and losing superficial subcutaneous adipose tissue remained neutral except for an association with decreased leptin.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Moderate weight loss alone inadequately reflects the significant lifestyle effects on atherogenic and diabetogenic fat depots. The MED/LC diet mobilizes specific ectopic fat depots, and exercise has an independent contribution to VAT loss. Fat depots exhibit diverse responsiveness and are differentially related to cardiometabolic markers. Distinct lifestyle protocols may uniquely induce fat mobilization from specific anatomic sites.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

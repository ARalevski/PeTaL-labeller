Manipulation of Discrete Nanostructures by Selective Modulation of Noncovalent Forces
<sec><title>Nanotube Engineering</title><p>In general, the reversible self-assembly of nanotubes through noncovalent bonding either gives fully assembled or fully disassembled products. <bold>Fukino <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 499, published online 10 April; see the Perspective by <bold>Hudson and Manners</bold>) developed a system with an intermediate possibility. Hollow nanotube structures were assembled from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferrocen</span></strong>e-based tetratopic pyridyl ligands mixed with AgBF<sub>4</sub>. Through oxidation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferrocen</span></strong>e groups, the tubes could be cut into stable, large rings and then reversibly reassembled into nanotubes by reduction of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferrocen</span></strong>e groups.</p></sec>

Direct observation of individual hydrogen atoms at trapping sites in a ferritic steel
<p>The design of atomic-scale microstructural traps to limit the diffusion of hydrogen is one key strategy in the development of hydrogen-embrittlement–resistant materials. In the case of bearing steels, an effective trapping mechanism may be the incorporation of finely dispersed V-Mo-Nb carbides in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferrit</span></strong>e matrix. First, we charged a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferrit</span></strong>ic steel with deuterium by means of electrolytic loading to achieve a high hydrogen concentration. We then immobilized it in the microstructure with a cryogenic transfer protocol before atom probe tomography (APT) analysis. Using APT, we show trapping of hydrogen within the core of these carbides with quantitative composition profiles. Furthermore, with this method the experiment can be feasibly replicated in any APT-equipped laboratory by using a simple cold chain.</p>

A Pleistocene ice core record of atmospheric O<sub>2</sub> concentrations
<p>The history of atmospheric O<sub>2</sub> partial pressures (<i>P</i><sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub>) is inextricably linked to the coevolution of life and Earth’s biogeochemical cycles. Reconstructions of past <i>P</i><sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub> rely on models and proxies but often markedly disagree. We present a record of <i>P</i><sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub> reconstructed using O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> ratios from ancient air trapped in ice. This record indicates that <i>P</i><sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub> declined by 7 per mil (0.7%) over the past 800,000 years, requiring that O<sub>2</sub> sinks were ~2% larger than sources. This decline is consistent with changes in burial and weathering fluxes of organic carbon and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pyrit</span></strong>e driven by either Neogene cooling or increasing Pleistocene erosion rates. The 800,000-year record of steady average carbon dioxide partial pressures (<i>P</i><sc>co</sc><sub>2</sub>) but declining <i>P</i><sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub> provides distinctive evidence that a silicate weathering feedback stabilizes <i>P</i><sc>co</sc><sub>2</sub> on million-year time scales.</p>

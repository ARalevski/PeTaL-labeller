A single-photon switch and transistor enabled by a solid-state quantum memory
<p>Single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> switches and transistors generate strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> interactions that are essential for quantum circuits and networks. However, the deterministic control of an optical signal with a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> requires strong interactions with a quantum memory, which has been challenging to achieve in a solid-state platform. We demonstrate a single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> switch and transistor enabled by a solid-state quantum memory. Our device consists of a semiconductor spin qubit strongly coupled to a nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic cavity. The spin qubit enables a single 63-picosecond gate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> to switch a signal field containing up to an average of 27.7 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s before the internal state of the device resets. Our results show that semiconductor nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic devices can produce strong and controlled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> interactions that could enable high-bandwidth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic quantum information processing.</p>

Observation of three-photon bound states in a quantum nonlinear medium
<p>Bound states of massive particles, such as nuclei, atoms, or molecules, constitute the bulk of the visible world around us. By contrast, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s typically only interact weakly. We report the observation of traveling three-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> bound states in a quantum nonlinear medium where the interactions between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s are mediated by atomic Rydberg states. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> correlation and conditional phase measurements reveal the distinct bunching and phase features associated with three-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> and two-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> bound states. Such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic trimers and dimers possess shape-preserving wave functions that depend on the constituent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> number. The observed bunching and strongly nonlinear optical phase are described by an effective field theory of Rydberg-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> interactions. These observations demonstrate the ability to realize and control strongly interacting quantum many-body states of light.</p>

A silicon Brillouin laser
<p>Brillouin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> oscillators offer powerful and flexible dynamics as the basis for mode-locked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong>s, microwave oscillators, and optical gyroscopes in a variety of optical systems. However, Brillouin interactions are markedly weak in conventional silicon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic waveguides, stifling progress toward silicon-based Brillouin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong>s. The recent advent of hybrid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic-phononic waveguides has revealed Brillouin interactions to be one of the strongest and most tailorable nonlinearities in silicon. In this study, we have harnessed these engineered nonlinearities to demonstrate Brillouin lasing in silicon. Moreover, we show that this silicon-based Brillouin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> enters a regime of dynamics in which optical self-oscillation produces phonon linewidth narrowing.

Topological insulator laser: Theory
<p>Topological insulators are phases of matter characterized by topological edge states that propagate in a unidirectional manner that is robust to imperfections and disorder. These attributes make topological insulator systems ideal candidates for enabling applications in quantum computation and spintronics. We propose a concept that exploits topological effects in a unique way: the topological insulator <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong>. These are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong>s whose lasing mode exhibits topologically protected transport without magnetic fields. The underlying topological properties lead to a highly efficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong>, robust to defects and disorder, with single-mode lasing even at very high gain values. The topological insulator <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> alters current understanding of the interplay between disorder and lasing, and at the same time opens exciting possibilities in topological physics, such as topologically protected transport in systems with gain. On the technological side, the topological insulator <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> provides a route to arrays of semiconductor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong>s that operate as one single-mode high-power <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> coupled efficiently into an output port.</p>

Deterministic generation of a cluster state of entangled photons
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic cluster states are a resource for quantum computation based solely on single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> measurements. We use semiconductor quantum dots to deterministically generate long strings of polarization-entangled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s in a cluster state by periodic timed excitation of a precessing matter qubit. In each period, an entangled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> is added to the cluster state formed by the matter qubit and the previously emitted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s. In our prototype device, the qubit is the confined dark exciton, and it produces strings of hundreds of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s in which the entanglement persists over five sequential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s. The measured process map characterizing the device has a fidelity of 0.81 with that of an ideal device.

Spatiotemporal mode-locking in multimode fiber lasers
<p>A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> is based on the electromagnetic modes of its resonator, which provides the feedback required for oscillation. Enormous progress has been made toward controlling the interactions of longitudinal modes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong>s with a single transverse mode. For example, the field of ultrafast science has been built on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong>s that lock many longitudinal modes together to form ultrashort light pulses. However, coherent superposition of longitudinal and transverse modes in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> has received little attention. We show that modal and chromatic dispersions in fiber <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong>s can be counteracted by strong spatial and spectral filtering. This allows locking of multiple transverse and longitudinal modes to create ultrashort pulses with a variety of spatiotemporal profiles. Multimode fiber <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong>s thus open new directions in studies of nonlinear wave propagation and capabilities for applications.</p>

Strongly correlated quantum walks with a 12-qubit superconducting processor
<p>Quantum walks are the quantum analogs of classical random walks, which allow for the simulation of large-scale quantum many-body systems and the realization of universal quantum computation without time-dependent control. We experimentally demonstrate quantum walks of one and two strongly correlated microwave <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s in a one-dimensional array of 12 superconducting qubits with short-range interactions. First, in one-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> quantum walks, we observed the propagation of the density and correlation of the quasiparticle excitation of the superconducting qubit and quantum entanglement between qubit pairs. Second, when implementing two-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> quantum walks by exciting two superconducting qubits, we observed the fermionization of strongly interacting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s from the measured time-dependent long-range anticorrelations, representing the antibunching of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s with attractive interactions.

Soliton microcomb range measurement

Coherent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> ranging systems using dual-frequency combs provide an unprecedented combination of long range, high precision, and fast update rate.

Dual-locked counterpropagating solitons having slightly different repetition rates were used to implement a vernier spectrometer, which enabled characterization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> tuning rates as high as 10 terahertz per second, broadly step-tuned <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong>s, multiline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> spectra, and molecular absorption lines.

Although expected from welding and inferred from postmortem cross sections of fusion zones, the direct visualization of the keyhole morphology and dynamics with high-energy x-rays shows that (i) keyholes are present across the range of power and scanning velocity used in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> powder bed fusion; (ii) there is a well-defined threshold from conduction mode to keyhole based on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> power density; and (iii) the transition follows the sequence of vaporization, depression of the liquid surface, instability, and then deep keyhole formation.

Imaging CF<sub>3</sub>I conical intersection and photodissociation dynamics with ultrafast electron diffraction
<p>Conical intersections play a critical role in excited-state dynamics of polyatomic molecules because they govern the reaction pathways of many nonadiabatic processes.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Light Sheet Microscopy Imaging of Light Absorption and Photosynthesis Distribution in Plant Tissue
<p>In vivo variable chlorophyll fluorescence measurements of photosystem II (PSII) quantum yields in optically dense systems are complicated by steep tissue light gradients due to scattering and absorption. Consequently, externally measured effective PSII quantum yields may be composed of signals derived from cells differentially exposed to actinic light, where cells located deeper inside tissues receive lower irradiance than cells closer to the surface and can display distinct photophysiological status. We demonstrate how measured distributions of PSII quantum yields in plant tissue change under natural tissue light gradients as compared with conventionally measured quantum yields with even exposure to actinic light. This was achieved by applying actinic irradiance perpendicular to one side of thallus cross sections of the aquatic macrophyte <i>Fucus vesiculosus</i> with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> light sheets of defined spectral composition, while imaging variable chlorophyll fluorescence from cross sections with a microscope-mounted pulse amplitude-modulated imaging system. We show that quantum yields are highly affected by light gradients and that traditional surface-based variable chlorophyll fluorescence measurements result in substantial underestimations and/or overestimations, depending on incident actinic irradiance. We present a method for using chlorophyll fluorescence profiles in combination with integrating sphere measurements of reflectance and transmittance to calculate depth-resolved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> absorption profiles, which can be used to correct apparent PSII electron transport rates to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s absorbed by PSII. Absorption profiles of the investigated aquatic macrophyte were different in shape from what is typically observed in terrestrial leaves, and based on this finding, we discuss strategies for optimizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> absorption via modulation of the structural organization of phytoelements according to in situ light environments.</p>

Observation of chiral zero mode in inhomogeneous three-dimensional Weyl metamaterials
<p>Owing to the chirality of Weyl nodes, the Weyl systems can support one-way chiral zero modes under a strong magnetic field, which leads to nonconservation of chiral currents—the so-called chiral anomaly. Although promising for robust transport of optical information, the zero chiral bulk modes have not been observed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ics. Here we design an inhomogeneous Weyl metamaterial in which a gauge field is generated for the Weyl nodes by engineering the individual unit cells.

Suppressing spatiotemporal lasing instabilities with wave-chaotic microcavities
<p>Spatiotemporal instabilities are widespread phenomena resulting from complexity and nonlinearity. In broad-area edge-emitting semiconductor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong>s, the nonlinear interactions of multiple spatial modes with the active medium can result in filamentation and spatiotemporal chaos. These instabilities degrade the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> performance and are extremely challenging to control. We demonstrate a powerful approach to suppress spatiotemporal instabilities using wave-chaotic or disordered cavities.

<p>We introduce MINFLUX, a concept for localizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> emitters in space. By probing the emitter with a local intensity minimum of excitation light, MINFLUX minimizes the fluorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s needed for high localization precision. In our experiments, 22 times fewer fluorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s are required as compared to popular centroid localization. In superresolution microscopy, MINFLUX attained ~1-nm precision, resolving molecules only 6 nanometers apart. MINFLUX tracking of single fluorescent proteins increased the temporal resolution and the number of localizations per trace by a factor of 100, as demonstrated with diffusing 30<i>S</i> ribosomal subunits in living <i>Escherichia coli</i>. As conceptual limits have not been reached, we expect this localization modality to break new ground for observing the dynamics, distribution, and structure of macromolecules in living cells and beyond.</p>

Quantum optical circulator controlled by a single chirally coupled atom
<p>Integrated nonreciprocal optical components, which have an inherent asymmetry between their forward and backward propagation direction, are key for routing signals in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic circuits. Here, we demonstrate a fiber-integrated quantum optical circulator operated by a single atom. Its nonreciprocal behavior arises from the chiral interaction between the atom and the transversally confined light. We demonstrate that the internal quantum state of the atom controls the operation direction of the circulator and that it features a strongly nonlinear response at the single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> level. This enables, for example, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> number–dependent routing and novel quantum simulation protocols. Furthermore, such a circulator can in principle be prepared in a coherent superposition of its operational states and may become a key element for quantum information processing in scalable integrated optical circuits.</p>

Buffer-gas cooling of antiprotonic helium to 1.5 to 1.7 K, and antiproton-to–electron mass ratio
<p>Charge, parity, and time reversal (CPT) symmetry implies that a particle and its antiparticle have the same mass. The antiproton-to-electron mass ratio [Formula] can be precisely determined from the single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> transition frequencies of antiprotonic helium. We measured 13 such frequencies with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> spectroscopy to a fractional precision of 2.5 × 10<sup>−9</sup> to 16 × 10<sup>−9</sup>. About 2 × 10<sup>9</sup> antiprotonic helium atoms were cooled to temperatures between 1.5 and 1.7 kelvin by using buffer-gas cooling in cryogenic low-pressure helium gas; the narrow thermal distribution led to the observation of sharp spectral lines of small thermal Doppler width. The deviation between the experimental frequencies and the results of three-body quantum electrodynamics calculations was reduced by a factor of 1.4 to 10 compared with previous single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> experiments. From this, [Formula] was determined as 1836.1526734(15), which agrees with a recent proton-to-electron experimental value within 8 × 10<sup>−10</sup>.</p>

The role of light in mediating the effects of ocean acidification on coral calcification
<p>We tested the effect of light and <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> on the calcification and survival of <i>Pocillopora damicornis</i> recruits settled from larvae released in southern Taiwan. In March 2011, recruits were incubated at 31, 41, 70, 122 and 226 μmol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> under ambient (493 μatm) and high <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> (878 μatm). After 5 days, calcification was measured gravimetrically and survivorship estimated as the number of living recruits. Calcification was affected by the interaction of <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> with light, and at 493 μatm <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> the response to light intensity resembled a positive parabola. At 878 μatm <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub>, the effect of light on calcification differed from that observed at 493 μatm <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub>, with the result that there were large differences in calcification between 493 μatm and 878 μatm <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> at intermediate light intensities (<i>ca</i>. 70 μmol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>), but similar rates of calcification at the highest and lowest light intensities. Survivorship was affected by light and <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub>, and was highest at 122 μmol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> in both <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> treatments, but was unrelated to calcification. In June 2012 the experiment was repeated, and again the results suggested that exposure to high <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> decreased calcification of <i>P. damicornis</i> recruits at intermediate light intensities, but not at lower or higher intensities. Together, our findings demonstrate that the effect of <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> on coral recruits can be light dependent, with inhibitory effects of high <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> on calcification at intermediate light intensities that disappear at both higher and lower light intensities.</p>

cAMPr: A single-wavelength fluorescent sensor for cyclic AMP
<p>Genetically encoded fluorescent sensors enable cell-specific measurements of ions and small molecules in real time. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is one of the most important signaling molecules in virtually all cell types and organisms. We describe cAMPr, a new single-wavelength cAMP sensor. We developed cAMPr in bacteria and embryonic stem cells and validated the sensor in mammalian neurons in vitro and in <i>Drosophila</i> circadian pacemaker neurons in intact brains. Comparison with other single-wavelength cAMP sensors showed that cAMPr improved the quantitative detection of cAMP abundance. In addition, cAMPr is compatible with both single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> and two-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> imaging. This enabled us to use cAMPr together with the red fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor RCaMP1h to simultaneously monitor Ca<sup>2+</sup> and cAMP in <i>Drosophila</i> brains. Thus, cAMPr is a new and versatile genetically encoded cAMP sensor.</p>

Observation and stabilization of photonic Fock states in a hot radio-frequency resonator
<p>Detecting weak radio-frequency electromagnetic fields plays a crucial role in a wide range of fields, from radio astronomy to nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. In quantum optics, the ultimate limit of a weak field is a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>. Detecting and manipulating single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s at megahertz frequencies presents a challenge because, even at cryogenic temperatures, thermal fluctuations are appreciable. Using a gigahertz superconducting qubit, we observed the quantization of a megahertz radio-frequency resonator, cooled it to the ground state, and stabilized Fock states. Releasing the resonator from our control, we observed its rethermalization with nanosecond resolution. Extending circuit quantum electrodynamics to the megahertz regime, we have enabled the exploration of thermodynamics at the quantum scale and allowed interfacing quantum circuits with megahertz systems such as spin systems or macroscopic mechanical oscillators.</p>

Laser cooling of ions in a neutral plasma
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> cooling of a neutral plasma is a challenging task because of the high temperatures typically associated with the plasma state. By using an ultracold neutral plasma created by photoionization of an ultracold atomic gas, we avoid this obstacle and demonstrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> cooling of ions in a neutral plasma. After 135 microseconds of cooling, we observed a reduction in ion temperature by up to a factor of four, with the temperature reaching as low as 50(4) millikelvin. This pushes laboratory studies of neutral plasmas deeper into the strongly coupled regime, beyond the limits of validity of current kinetic theories for calculating transport properties. The same optical forces also retard the plasma expansion, opening avenues for neutral-plasma confinement and manipulation.</p>

Measurement of a superconducting qubit with a microwave photon counter

We introduce an approach to measurement based on a microwave <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> counter demonstrating raw single-shot measurement fidelity of 92%. Moreover, the intrinsic damping of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> counter is used to extract the energy released by the measurement process, allowing repeated high-fidelity quantum nondemolition measurements. Our scheme provides access to the classical outcome of projective quantum measurement at the millikelvin stage and could form the basis for a scalable quantum-to-classical interface.</p>

Building one molecule from a reservoir of two atoms

The experimental apparatus traps two individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong>-cooled atoms [one sodium (Na) and one cesium (Cs)] in separate optical tweezers and then merges them into one optical dipole trap. Subsequently, photoassociation forms an excited-state NaCs molecule. The discovery of previously unseen resonances near the molecular dissociation threshold and measurement of collision rates are enabled by the tightly trapped ultracold sample of atoms. As <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong>-cooling and trapping capabilities are extended to more elements, the technique will enable the study of more diverse, and eventually more complex, molecules in an isolated environment, as well as synthesis of designer molecules for qubits.</p>

Topological insulator laser: Experiments

Here we demonstrate a nonmagnetic topological insulator <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> system exhibiting topologically protected transport in the cavity. Its topological properties give rise to single-mode lasing, robustness against defects, and considerably higher slope efficiencies compared to the topologically trivial counterparts. We further exploit the properties of active topological platforms by assembling the system from <i>S</i>-chiral microresonators, enforcing predetermined unidirectional lasing without magnetic fields. This work paves the way toward active topological devices with exciting properties and functionalities.</p>

Ideal Weyl points and helicoid surface states in artificial photonic crystal structures
<p>Weyl points are the crossings of linearly dispersing energy bands of three-dimensional crystals, providing the opportunity to explore a variety of intriguing phenomena such as topologically protected surface states and chiral anomalies. However, the lack of an ideal Weyl system in which the Weyl points all exist at the same energy and are separated from any other bands poses a serious limitation to the further development of Weyl physics and potential applications. By experimentally characterizing a microwave <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic crystal of saddle-shaped metallic coils, we observed ideal Weyl points that are related to each other through symmetry operations. Topological surface states exhibiting helicoidal structure have also been demonstrated.

Observation of bulk Fermi arc and polarization half charge from paired exceptional points

Moreover, we discover half-integer topological charges in the polarization of far-field radiation around the bulk Fermi arc.

Our work connects the fields of topological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ics, non-Hermitian physics, and singular optics, providing a framework to explore more complex non-Hermitian topological systems.</p>

Light amplification by seeded Kerr instability
<p>Amplification of femtosecond <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> pulses typically requires a lasing medium or a nonlinear crystal.

We demonstrate high gain amplification (greater than 1000) of widely tunable (0.5 to 2.2 micrometers) and short (less than 60 femtosecond) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong> pulses, up to intensities of 1 terawatt per square centimeter, by seeding the modulation instability in an Y<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub> crystal pumped by femtosecond near-infrared pulses. Our method avoids constraints related to doping and phase matching and therefore can occur in a wider pool of glasses and crystals even at far-infrared frequencies and for single-cycle pulses. Such amplified pulses are ideal to study strong-field processes in solids and highly excited states in gases.</p>

Coherent single-atom superradiance

Enhanced collective photoemission of <i>N</i>-squared dependence was observed even when the intracavity atom number was less than unity.

Asexual Female Gametogenesis Involves Contact with a Sexually-Fated Megaspore in Apomictic <i>Hieracium</i>
<p>Apomixis results in asexual seed formation where progeny are identical to the maternal plant. In ovules of apomictic species of the <i>Hieracium</i> subgenus <i>Pilosella</i>, meiosis of the megaspore mother cell generates four megaspores. Aposporous initial (AI) cells form during meiosis in most ovules. The sexual pathway terminates during functional megaspore (FM) differentiation, when an enlarged AI undergoes mitosis to form an aposporous female gametophyte. Then, the mitotically programmed FM dies along with the three other megaspores by unknown mechanisms. Transcriptomes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong>-dissected AIs, ovule cells, and ovaries from apomicts and AI-deficient mutants were analyzed to understand the pathways involved. The steps leading to AI mitosis and sexual pathway termination were determined using antibodies against arabinogalactan protein epitopes found to mark both sexual and aposporous female gametophyte lineages at inception. At most, four AIs differentiated near developing megaspores. The first expanding AI cell to contact the FM formed a functional AI that underwent mitosis soon after megaspore degeneration. Transcriptome analyses indicated that the enlarged, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laser</span></strong>-captured AIs were arrested in the S/G2 phase of the cell cycle and were metabolically active. Further comparisons with AI-deficient mutants showed that AIs were enriched in transcripts encoding homologs of genes involved in, and potentially antagonistic to, known FM specification pathways. We propose that AI and FM cell contact provides cues required for AI mitosis and megaspore degeneration. Specific candidates to further interrogate AI-FM interactions were identified here and include <i>Hieracium</i> arabinogalactan protein family genes.</p>

Processes and endfeet displayed frequent fast activity, whereas the soma was infrequently active. In awake mice, activity was higher than in brain slices, particularly in endfeet and processes, and displayed occasional multifocal cellwide events. Astrocytes responded locally to minimal axonal firing with time-correlated Ca<sup>2+</sup> spots.</p>

RPA binds histone H3-H4 and functions in DNA replication–coupled nucleosome assembly
<p>DNA replication–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed nucleosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y is essential to maintain genome integrity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retain</span></strong> epigenetic information. Multiple involved histone chaperones have been identified, but how nucleosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed to DNA replication remains elusive. Here we show that replication protein A (RPA), an essential replisome component that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s single-stranded DNA, has a role in replication-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed nucleosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y. RPA directly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s free H3-H4. Assays using a synthetic sequence that mimics freshly unwound single-stranded DNA at replication fork showed that RPA promotes DNA-(H3-H4) complex formation immediately adjacent to double-stranded DNA. Further, an RPA mutant defective in H3-H4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing exhibited attenuated nucleosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y on nascent chromatin. Thus, we propose that RPA functions as a platform for targeting histone de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion to replication fork, through which RPA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>es nucleosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y with ongoing DNA replication.</p>

VAMP721 Conformations Unmask an Extended Motif for K<sup>+</sup> Channel Binding and Gating Control
<p>Soluble <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins play a major role in membrane fusion and contribute to cell expansion, signaling, and polar growth in plants. The SNARE SYP121 of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> that facilitates vesicle fusion at the plasma membrane also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s with, and regulates, K<sup>+</sup> channels already present at the plasma membrane to affect K<sup>+</sup> uptake and K<sup>+</sup>-dependent growth. Here, we report that its cognate partner VAMP721, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>es with SYP121 to drive membrane fusion, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s to the KAT1 K<sup>+</sup> channel via two sites on the protein, only one of which contributes to channel-gating control. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing to the VAMP721 SNARE domain suppressed channel gating. By contrast, interaction with the amino-terminal longin domain conferred specificity on VAMP721 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing without influencing gating. Channel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing was defined by a linear motif within the longin domain. The SNARE domain is thought to wrap around this structure when not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>ed with SYP121 in the SNARE complex. Fluorescence lifetime analysis showed that mutations within this motif, which suppressed channel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing and its effects on gating, also altered the conformational displacement between the VAMP721 SNARE and longin domains. The presence of these two channel-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing sites on VAMP721, one also required for SNARE complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y, implies a well-defined sequence of events coordinating K<sup>+</sup> uptake and the final stages of vesicle traffic. It suggests that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing begins with VAMP721, and subsequently with SYP121, thereby coordinating K<sup>+</sup> channel gating during SNARE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y and vesicle fusion. Thus, our findings also are consistent with the idea that the K<sup>+</sup> channels are nucleation points for SNARE complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y.</p>

Tough adhesives for diverse wet surfaces
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion to wet and dynamic surfaces, including biological tissues, is important in many fields but has proven to be extremely challenging. Existing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ives are cytotoxic, adhere weakly to tissues, or cannot be used in wet environments. We report a bioinspired design for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ives consisting of two layers: an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ive surface and a dissipative matrix. The former adheres to the substrate by electrostatic interactions, covalent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>s, and physical interpenetration. The latter amplifies energy dissipation through hysteresis. The two layers synergistically lead to higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion energies on wet surfaces as compared with those of existing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ives. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion occurs within minutes, independent of blood exposure and compatible with in vivo dynamic movements.

Correcting for Differential Transcript Coverage Reveals a Strong Relationship between Alternative Splicing and Organism Complexity
<p>What at the genomic level underlies organism complexity? Although several genomic features have been associated with organism complexity, in the case of alternative splicing, which has long been proposed to explain the variation in complexity, no such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">link</span></strong> has been established. Here, we analyzed over 39 million expressed sequence tags available for 47 eukaryotic species with fully sequenced genomes to obtain a comparable index of alternative splicing estimates, which corrects for the distorting effect of a variable number of transcripts per species—an important obstacle for comparative studies of alternative splicing. We find that alternative splicing has steadily increased over the last 1,400 My of eukaryotic evolution and is strongly associated with organism complexity, assayed as the number of cell types. Importantly, this association is not explained as a by-product of covariance between alternative splicing with other variables previously <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">link</span></strong>ed to complexity including gene content, protein length, proteome disorder, and protein interactivity. In addition, we found no evidence to suggest that the relationship of alternative splicing to cell type number is explained by drift due to reduced <i>N</i><sub>e</sub> in more complex species. Taken together, our results firmly establish alternative splicing as a significant predictor of organism complexity and are, in principle, consistent with an important role of transcript diversification through alternative splicing as a means of determining a genome’s functional information capacity.</p>

Mapping the stochastic sequence of individual ligand-receptor binding events to cellular activation: T cells act on the rare events
<p>T cell receptor (TCR) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing to agonist peptide major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) triggers signaling events that initiate T cell responses. This system is remarkably sensitive, requiring only a few <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing events to successfully activate a cellular response. On average, activating pMHC ligands exhibit mean dwell times of at least a few seconds when bound to the TCR. However, a T cell accumulates pMHC-TCR interactions as a stochastic series of discrete, single-molecule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing events whose individual dwell times are broadly distributed. With activation occurring in response to only a handful of such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing events, individual cells are unlikely to experience the average <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing time. Here, we mapped the ensemble of pMHC-TCR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing events in space and time while simultaneously monitoring cellular activation. Our findings revealed that T cell activation hinges on rare, long–dwell time <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing events that are an order of magnitude longer than the average agonist pMHC-TCR dwell time. Furthermore, we observed that short pMHC-TCR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing events that were spatially correlated and temporally sequential led to cellular activation. These observations indicate that T cell antigen discrimination likely occurs by sensing the tail end of the pMHC-TCR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing dwell time distribution rather than its average properties.</p>

Mitotic phosphorylation regulates Hsp72 spindle localization by uncoupling ATP binding from substrate release
<p>Hsp72 is a member of the 70-kDa heat shock family of molecular chaperones (Hsp70s) that comprise a nucleotide-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing domain (NBD) and a substrate-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing domain (SBD) connected by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">link</span></strong>er that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>es the exchange of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) with the release of the protein substrate. Mitotic phosphorylation of Hsp72 by the kinase NEK6 at Thr<sup>66</sup> located in the NBD promotes the localization of Hsp72 to the mitotic spindle and is required for efficient spindle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y and chromosome congression and segregation. We determined the crystal structure of the Hsp72 NBD containing a genetically encoded phosphoserine at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion 66. This revealed structural changes that stabilized interactions between subdomains within the NBD. ATP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing to the NBD of unmodified Hsp72 resulted in the release of substrate from the SBD, but phosphorylated Hsp72 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retain</span></strong>ed substrate in the presence of ATP. Mutations that prevented phosphorylation-dependent subdomain interactions restored the connection between ATP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing and substrate release. Thus, phosphorylation of Thr<sup>66</sup> is a reversible mechanism that de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>es the allosteric connection between nucleotide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing and substrate release, providing further insight into the regulation of the Hsp70 family. We propose that phosphorylation of Hsp72 on Thr<sup>66</sup> by NEK6 during mitosis promotes its localization to the spindle by stabilizing its interactions with components of the mitotic spindle.</p>

Heterobiaryl synthesis by contractive C–C coupling via P(V) intermediates
<p>Heterobiaryls composed of pyridine and diazine rings are key components of pharmaceuticals and are often central to pharmacological function. We present an alternative approach to metal-catalyzed cross-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing to make heterobiaryls using contractive phosphorus C–C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ings, also termed phosphorus ligand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing reactions. The process starts by regioselective phosphorus substitution of the C–H <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>s para to nitrogen in two successive heterocycles; ligand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing is then triggered via acidic alcohol solutions to form the heterobiaryl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>. Mechanistic studies imply that ligand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing is an asynchronous process involving migration of one heterocycle to the ipso <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion of the other around a central pentacoordinate P(V) atom. The strategy can be applied to complex drug-like molecules containing multiple reactive sites and polar functional groups, and also enables convergent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing of drug fragments and late-stage heteroarylation of pharmaceuticals.</p>

ANGUSTIFOLIA Regulates Actin Filament Alignment for Nuclear Positioning in Leaves
<p>During dark adaptation, plant nuclei move centripetally toward the midplane of the leaf blade; thus, the nuclei on both the adaxial and abaxial sides become <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioned at the inner periclinal walls of cells. This centripetal nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning implies that a characteristic cell polarity exists within a leaf, but little is known about the mechanism underlying this process. Here, we show that ANGUSTIFOLIA (AN) and ACTIN7 regulate centripetal nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves. Two mutants defective in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning of nuclei in the dark were isolated and designated as <i>unusual nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning1</i> (<i>unp1</i>) and <i>unp2</i>. In the dark, nuclei of <i>unp1</i> were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioned at the anticlinal walls of adaxial and abaxial mesophyll cells and abaxial pavement cells, whereas the nuclei of <i>unp2</i> were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioned at the anticlinal walls of mesophyll and pavement cells on both the adaxial and abaxial sides. <i>unp1</i> was caused by a dominant-negative mutation in <i>ACTIN7</i>, and <i>unp2</i> resulted from a recessive mutation in <i>AN</i>. Actin filaments in <i>unp1</i> were fragmented and reduced in number, which led to pleiotropic defects in nuclear morphology, cytoplasmic streaming, and plant growth. The mutation in <i>AN</i> caused aberrant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning of nuclei-associated actin filaments at the anticlinal walls. AN was detected in the cytosol, where it interacted physically with plant-specific dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinases (DYRKPs) and itself. The DYRK inhibitor (1<i>Z</i>)-1-(3-ethyl-5-hydroxy-2(3<i>H</i>)-benzothiazolylidene)-2-propanone significantly inhibited dark-induced nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning. Collectively, these results suggest that the AN-DYRKP complex regulates the alignment of actin filaments during centripetal nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning in leaf cells.</p>

Subcellular Compartmentation of Alternatively Spliced Transcripts Defines <i>SERINE/ARGININE-RICH PROTEIN30</i> Expression<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Alternative splicing (AS) is prevalent in higher eukaryotes, and generation of different AS variants is tightly regulated. Widespread AS occurs in response to altered light conditions and plays a critical role in seedling photomorphogenesis, but despite its frequency and effect on plant development, the functional role of AS remains unknown for most splicing variants. Here, we characterized the light-dependent AS variants of the gene encoding the splicing regulator Ser/Arg-rich protein SR30 in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We demonstrated that the splicing variant <i>SR30.2</i>, which is predominantly produced in darkness, is enriched within the nucleus and strongly depleted from ribosomes. Light-induced AS from a downstream 3′ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">splice</span></strong> site gives rise to <i>SR30.1</i>, which is exported to the cytosol and translated, coinciding with SR30 protein accumulation upon seedling illumination. Constitutive expression of SR30.1 and SR30.2 fused to fluorescent proteins revealed their identical subcellular localization in the nucleoplasm and nuclear speckles. Furthermore, expression of either variant shifted splicing of a genomic <i>SR30</i> reporter toward <i>SR30.2</i>, suggesting that an autoregulatory feedback loop affects <i>SR30</i> splicing. We provide evidence that <i>SR30.2</i> can be further <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">splice</span></strong>d and, unlike <i>SR30.2</i>, the resulting cassette exon variant <i>SR30.3</i> is sensitive to nonsense-mediated decay. Our work delivers insight into the complex and compartmentalized RNA processing mechanisms that control the expression of the splicing regulator SR30 in a light-dependent manner.</p>

NDH-PSI Supercomplex Assembly Precedes Full Assembly of the NDH Complex in Chloroplast
<p>The chloroplast NADH dehydrogenase-like (NDH) complex is structurally similar to respiratory complex I and mediates PSI cyclic electron flow. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), chloroplast NDH is composed of at least 29 subunits and associates with two copies of PSI to form the NDH-PSI supercomplex. Here, we found that CHLORORESPIRATORY REDUCTION3 (CRR3) is an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y factor required for the accumulation of subcomplex B (SubB) of chloroplast NDH. In Suc density gradient centrifugation, CRR3 was detected in three protein complexes. Accumulation of the largest peak III complex was impaired in mutants defective in the SubB subunits PnsB2-PnsB5. The oligomeric form of CRR3 likely functions to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>e the core of SubB to form the peak III complex as an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y intermediate. A defect in the PnsL3 subunit increased the level of the peak III complex, suggesting that CRR3 was released from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y intermediate after PnsL3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing. Unlike PnsB2-PnsB5 and PnsL3, PnsB1 was not absolutely necessary for stabilizing SubB. PnsB1 is likely incorporated into the intermediate at the final step during SubB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y. Lhca6 is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">link</span></strong>er protein mediating NDH-PSI supercomplex formation, and its site of contact with NDH was suggested to be SubB. In the <i>lhca6</i> mutant, accumulation of the peak III complex was impaired, suggesting that SubB interacted with Lhca6 during the step of SubB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y. The process of supercomplex formation was triggered before the completion of the NDH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y. Consistent with its predicted function, CRR3 accumulated in young leaves, where the NDH complex was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>ed.</p>

Characterization of Trichome-Expressed BAHD Acyltransferases in <i>Petunia axillaris</i> Reveals Distinct Acylsugar Assembly Mechanisms within the Solanaceae
<p>Acylsugars are synthesized in the glandular trichomes of the Solanaceae family and are implicated in protection against abiotic and biotic stress. Acylsugars are composed of either sucrose or glucose esterified with varying numbers of acyl chains of differing length. In tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>), acylsugar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y requires four acylsugar acyltransferases (ASATs) of the BAHD superfamily. Tomato ASATs catalyze the sequential esterification of acyl-coenzyme A thioesters to the R4, R3, R3′, and R2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ions of sucrose, yielding a tetra-acylsucrose. <i>Petunia</i> spp. synthesize acylsugars that are structurally distinct from those of tomato. To explore the mechanisms underlying this chemical diversity, a <i>Petunia</i> <i>axillaris</i> transcriptome was mined for trichome preferentially expressed BAHDs. A combination of phylogenetic analyses, gene silencing, and biochemical analyses <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed with structural elucidation of metabolites revealed that acylsugar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y is not conserved between tomato and petunia. In <i>P. axillaris</i>, tetra-acylsucrose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y occurs through the action of four ASATs, which catalyze sequential addition of acyl groups to the R2, R4, R3, and R6 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ions. Notably, in <i>P. axillaris</i>, PaxASAT1 and PaxASAT4 catalyze the acylation of the R2 and R6 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ions of sucrose, respectively, and no clear orthologs exist in tomato. Similarly, petunia acylsugars lack an acyl group at the R3′ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion, and congruently, an ortholog of SlASAT3, which catalyzes acylation at the R3′ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion in tomato, is absent in <i>P. axillaris</i>. Furthermore, where putative orthologous relationships of ASATs are predicted between tomato and petunia, these are not supported by biochemical assays. Overall, these data demonstrate the considerable evolutionary plasticity of acylsugar biosynthesis.</p>

The Target of β-Expansin EXPB1 in Maize Cell Walls from Binding and Solid-State NMR Studies<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The wall-loosening actions of β-expansins are known primarily from studies of EXPB1 extracted from maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) pollen. EXPB1 selectively loosens cell walls (CWs) of grasses, but its specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing target is unknown. We characterized EXPB1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing to sequentially extracted maize CWs, finding that the protein primarily <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s glucuronoarabinoxylan (GAX), the major matrix polysaccharide in grass CWs. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing is strongly reduced by salts, indicating that it is predominantly electrostatic in nature. For direct molecular evidence of EXPB1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing, we conducted solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance experiments using paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE), which is sensitive to distances between unpaired electrons and nuclei. By mixing <sup>13</sup>C-enriched maize CWs with EXPB1 functionalized with a Mn<sup>2+</sup> tag, we measured Mn<sup>2+</sup>-induced PRE. Strong <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C PREs were observed for the carboxyls of GAX, followed by more moderate PREs for carboxyl groups in homogalacturonan and rhamnogalacturonan-I, indicating that EXPB1 preferentially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s GAX. In contrast, no PRE was observed for cellulose, indicating very weak interaction of EXPB1 with cellulose. Dynamics experiments show that EXPB1 changes GAX mobility in a complex manner: the rigid fraction of GAX became more rigid upon EXPB1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing while the dynamic fraction became more mobile. Combining these data with previous results, we propose that EXPB1 loosens grass CWs by disrupting noncovalent junctions between highly substituted GAX and GAX of low substitution, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s cellulose. This study provides molecular evidence of β-expansin’s target in grass CWs and demonstrates a new strategy for investigating ligand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing for proteins that are difficult to express heterologously.</p>

Vinculin forms a directionally asymmetric catch bond with F-actin
<p>Vinculin is an actin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing protein thought to reinforce cell-cell and cell-matrix <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ions. However, how mechanical load affects the vinculin–F-actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> is unclear. Using a single-molecule optical trap assay, we found that vinculin forms a force-dependent catch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> with F-actin through its tail domain, but with lifetimes that depend strongly on the direction of the applied force. Force toward the pointed (–) end of the actin filament resulted in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> that was maximally stable at 8 piconewtons, with a mean lifetime (12 seconds) 10 times as long as the mean lifetime when force was applied toward the barbed (+) end. A computational model of lamellipodial actin dynamics suggests that the directionality of the vinculin–F-actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> could establish long-range order in the actin cytoskeleton. The directional and force-stabilized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing of vinculin to F-actin may be a mechanism by which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion complexes maintain front-rear asymmetry in migrating cells.</p>

Dual Sites for SEC11 on the SNARE SYP121 Implicate a Binding Exchange during Secretory Traffic
<p>SNARE (soluble <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) proteins facilitate vesicle traffic through their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y in a heteromeric complex that drives membrane fusion. Much of vesicle traffic at the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plasma membrane is subject to the Sec1/Munc18 protein SEC11, which, along with plasma membrane K<sup>+</sup> channels, selectively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s with the SNARE SYP121 to regulate its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y in complex. How SEC11 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing is coordinated with the K<sup>+</sup> channels is poorly understood, as both SEC11 and the channels are thought to compete for the same SNARE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing site. Here, we identify a second <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing motif within the N terminus of SYP121 and demonstrate that this motif affects SEC11 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing independently of the F<sup>9</sup>xRF motif that is shared with the K<sup>+</sup> channels. This second, previously unrecognized motif is centered on residues R<sup>20</sup>R<sup>21</sup> of SYP121 and is essential for SEC11 interaction with SYP121.

We conclude that the R<sup>20</sup>R<sup>21</sup> motif represents a secondary site of interaction for the Sec1/Munc18 protein during the transition of SYP121 from the occluded to the open conformation that leads to SNARE complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y.</p>

STABILIZED1 Modulates Pre-mRNA Splicing for Thermotolerance
<p>High-temperature stress often leads to differential RNA splicing, thus accumulating different types and/or a<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mount</span></strong>s of mature mRNAs in eukaryotic cells. However, regulatory mechanisms underlying plant precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) splicing in the environmental stress conditions remain elusive. Herein, we describe that a U5-snRNP-interacting protein homolog STABILIZED1 (STA1) has pre-mRNA splicing activity for heat-inducible transcripts including <i>HEAT STRESS TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR</i>s and various <i>HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN</i>s for the establishment of heat stress tolerance in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Our cell-based splicing reporter assay demonstrated STA1 acts on pre-mRNA splicing for specific subsets of stress-related genes. Cellular reconstitution of heat-inducible transcription cascades supported the view that STA1-dependent pre-mRNA splicing plays a role in DREB2A-dependent <i>HSFA3</i> expression for heat-responsive gene expression. Further genetic analysis with a loss-of-function mutant <i>sta1</i>-<i>1</i>, <i>STA1</i>-expressing transgenic plants in Col background, and <i>STA1</i>-expressing transgenic plants in the <i>sta1</i>-<i>1</i> background verified that STA1 is essential in expression of necessary genes including <i>HSFA3</i> for two-step heat stress tolerance in plants. However, constitutive overexpression of the cDNA version of <i>HSFA3</i> in the <i>sta1</i>-<i>1</i> background is unable to execute plant heat stress tolerance in <i>sta1</i>-<i>1</i>. Consistently our global target analysis of STA1 showed that its splicing activity modulates a rather broad range of gene expression in response to heat treatment. The findings of this study reveal that heat-inducible STA1 activity for pre-mRNA splicing serves as a molecular regulatory mechanism underlying the plant stress tolerance to high-temperature stress.</p>

Genome-Wide Landscape of Alternative Splicing Events in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>
<p>Recently, <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i> has emerged as a model plant for studying monocot grasses and cereal crops. Using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>ed expressed transcript sequences and subsequent mapping to the corresponding genome, we identified 1219 alternative splicing (AS) events spanning across 2021 putatively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>ed transcripts generated from 941 genes. Approximately, 6.3% of expressed genes are alternatively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">splice</span></strong>d in <i>B. distachyon</i>. We observed that a majority of the identified AS events were related to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retain</span></strong>ed introns (55.5%), followed by alternative acceptor sites (16.7%). We also observed a low percentage of exon skipping (5.0%) and alternative donor site events (8.8%). The ‘complex event’ that consists of a combination of two or more basic splicing events accounted for ∼14.0%. Comparative AS transcript analysis revealed 163 and 39 homologous pairs between <i>B. distachyon</i> and <i>Oryza sativa</i> and between <i>B. distachyon</i> and <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, respectively<i>.</i> In all, we found 16 AS transcripts to be conserved in all 3 species. AS events and related putative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>ed transcripts annotation can be systematically browsed at Plant Alternative Splicing Database (<ext-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">link</span></strong>>http://proteomics.ysu.edu/alt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">splice</span></strong>/plant/</ext-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">link</span></strong>>).</p>

Notch-Jagged complex structure implicates a catch bond in tuning ligand sensitivity
<p>Notch receptor activation initiates cell fate decisions and is distinctive in its reliance on mechanical force and protein glycosylation. The 2.5-angstrom-resolution crystal structure of the extracellular interacting region of Notch1 complexed with an engineered, high-affinity variant of Jagged1 (Jag1) reveals a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing interface that extends ~120 angstroms along five consecutive domains of each protein. <i>O</i>-Linked fucose modifications on Notch1 epidermal growth factor–like (EGF) domains 8 and 12 engage the EGF3 and C2 domains of Jag1, respectively, and different Notch1 domains are favored in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing to Jag1 than those that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong> to the Delta-like 4 ligand. Jag1 undergoes conformational changes upon Notch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing, exhibiting catch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> behavior that prolongs interactions in the range of forces required for Notch activation. This mechanism enables cellular forces to regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing, discriminate among Notch ligands, and potentiate Notch signaling.</p>

Dirigent Protein Mode of Action Revealed by the Crystal Structure of AtDIR6
<p>Dirigent proteins impart stereoselectivity to phenoxy radical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing reactions in plants and, thus, play an essential role in the biosynthesis of biologically active natural products. This includes the regioselective and enantioselective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing and subsequent cyclization of two coniferyl alcohol radicals to pinoresinol as the committed step of lignan biosynthesis. The reaction is controlled by dirigent proteins, which, depending on the species and protein, direct the reaction to either (+)- or (−)-pinoresinol. We present the crystal structure of the (−)-pinoresinol forming DIRIGENT PROTEIN6 (AtDIR6) from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) with data to 1.4 Å resolution. The structure shows AtDIR6 as an eight-stranded antiparallel β-barrel that forms a trimer with spatially well-separated cavities for substrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing cavities are two lobed, exhibiting two opposing pockets, each lined with a set of hydrophilic and potentially catalytic residues, including essential aspartic acids. These residues are conserved between (+) and (−)-pinoresinol-forming DIRs and required for activity. The structure supports a model in which two substrate radicals <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong> to each of the DIR monomers. With the aromatic rings fixed in the two pockets, the propionyl side chains face each other for radical-radical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing, and stereoselectivity is determined by the exact <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning of the side chains. Extensive mutational analysis supports a previously unrecognized function for DIRs in catalyzing the cyclization of the bis-quinone methide reaction intermediate to yield (+)- or (−)-pinoresinol.</p>

K63-linked polyubiquitin chains bind to DNA to facilitate DNA damage repair
<p>Polyubiquitylation is canonically viewed as a posttranslational modification that governs protein stability or protein-protein interactions, in which distinct polyubiquitin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">link</span></strong>ages ultimately determine the fate of modified protein(s). We explored whether polyubiquitin chains have any nonprotein-related function. Using in vitro pull-down assays with synthetic materials, we found that polyubiquitin chains with the Lys<sup>63</sup> (K63) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">link</span></strong>age bound to DNA through a motif we called the “DNA-interacting patch” (DIP), which is composed of the adjacent residues Thr<sup>9</sup>, Lys<sup>11</sup>, and Glu<sup>34</sup>. Upon DNA damage, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing of K63-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">link</span></strong>ed polyubiquitin chains to DNA enhanced the recruitment of repair factors through their interaction with an Ile<sup>44</sup> patch in ubiquitin to facilitate DNA repair. Furthermore, experimental or cancer patient–derived mutations within the DIP impaired the DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing capacity of ubiquitin and subsequently attenuated K63-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">link</span></strong>ed polyubiquitin chain accumulation at sites of DNA damage, thereby resulting in defective DNA repair and increased cellular sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents. Our results therefore highlight a critical physiological role for K63-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">link</span></strong>ed polyubiquitin chains in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing to DNA to facilitate DNA damage repair.</p>

Dimerization of the adaptor Gads facilitates antigen receptor signaling by promoting the cooperative binding of Gads to the adaptor LAT
<p>The accurate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y of signalosomes centered on the adaptor protein LAT (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">link</span></strong>er of activated T cells) is required for antigen receptor signaling in T cells and mast cells. During signalosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y, members of the growth factor receptor–bound protein 2 (Grb2) family of cytosolic adaptor proteins <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong> cooperatively to LAT through interactions with its phosphorylated tyrosine (pTyr) residues. We demonstrated the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain–mediated dimerization of the Grb2 family member, Grb2-related adaptor downstream of Shc (Gads). Gads dimerization was mediated by an SH2 domain interface, which is distinct from the pTyr <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing pocket and which promoted cooperative, preferential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing of paired Gads to LAT. This SH2 domain–intrinsic mechanism of cooperativity, which we quantified by mathematical modeling, enabled Gads to discriminate between dually and singly phosphorylated LAT molecules. Mutational inactivation of the dimerization interface reduced cooperativity and abrogated Gads signaling in T cells and mast cells. The dimerization-dependent, cooperative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing of Gads to LAT may increase antigen receptor sensitivity by reducing signalosome formation at incompletely phosphorylated LAT molecules, thereby prioritizing the formation of complete signalosomes.</p>

Architecture and subunit arrangement of native AMPA receptors elucidated by cryo-EM
<p>Glutamate-gated AMPA receptors mediate the fast component of excitatory signal transduction at chemical synapses throughout all regions of the mammalian brain.

Despite decades of study, the subunit com<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion, subunit arrangement, and molecular structure of native AMPA receptors remain unknown. Here we elucidate the structures of 10 distinct native AMPA receptor complexes by single-particle cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM).

Organometallic and radical intermediates reveal mechanism of diphthamide biosynthesis
<p>Diphthamide biosynthesis involves a carbon-carbon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>-forming reaction catalyzed by a radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzyme that cleaves a carbon-sulfur (C–S) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> in SAM to generate a 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl (ACP) radical. Using rapid freezing, we have captured an organometallic intermediate with an iron-carbon (Fe–C) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> between ACP and the enzyme’s [4Fe-4S] cluster. In the presence of the substrate protein, elongation factor 2, this intermediate converts to an organic radical, formed by addition of the ACP radical to a histidine side chain. Crystal structures of archaeal diphthamide biosynthetic radical SAM enzymes reveal that the carbon of the SAM C–S <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> being cleaved is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioned near the unique cluster Fe, able to react with the cluster.

Experimentally realized mechanochemistry distinct from force-accelerated scission of loaded bonds
<p>Stretching polymer chains accelerates dissociation of a variety of internal covalent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>s, to an extent that correlates well with the force experienced by the scissile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>. Recent theory has also predicted scenarios in which applied force accelerates dissociation of unloaded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>s and kinetically strengthens strained <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>s. We report here unambiguous experimental validation of this hypothesis: Detailed kinetic measurements demonstrate that stretching phosphotriesters accelerates dissociation of the unloaded phosphorus-oxygen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> orthogonal to the pulling axis, whereas stretching organosiloxanes inhibits dissociation of the aligned loaded silicon-oxygen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>s. Qualitatively, the outcome is determined by phosphoester elongation and siloxane contraction along the pulling axis in the respective rate-determining transition states. Quantitatively, the results agree with a simple mechanochemical kinetics model.</p>

Tubular clathrin/AP-2 lattices pinch collagen fibers to support 3D cell migration
<p>Migrating cells often use focal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ions in order to move. Focal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ions are less prominent in cells migrating in three-dimensional (3D) as compared with 2D environments. We looked for alternative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion structures supporting cell migration. We analyzed the dynamics of clathrin-coated pits in cells migrating in a 3D environment of collagen fibers. Both topological cues and local engagement of integrins triggered the accumulation of clathrin-coated structures on fibers. Clathrin/adaptor protein 2 (AP-2) lattices pinched collagen fibers by adopting a tube-like morphology and regulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion to fibers in an endocytosis-independent manner. During migration, tubular clathrin/AP-2 lattices stabilized cellular protrusions by providing anchoring points to collagen fibers.

Crystal structures of a group II intron lariat primed for reverse splicing

MoChlo: A Versatile, Modular Cloning Toolbox for Chloroplast Biotechnology
<p>Plant synthetic biology is a rapidly evolving field with new tools constantly emerging to drive innovation. Of particular interest is the application of synthetic biology to chloroplast biotechnology to generate plants capable of producing new metabolites, vaccines, biofuels, and high-value chemicals. Progress made in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y of large DNA molecules, composing multiple transcriptional units, has significantly aided in the ability to rapidly construct novel vectors for genetic engineering. In particular, Golden Gate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y has provided a facile molecular tool for standardized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y of synthetic genetic elements into larger DNA constructs. In this work, a complete modular chloroplast cloning system, MoChlo, was developed and validated for fast and flexible chloroplast engineering in plants. A library of 128 standardized chloroplast-specific parts (47 promoters, 38 5′ untranslated regions [5′UTRs], nine promoter:5′UTR fusions, 10 3′UTRs, 14 genes of interest, and 10 chloroplast-specific destination vectors) were mined from the literature and modified for use in MoChlo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y, along with chloroplast-specific destination vectors. The strategy was validated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>ing synthetic operons of various sizes and determining the efficiency of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y. This method was successfully used to generate chloroplast transformation vectors containing up to seven transcriptional units in a single vector (∼10.6-kb synthetic operon). To enable researchers with limited resources to engage in chloroplast biotechnology, and to accelerate progress in the field, the entire kit, as described, is available through Addgene at minimal cost. Thus, the MoChlo kit represents a valuable tool for fast and flexible design of heterologous metabolic pathways for plastid metabolic engineering.</p>

Linking PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR to Histone Modification in Plant Shade Avoidance
<p>Shade avoidance syndrome (SAS) allows a plant grown in a densely populated environment to maximize opportunities to access to sunlight. Although it is well established that SAS is accompanied by gene expression changes, the underlying molecular mechanism needs to be elucidated. Here, we identify the H3K4me3/H3K36me3-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing proteins, Morf Related Gene (MRG) group proteins MRG1 and MRG2, as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive regulators of shade-induced hypocotyl elongation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>).

In response to shade, PIF7 and MRG2 are enriched at the promoter and gene-body regions and are necessary for increase of histone H4 and H3 acetylation to promote target gene expression. Our study uncovers a mechanism in which the shade-responsive factor PIF7 recruits MRG1/MRG2 that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s H3K4me3/H3K36me3 and brings histone-acetylases to induce histone acetylations to promote expression of shade responsive genes, providing thus a molecular mechanistic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">link</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing the environmental light to epigenetic modification in regulation of hypocotyl elongation in plant SAS.</p>

Structure of eIF4E in Complex with an eIF4G Peptide Supports a Universal Bipartite Binding Mode for Protein Translation
<p>The association-dissociation of the cap-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing protein eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) with eIF4G is a key control step in eukaryotic translation. The paradigm on the eIF4E-eIF4G interaction states that eIF4G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s to the dorsal surface of eIF4E through a single canonical alpha-helical motif, while metazoan eIF4E-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing proteins (m4E-BPs) advantageously compete against eIF4G via bimodal interactions involving this canonical motif and a second noncanonical motif of the eIF4E surface. Metazoan eIF4Gs share this extended <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing interface with m4E-BPs, with significant implications on the understanding of translation regulation and the design of therapeutic molecules. Here we show the high-resolution structure of melon (<i>Cucumis melo</i>) eIF4E in complex with a melon eIF4G peptide and propose the first eIF4E-eIF4G structural model for plants. Our structural data together with functional analyses demonstrate that plant eIF4G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s to eIF4E through both the canonical and noncanonical motifs, similarly to metazoan eIF4E-eIF4G complexes. As in the case of metazoan eIF4E-eIF4G, this may have very important practical implications, as plant eIF4E-eIF4G is also involved in a significant number of plant diseases. In light of our results, a universal eukaryotic bipartite mode of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing to eIF4E is proposed.</p>

<p>We report the partial complementation and subsequent comparative molecular analysis of two nonviable mutants impaired in chloroplast translation, one (<i>emb2394</i>) lacking the RPL6 protein, and the other (<i>emb2654</i>) carrying a mutation in a gene encoding a P-class pentatricopeptide repeat protein. We show that EMB2654 is required for the trans-splicing of the plastid <i>rps12</i> transcript and that therefore the <i>emb2654</i> mutant lacks Rps12 protein and fails to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>e the small subunit of the plastid ribosome, explaining the loss of plastid translation and consequent embryo-lethal phenotype. Predictions of the EMB2654 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing site match a small RNA “footprint” located on the 5′ half of the trans-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">splice</span></strong>d intron that is almost absent in the partially complemented mutant. EMB2654 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s sequence specifically to this target sequence in vitro. Altered patterns in nuclease-protected small RNA fragments in <i>emb2654</i> show that EMB2654 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing must be an early step in, or prior to, the formation of a large protein-RNA complex covering the free ends of the two <i>rps12</i> intron halves.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Dynamic Convergent Evolution Drives the Passage Adaptation across 48 Years’ History of H3N2 Influenza Evolution
<p>Influenza viruses are often propagated in a diverse set of culturing media and additional substitutions known as passage adaptation can cause extra evolution in the target strain, leading to ineffective vaccines. Using 25,482 H3N2 HA1 sequences curated from Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data and National Center for Biotechnology Information databases, we found that passage adaptation is a very dynamic process that changes over time and evolves in a seesaw like pattern. After crossing the species boundary from bird to human in 1968, the influenza H3N2 virus evolves to be better adapted to the human environment and passaging them in embryonated eggs (i.e., an avian environment) leads to increasingly stronger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive selection. On the contrary, passage adaptation to the mammalian cell lines changes from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive selection to negative selection. Using two statistical tests, we identified 19 codon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ions around the receptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing domain strongly contributing to passage adaptation in the embryonated egg. These sites show strong convergent evolution and overlap extensively with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ively selected sites identified in humans, suggesting that passage adaptation can confound many of the earlier studies on influenza evolution. Interestingly, passage adaptation in recent years seems to target a few codon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ions in antigenic surface epitopes, which makes it difficult to produce antigenically unaltered vaccines using embryonic eggs. Our study outlines another interesting scenario whereby both convergent and adaptive evolution are working in synchrony driving viral adaptation. Future studies from sequence analysis to vaccine production need to take careful consideration of passage adaptation.</p>

Elevated carboxyhemoglobin in a marine mammal, the northern elephant seal
<p>Low concentrations of endogenous carbon monoxide (CO), generated primarily through degradation of heme from heme-proteins, have been shown to maintain physiological function of organs and to exert cytoprotective effects. However, high concentrations of carboxyhemoglobin (COHb), formed by CO <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing to hemoglobin, potentially prevent adequate O<sub>2</sub> delivery to tissues by lowering arterial O<sub>2</sub> content. Elevated heme-protein concentrations, as found in marine mammals, are likely associated with greater heme degradation, more endogenous CO production and, consequently, elevated COHb concentrations. Therefore, we measured COHb in elephant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seal</span></strong>s, a species with large blood volumes and elevated hemoglobin and myoglobin concentrations. The levels of COHb were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ively related to the total hemoglobin concentration. The maximum COHb value was 10.4% of total hemoglobin concentration. The mean (±s.e.m.) value in adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seal</span></strong>s was 8.7±0.3% (<i>N</i>=6), while juveniles and pups (with lower heme-protein contents) had lower mean COHb values of 7.6±0.2% and 7.1±0.3%, respectively (<i>N</i>=9 and <i>N</i>=9, respectively). Serial samples over several hours revealed little to no fluctuation in COHb values. This consistent elevation in COHb suggests that the magnitude and/or rate of heme-protein turnover is much higher than in terrestrial mammals. The maximum COHb values from this study decrease total body O<sub>2</sub> stores by 7%, thereby reducing the calculated aerobic dive limit for this species. However, the constant presence of elevated CO in blood may also protect against potential ischemia–reperfusion injury associated with the extreme breath-holds of elephant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seal</span></strong>s. We suggest the elephant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seal</span></strong> represents an ideal model for understanding the potential cytoprotective effects, mechanisms of action and evolutionary adaptation associated with chronically elevated concentrations of endogenously produced CO.</p>

Molecular and functional characterization of hemocyanin of the giant African millipede, <i>Archispirostreptus gigas</i>
<p>In contrast to other terrestrial arthropods, where gaseous O<sub>2</sub> that fuels aerobic metabolism diffuses to the tissues in tracheal tubes, and most other metazoans, where O<sub>2</sub> is transported to tissues by circulating respiratory proteins, the myriapods (millipedes and centipedes) strikingly have tracheal systems as well as circulating hemocyanin (Hc). In order to elucidate the evolutionary origin and biological significance of millipede Hc, we report the molecular structure (subunit com<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion and amino acid sequence) of multimeric (36-mer) Hc from the forest floor-dwelling giant African millipede <i>Archispirostreptus gigas</i> and its allosteric oxygen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing properties under various physico-chemical conditions. <i>Archispirostreptus gigas</i> Hc consists of only a single subunit type with differential glycosylation. Phylogenic analysis revealed that millipede Hc is a sister group to centipede HcA, which supports an early divergence of distinct Hc subunits in myriapods and an ancient origin of multimeric Hcs. <i>Archispirostreptus gigas</i> Hc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s O<sub>2</sub> with a high affinity and shows a strong Bohr effect. O<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing is, moreover, modulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, which increase the O<sub>2</sub> affinity of the Hc in the tense (T; deoxygenated) as well as the relaxed (R; oxygenated) states, and by (<sc>l</sc>)-lactate, which modulates Hc–O<sub>2</sub> affinity by changing the allosteric equilibrium constant, <i>L</i>. Cooperativity in O<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing at half O<sub>2</sub> saturation (<i>n</i><sub>50</sub>) is pH dependent and maximal at ~pH 7.4, and the number of interacting O<sub>2</sub>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing sites (<i>q</i>) is markedly increased by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The data are discussed in the light of the mutually supplementary roles of Hc and the tracheal system for tissue O<sub>2</sub> supply.</p>

Metalloprotein entatic control of ligand-metal bonds quantified by ultrafast x-ray spectroscopy

Targeted Endoplasmic Reticulum Localization of Storage Protein mRNAs Requires the RNA-Binding Protein RBP-L
<p>The transport and targeting of glutelin and prolamine mRNAs to distinct subdomains of the cortical endoplasmic reticulum is a model for mRNA localization in plants. This process requires a number of RNA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing proteins (RBPs) that recognize and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong> to mRNA cis-localization (zipcode) elements to form messenger ribonucleoprotein complexes, which then transport the RNAs to their destination sites at the cortical endoplasmic reticulum. Here, we present evidence that the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) RNA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing protein, RBP-L, like its interacting RBP-P partner, specifically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s to glutelin and prolamine zipcode RNA sequences and is required for proper mRNA localization in rice endosperm cells. A transfer DNA insertion in the 3′ untranslated region resulted in reduced expression of the <i>RBP</i>-<i>L</i> gene to 10% to 25% of that in the wild-type. Reduced a<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mount</span></strong>s of RBP-L caused partial mislocalization of glutelin and prolamine RNAs and conferred other general growth defects, including dwarfism, late flowering, and smaller seeds. Transcriptome analysis showed that RBP-L knockdown greatly affected the expression of prolamine family genes and several classes of transcription factors. Collectively, these results indicate that RBP-L, like RBP-P, is a key RBP involved in mRNA localization in rice endosperm cells. Moreover, distinct from RBP-P, RBP-L exhibits additional regulatory roles in development, either directly through its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing to corresponding RNAs or indirectly through its effect on transcription factors.</p>

OHP1, OHP2, and HCF244 Form a Transient Functional Complex with the Photosystem II Reaction Center
<p>The reaction center (RC) of photosystem II (PSII), which is composed of D1, D2, PsbI, and cytochrome <i>b559</i> subunits, forms at an early stage of PSII biogenesis. However, it is largely unclear how these components <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>e to form a functional unit. In this work, we show that synthesis of the PSII core proteins D1/D2 and formation of the PSII RC is b<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lock</span></strong>ed specifically in the absence of ONE-HELIX PROTEIN1 (OHP1) and OHP2 proteins in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), indicating that OHP1 and OHP2 are essential for the formation of the PSII RC. Mutagenesis of the chlorophyll-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing residues in OHP proteins impairs their function and/or stability, suggesting that they may function in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing of chlorophyll in vivo. We further show that OHP1, OHP2, and HIGH CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE244 (HCF244), together with D1, D2, PsbI, and cytochrome <i>b559</i>, form a complex. We designated this complex the PSII RC-like complex to distinguish it from the RC subcomplex in the intact PSII complex. Our data imply that OHP1, OHP2, and HCF244 are present in this PSII RC-like complex for a limited time at an early stage of PSII de novo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y and of PSII repair under high-light conditions. In a subsequent stage of PSII biogenesis, OHP1, OHP2, and HCF244 are released from the PSII RC-like complex and replaced by the other PSII subunits. Together with previous reports on the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i>, our results demonstrate that the process of PSII RC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y is highly conserved among photosynthetic species.</p>

The Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein SOT5/EMB2279 Is Required for Plastid <i>rpl2</i> and <i>trnK</i> Intron Splicing
<p>Chloroplast biogenesis and development are highly complex processes requiring interaction between plastid and nuclear genomic products. Using a high-throughput screen for chloroplast biogenesis suppressors in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), we identified a <i>suppressor of thf1</i> (<i>sot5</i>) that displays virescent and serrated leaves. Further characterization revealed that <i>sot5</i> mutants are defective in leaf adaxial and abaxial polarity and act as enhancers of <i>asymmetric leaves2</i>. Map-based cloning identified <i>SOT5</i> as a gene previously named <i>EMB2279</i> that encodes a plastid-targeted pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein with 11 PPR motifs. A G-to-A mutation in <i>sot5</i> leads to a significant decrease in splicing efficiency, generating two additional mRNA variants. As reported previously, the <i>sot5</i> null mutation is embryo lethal. SOT5 is predicted to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong> to specific RNA sequences found in plastid <i>rpl2</i> and <i>trnK</i> genes, and we found decreased splicing efficiency of the <i>rpl2</i> and <i>trnK</i> genes in <i>sot5</i> mutants.

The Ribosome-Bound Protein Pam68 Promotes Insertion of Chlorophyll into the CP47 Subunit of Photosystem II
<p>Photosystem II (PSII) is a large enzyme complex embedded in the thylakoid membrane of oxygenic phototrophs. The biogenesis of PSII requires the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y of more than 30 subunits, with the assistance of a number of auxiliary proteins. In plants and cyanobacteria, the photosynthesis-affected mutant 68 (Pam68) is important for PSII <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y. However, its mechanisms of action remain unknown. Using a <i>Synechocystis</i> PCC 6803 strain expressing Flag-tagged Pam68, we purified a large protein complex containing ribosomes, SecY translocase, and the chlorophyll-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing PSII inner antenna CP47. Using 2D gel electrophoresis, we identified a pigmented Pam68-CP47 subcomplex and found Pam68 bound to ribosomes. Our results show that Pam68 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s to ribosomes even in the absence of CP47 translation. Furthermore, Pam68 associates with CP47 at an early phase of its biogenesis and promotes the synthesis of this chlorophyll-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing polypeptide until the attachment of the small PSII subunit PsbH. Deletion of both Pam68 and PsbH nearly abolishes the synthesis of CP47, which can be restored by enhancing chlorophyll biosynthesis. These results strongly suggest that ribosome-bound Pam68 stabilizes membrane segments of CP47 and facilitates the insertion of chlorophyll molecules into the translated CP47 polypeptide chain.</p>

SHORTROOT-Mediated Increase in Stomatal Density Has No Impact on Photosynthetic Efficiency
<p>The coordinated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning of veins, mesophyll cells, and stomata across a leaf is crucial for efficient gas exchange and transpiration and, therefore, for overall function. In monocot leaves, stomatal cell files are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioned at the flanks of underlying longitudinal leaf veins, rather than directly above or below. This pattern suggests either that stomatal formation is inhibited in epidermal cells directly in contact with the vein or that specification is induced in cell files beyond the vein. The SHORTROOT pathway specifies distinct cell types around the vasculature in subepidermal layers of both root and shoots, with cell type identity determined by distance from the vein. To test whether the pathway has the potential to similarly pattern epidermal cell types, we expanded the expression domain of the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> ssp <i>japonica</i>) <i>OsSHR2</i> gene, which we show is restricted to developing leaf veins, to include bundle sheath cells encircling the vein. In transgenic lines, which were generated using the orthologous <i>ZmSHR1</i> gene to avoid potential silencing of <i>OsSHR2</i>, stomatal cell files were observed both in the normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion and in more distant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ions from the vein. Contrary to theoretical predictions, and to phenotypes observed in eudicot leaves, the increase in stomatal density did not enhance photosynthetic capacity or increase mesophyll cell density. Collectively, these results suggest that the SHORTROOT pathway may coordinate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning of veins and stomata in monocot leaves and that distinct mechanisms may operate in monocot and eudicot leaves to coordinate stomatal patterning with the development of underlying mesophyll cells.</p>

Transcription Factor WRKY75 Interacts with DELLA Proteins to Affect Flowering
<p>Flowering time is tightly controlled by both endogenous and exogenous signals. Although several lines of evidence have suggested the involvement of WRKY transcription factors in floral initiation, the underlying mechanisms and signaling pathways involved remain elusive. Here, we newly identified Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) WRKY DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>ing protein75 (WRKY75) as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive regulator of flowering initiation. Mutation of <i>WRKY75</i> resulted in a delay in flowering, whereas overexpression of <i>WRKY75</i> significantly accelerated flowering in Arabidopsis. Gene expression analysis showed that the transcript abundance of the flowering time integrator gene <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T</i> (<i>FT</i>) was lower in <i>wrky75</i> mutants than in the wild type, but greater in <i>WRKY75</i>-overexpressing plants. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that WRKY75 directly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s to the promoter of <i>FT</i>. Both in vivo and in vitro biochemical analyses demonstrated that WRKY75 interacts with DELLA proteins. We found that both REPRESSOR OF <i>ga1-3</i> (RGA) RGA-LIKE1 (RGL1) and GA INSENSITIVE (GAI) can repress the activation ability of WRKY75, thereby attenuating expression of its regulon. Genetic analyses indicated that <i>WRKY75</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ively regulates flowering in a FT-dependent manner and overexpression of <i>RGL1</i> or gain-of-function of <i>GAI</i> could partially rescue the early flowering phenotype of <i>WRKY75</i>-overexpressing plants. Taken together, our results demonstrate that WRKY75 may function as a new component of the GA-mediated signaling pathway to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ively regulate flowering in Arabidopsis.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Hydroxystilbenes Are Monomers in Palm Fruit Endocarp Lignins
<p>Lignin, the plant cell wall polymer that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bind</span></strong>s fibers together but makes processing difficult, is traditionally formed from three monomers, the so-called monolignols (<i>p</i>-coumaryl, coniferyl, and sinapyl alcohols). Recently, we discovered, in grass lignins, a phenolic monomer that falls outside the canonical lignin biosynthetic pathway, the flavone tricin. As we show here, palm fruit (macaéíéííéíúba [<i>Acrocomia aculeata</i>], carnauba [<i>Copernicia prunifera</i>], and coconut [<i>Cocos nucifera</i>]) endocarps contain lignin polymers derived in part from a previously unconsidered class of lignin monomers, the hydroxystilbenes, including the valuable compounds piceatannol and resveratrol. Piceatannol could be released from these lignins upon derivatization followed by reductive cleavage, a degradative method that cleaves β-ether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>s, indicating that at least a fraction is incorporated through labile ether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>s. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of products from the copolymerization of piceatannol and monolignols confirms the structures in the natural polymer and demonstrates that piceatannol acts as an authentic monomer participating in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing and cross-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing reactions during lignification. Therefore, palm fruit endocarps contain a new class of stilbenolignin polymers, further expanding the definition of lignin and implying that compounds such as piceatannol and resveratrol are potentially available in what is now essentially a waste product.</p>

Fitness Trade-Offs Lead to Suppressor Tolerance in Yeast
<p>Genetic variation among individuals within a population provides the raw material for phenotypic diversity upon which natural selection operates. Some given variants can act on multiple standing genomic variations simultaneously and release previously inaccessible phenotypes, leading to increased adaptive potential upon challenging environments. Previously, we identified such a variant related to a tRNA nonsense suppressor in yeast. When introduced into other genetic backgrounds, the suppressor led to an increased population phenotypic variance on various culture conditions, conferring background and environment specific selective advantages. Nonetheless, most isolates are intolerant to the suppressor on rich media due to a severe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness cost. Here, we found that the tolerance to suppressor is related to a surprising level of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness outburst, showing a trade-off effect to accommodate the cost of carrying the suppressor. To dissect the genetic basis of such trade-offs, we crossed strains with contrasting tolerance levels on rich media, and analyzed the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness distribution patterns in the offspring. Combining quantitative tetrad analysis and bulk segregant analysis, we identified two genes, namely <i>MKT1</i> and <i>RGA1</i>, involved in suppressor tolerance. We showed that alleles from the tolerant parent for both genes conferred a significant gain of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness, which increased the suppressor tolerance. Our results present a detailed dissection of suppressor tolerance in yeast and provide insights into the molecular basis of trade-offs between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness and evolutionary potential.</p>

Detecting Adaptation in Protein-Coding Genes Using a Bayesian Site-Heterogeneous Mutation-Selection Codon Substitution Model
<p>Codon substitution models have traditionally attempted to uncover signatures of adaptation within protein-coding genes by contrasting the rates of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions. Another modeling approach, known as the mutation–selection framework, attempts to explicitly account for selective patterns at the amino acid level, with some approaches allowing for heterogeneity in these patterns across codon sites. Under such a model, substitutions at a given <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion occur at the neutral or nearly neutral rate when they are synonymous, or when they correspond to replacements between amino acids of similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness; substitutions from high to low (low to high) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness amino acids have comparatively low (high) rates. Here, we study the use of such a mutation–selection framework as a null model for the detection of adaptation. Following previous works in this direction, we include a deviation parameter that has the effect of capturing the surplus, or deficit, in non-synonymous rates, relative to what would be expected under a mutation–selection modeling framework that includes a Dirichlet process approach to account for across-codon-site variation in amino acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fit</span></strong>ness profiles. We use simulations, along with a few real data sets, to study the behavior of the approach, and find it to have good power with a low false-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive rate. Altogether, we emphasize the potential of recent mutation–selection models in the detection of adaptation, calling for further model refinements as well as large-scale applications.</p>

Storage Compartments for Capillary Water Rarely Refill in an Intact Woody Plant
<p>Water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">storag</span></strong>e is thought to play an integral role in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance of whole-plant water balance. The contribution of both living and dead cells to water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">storag</span></strong>e can be derived from rehydration and water-release curves on excised plant material, but the underlying tissue-specific emptying/refilling dynamics remain unclear. Here, we used x-ray computed microtomography to characterize the refilling of xylem fibers, pith cells, and vessels under both excised and in vivo conditions in <i>Laurus nobilis</i>. In excised stems supplied with water, water uptake exhibited a biphasic response curve, and x-ray computed microtomography images showed that high water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">storag</span></strong>e capacitance was associated with fiber and pith refilling as driven by capillary forces: fibers refilled more rapidly than pith cells, while vessel refilling was minimal. In excised stems that were sealed, fiber and pith refilling was associated with vessel emptying, indicating a link between tissue connectivity and water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">storag</span></strong>e. In contrast, refilling of fibers, pith cells, and vessels was negligible in intact saplings over two time scales, 24 h and 3 weeks. However, those compartments did refill slowly when the shoot was covered to prevent transpiration. Collectively, our data (1) provide direct evidence that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">storag</span></strong>e compartments for capillary water refill in excised stems but rarely under in vivo conditions, (2) highlight that estimates of capacitance from excised samples should be interpreted with caution, as certain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">storag</span></strong>e compartments may not be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">util</span></strong>ized in the intact plant, and (3) question the paradigm that fibers play a substantial role in daily discharge/recharge of stem capacitance in an intact tree.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
The Evolution of Silicon Transport in Eukaryotes
<p>Biosilicification (the formation of biological structures from silica) occurs in diverse eukaryotic lineages, plays a major role in global biogeochemical cycles, and has significant biotechnological applications. Silicon (Si) uptake is crucial for biosilicification, yet the evolutionary history of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers involved remains poorly known. Recent evidence suggests that the SIT family of Si <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers, initially identified in diatoms, may be widely distributed, with an extended family of related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers (SIT-Ls) present in some nonsilicified organisms. Here, we identify SITs and SIT-Ls in a range of eukaryotes, including major silicified lineages (radiolarians and chrysophytes) and also bacterial SIT-Ls. Our evidence suggests that the symmetrical 10-transmembrane-domain SIT structure has independently evolved multiple times via duplication and fusion of 5-transmembrane-domain SIT-Ls. We also identify a second gene family, similar to the active Si <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er Lsi2, that is broadly distributed amongst siliceous and nonsiliceous eukaryotes. Our analyses resolve a distinct group of Lsi2-like genes, including plant and diatom Si-responsive genes, and sequences unique to siliceous sponges and choanoflagellates. The SIT/SIT-L and Lsi2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er families likely contribute to biosilicification in diverse lineages, indicating an ancient role for Si <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> in eukaryotes. We propose that these Si <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers may have arisen initially to prevent Si toxicity in the high Si Precambrian oceans, with subsequent biologically induced reductions in Si concentrations of Phanerozoic seas leading to widespread losses of SIT, SIT-L, and Lsi2-like genes in diverse lineages. Thus, the origin and diversification of two independent Si <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er families both drove and were driven by ancient ocean Si levels.</p>

A Magnesium Transporter OsMGT1 Plays a Critical Role in Salt Tolerance in Rice
<p>Salt stress is one of the major factors limiting rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) production globally. Although several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers involved in salt tolerance have been identified in rice, the mechanisms regulating their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> activity are still poorly understood. Here, we show evidence that a rice Mg <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er OsMGT1 is required for salt tolerance probably by regulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> activity of OsHKT1;5, a key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er for the removal of Na<sup>+</sup> from the xylem sap at the root mature zone. Knockout of <i>OsMGT1</i> did not affect total Na uptake, but increased Na concentration in the shoots and xylem sap, resulting in a significant increase in salt sensitivity at low external Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration (20–200 μ<sc>m</sc>). However, such differences were abolished at a higher Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration (2 m<sc>m</sc>), although the total Na uptake was not altered. <i>OsMGT1</i> was expressed in both the roots and shoots, but only that in the roots was moderately up-regulated by salt stress. Spatial expression analysis revealed that <i>OsMGT1</i> was expressed in all root cells of the root tips but was highly expressed in the pericycle of root mature zone. <i>OsMGT1</i> was also expressed in the phloem region of basal node, leaf blade, and sheath. When expressed in <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> activity of OsHKT1;5 was enhanced by elevating external Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration. Furthermore, knockout of <i>OsHKT1;5</i> in <i>osmgt1</i> mutant background did not further increase its salt sensitivity. Taken together, our results suggest that Mg<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ed by OsMGT1 in the root mature zone is required for enhancing OsHKT1;5 activity, thereby restricting Na accumulation to the shoots.</p>

Ontogenetic expression of metabolic genes and microRNAs in rainbow trout alevins during the transition from the endogenous to the exogenous feeding period
<p>As oviparous fish, rainbow trout change their nutritional strategy during ontogenesis. This change is divided into the exclusive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">util</span></strong>ization of yolk-sac reserves (endogenous feeding), the concurrent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">util</span></strong>ization of yolk reserves and exogenous feeds (mixed feeding) and the complete dependence on external feeds (exogenous feeding). The change in food source is accompanied by well-characterized morphological changes, including the development of adipose tissue as an energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">storag</span></strong>e site, and continuous muscle development to improve foraging. The aim of this study was to investigate underlying molecular mechanisms that contribute to these ontogenetic changes between the nutritional phenotypes in rainbow trout alevins. We therefore analyzed the expression of marker genes of metabolic pathways and microRNAs (miRNAs) important in the differentiation and/or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance of metabolic tissues. In exogenously feeding alevins, the last enzyme involved in glucose production (<i>g6pca</i> and <i>g6pcb</i>) and lipolytic gene expression (<i>cpt1a</i> and <i>cpt1b</i>) decreased, while that of <i>gk</i>, involved in hepatic glucose use, was induced. This pattern is consistent with a progressive switch from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">util</span></strong>ization of stored (gluconeogenic) amino acids and lipids in endogenously feeding alevins to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">util</span></strong>ization of exogenous feeds <i>via</i> the glycolytic pathway. A shift towards the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">util</span></strong>ization of external feeds is further evidenced by the increased expression of <i>omy-miRNA-143</i>, a homologue of the mammalian marker of adipogenesis. The expression of its predicted target gene <i>abhd5</i>, a factor in triglyceride hydrolysis, decreased concurrently, suggesting a potential mechanism in the onset of lipid deposition. Muscle-specific <i>omy-miRNA-1/133</i> and <i>myod1</i> expression decreased in exogenously feeding alevins, a molecular signature consistent with muscle hypertrophy, which may be linked to nutritional cues or increased foraging.</p>

Inhibition of Endothelial Notch Signaling Impairs Fatty Acid Transport and Leads to Metabolic and Vascular Remodeling of the Adult Heart
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Nutrients are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ed through endothelial cells before being metabolized in muscle cells. However, little is known about the regulation of endothelial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> processes. Notch signaling is a critical regulator of metabolism and angiogenesis during development. Here, we studied how genetic and pharmacological manipulation of endothelial Notch signaling in adult mice affects endothelial fatty acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>, cardiac angiogenesis, and heart function.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Endothelial-specific Notch inhibition was achieved by conditional genetic inactivation of Rbp-jκ in adult mice to analyze fatty acid metabolism and heart function. Wild-type mice were treated with neutralizing antibodies against the Notch ligand Delta-like 4. Fatty acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> was studied in cultured endothelial cells and transgenic mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Treatment of wild-type mice with Delta-like 4 neutralizing antibodies for 8 weeks impaired fractional shortening and ejection fraction in the majority of mice. Inhibition of Notch signaling specifically in the endothelium of adult mice by genetic ablation of Rbp-jκ caused heart hypertrophy and failure. Impaired heart function was preceded by alterations in fatty acid metabolism and an increase in cardiac blood vessel density. Endothelial Notch signaling controlled the expression of endothelial lipase, Angptl4, CD36, and Fabp4, which are all needed for fatty acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> across the vessel wall. In endothelial-specific Rbp-jκ–mutant mice, lipase activity and transendothelial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> of long-chain fatty acids to muscle cells were impaired. In turn, lipids accumulated in the plasma and liver. The attenuated supply of cardiomyocytes with long-chain fatty acids was accompanied by higher glucose uptake, increased concentration of glycolysis intermediates, and mTOR-S6K signaling. Treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin or displacing glucose as cardiac substrate by feeding a ketogenic diet prolonged the survival of endothelial-specific Rbp-jκ–deficient mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This study identifies Notch signaling as a novel regulator of fatty acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> across the endothelium and as an essential repressor of angiogenesis in the adult heart.

Opposing microtubule motors control motility, morphology and cargo segregation during ER-to-Golgi transport
<p>We recently demonstrated that dynein and kinesin motors drive multiple aspects of endosomal function in mammalian cells. These functions include driving motility, maintaining morphology (notably through providing longitudinal tension to support vesicle fission), and driving cargo sorting. Microtubule motors drive bidirectional motility during traffic between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi. Here, we have examined the role of microtubule motors in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> carrier motility, morphology, and domain organization during ER-to-Golgi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>. We show that, consistent with our findings for endosomal dynamics, microtubule motor function during ER-to-Golgi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> of secretory cargo is required for motility, morphology, and cargo sorting within vesicular tubular carriers <i>en route</i> to the Golgi. Our data are consistent with previous findings that defined roles for dynein-1, kinesin-1 (KIF5B) and kinesin-2 in this trafficking step. Our high resolution tracking data identify some intriguing aspects. Depletion of kinesin-1 reduces the number of motile structures seen, which is in line with other findings relating to the role of kinesin-1 in ER export. However, those <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> carriers that were produced had a much greater run length suggesting that this motor can act as a brake on anterograde motility. Kinesin-2 depletion did not significantly reduce the number of motile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> carriers but did cause a similar increase in run length. These data suggest that kinesins act as negative regulators of ER-to-Golgi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>. Depletion of dynein not only reduced the number of motile carriers formed but also caused tubulation of carriers similar to that seen for sorting nexin-coated early endosomes. Our data indicated that the previously observed anterograde–retrograde polarity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> carriers in transit to the Golgi from the ER is maintained by microtubule motor function.</p>

The Coumarin Glucoside, Esculin, Reveals Rapid Changes in Phloem-Transport Velocity in Response to Environmental Cues
<p>The study of phloem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> and its vital roles in long-distance communication and carbon allocation have been hampered by a lack of suitable tools that allow high-throughput, real-time studies. Esculin, a fluorescent coumarin glucoside, is recognized by Suc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers, including AtSUC2, which loads it into the phloem for translocation to sink tissues. These properties make it an ideal tool for use in live-imaging experiments, where it acts as a surrogate for Suc. Here, we show that esculin is translocated with a similar efficiency to Suc and, because of its ease of application and detection, demonstrate that it is an ideal tool for in vivo studies of phloem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>. We used esculin to determine the effect of different environmental cues on the velocity of phloem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>. We provide evidence that fluctuations in cotyledon Suc levels influence phloem velocity rapidly, supporting the pressure-flow model of phloem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>. Under acute changes in light levels, the phloem velocity mirrored changes in the expression of <i>AtSUC2</i>. This observation suggests that under certain environmental conditions, transcriptional regulation may affect the abundance of AtSUC2 and thus regulate the phloem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> velocity.</p>

Boron Alleviates Aluminum Toxicity by Promoting Root Alkalization in Transition Zone via Polar Auxin Transport
<p>Boron (B) alleviates aluminum (Al) toxicity in higher plants; however, the underlying mechanisms behind this phenomenon remain unknown. Here, we used bromocresol green pH indicator, noninvasive microtest, and microelectrode ion flux estimation techniques to demonstrate that B promotes root surface pH gradients in pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) roots, leading to alkalization in the root transition zone and acidification in the elongation zone, while Al inhibits these pH gradients. B significantly decreased Al accumulation in the transition zone (∼1.0–2.5 mm from the apex) of lateral roots, thereby alleviating Al-induced inhibition of root elongation. Net indole acetic acid (IAA) efflux detected by an IAA-sensitive platinum microelectrode showed that polar auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>, which peaked in the root transition zone, was inhibited by Al toxicity, while it was partially recovered by B. Electrophysiological experiments using the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er mutants (<i>auxin resistant1-7</i>; <i>pin-formed2</i> [<i>pin2</i>]) and the specific polar auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er inhibitor1-naphthylphthalamic acid showed that PIN2-based polar auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> is involved in root surface alkalization in the transition zone. Our results suggest that B promotes polar auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> driven by the auxin efflux <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er PIN2 and leads to the downstream regulation of the plasma membrane-H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, resulting in elevated root surface pH, which is essential to decrease Al accumulation in this Al-targeted apical root zone. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the role of exogenous B in alleviation of Al accumulation and toxicity in plants.</p>

Sugar Transporter STP7 Specificity for <sc>l</sc>-Arabinose and <sc>d</sc>-Xylose Contrasts with the Typical Hexose Transporters STP8 and STP12
<p>The controlled distribution of sugars between assimilate-exporting source tissues and sugar-consuming sink tissues is a key element for plant growth and development. Monosaccharide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers of the SUGAR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> PROTEIN (STP) family contribute to the uptake of sugars into sink cells. Here, we report on the characterization of STP7, STP8, and STP12, three previously uncharacterized members of this family in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Heterologous expression in yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) revealed that STP8 and STP12 catalyze the high-affinity proton-dependent uptake of glucose and also accept galactose and mannose. STP12 additionally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>s xylose. <i>STP8</i> and <i>STP12</i> are highly expressed in reproductive organs, where their protein products might contribute to sugar uptake into the pollen tube and the embryo sac. <i>stp8.1</i> and <i>stp12.1</i> T-DNA insertion lines developed normally, which may point toward functional redundancy with other STPs. In contrast to all other STPs, STP7 does not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> hexoses but is specific for the pentoses <sc>l</sc>-arabinose and <sc>d</sc>-xylose. <i>STP7-</i>promoter-reporter gene plants showed an expression of <i>STP7</i> especially in tissues with high cell wall turnover, indicating that STP7 might contribute to the uptake and recycling of cell wall sugars. Uptake analyses with radioactive <sc>l</sc>-arabinose revealed that 11 other STPs are able to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> <sc>l</sc>-arabinose with high affinity. Hence, functional redundancy might explain the missing-mutant phenotype of two <i>stp7</i> T-DNA insertion lines. Together, these data complete the characterization of the STP family and present the STPs as new <sc>l</sc>-arabinose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers for potential biotechnological applications.</p>

Vacuolar Transporters – Companions on a Longtime Journey
<p>Biochemical and electrophysiological studies on plant vacuolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers became feasible in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when methods to isolate large quantities of intact vacuoles and purified vacuolar membrane vesicles were established. However, with the exception of the H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase and H<sup>+</sup>-PPase, which could be followed due to their hydrolytic activities, attempts to purify tonoplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers were for a long time not successful. Heterologous complementation, T-DNA insertion mutants, and later proteomic studies allowed the next steps, starting from the 1990s. Nowadays, our knowledge about vacuolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers has increased greatly. Nevertheless, there are several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers of central importance that have still to be identified at the molecular level or have even not been characterized biochemically. Furthermore, our knowledge about regulation of the vacuolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers is very limited, and much work is needed to get a holistic view about the interplay of the vacuolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ome. The huge amount of information generated during the last 35 years cannot be summarized in such a review. Therefore, I decided to concentrate on some aspects where we were involved during my research on vacuolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers, for some our laboratories contributed more, while others contributed less.</p>

Metal Tolerance Protein 8 Mediates Manganese Homeostasis and Iron Reallocation during Seed Development and Germination
<p>Metal accumulation in seeds is a prerequisite for germination and establishment of plants but also for micronutrient delivery to humans. To investigate metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> processes and their interactions in seeds, we focused on METAL TOLERANCE PROTEIN8 (MTP8), a tonoplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er of the manganese (Mn) subclade of cation diffusion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">facil</span></strong>itators, which in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) is expressed in embryos of seeds. The x-ray fluorescence imaging showed that expression of MTP8 was responsible for Mn localization in subepidermal cells on the abaxial side of the cotyledons and in cortical cells of the hypocotyl. Accordingly, under low Mn availability, MTP8 increased seed stores of Mn, required for efficient seed germination. In mutant embryos lacking expression of <i>VACUOLAR IRON <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ER1</i> (<i>VIT1</i>), MTP8 built up iron (Fe) hotspots in <i>MTP8</i>-expressing cells types, suggesting that MTP8 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>s Fe in addition to Mn. In <i>mtp8 vit1</i> double mutant seeds, Mn and Fe were distributed in all cell types of the embryo. An Fe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> function of MTP8 was confirmed by its ability to complement Fe hypersensitivity of a yeast mutant defective in vacuolar Fe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>. Imbibing <i>mtp8-1</i> mutant seeds in the presence of Mn or subjecting seeds to wet-dry cycles showed that MTP8 conferred Mn tolerance. During germination, MTP8 promoted reallocation of Fe from the vasculature. These results indicate that cell type-specific accumulation of Mn and Fe in seeds depends on MTP8 and that this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er plays an important role in the generation of seed metal stores as well as for metal homeostasis and germination efficiency under challenging environmental conditions.</p>

Global Sensitivity Analysis of OnGuard Models Identifies Key Hubs for Transport Interaction in Stomatal Dynamics
<p>The physical requirement for charge to balance across biological membranes means that the transmembrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> of each ionic species is interrelated, and manipulating solute flux through any one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er will affect other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers at the same membrane, often with unforeseen consequences. The OnGuard systems modeling platform has helped to resolve the mechanics of stomatal movements, uncovering previously unexpected behaviors of stomata. To date, however, the manual approach to exploring model parameter space has captured little formal information about the emergent connections between parameters that define the most interesting properties of the system as a whole. Here, we introduce global sensitivity analysis to identify interacting parameters affecting a number of outputs commonly accessed in experiments in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The analysis highlights synergies between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers affecting the balance between Ca<sup>2+</sup> sequestration and Ca<sup>2+</sup> release pathways, notably those associated with internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores and their turnover. Other, unexpected synergies appear, including with the plasma membrane anion channels and H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase and with the tonoplast TPK K<sup>+</sup> channel. These emergent synergies, and the core hubs of interaction that they define, identify subsets of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers associated with free cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration that represent key targets to enhance plant performance in the future. They also highlight the importance of interactions between the voltage regulation of the plasma membrane and tonoplast in coordinating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> between the different cellular compartments.</p>

Sucrose Transporter Localization and Function in Phloem Unloading in Developing Stems
<p>How sucrose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers (SUTs) regulate phloem unloading in monocot stems is poorly understood and particularly so for species storing high Suc concentrations. To this end, <i>Sorghum bicolor</i> SUTs SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 were characterized by determining their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> properties heterologously expressed in yeast or <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes, and their in planta cellular and subcellular localization. The plasma membrane-localized SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 exhibited a strong selectivity for Suc and high Suc affinities in <i>X. laevis</i> oocytes at pH 5—SbSUT1, 6.3 ± 0.7 m<sc>m,</sc> and SbSUT5, 2.4 ± 0.5 m<sc>m</sc> Suc. The Suc affinity of SbSUT1 was dependent on membrane potential and pH. In contrast, SbSUT5 Suc affinity was independent of membrane potential and pH but supported high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> rates at neutral pH. Suc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> by the tonoplast localized SbSUT4 could not be detected using yeast or <i>X. laevis</i> oocytes. Across internode development, SUTs, other than SbSUT4, were immunolocalized to sieve elements, while for elongating and recently elongated internodes, SUTs also were detected in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">storag</span></strong>e parenchyma cells. We conclude that apoplasmic Suc unloading from de-energized protophloem sieve elements in meristematic zones may be mediated by reversal of SbSUT1 and/or by uniporting SWEETs. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">storag</span></strong>e parenchyma localized SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 may accumulate Suc from the stem apoplasms of elongating and recently elongated internodes, whereas SbSUT4 may function to release Suc from vacuoles. Transiting from an apoplasmic to symplasmic unloading pathway as the stem matures, SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 increasingly function in Suc retrieval into metaphloem sieve elements to maintain a high turgor to drive symplasmic unloading by bulk flow.</p>

<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Geospatial methods using mathematical optimization to identify clusters of cardiac arrests and prioritize public locations for defibrillator <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deploy</span></strong>ment have not been studied. Our objective was to develop such a method and test its performance against a population-guided approach.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>All public location cardiac arrests in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, from December 16, 2005, to July 15, 2010, and all automated external defibrillator (AED) locations registered with Toronto Emergency Medical Services as of September 2009 were plotted geographically. Current AED coverage was quantified by determining the number of cardiac arrests occurring within 100 m of a registered AED. Clusters of cardiac arrests without a registered AED within 100 m were identified. With the use of mathematical optimization techniques, cardiac arrest coverage improvements were computed and shown to be superior to results from a population-guided <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deploy</span></strong>ment method. There were 1310 eligible public location cardiac arrests and 1669 registered AEDs. Of the eligible cardiac arrests, 304 were within 100 m of at least 1 registered AED (23% coverage). The average distance from a cardiac arrest to the closest AED was 281 m. With AEDs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deploy</span></strong>ed in the top 30 locations, an additional 112 historical cardiac arrests would be covered (32% total coverage), and the average distance to the closest AED would be 262 m.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Geographic clusters of cardiac arrests can be easily identified and prioritized with the use of mathematical modeling.

Restored iron transport by a small molecule promotes absorption and hemoglobinization in animals
<p>Multiple human diseases ensue from a hereditary or acquired deficiency of iron-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ing protein function that diminishes transmembrane iron flux in distinct sites and directions. Because other iron-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> proteins remain active, labile iron gradients build up across the corresponding protein-deficient membranes. Here we report that a small-molecule natural product, hinokitiol, can harness such gradients to restore iron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> into, within, and/or out of cells. The same compound promotes gut iron absorption in DMT1-deficient rats and ferroportin-deficient mice, as well as hemoglobinization in DMT1- and mitoferrin-deficient zebrafish. These findings illuminate a general mechanistic framework for small molecule–mediated site- and direction-selective restoration of iron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>. They also suggest that small molecules that partially mimic the function of missing protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers of iron, and possibly other ions, may have potential in treating human diseases.</p>

Three-dimensional holey-graphene/niobia composite architectures for ultrahigh-rate energy storage
<p>Nanostructured materials have shown extraordinary promise for electrochemical energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">storag</span></strong>e but are usually limited to electrodes with rather low mass loading (~1 milligram per square centimeter) because of the increasing ion diffusion limitations in thicker electrodes.

Long-range hot-carrier transport in hybrid perovskites visualized by ultrafast microscopy
<p>The Shockley-Queisser limit for solar cell efficiency can be overcome if hot carriers can be harvested before they thermalize. Recently, carrier cooling time up to 100 picoseconds was observed in hybrid perovskites, but it is unclear whether these long-lived hot carriers can migrate long distance for efficient collection. We report direct visualization of hot-carrier migration in methylammonium lead iodide (CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub>) thin films by ultrafast transient absorption microscopy, demonstrating three distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> regimes. Quasiballistic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> was observed to correlate with excess kinetic energy, resulting in up to 230 nanometers <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> distance that could overcome grain boundaries. The nonequilibrium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> persisted over tens of picoseconds and ~600 nanometers before reaching the diffusive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> limit. These results suggest potential applications of hot-carrier devices based on hybrid perovskites.</p>

Pinstatic Acid Promotes Auxin Transport by Inhibiting PIN Internalization
<p>Polar auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> plays a pivotal role in plant growth and development. PIN-FORMED (PIN) auxin efflux carriers regulate directional auxin movement by establishing local auxin maxima, minima, and gradients that drive multiple developmental processes and responses to environmental signals. Auxin has been proposed to modulate its own <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> by regulating subcellular PIN trafficking via processes such as clathrin-mediated PIN endocytosis and constitutive recycling. Here, we further investigated the mechanisms by which auxin affects PIN trafficking by screening auxin analogs and identified pinstatic acid (PISA) as a positive modulator of polar auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). PISA had an auxin-like effect on hypocotyl elongation and adventitious root formation via positive regulation of auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>. PISA did not activate SCF<sup>TIR1/AFB</sup> signaling and yet induced PIN accumulation at the cell surface by inhibiting PIN internalization from the plasma membrane. This work demonstrates PISA to be a promising chemical tool to dissect the regulatory mechanisms behind subcellular PIN trafficking and auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>.</p>

SULTR3s Function in Chloroplast Sulfate Uptake and Affect ABA Biosynthesis and the Stress Response
<p>Plants are major sulfur reducers in the global sulfur cycle. Sulfate, the major natural sulfur source in soil, is absorbed by plant roots and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ed into plastids, where it is reduced and assimilated into Cys for further metabolic processes. Despite its importance, how sulfate is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ed into plastids is poorly understood. We previously demonstrated using single Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) genetic mutants that each member of the sulfate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er (SULTR) subfamily 3 was able to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> sulfate across the chloroplast envelope membrane. To resolve the function of SULTR3s, we constructed a <i>sultr3</i> quintuple mutant completely knocking out all five members of the subfamily. Here we report that all members of the <i>SULTR3</i> subfamily show chloroplast membrane localization. Sulfate uptake by chloroplasts of the quintuple mutant is reduced by more than 50% compared with the wild type. Consequently, Cys and abscisic acid (ABA) content are reduced to ∼67 and ∼20% of the wild-type level, respectively, and strong positive correlations are found among sulfate, Cys, and ABA content. The <i>sultr3</i> quintuple mutant shows obvious growth retardation with smaller rosettes and shorter roots. Seed germination of the <i>sultr3</i> quintuple mutant is hypersensitive to exogenous ABA and salt stress, but is rescued by sulfide supplementation. Furthermore, sulfate-induced stomatal closure is abolished in the quintuple mutant, strongly suggesting that chloroplast sulfate is required for stomatal closure. Our genetic analyses unequivocally demonstrate that sulfate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er subfamily 3 is responsible for more than half of the chloroplast sulfate uptake and influences downstream sulfate assimilation and ABA biosynthesis.</p>

In Silico Analysis of the Regulation of the Photosynthetic Electron Transport Chain in C3 Plants<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>We present a new simulation model of the reactions in the photosynthetic electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> chain of C3 species. We show that including recent insights about the regulation of the thylakoid proton motive force, ATP/NADPH balancing mechanisms (cyclic and noncyclic alternative electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>), and regulation of Rubisco activity leads to emergent behaviors that may affect the operation and regulation of photosynthesis under different dynamic environmental conditions. The model was parameterized with experimental results in the literature, with a focus on Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). A dataset was constructed from multiple sources, including measurements of steady-state and dynamic gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, and absorbance spectroscopy under different light intensities and CO<sub>2</sub>, to test predictions of the model under different experimental conditions. Simulations suggested that there are strong interactions between cyclic and noncyclic alternative electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> and that an excess capacity for alternative electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> is required to ensure adequate redox state and lumen pH. Furthermore, the model predicted that, under specific conditions, reduction of ferredoxin by plastoquinol is possible after a rapid increase in light intensity. Further analysis also revealed that the relationship between ATP synthesis and proton motive force was highly regulated by the concentrations of ATP, ADP, and inorganic phosphate, and this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">facil</span></strong>itated an increase in nonphotochemical quenching and proton motive force under conditions where metabolism was limiting, such as low CO<sub>2</sub>, high light intensity, or combined high CO<sub>2</sub> and high light intensity. The model may be used as an in silico platform for future research on the regulation of photosynthetic electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>.</p>

A Program for Iron Economy during Deficiency Targets Specific Fe Proteins
<p>Iron (Fe) is an essential element for plants, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">util</span></strong>ized in nearly every cellular process. Because the adjustment of uptake under Fe limitation cannot satisfy all demands, plants need to acclimate their physiology and biochemistry, especially in their chloroplasts, which have a high demand for Fe. To investigate if a program exists for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">util</span></strong>ization of Fe under deficiency, we analyzed how hydroponically grown Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) adjusts its physiology and Fe protein composition in vegetative photosynthetic tissue during Fe deficiency. Fe deficiency first affected photosynthetic electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> with concomitant reductions in carbon assimilation and biomass production when effects on respiration were not yet significant. Photosynthetic electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> function and protein levels of Fe-dependent enzymes were fully recovered upon Fe resupply, indicating that the Fe depletion stress did not cause irreversible secondary damage. At the protein level, ferredoxin, the cytochrome-<i>b<sub>6</sub>f</i> complex, and Fe-containing enzymes of the plastid sulfur assimilation pathway were major targets of Fe deficiency, whereas other Fe-dependent functions were relatively less affected. In coordination, SufA and SufB, two proteins of the plastid Fe-sulfur cofactor assembly pathway, were also diminished early by Fe depletion. Iron depletion reduced mRNA levels for the majority of the affected proteins, indicating that loss of enzyme was not just due to lack of Fe cofactors. SufB and ferredoxin were early targets of transcript down-regulation. The data reveal a hierarchy for Fe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">util</span></strong>ization in photosynthetic tissue and indicate that a program is in place to acclimate to impending Fe deficiency.</p>

F-Actin Mediated Focusing of Vesicles at the Cell Tip Is Essential for Polarized Growth
<p>F-actin has been shown to be essential for tip growth in an array of plant models, including <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. One hypothesis is that diffusion can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> secretory vesicles, while actin plays a regulatory role during secretion. Alternatively, it is possible that actin-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> is necessary to overcome vesicle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> limitations to sustain secretion. Therefore, a quantitative analysis of diffusion, secretion kinetics, and cell geometry is necessary to clarify the role of actin in polarized growth. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis, we first show that secretory vesicles move toward and accumulate at the tip in an actin-dependent manner. We then depolymerized F-actin to decouple vesicle diffusion from actin-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> and measured the diffusion coefficient and concentration of vesicles. Using these values, we constructed a theoretical diffusion-based model for growth, demonstrating that with fast-enough vesicle fusion kinetics, diffusion could support normal cell growth rates. We further refined our model to explore how experimentally extrapolated vesicle fusion kinetics and the size of the secretion zone limit diffusion-based growth. This model predicts that diffusion-mediated growth is dependent on the size of the region of exocytosis at the tip and that diffusion-based growth would be significantly slower than normal cell growth. To further explore the size of the secretion zone, we used a cell wall degradation enzyme cocktail and determined that the secretion zone is smaller than 6 μm in diameter at the tip. Taken together, our results highlight the requirement for active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> in polarized growth and provide important insight into vesicle secretion during tip growth.</p>

Wheat Vacuolar Iron Transporter TaVIT2 Transports Fe and Mn and Is Effective for Biofortification
<p>Increasing the intrinsic nutritional quality of crops, known as biofortification, is viewed as a sustainable approach to alleviate micronutrient deficiencies. In particular, iron deficiency anemia is a major global health issue, but the iron content of staple crops such as wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) is difficult to change because of genetic complexity and homeostasis mechanisms. To identify target genes for the biofortification of wheat, we functionally characterized homologs of the <i>VACUOLAR IRON <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ER</i> (<i>VIT</i>). The wheat genome contains two <i>VIT</i> paralogs, <i>TaVIT1</i> and <i>TaVIT2</i>, which have different expression patterns but are both low in the endosperm. TaVIT2, but not TaVIT1, was able to rescue the growth of a yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) mutant defective in vacuolar iron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>. TaVIT2 also complemented a manganese <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er mutant but not a vacuolar zinc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er mutant. By overexpressing <i>TaVIT2</i> under the control of an endosperm-specific promoter, we achieved a greater than 2-fold increase in iron in white flour fractions, exceeding minimum legal fortification levels in countries such as the United Kingdom. The antinutrient phytate was not increased and the iron in the white flour fraction was bioavailable in vitro, suggesting that food products made from the biofortified flour could contribute to improved iron nutrition. The single-gene approach impacted minimally on plant growth and also was effective in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>). Our results show that by enhancing vacuolar iron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> in the endosperm, this essential micronutrient accumulated in this tissue, bypassing existing homeostatic mechanisms.</p>

Phloem Transport of the Receptor DWARF14 Protein Is Required for Full Function of Strigolactones<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The cell-to-cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> of signaling molecules is essential for multicellular organisms to coordinate the action of their cells. Recent studies identified DWARF14 (D14) as a receptor of strigolactones (SLs), molecules that act as plant hormones and inhibit shoot branching. Here, we demonstrate that <i>RAMOSUS3</i>, a pea ortholog of <i>D14</i>, works as a graft-transmissible signal to suppress shoot branching. In addition, we show that D14 protein is contained in phloem sap and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ed through the phloem to axillary buds in rice. SLs are not required for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> of D14 protein. Disruption of D14 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> weakens the suppression of axillary bud outgrowth of rice. Taken together, we conclude that the D14 protein works as an intercellular signaling molecule to fine-tune SL function. Our findings provide evidence that the intercellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> of a receptor can regulate the action of plant hormones.</p>

Physiological basis of starvation resistance in <i>Drosophila leontia</i>: analysis of sexual dimorphism
<p>Geographically varying starvation stress has often been considered as a natural selector that constrains between-population differences for starvation resistance (SR) in <i>Drosophila</i> species. On the Indian subcontinent, a dozen <i>Drosophila</i> species have shown clinal variations in SR across latitude, but the evolved physiological basis of such contrasting adaptations is largely unknown. In the present study, I untangled the physiological basis of sex-specific as well as between-population divergence for SR in <i>D. leontia</i>, collected across a latitudinal transect of the Indian subcontinent (11°45′–31°19′N). Secondly, I tested the assumptions that hardening to starvation stress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">facil</span></strong>itates an increased survival under subsequent lethal levels of starvation, and such plastic effects differ between the sexes. I observed several interesting results. In contrast to a steeper cline of starvation-related traits with latitude in females, a shallower gradient was observed for males. Females stored higher (~1.3-fold) dry-mass-specific levels of body lipids and glycogen contents, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">util</span></strong>ized these both of these energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resourc</span></strong>es under starvation stress, whereas the starved males metabolized only body lipids as a source of energy. Conversely, the rate of body lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">util</span></strong>ization and threshold need were considerably higher in females as compared with males. Between-population differences were significant for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">storag</span></strong>e levels of energy reserves only, but not for other avenues (rate of metabolite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">util</span></strong>ization and threshold need) of SR for both sexes. These findings indicate that multiple pathways shape the physiological basis of sexual dimorphism for SR in <i>D. leontia</i>. Further, single or multiple bouts of starvation hardening conferred an increased longevity (~4–9 h; <i>P</i><0.001) under subsequent lethal levels of starvation stress for females only, and such plastic responses were consistent with a decrease in rate of metabolite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">util</span></strong>ization. Nevertheless, between-population effects were non-significant for absolute hardening capacity (AHC=<i>K</i><sub>SR</sub>–C). Altogether, these findings suggest that similar evolutionary constraints have resulted in divergent genetic as well as plastic responses to evolve adaptations under starvation stress, and account for the observed sexual dimorphism for basal SR in <i>D. leontia</i>.</p>

Impact of Bystander Automated External Defibrillator Use on Survival and Functional Outcomes in Shockable Observed Public Cardiac Arrests

Although shockable OHCA accounts for only ≈25% of overall arrests, ≈60% of public OHCAs are shockable, offering the possibility of restoring thousands of individuals to full recovery with early defibrillation by bystanders. We sought to determine the association of bystander automated external defibrillator use with survival and functional outcomes in shockable observed public OHCA.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>From 2011 to 2015, the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium prospectively collected detailed information on all cardiac arrests at 9 regional centers. The exposures were shock administration by a bystander-applied automated external defibrillator in comparison with initial defibrillation by emergency medical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">servic</span></strong>es. The primary outcome measure was discharge with normal or near-normal (favorable) functional status defined as a modified Rankin Score ≤2.

Modulation of Cl<sup>−</sup> signaling and ion transport by recruitment of kinases and phosphatases mediated by the regulatory protein IRBIT
<p>IRBIT is a multifunctional protein that controls the activity of various epithelial ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers including NBCe1-B. Interaction with IRBIT increases NBCe1-B activity and exposes two cryptic Cl<sup>−</sup>-sensing GXXXP sites that enable regulation of NBCe1-B by intracellular Cl<sup>−</sup> (Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub>). Here, phosphoproteomic analysis revealed that IRBIT controlled five phosphorylation sites in NBCe1-B that determined both the active conformation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er and its regulation by Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub>. Mutational analysis suggested that the phosphorylation status of Ser<sup>232</sup>, Ser<sup>233</sup>, and Ser<sup>235</sup> was regulated by IRBIT and determined whether NBCe1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers are in active or inactive conformations. The absence of phosphorylation at Ser<sup>232</sup>, Ser<sup>233</sup>, or Ser<sup>235</sup> produced NBCe1-B in the conformations pSer<sup>233</sup>/pSer<sup>235</sup>, pSer<sup>232</sup>/pSer<sup>235</sup>, or pSer<sup>232</sup>/pSer<sup>233</sup>, respectively. The activity of the pSer<sup>233</sup>/pSer<sup>235</sup> form was similar to that of IRBIT-activated NBCe1-B, but it was insensitive to inhibition by Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub>. The properties of the pSer<sup>232</sup>/pSer<sup>235</sup> form were similar to those of wild-type NBCe1-B, whereas the pSer<sup>232</sup>/pSer<sup>233</sup> form was partially active, further activated by IRBIT, but retained inhibition by Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub>. Furthermore, IRBIT recruited the phosphatase PP1 and the kinase SPAK to control phosphorylation of Ser<sup>65</sup>, which affected Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub> sensing by the <sup>32</sup>GXXXP<sup>36</sup> motif. IRBIT also recruited the phosphatase calcineurin and the kinase CaMKII to control phosphorylation of Ser<sup>12</sup>, which affected Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub> sensing by the <sup>194</sup>GXXXP<sup>198</sup> motif. Ser<sup>232</sup>, Ser<sup>233</sup>, and Ser<sup>235</sup> are conserved in all NBCe1 variants and affect their activity. These findings reveal how multiple kinase and phosphatase pathways use phosphorylation sites to fine-tune a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er, which have important implications for epithelial fluid and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> secretion.</p>

Enhanced water permeability and tunable ion selectivity in subnanometer carbon nanotube porins

Vacuolar Phosphate Transporters Contribute to Systemic Phosphate Homeostasis Vital for Reproductive Development in Arabidopsis
<p>Vacuolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">storag</span></strong>e of phosphate (Pi) is essential for Pi homeostasis in plants. Recent studies have identified a family of vacuolar Pi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers, VPTs (PHT5s), responsible for vacuolar sequestration of Pi. We report here that both VPT1 and VPT3 contribute to cytosol-to-vacuole Pi partitioning. Although VPT1 plays a predominant role, VPT3 is particularly important when VPT1 is absent. Our data suggested that the <i>vpt1 vpt3</i> double mutant was more defective in Pi homeostasis than the <i>vpt1</i> single mutant, as indicated by Pi accumulation capacity, vacuolar Pi influx, subcellular Pi allocation, and plant adaptability to changing Pi status. The remaining member of the VPT family, VPT2 (PHT5;2), did not appear to contribute to Pi homeostasis in such assays. Particularly interesting is the finding that the <i>vpt1 vpt3</i> double mutant was impaired in reproductive development with shortened siliques and impaired seed set under sufficient Pi, and this phenotype was not found in the <i>vpt1 vpt2</i> and <i>vpt2 vpt3</i> double mutants. Measurements of Pi contents revealed Pi over-accumulation in the floral organs of <i>vpt1 vpt3</i> as compared with the wild type. Further analysis identified excess Pi in the pistil as inhibitory to pollen tube growth, and thus seed yield, in the mutant plants. Reducing the Pi levels in culture medium or mutation of PHO1, a Pi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> protein responsible for root-shoot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>, restored the seed set of <i>vpt1 vpt3</i>. Thus, VPTs, through their function in vacuolar Pi sequestration, control the fine-tuning of systemic Pi allocation, which is particularly important for reproductive development.</p>

OsPHT1;3 Mediates Uptake, Translocation, and Remobilization of Phosphate under Extremely Low Phosphate Regimes
<p>Plant roots rely on inorganic orthophosphate (Pi) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers to acquire soluble Pi from soil solutions that exists at micromolar levels in natural ecosystems. Here, we functionally characterized a rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) Pi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er, Os Phosphate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er-1;3 (OsPHT1;3), that mediates Pi uptake, translocation, and remobilization. <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> was directly regulated by Os Phosphate Starvation Response-2 and, in response to Pi starvation, showed enhanced expression in young leaf blades and shoot basal regions and even more so in roots and old leaf blades. OsPHT1;3 was able to complement a yeast mutant strain defective in five Pi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers and mediate Pi influx in <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes. Overexpression of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> led to increased Pi concentration both in roots and shoots. However, unlike that reported for other known OsPHT1 members that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">facil</span></strong>itate Pi uptake at relatively higher Pi levels, mutation of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> impaired Pi uptake and root-to-shoot Pi translocation only when external Pi concentration was below 5 μ<sc>m</sc>. Moreover, in basal nodes, the expression of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> was restricted to the phloem of regular vascular bundles and enlarged vascular bundles. An isotope labeling experiment with <sup>32</sup>P showed that <i>ospht1</i>;<i>3</i> mutant lines were impaired in remobilization of Pi from source to sink leaves. Furthermore, overexpression and mutation of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> led to reciprocal alteration in the expression of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>2</i> and several other <i>OsPHT1</i> genes. Yeast-two-hybrid, bimolecular fluorescence complementation, and coimmunoprecipitation assays all demonstrated a physical interaction between OsPHT1;3 and OsPHT1;2. Taken together, our results indicate that OsPHT1;3 acts as a crucial factor for Pi acquisition, root-to-shoot Pi translocation, and redistribution of phosphorus in plants growing in environments with extremely low Pi levels.</p>

Consensus Coexpression Network Analysis Identifies Key Regulators of Flower and Fruit Development in Wild Strawberry
<p>The diploid strawberry, <i>Fragaria vesca</i>, is a developing model system for the economically important Rosaceae family. Strawberry fleshy fruit develops from the floral receptacle and its ripening is nonclimacteric. The external seed configuration of strawberry fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">facil</span></strong>itates the study of seed-to-fruit cross tissue communication, particularly phytohormone biosynthesis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>. To investigate strawberry fruit development, we previously generated spatial and temporal transcriptome data profiling <i>F. vesca</i> flower and fruit development pre- and postfertilization. In this study, we combined 46 of our existing RNA-seq libraries to generate coexpression networks using the Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis package in R. We then applied a post-hoc consensus clustering approach and used bootstrapping to demonstrate consensus clustering’s ability to produce robust and reproducible clusters. Further, we experimentally tested hypotheses based on the networks, including increased iron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> from the receptacle to the seed postfertilization and characterized a <i>F. vesca</i> floral mutant and its candidate gene. To increase their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">util</span></strong>ity, the networks are presented in a web interface (<ext-link>www.fv.rosaceaefruits.org</ext-link>) for easy exploration and identification of coexpressed genes. Together, the work reported here illustrates ways to generate robust networks optimized for the mining of large transcriptome data sets, thereby providing a useful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resourc</span></strong>e for hypothesis generation and experimental design in strawberry and related Rosaceae fruit crops.</p>

An Iron-Activated Citrate Transporter, MtMATE67, Is Required for Symbiotic Nitrogen Fixation<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Iron (Fe) is an essential micronutrient for symbiotic nitrogen fixation in legume nodules, where it is required for the activity of bacterial nitrogenase, plant leghemoglobin, respiratory oxidases, and other Fe proteins in both organisms. Fe solubility and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> within and between plant tissues is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">facil</span></strong>itated by organic chelators, such as nicotianamine and citrate. We have characterized a nodule-specific citrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er of the multidrug and toxic compound extrusion family, MtMATE67 of <i>Medicago truncatula</i>. The MtMATE67 gene was induced early during nodule development and expressed primarily in the invasion zone of mature nodules. The MtMATE67 protein was localized to the plasma membrane of nodule cells and also the symbiosome membrane surrounding bacteroids in infected cells. In oocytes, MtMATE67 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ed citrate out of cells in an Fe-activated manner. Loss of <i>MtMATE67</i> gene function resulted in accumulation of Fe in the apoplasm of nodule cells and a substantial decrease in symbiotic nitrogen fixation and plant growth. Taken together, the results point to a primary role of MtMATE67 in citrate efflux from nodule cells in response to an Fe signal. This efflux is necessary to ensure Fe(III) solubility and mobility in the apoplasm and uptake into nodule cells. Likewise, MtMATE67-mediated citrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> into the symbiosome space would increase the solubility and availability of Fe(III) for rhizobial bacteroids.</p>

Improving Plant Nitrogen Use Efficiency through Alteration of Amino Acid Transport Processes
<p>Improving the efficiency of nitrogen (N) uptake and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">util</span></strong>ization in plants could potentially increase crop yields while reducing N fertilization and, subsequently, environmental pollution. Within most plants, N is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ed primarily as amino acids. In this study, pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) plants overexpressing <i>AMINO ACID PERMEASE1</i> (<i>AAP1</i>) were used to determine if and how genetic manipulation of amino acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> from source to sink affects plant N use efficiency. The modified plants were grown under low, moderate, or high N fertilization regimes. The results showed that, independent of the N nutrition, the engineered plants allocate more N via the vasculature to the shoot and seeds and produce more biomass and higher seed yields than wild-type plants. Dependent on the amount of N supplied, the <i>AAP1</i>-overexpressing plants displayed improved N uptake or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">util</span></strong>ization efficiency, or a combination of the two. They also showed significantly increased N use efficiency in N-deficient as well as in N-rich soils and, impressively, required half the amount of N to produce as many fruits and seeds as control plants. Together, these data support that engineering N allocation from source to sink presents an effective strategy to produce crop plants with improved productivity as well as N use efficiency in a range of N environments.</p>

Outside-Xylem Vulnerability, Not Xylem Embolism, Controls Leaf Hydraulic Decline during Dehydration<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[CC-BY]</sup></xref>
<p>Leaf hydraulic supply is crucial to maintaining open stomata for CO<sub>2</sub> capture and plant growth. During drought-induced dehydration, the leaf hydraulic conductance (<i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub>) declines, which contributes to stomatal closure and, eventually, to leaf death. Previous studies have tended to attribute the decline of <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> to embolism in the leaf vein xylem. We visualized at high resolution and quantified experimentally the hydraulic vulnerability of xylem and outside-xylem pathways and modeled their respective influences on plant water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>. Evidence from all approaches indicated that the decline of <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> during dehydration arose first and foremost due to the vulnerability of outside-xylem tissues. In vivo x-ray microcomputed tomography of dehydrating leaves of four diverse angiosperm species showed that, at the turgor loss point, only small fractions of leaf vein xylem conduits were embolized, and substantial xylem embolism arose only under severe dehydration. Experiments on an expanded set of eight angiosperm species showed that outside-xylem hydraulic vulnerability explained 75% to 100% of <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> decline across the range of dehydration from mild water stress to beyond turgor loss point. Spatially explicit modeling of leaf water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> pointed to a role for reduced membrane conductivity consistent with published data for cells and tissues. Plant-scale modeling suggested that outside-xylem hydraulic vulnerability can protect the xylem from tensions that would induce embolism and disruption of water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> under mild to moderate soil and atmospheric droughts. These findings pinpoint outside-xylem tissues as a central locus for the control of leaf and plant water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> during progressive drought.</p>

SHADE AVOIDANCE 4 Is Required for Proper Auxin Distribution in the Hypocotyl
<p>The phytohormone auxin is involved in virtually every aspect of plant growth and development. Through polar auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>, auxin gradients can be established, which then direct plant differentiation and growth. Shade avoidance responses are well-known processes that require polar auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>. In this study, we have identified a mutant, <i>shade avoidance 4</i> (<i>sav4</i>), defective in shade-induced hypocotyl elongation and basipetal auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>. <i>SAV4</i> encodes an unknown protein with armadillo repeat- and tetratricopeptide repeat-like domains known to provide protein-protein interaction surfaces. C terminally yellow fluorescent protein-tagged SAV4 localizes to both the plasma membrane and the nucleus. Membrane-localized SAV4 displays a polar association with the shootward plasma membrane domain in hypocotyl and root cells, which appears to be necessary for its function in hypocotyl elongation. Cotransfection of SAV4 and ATP-binding cassette B1 (ABCB1) auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>) revealed that SAV4 blocks ABCB1-mediated auxin efflux. We thus propose that polarly localized SAV4 acts to inhibit ABCB-mediated auxin efflux toward shoots and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">facil</span></strong>itates the establishment of proper auxin gradients.</p>

Starch Turnover and Metabolism during Flower and Early Embryo Development
<p>The accumulation of starch within photosynthetic tissues and within dedicated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">storag</span></strong>e organs has been characterized extensively in many species, and a function in buffering carbon availability or in fueling later growth phases, respectively, has been proposed. However, developmentally regulated starch turnover within heterotrophic tissues other than dedicated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">storag</span></strong>e organs is poorly characterized, and its function is not well understood. Here, we report on the characterization of starch turnover during flower, early embryo, and silique development in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) using a combined clearing-staining technique on whole-mount tissue. Besides the two previously documented waves of transient starch accumulation in the stamen envelope, occurring during meiosis and pollen mitosis I, we identified a novel, third wave of starch amylogenesis/amylolysis during the last stages of stamen development. To gain insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms, we analyzed publicly available microarray data, which revealed a developmentally coordinated expression of carbohydrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> and metabolism genes during these waves of transient starch accumulation. Based on this analysis, we characterized starch dynamics in mutants affecting hexose phosphate metabolism and translocation, and identified the Glc-6-phosphate/phosphate antiporter GPT1 as the putative translocator of Glc-6-phosphate for starch biosynthesis in reproductive tissues. Based on these results, we propose a model of starch synthesis within the pollen grain and discuss the nutrient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> route feeding the embryo within the developing seed.</p>

The HvNramp5 Transporter Mediates Uptake of Cadmium and Manganese, But Not Iron
<p>The Natural Resistance Associated Macrophage Protein (Nramp) represents a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er family for metal ions in all organisms. Here, we functionally characterized a member of Nramp family in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), HvNramp5. This member showed different expression patterns, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> substrate specificity, and cellular localization from its close homolog in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), OsNramp5, although HvNramp5 was also localized to the plasma membrane. <i>HvNramp5</i> was mainly expressed in the roots and its expression was not affected by Cd and deficiency of Zn, Cu, and Mn, but slightly up-regulated by Fe deficiency. Spatial expression analysis showed that the expression of <i>HvNramp5</i> was higher in the root tips than that in the basal root regions. Furthermore, analysis with laser microdissection revealed higher expression of <i>HvNramp5</i> in the outer root cell layers. HvNramp5 showed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> activity for both Mn<sup>2+</sup> and Cd<sup>2+</sup>, but not for Fe<sup>2+</sup> when expressed in yeast. Immunostaining with a HvNramp5 antibody showed that this protein was localized in the root epidermal cells without polarity. Knockdown of <i>HvNramp5</i> in barley resulted in a significant reduction in the seedling growth at low Mn supply, but this reduction was rescued at high Mn supply. The concentration of Mn and Cd, but not other metals including Cu, Zn, and Fe, was decreased in both the roots and shoots of knockdown lines compared with the wild-type barley. These results indicate that HvNramp5 is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er required for uptake of Mn and Cd, but not for Fe, and that barley has a distinct uptake system from rice.</p>

Endocrine regulation of carbonate precipitate formation in marine fish intestine by stanniocalcin and PTHrP
<p>In marine fish, high epithelial bicarbonate secretion by the intestine generates luminal carbonate precipitates of divalent cations that play a key role in water and ion homeostasis. <i>In vitro</i> studies highlight the involvement of the calciotropic hormones PTHrP (parathyroid hormone-related protein) and stanniocalcin (STC) in the regulation of epithelial bicarbonate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>. The present study tested the hypothesis that calciotropic hormones have a regulatory role in carbonate precipitate formation <i>in vivo</i>. Sea bream (<i>Sparus aurata</i>) juveniles received single intraperitoneal injections of piscine PTHrP(1–34), the PTH/PTHrP receptor antagonist PTHrP(7–34) or purified sea bream STC, or were passively immunized with polyclonal rabbit antisera raised against sea bream STC (STC-Ab). Endocrine effects on the expression of the basolateral sodium bicarbonate co-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er (Slc4a4.A), the apical anion exchangers Slc26a6.A and Slc26a3.B, and the V-type proton pump β-subunit (Atp6v1b) in the anterior intestine were evaluated. In keeping with their calciotropic nature, the hypocalcaemic factors PTHrP(7–34) and STC up-regulated gene expression of all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers. In contrast, the hypercalcaemic factor PTHrP(1–34) and STC antibodies down-regulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers involved in the bicarbonate secretion cascade. Changes in intestine luminal precipitate contents provoked by calcaemic endocrine factors validated these results: 24 h post-injection either PTHrP(1–34) or immunization with STC-Ab reduced the carbonate precipitate content in the sea bream intestine. In contrast, the PTH/PTHrP receptor antagonist PTHrP(7–34) increased not only the precipitated fraction but also the concentration of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> equivalents in the intestinal fluid. These results confirm the hypothesis that calciotropic hormones have a regulatory role in carbonate precipitate formation <i>in vivo</i> in the intestine of marine fish. Furthermore, they illustrate for the first time in fish the counteracting effect of PTHrP and STC, and reveal an unexpected contribution of calcaemic factors to acid–base balance.</p>

Skeletal muscle fuel selection occurs at the mitochondrial level
<p>Mammals exponentially increase the rate of carbohydrate oxidation as exercise intensity rises, while birds combust lipid almost exclusively while flying at high percentages of aerobic capacity. The fuel oxidized by contracting muscle depends on many factors: whole-body fuel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">storag</span></strong>e mass, mobilization, blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>, cellular uptake, and substrate selection at the level of the mitochondrion. We examined the fuel preferences of mitochondria isolated from mammalian and avian locomotory muscles using two approaches. First, the influence of substrates on the kinetics of respiration (<i>K</i><sub>m,ADP</sub> and <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>) was evaluated. For all substrates and combinations, <i>K</i><sub>m,ADP</sub> was generally twofold higher in avian mitochondria. Second, fuel competition between pyruvate, glutamate and/or palmitoyl-<sc>l</sc>-carnitine at three levels of ATP free energy was determined using the principle of mass balance and the measured rates of O<sub>2</sub> consumption and metabolite accumulation/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">util</span></strong>ization. Avian mitochondria strongly spared pyruvate from oxidation when another substrate was available and fatty acid was the dominant substrate, regardless of energy state. Mammalian mitochondria exhibited some preference for fatty acid over pyruvate at lower flux (higher energy state), but exhibited a much greater tendency to select pyruvate and glutamate when available. Studies in sonicated mitochondria revealed twofold higher electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> chain electron conductance in avian mitochondria. We conclude that substantial fuel selection occurs at the level of the mitochondrial matrix and that avian flight muscle mitochondria are particularly biased toward the selection of fatty acid, possibly by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">facil</span></strong>itating high β-oxidation flux by maintaining a more oxidized matrix.</p>

The impact of pharmacological MC1-R activation on atherosclerosis was assessed in apolipoprotein E–deficient mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Characterization of human and mouse atherosclerotic plaques revealed that MC1-R expression localizes in lesional macrophages and is significantly associated with the ATP-binding cassette <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers ABCA1 and ABCG1, which are responsible for initiating reverse cholesterol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>. Using bone marrow–derived macrophages, we observed that α-melanocyte–stimulating hormone and selective MC1-R agonists similarly promoted cholesterol efflux, which is a counterregulatory mechanism against foam cell formation. Mechanistically, MC1-R activation upregulated the levels of ABCA1 and ABCG1. These effects were accompanied by a reduction in cell surface CD36 expression and in cholesterol uptake, further protecting macrophages from excessive lipid accumulation. Conversely, macrophages deficient in functional MC1-R displayed a phenotype with impaired efflux and enhanced uptake of cholesterol.

Altered Expression of a Malate-Permeable Anion Channel, OsALMT4, Disrupts Mineral Nutrition
<p>Aluminum-activated malate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers (ALMTs) form a family of anion channels in plants, but little is known about most of its members. This study examined the function of <i>OsALMT4</i> from rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). We show that <i>OsALMT4</i> is expressed in roots and shoots and that the OsALMT4 protein localizes to the plasma membrane. Transgenic rice lines overexpressing (OX) <i>OsALMT4</i> released malate from the roots constitutively and had 2-fold higher malate concentrations in the xylem sap than nulls, indicating greater concentrations of malate in the apoplast. OX lines developed brown necrotic spots on the leaves that did not appear on nulls. These symptoms were not associated with altered concentrations of any mineral element in the leaves, although the OX lines had higher concentrations of Mn and B in their grain compared with nulls. While total leaf Mn concentrations were not different between the OX and null lines, Mn concentrations in the apoplast were greater in the OX plants. The OX lines also displayed increased expression of Mn <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers and were more sensitive to Mn toxicity than null plants. We showed that the growth of wild-type rice was unaffected by 100 µ<sc>m</sc> Mn in hydroponics but, when combined with 1 m<sc>m</sc> malate, this concentration inhibited growth. We conclude that increasing <i>OsALMT4</i> expression affected malate efflux and compartmentation within the tissues, which increased Mn concentrations in the apoplast of leaves and induced the toxicity symptoms. This study reveals new links between malate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> and mineral nutrition.</p>

Impaired Malate and Fumarate Accumulation Due to the Mutation of the Tonoplast Dicarboxylate Transporter Has Little Effects on Stomatal Behavior
<p>Malate is a central metabolite involved in a multiplicity of plant metabolic pathways, being associated with mitochondrial metabolism and playing significant roles in stomatal movements. Vacuolar malate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> has been characterized at the molecular level and is performed by at least one carrier protein and two channels in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) vacuoles. The absence of the Arabidopsis tonoplast Dicarboxylate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er (tDT) in the <i>tdt</i> knockout mutant was associated previously with an impaired accumulation of malate and fumarate in leaves. Here, we investigated the consequences of this lower accumulation on stomatal behavior and photosynthetic capacity as well as its putative metabolic impacts. Neither the stomatal conductance nor the kinetic responses to dark, light, or high CO<sub>2</sub> were highly affected in <i>tdt</i> plants. In addition, we did not observe any impact on stomatal aperture following incubation with abscisic acid, malate, or citrate. Furthermore, an effect on photosynthetic capacity was not observed in the mutant lines. However, leaf mitochondrial metabolism was affected in the <i>tdt</i> plants. Levels of the intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle were altered, and increases in both light and dark respiration were observed. We conclude that manipulation of the tonoplastic organic acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er impacted mitochondrial metabolism, while the overall stomatal and photosynthetic capacity were unaffected.</p>

<p>Protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> between organelles is an essential process in all eukaryotic cells and is mediated by the regulation of processes such as vesicle formation, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>, docking, and fusion. In animals, SCY1-LIKE2 (SCYL2) binds to clathrin and has been shown to play roles in trans-Golgi network-mediated clathrin-coated vesicle trafficking. Here, we demonstrate that SCYL2A and SCYL2B, which are Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) homologs of animal SCYL2, are vital for plant cell growth and root hair development. Studies of the SCYL2 isoforms using multiple single or double loss-of-function alleles show that SCYL2B is involved in root hair development and that SCYL2A and SCYL2B are essential for plant growth and development and act redundantly in those processes. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and a β-glucuronidase-aided promoter assay show that <i>SCYL2A</i> and <i>SCYL2B</i> are differentially expressed in various tissues. We also show that SCYL2 proteins localize to the Golgi, trans-Golgi network, and prevacuolar compartment and colocalize with Clathrin Heavy Chain1 (CHC1). Furthermore, bimolecular fluorescence complementation and coimmunoprecipitation data show that SCYL2B interacts with CHC1 and two Soluble NSF Attachment Protein Receptors (SNAREs): Vesicle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> through t-SNARE Interaction11 (VTI11) and VTI12. Finally, we present evidence that the root hair tip localization of Cellulose Synthase-Like D3 is dependent on SCYL2B. These findings suggest the role of SCYL2 genes in plant cell developmental processes via clathrin-mediated vesicle membrane trafficking.</p>

Transcription Factor AREB2 Is Involved in Soluble Sugar Accumulation by Activating Sugar Transporter and Amylase Genes
<p>Sugars play important roles in plant growth and development, crop yield and quality, as well as responses to abiotic stresses. Abscisic acid (ABA) is a multifunctional hormone. However, the exact mechanism by which ABA regulates sugar accumulation is largely unknown in plants. Here, we tested the expression profile of several sugar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er and amylase genes in response to ABA treatment. <i>MdSUT2</i> and <i>MdAREB2</i> were isolated and genetically transformed into apple (<i>Malus domestica</i>) to investigate their roles in ABA-induced sugar accumulation. The MdAREB2 transcription factor was found to bind to the promoters of the sugar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er and amylase genes and activate their expression. Both MdAREB2 and MdSUT2 transgenic plants produced more soluble sugars than controls. Furthermore, MdAREB2 promoted the accumulation of sucrose and soluble sugars in an <i>MdSUT2</i>-dependent manner. Our results demonstrate that the ABA-responsive transcription factor MdAREB2 directly activates the expression of amylase and sugar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er genes to promote soluble sugar accumulation, suggesting a mechanism by which ABA regulates sugar accumulation in plants.</p>

A Light Harvesting Complex-Like Protein in Maintenance of Photosynthetic Components in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>
<p>Using a genetic approach, we have identified and characterized a novel protein, named Msf1 (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance factor for photosystem I), that is required for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance of specific components of the photosynthetic apparatus in the green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>. Msf1 belongs to the superfamily of light-harvesting complex proteins with three transmembrane domains and consensus chlorophyll-binding sites. Loss of Msf1 leads to reduced accumulation of photosystem I and chlorophyll-binding proteins/complexes. Msf1is a component of a thylakoid complex containing key enzymes of the tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway, thus revealing a possible link between Msf1 and chlorophyll biosynthesis. Protein interaction assays and greening experiments demonstrate that Msf1 interacts with Copper target homolog1 (CHL27B) and accumulates concomitantly with chlorophyll in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>, implying that chlorophyll stabilizes Msf1. Contrary to other light-harvesting complex-like genes, the expression of <i>Msf1</i> is not stimulated by high-light stress, but its protein level increases significantly under heat shock, iron and copper limitation, as well as in stationary cells. Based on these results, we propose that Msf1 is required for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance of photosystem I and specific protein-chlorophyll complexes especially under certain stress conditions.</p>

Rice Sucrose Partitioning Mediated by a Putative Pectin Methyltransferase and Homogalacturonan Methylesterification
<p>Homogalacturonan (HG) is the main component of pectins. HG methylesterification has recently emerged as a key determinant controlling cell attachment, organ formation, and phyllotaxy. However, whether and how HG methylesterification affects intercellular metabolite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> has rarely been reported. Here, we identified and characterized knockout mutants of the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) <i>OsQUA2</i> gene encoding a putative pectin methyltransferase. <i>Osqua2</i> mutants exhibit a remarkable decrease in the degree of methylesterification of HG in the culm-sieve element cell wall and a markedly reduced grain yield. The culm of <i>Osqua2</i> mutant plants contains excessive sucrose (Suc), and a <sup>13</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> feeding experiment showed that the Suc overaccumulation in the culm was caused by blocked Suc translocation. These and other findings demonstrate that OsQUA2 is essential for maintaining a high degree of methylesterification of HG in the rice culm-sieve element cell wall, which may be critical for efficient Suc partitioning and grain filling. In addition, our results suggest that the apoplastic pathway is involved in long-distance Suc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> in rice. The identification and characterization of the <i>OsQUA2</i> gene and its functionality revealed a previously unknown contribution of HG methylesterification and provided insight into how modification of the cell wall regulates intercellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> in plants.</p>

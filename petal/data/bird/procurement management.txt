Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Phosphatases Affect UV-B-Induced Stomatal Closure via Controlling NO in Guard Cells
<p>Ultraviolet B (UV-B) radiation induces the activation of MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE PHOSPHATASE1 (MKP1) and its targets MPK3 and MPK6, but whether they participate in UV-B guard cell signaling is not clear. Here, evidence shows that UV-B-induced stomatal closure in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) is antagonistically regulated by MKP1 and MPK6 via modulating hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)-induced nitric oxide (NO) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion in guard cells. The <i>mkp1</i> mutant was hypersensitive to UV-B-induced stomatal closure and NO <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion in guard cells but not to UV-B-induced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion, suggesting that MKP1 negatively regulates UV-B-induced stomatal closure via inhibiting NO generation in guard cells. Moreover, MPK3 and MPK6 were activated by UV-B in leaves of the wild type and hyperactivated in the <i>mkp1</i> mutant, but the UV-B-induced activation of MPK3 and MPK6 was largely inhibited in mutants for <i>ATRBOHD</i> and <i>ATRBOHF</i> but not in mutants for <i>NIA1</i> and <i>NIA2</i>. <i>mpk6</i> mutants showed defects of UV-B-induced NO <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion and stomatal closure but were normal in UV-B-induced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion, while stomata of <i>mpk3</i> mutants responded to UV-B just like those of the wild type. The defect of UV-B-induced stomatal closure in <i>mpk6</i> mutants was rescued by exogenous NO but not by exogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Furthermore, double mutant <i>mkp1</i>/<i>mpk6</i> and the single mutant <i>mpk6</i> showed the same responses to UV-B in terms of either stomatal movement or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and NO <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion. These data indicate that MPK6, but not MPK3, positively regulates UV-B-induced stomatal closure via acting downstream of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and upstream of NO, while MKP1 functions negatively in UV-B guard cell signaling via down-regulation of MPK6.</p>

Reproduction-related variation in carbon allocation to woody tissues in <i>Fagus crenata</i> using a natural <sup>13</sup>C approach
<p>The contribution of new photo-assimilates and stored carbon (C) to plant growth remains poorly understood, especially during re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion. In order to elucidate how mast seeding affects C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation to both re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ive and vegetative tissues, we measured biomass increase in each tissue, branch starch concentration and stable C isotope composition (δ<sup>13</sup>C) in bulk leaves, current-year shoots, 3-year branches and tree rings in fruiting and non-fruiting trees for 2 years, as well as in fruits. We isolated the effect of re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion on C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation to vegetative growth by comparing <sup>13</sup>C enrichment in woody tissues in fruiting and non-fruiting specimens. Compared with 2‰ <sup>13</sup>C enrichment in shoots relative to leaves from non-fruiting trees, fruiting reduced the enrichment to 1‰ and this reduction disappeared in the following year with no fruiting, indicating that new photo-assimilates are preferentially used for woody tissues even with fruiting burden. In contrast, fruits had up to 2.5‰ <sup>13</sup>C enrichment at mid-summer, which dropped thereafter, indicating that fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion relies on C storage early in the growing season then shifts to current photo-assimilates. At this tipping point, growth of shoots and cupules had almost finished and nuts had a second rapid growth period thereafter. Together with shorter shoots but higher biomass increment per length in fruiting trees than non-fruiting trees, these results indicate that the C limitation due to fruit burden is minimized by fine-tuning of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation of old C stores and new photo-assimilates, along with the growth pattern in various tissues. Furthermore, fruiting had no significant effect on starch concentration in 3-year-old branches, which became fully depleted during leaf and flower flushing but were quickly replenished. These results indicate that re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion affects C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation to branches but not its source or storage. These re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion-related variations in the fate of C have implications for evaluating forest ecosystem C cycles during climate change.</p>

Acclimation of <i>Betula alleghaniensis</i> Britton to moderate soil water deficit: small morphological changes make for important consequences in crown display
<p>In the context of the predicted increasing frequency of summer droughts in the northeastern deciduous forest of North America due to climate change, we investigated the acclimation capacity of yellow birch, an economically important native tree species, to soil water deficit. We carried out an integrated examination of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation of biomass, leaf physiology, branching pattern and in situ 3D crown display. Potted seedlings were subjected to moderate soil water deficit for four consecutive months during their second growing season. Individuals under soil water deficit showed a 40% decrease in biomass accumulation but no change in the relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation of biomass to the different plant compartments. Net CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rates at leaf level decreased under water deficit (~15%) but could not alone explain the total reduction in growth, excluding the carbon starvation hypothesis. The observed reduction in net CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rates was related to a decrease in stomatal conductance and chlorophyll content. <i>STAR</i><sub>zen</sub> (in situ silhouette to total leaf area ratio; a proxy for light interception efficiency) decreased under soil water deficit due to shifts in biomass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation within the branch compartment from long upper axes to short bottom axes. Despite the fact that the understanding of the processes involved in growth reduction and branching pattern alteration will need more attention in future research, we conclude that under water deficit yellow birch at young stages will: (i) experience a substantial loss of growth and biomass; and (ii) acclimate through architectural plasticity rather than through changes in the relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation of root biomass to enhance its water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement.</p>

Ecophysiological variables influencing Aleppo pine seed and cone production: a review
<p>The most interesting factors associated with seed and cone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of Aleppo pine were largely reviewed to identify broad patterns and potential effectiveness of reforestation efforts and planning. Aleppo pine cone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion and seed yields are relatively variable, with differences between spatial and temporal influences. These differences are considered, mainly between (i) year, (ii) stand characteristics and (iii) individual tree measurements. Annual variability among populations was recorded for cone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion per tree, based on influencing factors such as genetic characteristics, wetness, nutrient availability, insect pests and disease. In addition, some factors may affect Aleppo pine tree growth directly but may be affecting seed and cone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion indirectly. Therefore, reduced stand density results in less competition among Aleppo pine trees and accompanying understory flora, which subsequently increases the stem diameter and other tree dimensions, including seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion. This review suggests that reforestation planning, particularly thinning, will result in improved tree morphology that will increase Aleppo pine seed and cone crops. Wildfire intensity and stand conditions such as light and soil nutrient status are also examined.</p>

The host microRNA miR-301a blocks the IRF1-mediated neuronal innate immune response to Japanese encephalitis virus infection
<p>Effective recognition of viral components and the subsequent stimulation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of type I interferons (IFNs) is crucial for the induction of host antiviral immunity. The failure of the host to efficiently produce type I IFNs in response to infection by the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is linked with an increased probability for the disease to become lethal. JEV is a neurotropic virus of the <i>Flaviviridae</i> family that causes encephalitis in humans. JEV infection is regulated by several host factors, including microRNAs, which are conserved noncoding RNAs that participate in various physiological and pathological processes. We showed that the JEV-induced expression of <i>miR-301a</i> led to inhibition of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of type I IFN by reducing the abundances of the transcription factor IFN regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) and the signaling protein suppressor of cytokine signaling 5 (SOCS5). Mechanistically, induction of <i>miR-301a</i> expression during JEV infection required the transcription factor nuclear factor κB. In mouse neurons, neutralization of miR-301a restored the host innate immune response by enabling IFN-β <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion, thereby restricting viral propagation. Inhibition of miR-301a in mouse brain rescued the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of IRF1 and SOCS5, increased the generation of IFN-β, and reduced the extent of JEV replication, thus improving mouse survival. Thus, our study suggests that the JEV-induced expression of <i>miR-301a</i> assists viral pathogenesis by suppressing IFN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion, which might be targeted by antiviral therapies.</p>

Differential IL-2 expression defines developmental fates of follicular versus nonfollicular helper T cells
<p>In response to infection, naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells differentiate into two subpopulations: T follicular helper (T<sub>FH</sub>) cells, which support B cell antibody <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion, and non-T<sub>FH</sub> cells, which enhance innate immune cell functions. Interleukin-2 (IL-2), the major cytokine produced by naive T cells, plays an important role in the developmental divergence of these populations. However, the relationship between IL-2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion and fate determination remains unclear. Using reporter mice, we found that differential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of IL-2 by naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells defined precursors fated for different immune functions. IL-2 producers, which were fated to become T<sub>FH</sub> cells, delivered IL-2 to nonproducers destined to become non-T<sub>FH</sub> cells. Because IL-2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion was limited to cells receiving the strongest T cell receptor (TCR) signals, a direct link between TCR-signal strength, IL-2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion, and T cell fate determination has been established.</p>

The scheme can readily be adapted to other species and opens a door to detailed investigations of inelastic or reactive processes.</p>

Leaf Amino Acid Supply Affects Photosynthetic and Plant Nitrogen Use Efficiency under Nitrogen Stress
<p>The coordinated distribution of nitrogen to source leaves and sinks is essential for supporting leaf metabolism while also supplying sufficient nitrogen to seeds for development. This study aimed to understand how regulated amino acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation to leaves affects photosynthesis and overall plant nitrogen use efficiency in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and how soil nitrogen availability influences these processes. Arabidopsis plants with a knockout of <i>AAP2</i>, encoding an amino acid permease involved in xylem-to-phloem transfer of root-derived amino acids, were grown in low-, moderate-, and high-nitrogen environments. We analyzed nitrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation to shoot tissues, photosynthesis, and photosynthetic and plant nitrogen use efficiency in these knockout plants. Our results demonstrate that, independent of nitrogen conditions, <i>aap2</i> plants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ate more nitrogen to leaves than wild-type plants. Increased leaf nitrogen supply positively affected chlorophyll and Rubisco levels, photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency, and carbon assimilation and transport to sinks. The <i>aap2</i> plants outperformed wild-type plants with respect to growth, seed yield and carbon storage pools, and nitrogen use efficiency in both high and deficient nitrogen environments. Overall, this study demonstrates that increasing nitrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation to leaves represents an effective strategy for improving carbon fixation and photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency. The results indicate that an optimized coordination of nitrogen and carbon partitioning processes is critical for high oilseed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion in Arabidopsis, including in plants exposed to limiting nitrogen conditions.</p>

In multivariate analysis, younger age, absence of obesity, absence of diabetes mellitus, shortness of breath, and a short delay between pain onset and call to emergency medical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">servic</span></strong>es were the main predictors of SCA. A score built from these variables predicted SCA, with the risk increasing 2-fold in patients with a score between 10 and 19, 4-fold in those with a score between 20 and 29, and >18-fold in patients with a score ≥30 compared with those with scores <10. The SCA rate was 28.9% in patients with a score ≥30 compared with 1.6% in patients with a score ≤9 (<i>P</i> for trend <0.001). The area under the curve values were 0.7033 in the internal validation sample and 0.6031 in the external validation sample.

mTORC1 amplifies the ATF4-dependent de novo serine-glycine pathway to supply glycine during TGF-β<sub>1</sub>–induced collagen biosynthesis
<p>The differentiation of fibroblasts into a transient population of highly activated, extracellular matrix (ECM)–producing myofibroblasts at sites of tissue injury is critical for normal tissue repair. Excessive myofibroblast accumulation and persistence, often as a result of a failure to undergo apoptosis when tissue repair is complete, lead to pathological fibrosis and are also features of the stromal response in cancer. Myofibroblast differentiation is accompanied by changes in cellular metabolism, including increased glycolysis, to meet the biosynthetic demands of enhanced ECM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion. Here, we showed that transforming growth factor–β<sub>1</sub> (TGF-β<sub>1</sub>), the key pro-fibrotic cytokine implicated in multiple fibrotic conditions, increased the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), the transcriptional master regulator of amino acid metabolism, to supply glucose-derived glycine to meet the amino acid requirements associated with enhanced collagen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion in response to myofibroblast differentiation. We further delineated the signaling pathways involved and showed that TGF-β<sub>1</sub>–induced ATF4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion depended on cooperation between canonical TGF-β<sub>1</sub> signaling through Smad3 and activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and its downstream target eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1). ATF4, in turn, promoted the transcription of genes encoding enzymes of the de novo serine-glycine biosynthetic pathway and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1). Our findings suggest that targeting the TGF-β<sub>1</sub>–mTORC1–ATF4 axis may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for interfering with myofibroblast function in fibrosis and potentially in other conditions, including cancer.</p>

Pivotal role of STIM2, but not STIM1, in IL-4 production by IL-3–stimulated murine basophils
<p>Basophils have nonredundant roles in various immune responses that require Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Here, we examined the role of two Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors, stromal interaction molecule 1 and 2 (STIM1 and STIM2), in basophil activation. We found that loss of STIM1, but not STIM2, impaired basophil IL-4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion after stimulation with immunoglobulin E (IgE)–containing immune complexes. In contrast, when basophils were stimulated with IL-3, loss of STIM2, but not STIM1, reduced basophil IL-4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion. This difference in STIM proteins was associated with distinct time courses of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and transcription of the <i>Il4</i> gene that were elicited by each stimulus. Similarly, basophil-specific STIM1 expression was required for IgE-driven chronic allergic inflammation in vivo, whereas STIM2 was required for IL-4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion after combined IL-3 and IL-33 treatment in mice. These data indicate that STIM1 and STIM2 have differential roles in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of IL-4, which are stimulus dependent. Furthermore, these results illustrate the vital role of STIM2 in basophils, which is often considered to be less important than STIM1.</p>

HIPK2 is necessary for type I interferon–mediated antiviral immunity
<p>Precise control of interferons (IFNs) is crucial to maintain immune homeostasis. Here, we demonstrated that homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) was required for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of type I IFNs in response to RNA virus infection. HIPK2 deficiency markedly impaired IFN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion in macrophages after vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection, and HIPK2-deficient mice were more susceptible to lethal VSV disease than were wild-type mice. After VSV infection, HIPK2 was cleaved by active caspases, which released a hyperactive, N-terminal fragment that translocated to the nucleus and further augmented antiviral responses. In part, HIPK2 interacted with ELF4 and promoted its phosphorylation at Ser<sup>369</sup>, which enabled <i>Ifn-</i>b transcription. In addition, HIPK2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion was stimulated by type I IFNs to further enhance antiviral immunity. These data suggest that the kinase activity and nuclear localization of HIPK2 are essential for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of type I IFNs.</p>

Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate is a major source of GPCR-stimulated phosphoinositide production
<p>Phospholipase C (PLC) enzymes hydrolyze the plasma membrane (PM) lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI4,5P<sub>2</sub>) to generate the second messengers inositol trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) and diacylglycerol (DAG) in response to receptor activation in almost all mammalian cells. We previously found that stimulation of G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) in cardiac cells leads to the PLC-dependent hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) at the Golgi, a process required for the activation of nuclear protein kinase D (PKD) during cardiac hypertrophy. We hypothesized that GPCR-stimulated PLC activation leading to direct PI4P hydrolysis may be a general mechanism for DAG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion. We measured GPCR activation–dependent changes in PM and Golgi PI4P pools in various cells using GFP-based detection of PI4P. Stimulation with various agonists caused a time-dependent reduction in PI4P-associated, but not PI4,5P<sub>2</sub>-associated, fluorescence at the Golgi and PM. Targeted depletion of PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> from the PM before GPCR stimulation had no effect on the depletion of PM or Golgi PI4P, total inositol phosphate (IP) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion, or PKD activation. In contrast, acute depletion of PI4P specifically at the PM completely blocked the GPCR-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of IPs and activation of PKD but did not change the abundance of PI4,5P<sub>2</sub>. Acute depletion of Golgi PI4P had no effect on these processes. These data suggest that most of the PM PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> pool is not involved in GPCR-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis and that PI4P at the PM is responsible for the bulk of receptor-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis and DAG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion.</p>

The assembly of signaling platforms on microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B–light chain 3 (LC3)–decorated endosomal vesicles is required to transduce TLR9 signals that stimulate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of IFN but not interleukin-12 p40 (IL-12p40). LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP), a form of noncanonical autophagy, is critical for the activation of interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) and for IFN synthesis. We showed that after the stimulation of TLR9 by CpG oligonucleotides, the autophagy protein LC3 and the kinase IKKα were recruited to endosomes that contained TLR9. The recruitment of IKKα and LC3 to such signaling endosomes was not stimulated by catalysts of classical autophagosome formation but involved LAP formation, which required ATG5 but not FIP200. In addition, we found that the LC3-IKKα complex further associated with both TRAF3 and IRF7. We identified three putative LC3-interacting regions (LIRs) in IKKα, and mutagenesis suggested that two of these were critical for direct binding to LC3. Moreover, mutation of the same LIR sequences failed to rescue type I IFN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion in IKKα-deficient dendritic cells upon reconstitution. Together, these data suggest a direct link between LAP formation and IKKα recruitment downstream of TLR9 activation that is necessary to facilitate type I IFN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion.</p>

Nuclear PTEN enhances the maturation of a microRNA regulon to limit MyD88-dependent susceptibility to sepsis
<p>Sepsis-induced organ damage is caused by systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), which results in substantial comorbidities. Therefore, it is of medical importance to identify molecular brakes that can be exploited to dampen inflammation and prevent the development of SIRS. We investigated the role of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) in suppressing SIRS, increasing microbial clearance, and preventing lung damage. Septic patients and mice with sepsis exhibited increased <i>PTEN</i> expression in leukocytes. Myeloid-specific <i>Pten</i> deletion in an animal model of sepsis increased bacterial loads and cytokine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion, which depended on enhanced myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) abundance and resulted in mortality. PTEN-mediated induction of the microRNAs (miRNAs) miR125b and miR203b reduced the abundance of MyD88. Loss- and gain-of-function assays demonstrated that PTEN induced miRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion by associating with and facilitating the nuclear localization of Drosha-Dgcr8, part of the miRNA-processing complex. Reconstitution of PTEN-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts with a mutant form of PTEN that does not localize to the nucleus resulted in retention of Drosha-Dgcr8 in the cytoplasm and impaired <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of mature miRNAs. Thus, we identified a regulatory pathway involving nuclear PTEN–mediated miRNA generation that limits the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of MyD88 and thereby limits sepsis-associated mortality.</p>

Shifting habitat mosaics and fish production across river basins
<p>Watersheds are complex mosaics of habitats whose conditions vary across space and time as landscape features filter overriding climate forcing, yet the extent to which the reliability of ecosystem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">servic</span></strong>es depends on these dynamics remains unknown. We quantified how shifting habitat mosaics are expressed across a range of spatial scales within a large, free-flowing river, and how they stabilize the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of Pacific salmon that support valuable fisheries. The strontium isotope records of ear stones (otoliths) show that the relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ivity of locations across the river network, as both natal- and juvenile-rearing habitat, varies widely among years and that this variability is expressed across a broad range of spatial scales, ultimately stabilizing the interannual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of fish at the scale of the entire basin.</p>

Impacts of historical warming on marine fisheries production
<p>Climate change is altering habitats for marine fishes and invertebrates, but the net effect of these changes on potential food <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion is unknown. We used temperature-dependent population models to measure the influence of warming on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ivity of 235 populations of 124 species in 38 ecoregions. Some populations responded significantly positively (<i>n</i> = 9 populations) and others responded significantly negatively (<i>n</i> = 19 populations) to warming, with the direction and magnitude of the response explained by ecoregion, taxonomy, life history, and exploitation history. Hindcasts indicate that the maximum sustainable yield of the evaluated populations decreased by 4.1% from 1930 to 2010, with five ecoregions experiencing losses of 15 to 35%.

Gut bacteria selectively promoted by dietary fibers alleviate type 2 diabetes

We conducted a randomized clinical study of specifically designed isoenergetic diets, together with fecal shotgun metagenomics, to show that a select group of SCFA-producing strains was promoted by dietary fibers and that most other potential producers were either diminished or unchanged in patients with T2DM. When the fiber-promoted SCFA producers were present in greater diversity and abundance, participants had better improvement in hemoglobin A1c levels, partly via increased glucagon-like peptide-1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion. Promotion of these positive responders diminished producers of metabolically detrimental compounds such as indole and hydrogen sulfide.

Metabolic recycling of ammonia via glutamate dehydrogenase supports breast cancer biomass
<p>Ammonia is a ubiquitous by-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong> of cellular metabolism; however, the biological consequences of ammonia <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion are not fully understood, especially in cancer. We found that ammonia is not merely a toxic waste <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong> but is recycled into central amino acid metabolism to maximize nitrogen utilization. In our experiments, human breast cancer cells primarily assimilated ammonia through reductive amination catalyzed by glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH); secondary reactions enabled other amino acids, such as proline and aspartate, to directly acquire this nitrogen. Metabolic recycling of ammonia accelerated proliferation of breast cancer. In mice, ammonia accumulated in the tumor microenvironment and was used directly to generate amino acids through GDH activity. These data show that ammonia is not only a secreted waste <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong> but also a fundamental nitrogen source that can support tumor biomass.</p>

Super-dry reforming of methane intensifies CO<sub>2</sub> utilization via Le Chatelier’s principle
<p>Efficient CO<sub>2</sub> transformation from a waste <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong> to a carbon source for chemicals and fuels will require reaction conditions that effect its reduction. We developed a “super-dry” CH<sub>4</sub> reforming reaction for enhanced CO <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion from CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>. We used Ni/MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> as a CH<sub>4</sub>-reforming catalyst, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> as a solid oxygen carrier, and CaO/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> as a CO<sub>2</sub> sorbent. The isothermal coupling of these three different processes resulted in higher CO <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion as compared with that of conventional dry reforming, by avoiding back reactions with water. The reduction of iron oxide was intensified through CH<sub>4</sub> conversion to syngas over Ni and CO<sub>2</sub> extraction and storage as CaCO<sub>3</sub>. CO<sub>2</sub> is then used for iron reoxidation and CO <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion, exploiting equilibrium shifts effected with inert gas sweeping (Le Chatelier’s principle). Super-dry reforming uses up to three CO<sub>2</sub> molecules per CH<sub>4</sub> and offers a high CO space-time yield of 7.5 millimole CO per second per kilogram of iron at 1023 kelvin.</p>

Positive biodiversity-productivity relationship predominant in global forests
<p>The biodiversity-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ivity relationship (BPR) is foundational to our understanding of the global extinction crisis and its impacts on ecosystem functioning. Understanding BPR is critical for the accurate valuation and effective conservation of biodiversity. Using ground-sourced data from 777,126 permanent plots, spanning 44 countries and most terrestrial biomes, we reveal a globally consistent positive concave-down BPR, showing that continued biodiversity loss would result in an accelerating decline in forest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ivity worldwide. The value of biodiversity in maintaining commercial forest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ivity alone—US$166 billion to 490 billion per year according to our estimation—is more than twice what it would cost to implement effective global conservation.

ABC Transporter-Mediated Transport of Glutathione Conjugates Enhances Seed Yield and Quality in Chickpea
<p>The identification of functionally relevant molecular tags is vital for genomics-assisted crop improvement and enhancement of seed yield, quality, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ivity in chickpea (<i>Cicer arietinum</i>). The simultaneous improvement of yield/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ivity as well as quality traits often requires pyramiding of multiple genes, which remains a major hurdle given various associated epistatic and pleotropic effects. Unfortunately, no single gene that can improve yield/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ivity along with quality and other desirable agromorphological traits is known, hampering the genetic enhancement of chickpea. Using a combinatorial genomics-assisted breeding and functional genomics strategy, this study identified natural alleles and haplotypes of an <i>ABCC3</i>-type transporter gene that regulates seed weight, an important domestication trait, by transcriptional regulation and modulation of the transport of glutathione conjugates in seeds of <i>desi</i> and <i>kabuli</i> chickpea. The superior allele/haplotype of this gene introgressed in <i>desi</i> and <i>kabuli</i> near-isogenic lines enhances the seed weight, yield, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ivity, and multiple desirable plant architecture and seed-quality traits without compromising agronomic performance. These salient findings can expedite crop improvement endeavors and the development of nutritionally enriched high-yielding cultivars in chickpea.</p>

Chloroplast Accumulation Response Enhances Leaf Photosynthesis and Plant Biomass Production
<p>Under high light intensity, chloroplasts avoid absorbing excess light by moving to anticlinal cell walls (avoidance response), but under low light intensity, chloroplasts accumulate along periclinal cell walls (accumulation response). In most plant species, these responses are induced by blue light and are mediated by the blue light photoreceptor, phototropin, which also regulates phototropism, leaf flattening, and stomatal opening. These phototropin-mediated responses could enhance photosynthesis and biomass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion. Here, using various Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants deficient in chloroplast movement, we demonstrated that the accumulation response enhances leaf photosynthesis and plant biomass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion. Conspicuously, <i>phototropin2</i> mutant plants specifically defective in the avoidance response but not in other phototropin-mediated responses displayed a constitutive accumulation response irrespective of light intensities, enhanced leaf photosynthesis, and increased plant biomass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion. Therefore, our findings provide clear experimental evidence of the importance of the chloroplast accumulation response in leaf photosynthesis and biomass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion.</p>

Dynamics of Ethylene Production in Response to Compatible Nod Factor
<p>Establishment of symbiotic nitrogen-fixation in legumes is regulated by the plant hormone ethylene, but it has remained unclear whether and how its biosynthesis is regulated by the symbiotic pathway. We established a sensitive ethylene detection system for <i>Lotus japonicus</i> and found that ethylene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion increased as early as 6 hours after inoculation with <i>Mesorhizobium loti</i>. This ethylene response was dependent on Nod factor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion by compatible rhizobia. Analyses of nodulation mutants showed that perception of Nod factor was required for ethylene emission, while downstream transcription factors including CYCLOPS, NIN, and ERN1 were not required for this response. Activation of the nodulation signaling pathway in spontaneously nodulating mutants was also sufficient to elevate ethylene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion. Ethylene signaling is controlled by EIN2, which is duplicated in <i>L. japonicus</i>. We obtained a <i>L. japonicus Ljein2a Ljein2b</i> double mutant that exhibits complete ethylene insensitivity and confirms that these two genes act redundantly in ethylene signaling. Consistent with this redundancy, both <i>LjEin2a</i> and <i>LjEin2b</i> are required for negative regulation of nodulation and <i>Ljein2a Ljein2b</i> double mutants are hypernodulating and hyperinfected. We also identified an unexpected role for ethylene in the onset of nitrogen fixation, with the <i>Ljein2a Ljein2b</i> double mutant showing severely reduced nitrogen fixation. These results demonstrate that ethylene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion is an early and sustained nodulation response that acts at multiple stages to regulate infection, nodule organogenesis, and nitrogen fixation in <i>L. japonicus</i>.</p>

Salicylic Acid-Dependent Plant Stress Signaling via Mitochondrial Succinate Dehydrogenase
<p>Mitochondria are known for their role in ATP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion and generation of reactive oxygen species, but little is known about the mechanism of their early involvement in plant stress signaling. The role of mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) in salicylic acid (SA) signaling was analyzed using two mutants: <i>disrupted in stress response1</i> (<i>dsr1</i>), which is a point mutation in SDH1 identified in a loss of SA signaling screen, and a knockdown mutant (<i>sdhaf2</i>) for SDH assembly factor 2 that is required for FAD insertion into SDH1. Both mutants showed strongly decreased SA-inducible stress promoter responses and low SDH maximum capacity compared to wild type, while <i>dsr1</i> also showed low succinate affinity, low catalytic efficiency, and increased resistance to SDH competitive inhibitors. The SA-induced promoter responses could be partially rescued in <i>sdhaf2</i>, but not in <i>dsr1</i>, by supplementing the plant growth media with succinate. Kinetic characterization showed that low concentrations of either SA or ubiquinone binding site inhibitors increased SDH activity and induced mitochondrial H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion. Both <i>dsr1</i> and <i>sdhaf2</i> showed lower rates of SA-dependent H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion in vitro in line with their low SA-dependent stress signaling responses in vivo. This provides quantitative and kinetic evidence that SA acts at or near the ubiquinone binding site of SDH to stimulate activity and contributes to plant stress signaling by increased rates of mitochondrial H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion, leading to part of the SA-dependent transcriptional response in plant cells.</p>

A Palmitic Acid Elongase Affects Eicosapentaenoic Acid and Plastidial Monogalactosyldiacylglycerol Levels in Nannochloropsis
<p><i>Nannochloropsis</i> species are oleaginous eukaryotes containing a plastid limited by four membranes, deriving from a secondary endosymbiosis. In <i>Nannochloropsis</i>, thylakoid lipids, including monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG), are enriched in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). The need for EPA in MGDG is not understood. Fatty acids are de novo synthesized in the stroma, then converted into very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (FAs) at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of MGDG relies therefore on an EPA supply from the ER to the plastid, following an unknown process. We identified seven elongases and five desaturases possibly involved in EPA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion in <i>Nannochloropsis gaditana</i>. Among the six heterokont-specific saturated FA elongases possibly acting upstream in this pathway, we characterized the highly expressed isoform <i>Δ0-ELO1</i>. Heterologous expression in yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) showed that NgΔ0-ELO1 could elongate palmitic acid. <i>Nannochloropsis</i> Δ0-elo1 mutants exhibited a reduced EPA level and a specific decrease in MGDG. In NgΔ0-elo1 lines, the impairment of photosynthesis is consistent with a role of EPA-rich MGDG in nonphotochemical quenching control, possibly providing an appropriate MGDG platform for the xanthophyll cycle. Concomitantly with MGDG decrease, the level of triacylglycerol (TAG) containing medium chain FAs increased. In <i>Nannochloropsis</i>, part of EPA used for MGDG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion is therefore biosynthesized by a channeled process initiated at the elongation step of palmitic acid by Δ0-ELO1, thus acting as a committing enzyme for galactolipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion. Based on the MGDG/TAG balance controlled by Δ0-ELO1, this study also provides novel prospects for the engineering of oleaginous microalgae for biotechnological applications.</p>

The metabolic cost of communicative sound production in bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>)
<p>Bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>) produce various communicative sounds that are important for social behavior, maintaining group cohesion and coordinating foraging. For example, whistle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion increases during disturbances, such as separations of mother–calf pairs and vessel approaches. It is clear that acoustic communication is important to the survival of these marine mammals, yet the metabolic cost of producing whistles and other socials sounds and the energetic consequences of modifying these sounds in response to both natural and anthropogenic disturbance are unknown. We used flow-through respirometry to determine whether the metabolic cost of sound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion could be quantified in two captive dolphins producing social sounds (whistles and squawks). On average, we found that metabolic rates measured during 2 min periods of sound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion were 1.2 times resting values. Up to 7 min were required for metabolism to return to resting values following vocal periods. The total metabolic cost (over resting values) of the 2 min vocal period plus the required recovery period (163.3 to 2995.9 ml O<sub>2</sub> or 3279.6 to 60,166.7 J) varied by individual as well as by mean duration of sounds produced within the vocal period. Observed variation in received cumulative sound energy levels of vocalizations was not related to total metabolic costs. Furthermore, our empirical findings did not agree with previous theoretical estimates of the metabolic cost of whistles. This study provides the first empirical data on the metabolic cost of sound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion in dolphins, which can be used to estimate metabolic costs of vocal responses to environmental perturbations in wild dolphins.</p>

Impact of Bystander Automated External Defibrillator Use on Survival and Functional Outcomes in Shockable Observed Public Cardiac Arrests
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Survival following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with shockable rhythms can be improved with early defibrillation. Although shockable OHCA accounts for only ≈25% of overall arrests, ≈60% of public OHCAs are shockable, offering the possibility of restoring thousands of individuals to full recovery with early defibrillation by bystanders. We sought to determine the association of bystander automated external defibrillator use with survival and functional outcomes in shockable observed public OHCA.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>From 2011 to 2015, the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium prospectively collected detailed information on all cardiac arrests at 9 regional centers. The exposures were shock administration by a bystander-applied automated external defibrillator in comparison with initial defibrillation by emergency medical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">servic</span></strong>es. The primary outcome measure was discharge with normal or near-normal (favorable) functional status defined as a modified Rankin Score ≤2. Survival to hospital discharge was the secondary outcome measure.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 49 555 OHCAs, 4115 (8.3%) observed public OHCAs were analyzed, of which 2500 (60.8%) were shockable. A bystander shock was applied in 18.8% of the shockable arrests. Patients shocked by a bystander were significantly more likely to survive to discharge (66.5% versus 43.0%) and be discharged with favorable functional outcome (57.1% versus 32.7%) than patients initially shocked by emergency medical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">servic</span></strong>es. After adjusting for known predictors of outcome, the odds ratio associated with a bystander shock was 2.62 (95% confidence interval, 2.07–3.31) for survival to hospital discharge and 2.73 (95% confidence interval, 2.17–3.44) for discharge with favorable functional outcome.

Restoration of Hydrogen Sulfide Production in Diabetic Mice Improves Reparative Function of Bone Marrow Cells
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Bone marrow cell (BMC)–based treatment for critical limb ischemia in diabetic patients yielded a modest therapeutic effect resulting from cell dysfunction.

Here, we tested the hypothesis that restoration of hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion in diabetic BMCs improves their reparative capacities.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Mouse BMCs were isolated by density-gradient centrifugation. Unilateral hind limb ischemia was conducted in 12- to 14-week-old db/+ and db/db mice by ligation of the left femoral artery. The H<sub>2</sub>S level was measured by either gas chromatography or staining with florescent dye sulfidefluor 7 <sc>AM</sc>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Both H<sub>2</sub>S <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion and cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE), an H<sub>2</sub>S enzyme, levels were significantly decreased in BMCs from diabetic db/db mice. Administration of H<sub>2</sub>S donor diallyl trisulfide (DATS) or overexpression of CSE restored H<sub>2</sub>S <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion and enhanced cell survival and migratory capacity in high glucose (HG)–treated BMCs. Immediately after hind limb ischemia surgery, the db/+ and db/db mice were administered DATS orally and/or given a local intramuscular injection of green fluorescent protein–labeled BMCs or red fluorescent protein–CSE–overexpressing BMCs (CSE-BMCs). Mice with hind limb ischemia were divided into 6 groups: db/+, db/db, db/db+BMCs, db/db+DATS, db/db+DATS+BMCs, and db/db+CSE-BMCs. DATS and CSE overexpression greatly enhanced diabetic BMC retention in ischemic hind limbs followed by improved blood perfusion, capillary/arteriole density, skeletal muscle architecture, and cell survival and decreased perivascular CD68<sup>+</sup> cell infiltration in the ischemic hind limbs of diabetic mice. It is interesting to note that DATS or CSE overexpression rescued high glucose–impaired migration, tube formation, and survival of BMCs or mature human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells. Moreover, DATS restored nitric oxide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion and decreased endothelial nitric oxide synthase phosphorylation at threonine 495 levels in human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells and improved BMC angiogenic activity under high glucose condition. Last, silencing CSE by siRNA significantly increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase phosphorylation at threonine 495 levels in human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Decreased CSE-mediated H<sub>2</sub>S bioavailability is an underlying source of BMC dysfunction in diabetes mellitus. Our data indicate that H<sub>2</sub>S and overexpression of CSE in diabetic BMCs may rescue their dysfunction and open novel avenues for cell-based therapeutics of critical limb ischemia in diabetic patients.</p></sec>

We hypothesized that point-of-care hemostatic testing within the context of an integrated transfusion algorithm would improve the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement of coagulopathy in cardiac surgery and thereby reduce blood transfusions.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a pragmatic multicenter stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial of a point-of-care–based transfusion algorithm in consecutive patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass at 12 hospitals from October 6, 2014, to May 1, 2015. Following a 1-month data collection at all participating hospitals, a transfusion algorithm incorporating point-of-care hemostatic testing was sequentially implemented at 2 hospitals at a time in 1-month intervals, with the implementation order randomly assigned. No other aspects of care were modified. The primary outcome was red blood cell transfusion from surgery to postoperative day 7. Other outcomes included transfusion of other blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>s, major bleeding, and major complications. The analysis adjusted for secular time trends, within-hospital clustering, and patient-level risk factors. All outcomes and analyses were prespecified before study initiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among the 7402 patients studied, 3555 underwent surgery during the control phase and 3847 during the intervention phase. Overall, 3329 (45.0%) received red blood cells, 1863 (25.2%) received platelets, 1645 (22.2%) received plasma, and 394 (5.3%) received cryoprecipitate. Major bleeding occurred in 1773 (24.1%) patients, and major complications occurred in 740 (10.2%) patients. The trial intervention reduced rates of red blood cell transfusion (adjusted relative risk, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.85–0.98; <i>P</i>=0.02; number needed to treat, 24.7), platelet transfusion (relative risk, 0.77; 95% confidence interval, 0.68–0.87; <i>P</i><0.001; number needed to treat, 16.7), and major bleeding (relative risk, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.72–0.94; <i>P</i>=0.004; number needed to treat, 22.6), but had no effect on other blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong> transfusions or major complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Implementation of point-of-care hemostatic testing within the context of an integrated transfusion algorithm reduces red blood cell transfusions, platelet transfusions, and major bleeding following cardiac surgery. Our findings support the broader adoption of point-of-care hemostatic testing into clinical practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Impact of Combat Deployment and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder on Newly Reported Coronary Heart Disease Among US Active Duty and Reserve Forces
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>The recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have exposed thousands of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">servic</span></strong>e members to intense stress, and as a result, many have developed posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The role of military deployment experiences and PTSD in coronary heart disease (CHD) is not well defined, especially in young US <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">servic</span></strong>e members with recent combat exposure.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We conducted a prospective cohort study to investigate the relationships between wartime experiences, PTSD, and CHD. Current and former US military personnel from all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">servic</span></strong>e branches participating in the Millennium Cohort Study during 2001 to 2008 (n=60 025) were evaluated for newly self-reported CHD. Electronic medical record review for <i>International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification</i> codes for CHD was conducted among a subpopulation of active duty members (n=23 794). Logistic regression models examined the associations between combat experiences and PTSD with CHD with adjustment for established CHD risk factors. A total of 627 participants (1.0%) newly reported CHD over an average of 5.6 years of follow-up. Deployers with combat experiences had an increased odds of newly reporting CHD (odds ratio, 1.63; 95% confidence interval, 1.11–2.40) and having a diagnosis code for new-onset CHD (odds ratio, 1.93; 95% confidence interval, 1.31–2.84) compared with noncombat deployers. Screening positive for PTSD symptoms was associated with self-reported CHD before but not after adjustment for depression and anxiety and was not associated with a new diagnosis code for CHD.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Combat deployments are associated with new-onset CHD among young US <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">servic</span></strong>e members and veterans. Experiences of intense stress may increase the risk for CHD over a relatively short period among young adults.</p></sec>

Sustained climate warming drives declining marine biological productivity
<p>Climate change projections to the year 2100 may miss physical-biogeochemical feedbacks that emerge later from the cumulative effects of climate warming. In a coupled climate simulation to the year 2300, the westerly winds strengthen and shift poleward, surface waters warm, and sea ice disappears, leading to intense nutrient trapping in the Southern Ocean. The trapping drives a global-scale nutrient redistribution, with net transfer to the deep ocean. Ensuing surface nutrient reductions north of 30°S drive steady declines in primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion and carbon export (decreases of 24 and 41%, respectively, by 2300). Potential fishery yields, constrained by lower–trophic-level <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ivity, decrease by more than 20% globally and by nearly 60% in the North Atlantic. Continued high levels of greenhouse gas emissions could suppress marine biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ivity for a millennium.</p>

Nitrogen fixation and reduction at boron
<p>Currently, the only compounds known to support fixation and functionalization of dinitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) under nonmatrix conditions are based on metals. Here we present the observation of N<sub>2</sub> binding and reduction by a nonmetal, specifically a dicoordinate borylene. Depending on the reaction conditions under which potassium graphite is introduced as a reductant, N<sub>2</sub> binding to two borylene units results in either neutral (B<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>) or dianionic ([B<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2–</sup>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>s that can be interconverted by respective exposure to further reductant or to air. The <sup>15</sup>N isotopologues of the neutral and dianionic molecules were prepared with <sup>15</sup>N-labeled dinitrogen, allowing observation of the nitrogen nuclei by <sup>15</sup>N nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Protonation of the dianionic compound with distilled water furnishes a diradical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong> with a central hydrazido B<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> unit.

Species turnover promotes the importance of bee diversity for crop pollination at regional scales
<p>Ecologists have shown through hundreds of experiments that ecological communities with more species produce higher levels of essential ecosystem functions such as biomass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion, nutrient cycling, and pollination, but whether this finding holds in nature (that is, in large-scale and unmanipulated systems) is controversial. This knowledge gap is troubling because ecosystem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">servic</span></strong>es have been widely adopted as a justification for global biodiversity conservation. Here we show that, to provide crop pollination in natural systems, the number of bee species must increase by at least one order of magnitude compared with that in field experiments. This increase is driven by species turnover and its interaction with functional dominance, mechanisms that emerge only at large scales. Our results show that maintaining ecosystem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">servic</span></strong>es in nature requires many species, including relatively rare ones.</p>

Designing river flows to improve food security futures in the Lower Mekong Basin
<p>Rivers provide unrivaled opportunity for clean energy via hydropower, but little is known about the potential impact of dam-building on the food security these rivers provide. In tropical rivers, rainfall drives a periodic flood pulse fueling fish <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion and delivering nutrition to more than 150 million people worldwide. Hydropower will modulate this flood pulse, thereby threatening food security. We identified variance components of the Mekong River flood pulse that predict yield in one of the largest freshwater fisheries in the world. We used these variance components to design an algorithm for a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ed hydrograph to explore future yields. This algorithm mimics attributes of discharge variance that drive fishery yield: prolonged low flows followed by a short flood pulse. Designed flows increased yield by a factor of 3.7 relative to historical hydrology. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ing desired components of discharge variance will lead to greater efficiency in the Lower Mekong Basin food system.</p>

Renewable acrylonitrile production
<p>Acrylonitrile (ACN) is a petroleum-derived compound used in resins, polymers, acrylics, and carbon fiber. We present a process for renewable ACN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion using 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP), which can be produced microbially from sugars. The process achieves ACN molar yields exceeding 90% from ethyl 3-hydroxypropanoate (ethyl 3-HP) via dehydration and nitrilation with ammonia over an inexpensive titanium dioxide solid acid catalyst. We further describe an integrated process modeled at scale that is based on this chemistry and achieves near-quantitative ACN yields (98 ± 2%) from ethyl acrylate. This endothermic approach eliminates runaway reaction hazards and achieves higher yields than the standard propylene ammoxidation process. Avoidance of hydrogen cyanide as a by-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong> also improves process safety and mitigates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong> handling requirements.</p>

Snap deconvolution: An informatics approach to high-throughput discovery of catalytic reactions
<p>We present an approach to multidimensional high-throughput discovery of catalytic coupling reactions that integrates molecular design with automated analysis and interpretation of mass spectral data. We simultaneously assessed the reactivity of three pools of compounds that shared the same functional groups (halides, boronic acids, alkenes, and alkynes, among other groups) but carried inactive substituents having specifically designed differences in masses. The substituents were chosen such that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>s from any class of reaction in multiple reaction sets would have unique differences in masses, thus allowing simultaneous identification of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>s of all transformations in a set of reactants.

The long-run poverty and gender impacts of mobile money
<p>Mobile money, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">servic</span></strong>e that allows monetary value to be stored on a mobile phone and sent to other users via text messages, has been adopted by the vast majority of Kenyan households. We estimate that access to the Kenyan mobile money system M-PESA increased per capita consumption levels and lifted 194,000 households, or 2% of Kenyan households, out of poverty. The impacts, which are more pronounced for female-headed households, appear to be driven by changes in financial behavior—in particular, increased financial resilience and saving—and labor market outcomes, such as occupational choice, especially for women, who moved out of agriculture and into business. Mobile money has therefore increased the efficiency of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation of consumption over time while allowing a more efficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation of labor, resulting in a meaningful reduction of poverty in Kenya.</p>

Biosynthesis of 2-Phenylethanol in Rose Petals Is Linked to the Expression of One Allele of <i>RhPAAS</i>
<p>Floral scent is one of the most important characters in horticultural plants. Roses (<i>Rosa</i> spp.) have been cultivated for their scent since antiquity. However, probably by selecting for cultivars with long vase life, breeders have lost the fragrant character in many modern roses, especially the ones bred for the cut flower market. The genetic inheritance of scent characters has remained elusive so far. In-depth knowledge of this quantitative trait is thus very much needed to breed more fragrant commercial cultivars. Furthermore, rose hybrids harbor a composite genomic structure, which complexifies quantitative trait studies. To understand rose scent inheritance, we characterized a segregating population from two diploid cultivars, <i>Rosa</i> × <i>hybrida</i> cv H190 and <i>Rosa wichurana</i>, which have contrasting scent profiles. Several quantitative trait loci for the major volatile compounds in this progeny were identified. One among these loci contributing to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of 2-phenylethanol, responsible for the characteristic odor of rose, was found to be colocalized with a candidate gene belonging to the 2-phenylethanol biosynthesis pathway: the <i>PHENYLACETALDEHYDE SYNTHASE</i> gene <i>RhPAAS</i>. An in-depth allele-specific expression analysis in the progeny demonstrated that only one allele was highly expressed and was responsible for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of 2-phenylethanol. Unexpectedly, its expression was found to start early during flower development, before the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of the volatile 2-phenylethanol, leading to the accumulation of glycosylated compounds in petals.</p>

Parts-Prospecting for a High-Efficiency Thiamin Thiazole Biosynthesis Pathway
<p>Plants synthesize the thiazole precursor of thiamin (cThz-P) via THIAMIN4 (THI4), a suicide enzyme that mediates one reaction cycle and must then be degraded and resynthesized. It has been estimated that this THI4 turnover consumes 2% to 12% of the maintenance energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">budget</span></strong></span></strong> and that installing an energy-efficient alternative pathway could substantially increase crop yield potential. Available data point to two natural alternatives to the suicidal THI4 pathway: (i) nonsuicidal prokaryotic THI4s that lack the active-site Cys residue on which suicide activity depends, and (ii) an uncharacterized thiazole synthesis pathway in flowers of the tropical arum lily <i>Caladium bicolor</i> that enables <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion and emission of large amounts of the cThz-P analog 4-methyl-5-vinylthiazole (MVT). We used functional complementation of an <i>Escherichia coli</i> Δ<i>thiG</i> strain to identify a nonsuicidal bacterial THI4 (from <i>Thermovibrio ammonificans</i>) that can function in conditions like those in plant cells. We explored whether <i>C. bicolor</i> synthesizes MVT de novo via a novel route, via a suicidal or a nonsuicidal THI4, or by catabolizing thiamin. Analysis of developmental changes in MVT emission, extractable MVT, thiamin level, and THI4 expression indicated that <i>C. bicolor</i> flowers make MVT de novo via a massively expressed THI4 and that thiamin is not involved. Functional complementation tests indicated that <i>C. bicolor</i> THI4, which has the active-site Cys needed to operate suicidally, may be capable of suicidal and – in hypoxic conditions – nonsuicidal operation. <i>T. ammonificans</i> and <i>C. bicolor</i> THI4s are thus candidate parts for rational redesign or directed evolution of efficient, nonsuicidal THI4s for use in crop improvement.</p>

Diurnal Variation in Nonstructural Carbohydrate Storage in Trees: Remobilization and Vertical Mixing
<p>Nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) storage plays a critical role in tree function and survival, but understanding and predicting local NSC storage dynamics is challenging because NSC storage pools are dispersed throughout the complex architecture of trees and continuously exchange carbon between source and sink organs at different time scales. To address these knowledge gaps, characterization and understanding of NSC diel variation are necessary. Here, we analyzed diurnal NSC dynamics in the overall architecture of almond (<i>Prunus dulcis</i>) trees. We also analyzed the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation of newly assimilated carbon using isotopic labeling. We show that both components of NSC (i.e. soluble carbohydrates and starch) are highly dynamic at the diurnal time scale and that these trends are influenced by tissue type, age, and/or position within the canopy. In leaves, starch reserves can be depleted completely during the night, while woody tissue starch levels may vary by more than 50% over a daily cycle. Recently assimilated carbon showed a dispersed downward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation across the entire tree. NSC diurnal fluctuations within the tree’s structure in combination with dispersed carbon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation patterns provide evidence for the presence of vertical mixing and suggest that the xylem acts as a secondary NSC redistribution pathway.</p>

Non-Enzymatic Synthesis of Bioactive Isoprostanoids in the Diatom <i>Phaeodactylum</i> following Oxidative Stress
<p>The ecological success of diatoms requires a remarkable ability to survive many types of stress, including variations in temperature, light, salinity, and nutrient availability. On exposure to these stresses, diatoms exhibit common responses, including growth arrest, impairment of photosynthesis, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of reactive oxygen species, and accumulation of triacylglycerol (TAG). We studied the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of cyclopentane oxylipins derived from fatty acids in the diatom <i>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</i> in response to oxidative stress. <i>P. tricornutum</i> lacks the enzymatic pathway for producing cyclopentane-oxylipins, such as jasmonate, prostaglandins, or thromboxanes. In cells subjected to increasing doses of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), we detected nonenzymatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of isoprostanoids, including six phytoprostanes, three F<sub>2t</sub>-isoprostanes, two F<sub>3t</sub>-isoprostanes, and three F<sub>4t</sub>-neuroprostanes, by radical peroxidation of α-linolenic, arachidonic, eicosapentaenoic, and docosahexanoic acids, respectively. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> also triggered photosynthesis impairment and TAG accumulation. F<sub>1t</sub>-phytoprostanes constitute the major class detected (300 pmol per 1 million cells; intracellular concentration, ∼4 µ<sc>m</sc>). Only two glycerolipids, phosphatidylcholine and diacylglycerylhydroxymethyl-trimethyl-alanine, could provide all substrates for these isoprostanoids. Treatment of <i>P. tricornutum</i> with nine synthetic isoprostanoids produced an effect in the micromolar range, marked by the accumulation of TAG and reduced growth, without affecting photosynthesis. Therefore, the emission of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and free radicals upon exposure to stresses can lead to glycerolipid peroxidation and nonenzymatic synthesis of isoprostanoids, inhibiting growth and contributing to the induction of TAG accumulation via unknown processes. This characterization of nonenzymatic oxylipins in <i>P. tricornutum</i> opens a field of research on the study of processes controlled by isoprostanoid signaling in various physiological and environmental contexts in diatoms.</p>

Early Senescence in Older Leaves of Low Nitrate-Grown <i>Atxdh1</i> Uncovers a Role for Purine Catabolism in N Supply
<p>The nitrogen (N)-rich ureides allantoin and allantoate, which are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>s of purine catabolism, play a role in N delivery in Leguminosae. Here, we examined their role as an N source in nonlegume plants using Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants mutated in XANTHINE DEHYDROGENASE1 (AtXDH1), a catalytic bottleneck in purine catabolism. Older leaves of the <i>Atxdh1</i> mutant exhibited early senescence, lower soluble protein, and lower organic N levels as compared with wild-type older leaves when grown with 1 m<sc>m</sc> nitrate but were comparable to the wild type under 5 m<sc>m</sc> nitrate. Similar nitrate-dependent senescence phenotypes were evident in the older leaves of <i>allantoinase</i> (<i>Ataln</i>) and <i>allantoate amidohydrolase</i> (<i>Ataah</i>) mutants, which also are impaired in purine catabolism. Under low-nitrate conditions, xanthine accumulated in older leaves of <i>Atxdh1</i>, whereas allantoin accumulated in both older and younger leaves of <i>Ataln</i> but not in wild-type leaves, indicating the remobilization of xanthine-degraded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>s from older to younger leaves. Supporting this notion, ureide transporter expression was enhanced in older leaves of the wild type in low-nitrate as compared with high-nitrate conditions. Elevated transcripts and proteins of AtXDH and AtAAH were detected in low-nitrate-grown wild-type plants, indicating regulation at protein and transcript levels. The higher nitrate reductase activity in <i>Atxdh1</i> leaves compared with wild-type leaves indicated a need for nitrate assimilation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>s. Together, these results indicate that the absence of remobilized purine-degraded N from older leaves of <i>Atxdh1</i> caused senescence symptoms, a result of higher chloroplastic protein degradation in older leaves of low-nitrate-grown plants.</p>

Arabidopsis <i>VAC14</i> Is Critical for Pollen Development through Mediating Vacuolar Organization
<p>Pollen viability depends on dynamic vacuolar changes during pollen development involving increases and decreases of vacuolar volume through water and osmolite accumulation and vacuolar fission. Mutations in <i>FAB1A</i> to <i>FAB1D</i>, the genes encoding phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate [PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>]-converting kinases, are male gametophyte lethal in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) due to defective vacuolar fission after pollen mitosis I, suggesting a key role of the phospholipid in dynamic vacuolar organization. However, other genetic components that regulate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> and its involvement in pollen germination and tube growth are unknown. Here, we identified and characterized Arabidopsis VAC14, a homolog of the yeast and metazoan VAC14s that are crucial for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>. <i>VAC14</i> is constitutively expressed and highly present in developing pollen. Loss of function of <i>VAC14</i> was male gametophyte lethal due to defective pollen development. Ultrastructural studies showed that vacuolar fission after pollen mitosis I was compromised in <i>vac14</i> mutant microspores, which led to pollen abortion. We further showed that inhibiting the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> or exogenous application of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> mimicked or rescued the pollen developmental defect of the <i>vac14</i> mutant, respectively. Genetic interference and pharmacological approaches suggested a role of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> in pollen germination and tube growth. Our results provide insights into the function of VAC14 and, by inference, that of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> in plant cells.</p>

DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE and DIACYLGLYCEROL KINASE Modulate Triacylglycerol and Phosphatidic Acid Production in the Plant Response to Freezing Stress
<p>Plants accumulate the lipids phosphatidic acid (PA), diacylglycerol (DAG), and triacylglycerol (TAG) during cold stress, but how plants balance the levels of these lipids to mediate cold responses remains unknown. The enzymes ACYL-COENZYME A:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE (DGAT) and DIACYLGLYCEROL KINASE (DGK) catalyze the conversion of DAG to TAG and PA, respectively. Here, we show that DGAT1, DGK2, DGK3, and DGK5 contribute to the response to cold in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). With or without cold acclimation, the <i>dgat1</i> mutants exhibited higher sensitivity upon freezing exposure compared with the wild type. Under cold conditions, the <i>dgat1</i> mutants showed reduced expression of <i>C-REPEAT/DRE BINDING FACTOR2</i> and its regulons, which are essential for the acquisition of cold tolerance. Lipid profiling revealed that freezing significantly increased the levels of PA and DAG while decreasing TAG in the rosettes of <i>dgat1</i> mutant plants. During freezing stress, the accumulation of PA in <i>dgat1</i> plants stimulated NADPH oxidase activity and enhanced RbohD-dependent hydrogen peroxide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion compared with the wild type. Moreover, the cold-inducible transcripts of <i>DGK2</i>, <i>DGK3</i>, and <i>DGK5</i> were significantly more up-regulated in the <i>dgat1</i> mutants than in the wild type during cold stress. Consistent with this observation, <i>dgk2</i>, <i>dgk3</i>, and <i>dgk5</i> knockout mutants showed improved tolerance and attenuated PA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion in response to freezing temperatures. Our findings demonstrate that the conversion of DAG to TAG by <i>DGAT1</i> is critical for plant freezing tolerance, acting by balancing TAG and PA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion in Arabidopsis.</p>

Development Defects of Hydroxy-Fatty Acid-Accumulating Seeds Are Reduced by Castor Acyltransferases
<p>Researchers have long endeavored to produce modified fatty acids in easily <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ed crop plants where they are not natively found. An important step toward this goal has been the biosynthesis of these valuable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>s in model oilseeds. The successful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of such fatty acids has revealed barriers to the broad application of this technology, including low seed oil and low proportion of the introduced fatty acid and reduced seed vigor. Here, we analyze the impact of producing hydroxy-fatty acids on seedling development. We show that germinating seeds of a hydroxy-fatty acid-accumulating Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) line produce chlorotic cotyledons and suffer reduced photosynthetic capacity. These seedlings retain hydroxy-fatty acids in polar lipids, including chloroplast lipids, and exhibit decreased fatty acid synthesis. Triacylglycerol mobilization in seedling development also is reduced, especially for lipids that include hydroxy-fatty acid moieties. These developmental defects are ameliorated by increased flux of hydroxy-fatty acids into seed triacylglycerol created through the expression of either castor (<i>Ricinus communis</i>) acyltransferase enzyme ACYL-COA:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE2 or PHOSPHOLIPID:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1A. Such expression increases both the level of total stored triacylglycerol and the rate at which it is mobilized, fueling fatty acid synthesis and restoring photosynthetic capacity. Our results suggest that further improvements in seedling development may require the specific mobilization of triacylglycerol-containing hydroxy-fatty acids. Understanding the defects in early development caused by the accumulation of modified fatty acids and providing mechanisms to circumvent these defects are vital steps in the development of tailored oil crops.</p>

We combined pharmacological and genetic approaches to elucidate the involvement of H<sub>2</sub>S in stomatal closure and the interplay between H<sub>2</sub>S and other second messengers of the guard cell signaling network, such as hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and phospholipase D (PLD)-derived phosphatidic acid in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Both NADPH oxidase isoforms, respiratory burst oxidase homolog (RBOH)D and RBOHF, were required for H<sub>2</sub>S-induced stomatal closure. In vivo imaging using the cytosolic ratiometric fluorescent biosensor roGFP2-Orp1 revealed that H<sub>2</sub>S stimulates H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion in Arabidopsis guard cells. Additionally, we observed an interplay between H<sub>2</sub>S and PLD activity in the regulation of reactive oxygen species <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion and stomatal movement. The PLDα1 and PLDδ isoforms were required for H<sub>2</sub>S-induced stomatal closure, and most of the H<sub>2</sub>S-dependent H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion required the activity of PLDα1. Finally, we showed that H<sub>2</sub>S induced increases in the PLDδ-derived phosphatidic acid levels in guard cells. Our results revealed the involvement of H<sub>2</sub>S in the signaling network that controls stomatal closure, and suggest that H<sub>2</sub>S regulates NADPH oxidase and PLD activity in guard cells.</p>

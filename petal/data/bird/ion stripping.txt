Entanglement between two spatially separated atomic modes
<p>Modern quantum technologies in the fields of quantum computing, quantum simulation, and quantum metrology require the creation and control of large ensembles of entangled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es. In ultracold ensembles of neutral atoms, nonclassical states have been generated with mutual entanglement among thousands of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es. The entanglement generation relies on the fundamental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e-exchange symmetry in ensembles of identical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es, which lacks the standard notion of entanglement between clearly definable subsystems. Here, we present the generation of entanglement between two spatially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated clouds by splitting an ensemble of ultracold identical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es prepared in a twin Fock state. Because the clouds can be addressed individually, our experiments open a path to exploit the available entangled states of indistinguishable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es for quantum information applications.</p>

Root diffusion barrier control by a vasculature-derived peptide binding to the SGN3 receptor
<p>The root endodermis forms its extracellular diffusion barrier by developing ringlike impregnations called Casparian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strip</span></strong>s. A factor responsible for their establishment is the SCHENGEN3/GASSHO1 (SGN3/GSO1) receptor-like kinase. Its loss of function causes discontinuous Casparian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strip</span></strong>s. SGN3 also mediates endodermal overlignification of other Casparian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strip</span></strong> mutants. Yet, without ligand, SGN3 function remained elusive. Here we report that <i>schengen2 (sgn2)</i> is defective in an enzyme sulfating peptide ligands. On the basis of this observation, we identified two stele-expressed peptides (CASPARIAN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strip</span></strong> INTEGRITY FACTORS, CIF1/2) that complement <i>sgn2</i> at nanomolar concentrations and induce Casparian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strip</span></strong> mislocalization as well as overlignification—all of which depend on SGN3. Direct peptide binding to recombinant SGN3 identifies these peptides as SGN3 ligands. We speculate that CIF1/2-SGN3 is part of a barrier surveillance system, evolved to guarantee effective sealing of the supracellular Casparian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strip</span></strong> network.</p>

Cholesterol Efflux Capacity, High-Density Lipoprotein Particle Number, and Incident Cardiovascular Events
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Recent failures of drugs that raised high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels to reduce cardiovascular events in clinical trials have led to increased interest in alternative indices of HDL quality, such as cholesterol efflux capacity, and HDL quantity, such as HDL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e number. However, no studies have directly compared these metrics in a contemporary population that includes potent statin therapy and low low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>HDL cholesterol levels, apolipoprotein A-I, cholesterol efflux capacity, and HDL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e number were assessed at baseline and 12 months in a nested case-control study of the JUPITER trial (Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin), a randomized primary prevention trial that compared rosuvastatin treatment to placebo in individuals with normal low-density lipoprotein cholesterol but increased C-reactive protein levels. In total, 314 cases of incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) (myocardial infarction, unstable angina, arterial revascularization, stroke, or cardiovascular death) were compared to age- and gender-matched controls. Conditional logistic regression models adjusting for risk factors evaluated associations between HDL-related biomarkers and incident CVD.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Cholesterol efflux capacity was moderately correlated with HDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein A-I, and HDL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e number (Spearman <i>r</i>= 0.39, 0.48, and 0.39 respectively; <i>P</i><0.001). Baseline HDL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e number was inversely associated with incident CVD (adjusted odds ratio per SD increment [OR/SD], 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56–0.86; <i>P</i><0.001), whereas no significant association was found for baseline cholesterol efflux capacity (OR/SD, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.72–1.10; <i>P</i>=0.28), HDL cholesterol (OR/SD, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.66–1.02; <i>P</i>=0.08), or apolipoprotein A-I (OR/SD, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.67–1.03; <i>P</i>=0.08). Twelve months of rosuvastatin (20 mg/day) did not change cholesterol efflux capacity (average percentage change −1.5%, 95% CI, −13.3 to +10.2; <i>P</i>=0.80), but increased HDL cholesterol (+7.7%), apolipoprotein A-I (+4.3%), and HDL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e number (+5.2%). On-statin cholesterol efflux capacity was inversely associated with incident CVD (OR/SD, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.42–0.92; <i>P</i>=0.02), although HDL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e number again emerged as the strongest predictor (OR/SD, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.33–0.77; <i>P</i><0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In JUPITER, cholesterol efflux capacity was associated with incident CVD in individuals on potent statin therapy but not at baseline.

Atmospheric new particle formation from sulfuric acid and amines in a Chinese megacity
<p>Atmospheric new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e formation (NPF) is an important global phenomenon that is nevertheless sensitive to ambient conditions. According to both observation and theoretical arguments, NPF usually requires a relatively high sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) concentration to promote the formation of new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es and a low preexisting aerosol loading to minimize the sink of new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es. We investigated NPF in Shanghai and were able to observe both precursor vapors (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) and initial clusters at a molecular level in a megacity. High NPF rates were observed to coincide with several familiar markers suggestive of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>–dimethylamine (DMA)–water (H<sub>2</sub>O) nucleation, including sulfuric acid dimers and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>-DMA clusters. In a cluster kinetics simulation, the observed concentration of sulfuric acid was high enough to explain the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e growth to ~3 nanometers under the very high condensation sink, whereas the subsequent higher growth rate beyond this size is believed to result from the added contribution of condensing organic species. These findings will help in understanding urban NPF and its air quality and climate effects, as well as in formulating policies to mitigate secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e formation in China.</p>

Nanofluidic rocking Brownian motors
<p>Control and transport of nanoscale objects in fluids is challenging because of the unfavorable scaling of most interaction mechanisms to small length scales. We designed energy landscapes for nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es by accurately shaping the geometry of a nanofluidic slit and exploiting the electrostatic interaction between like-charged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es and walls. Directed transport was performed by combining asymmetric potentials with an oscillating electric field to achieve a rocking Brownian motor. Using gold spheres 60 nanometers in diameter, we investigated the physics of the motor with high spatiotemporal resolution, enabling a parameter-free comparison with theory. We fabricated a sorting device that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ates 60- and 100-nanometer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es in opposing directions within seconds. Modeling suggests that the device <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es with a radial difference of 1 nanometer.</p>

Ethane/ethylene separation in a metal-organic framework with iron-peroxo sites
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of ethane from its corresponding ethylene is an important, challenging, and energy-intensive process in the chemical industry. Here we report a microporous metal-organic framework, iron(III) peroxide 2,5-dioxido-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate [Fe<sub>2</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>)(dobdc) (dobdc<sup>4−</sup>: 2,5-dioxido-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate)], with iron (Fe)–peroxo sites for the preferential binding of ethane over ethylene and thus highly selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>/C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>. Neutron powder diffraction studies and theoretical calculations demonstrate the key role of Fe-peroxo sites for the recognition of ethane. The high performance of Fe<sub>2</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>)(dobdc) for the ethane/ethylene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation has been validated by gas sorption isotherms, ideal adsorbed solution theory calculations, and simulated and experimental breakthrough curves. Through a fixed-bed column packed with this porous material, polymer-grade ethylene (99.99% pure) can be straightforwardly produced from ethane/ethylene mixtures during the first adsorption cycle, demonstrating the potential of Fe<sub>2</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>)(dobdc) for this important industrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation with a low energy cost under ambient conditions.</p>

Resonance-stabilized hydrocarbon-radical chain reactions may explain soot inception and growth
<p>Mystery surrounds the transition from gas-phase hydrocarbon precursors to terrestrial soot and interstellar dust, which are carbonaceous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es formed under similar conditions. Although polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are known precursors to high-temperature carbonaceous-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e formation, the molecular pathways that initiate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e formation are unknown. We present experimental and theoretical evidence for rapid molecular clustering–reaction pathways involving radicals with extended conjugation. These radicals react with other hydrocarbon species to form covalently bound complexes that promote further growth and clustering by regenerating resonance-stabilized radicals through low-barrier hydrogen-abstraction and hydrogen-ejection reactions. Such radical–chain reaction pathways may lead to covalently bound clusters of PAHs and other hydrocarbons that would otherwise be too small to condense at high temperatures, thus providing the key mechanistic steps for rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e formation and surface growth by hydrocarbon chemisorption.</p>

Direct measurements of two-way wave-particle energy transfer in a collisionless space plasma
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e acceleration by plasma waves and spontaneous wave generation are fundamental energy and momentum exchange processes in collisionless plasmas. Such wave-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e interactions occur ubiquitously in space. We present ultrafast measurements in Earth’s magnetosphere by the Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft that enabled quantitative evaluation of energy transfer in interactions associated with electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves. The observed ion distributions are not symmetric around the magnetic field direction but are in phase with the plasma wave fields. The wave-ion phase relations demonstrate that a cyclotron resonance transferred energy from hot protons to waves, which in turn nonresonantly accelerated cold He<sup>+</sup> to energies up to ~2 kilo–electron volts. These observations provide direct quantitative evidence for collisionless energy transfer in plasmas between distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e populations via wave-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e interactions.</p>

Control of zeolite framework flexibility and pore topology for separation of ethane and ethylene
<p>The discovery of new materials for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ating ethylene from ethane by adsorption, instead of using cryogenic distillation, is a key milestone for molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ations because of the multiple and widely extended uses of these molecules in industry. This technique has the potential to provide tremendous energy savings when compared with the currently used cryogenic distillation process for ethylene produced through steam cracking. Here we describe the synthesis and structural determination of a flexible pure silica zeolite (ITQ-55). This material can kinetically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate ethylene from ethane with an unprecedented selectivity of ~100, owing to its distinctive pore topology with large heart-shaped cages and framework flexibility.

Direction-specific van der Waals attraction between rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> nanocrystals
<p>Mutual lattice orientations dictate the types and magnitudes of forces between crystalline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es. When lattice polarizability is anisotropic, the van der Waals dispersion attraction can, in principle, contribute to this direction dependence. We report measurement of this attraction between rutile nanocrystals, as a function of their mutual orientation and surface hydration extent. At tens of nanometers of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation, the attraction is weak and shows no dependence on azimuthal alignment or surface hydration. At <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ations of approximately one hydration layer, the attraction is strongly dependent on azimuthal alignment and systematically decreases as intervening water density increases. Measured forces closely agree with predictions from Lifshitz theory and show that dispersion forces can generate a torque between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es interacting in solution and between grains in materials.</p>

A peptide hormone required for Casparian strip diffusion barrier formation in <i>Arabidopsis</i> roots
<p>Plants achieve mineral ion homeostasis by means of a hydrophobic barrier on endodermal cells called the Casparian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strip</span></strong>, which restricts lateral diffusion of ions between the root vascular bundles and the soil. We identified a family of sulfated peptides required for contiguous Casparian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strip</span></strong> formation in <i>Arabidopsis</i> roots. These peptide hormones, which we named Casparian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strip</span></strong> integrity factor 1 (CIF1) and CIF2, are expressed in the root stele and specifically bind the endodermis-expressed leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase GASSHO1 (GSO1)/SCHENGEN3 and its homolog, GSO2. A mutant devoid of CIF peptides is defective in ion homeostasis in the xylem. <i>CIF</i> genes are environmentally responsive. Casparian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strip</span></strong> regulation is not merely a passive process driven by root developmental cues; it also serves as an active strategy to cope with adverse soil conditions.</p>

Spatially structured cell populations process multiple sensory signals in parallel in intact vascular endothelium
<p>Blood flow, blood clotting, angiogenesis, vascular permeability, and vascular remodeling are each controlled by a large number of variable, noisy, and interacting chemical inputs to the vascular endothelium. The endothelium processes the entirety of the chemical composition to which the cardiovascular system is exposed, carrying out sophisticated computations that determine physiological output. Processing this enormous quantity of information is a major challenge facing the endothelium. We analyzed the responses of hundreds of endothelial cells to carbachol (CCh) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and found that the endothelium segregates the responses to these two distinct components of the chemical environment into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate streams of complementary information that are processed in parallel. Sensitivities to CCh and ATP mapped to different clusters of cells, and each agonist generated distinct signal patterns. The distinct signals were features of agonist activation rather than properties of the cells themselves. When there was more than one stimulus present, the cells communicated and combined inputs to generate new distinct signals that were nonlinear combinations of the inputs. Our results demonstrate that the endothelium is a structured, collaborative sensory network that simplifies the complex environment using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate cell clusters that are sensitive to distinct aspects of the overall biochemical environment and interactively compute signals from diverse but interrelated chemical inputs. These features enable the endothelium to selectively process <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate signals and perform multiple computations in an environment that is noisy and variable.</p>

DNA-induced liquid phase condensation of cGAS activates innate immune signaling
<p>The binding of DNA to cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS) leads to the production of the secondary messenger cyclic GMP–AMP (cGAMP), which activates innate immune responses.

The disordered and positively charged cGAS N terminus enhanced cGAS-DNA phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation by increasing the valencies of DNA binding. Long DNA was more efficient in promoting cGAS liquid phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation and cGAS enzyme activity than short DNA.

Spatially distributed multipartite entanglement enables EPR steering of atomic clouds

We show experimentally that this entanglement can be spatially distributed by self-similar expansion of the atomic cloud.

Based on the strength of EPR steering, we constructed a witness, which confirmed genuine 5-partite entanglement.</p>

Phase separation of a yeast prion protein promotes cellular fitness
<p>Despite the important role of prion domains in neurodegenerative disease, their physiological function has remained enigmatic. Previous work with yeast prions has defined prion domains as sequences that form self-propagating aggregates. Here, we uncovered an unexpected function of the canonical yeast prion protein Sup35. In stressed conditions, Sup35 formed protective gels via pH-regulated liquid-like phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation followed by gelation. Phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation was mediated by the N-terminal prion domain and regulated by the adjacent pH sensor domain. Phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation promoted yeast cell survival by rescuing the essential Sup35 translation factor from stress-induced damage. Thus, prion-like domains represent conserved environmental stress sensors that facilitate rapid adaptation in unstable environments by modifying protein phase behavior.</p>

Highly elastic binders integrating polyrotaxanes for silicon microparticle anodes in lithium ion batteries
<p>Lithium-ion batteries with ever-increasing energy densities are needed for batteries for advanced devices and all-electric vehicles.

However, the molecular mechanism that protects centromeric cohesion from release at meiosis I is unclear in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Here, we report that the protein phosphatase 2A regulatory subunits B'α and B'β participate in the control of sister chromatid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation. The double mutant <i>b'αβ</i> exhibited severe male and female sterility, caused by the lack of a nucleus or presence of an abnormal nucleus in mature microspores and embryo sacs. 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole staining revealed unequal amounts of DNA in the mononuclear microspores. Transverse sections of the anthers revealed unevenly sized tetrads with or without a nucleus, suggesting a defect in meiocyte meiosis. An analysis of chromosome spreads showed that the sister chromatids <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated prematurely at anaphase I in <i>b'αβ</i>. Immunoblotting showed that AtRECOMBINATION DEFECTIVE8 (AtREC8), a key member of the cohesin complex, was hyperphosphorylated in <i>b'αβ</i> anthers and pistils during meiosis but hypophosphorylated in the wild type. Furthermore, yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays showed that B'α and B'β interact specifically with AtREC8, AtSHUGOSHIN1 (AtSGO1), AtSGO2, and PATRONUS1. Given that B'α was reported to localize to the centromere in meiotic cells, we propose that protein phosphatase 2A B'α and B'β are recruited by AtSGO1/2 and PATRONUS1 to dephosphorylate AtREC8 at the site of centromere cohesion to shield it from cleavage until anaphase II, contributing to the balanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of sister chromatids at meiosis.</p>

Dynamics of the Pollen Sequestrome Defined by Subcellular Coupled Omics
<p>Reproduction success in angiosperm plants depends on robust pollen tube growth through the female pistil tissues to ensure successful fertilization. Accordingly, there is an apparent evolutionary trend to accumulate significant reserves during pollen maturation, including a population of stored mRNAs, that are utilized later for a massive translation of various proteins in growing pollen tubes. Here, we performed a thorough transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of stored and translated transcripts in three subcellular compartments of tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>), long-term storage EDTA/puromycin-resistant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es, translating polysomes, and free ribonuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es, throughout tobacco pollen development and in in vitro-growing pollen tubes. We demonstrated that the composition of the aforementioned complexes is not rigid and that numerous transcripts were redistributed among these complexes during pollen development, which may represent an important mechanism of translational regulation. Therefore, we defined the pollen sequestrome as a distinct and highly dynamic compartment for the storage of stable, translationally repressed transcripts and demonstrated its dynamics. We propose that EDTA/puromycin-resistant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e complexes represent aggregated nontranslating monosomes as the primary mediators of messenger RNA sequestration. Such organization is extremely useful in fast tip-growing pollen tubes, where rapid and orchestrated protein synthesis must take place in specific regions.</p>

Anterior lateral line nerve encoding to tones and play-back vocalisations in free-swimming oyster toadfish, <i>Opsanus tau</i>
<p>In the underwater environment, sound propagates both as a pressure wave and as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e motion, with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e motion dominating close to the source. At the receptor level, the fish ear and the neuromast hair cells act as displacement detectors, and both are potentially stimulated by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e motion component of sound. The encoding of the anterior lateral line nerve to acoustic stimuli in freely behaving oyster toadfish, <i>Opsanus tau</i>, was examined. Nerve sensitivity and directional responses were determined using spike rate and vector strength analysis, a measure of phase-locking of spike times to the stimulus waveform. All units showed greatest sensitivity to 100 Hz stimulus. While sensitivity was independent of stimuli orientation, the neuron's ability to phase-lock was correlated with stimuli origin. Two different types of units were classified, type 1 (tonic), and type 2 (phasic). The type 1 fibres were further classified into two sub-types based on their frequency response (type 1–1 and type 1–2), which was hypothesised to be related to canal (type 1–1) and superficial (type 1–2) neuromast innervation. Lateral line units also exhibited sensitivity and phase locking to boatwhistle vocalisations, with greatest spike rates exhibited at the onset of the call. These results provide direct evidence that oyster toadfish can use their lateral line to detect behaviourally relevant acoustic stimuli, which could provide a sensory pathway to aid in sound source localisation.</p>

Mediterranean Diet Improves High-Density Lipoprotein Function in High-Cardiovascular-Risk Individuals
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The biological functions of high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) contribute to explaining the cardioprotective role of the lipoprotein beyond quantitative HDL cholesterol levels. A few small-scale interventions with a single antioxidant have improved some HDL functions. However, to date, no long-term, large-scale, randomized controlled trial has been conducted to assess the effects of an antioxidant-rich dietary pattern (such as a traditional Mediterranean diet [TMD]) on HDL function in humans.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This study was performed in a random subsample of volunteers from the PREDIMED Study (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea; n=296) after a 1-year intervention. We compared the effects of 2 TMDs, one enriched with virgin olive oil (TMD-VOO; n=100) and the other enriched with nuts (TMD-Nuts; n=100), with respect to a low-fat control diet (n=96). We assessed the effects of both TMDs on the role of HDL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es on reverse cholesterol transport (cholesterol efflux capacity, HDL ability to esterify cholesterol, and cholesteryl ester transfer protein activity), HDL antioxidant properties (paraoxonase-1 arylesterase activity and total HDL antioxidant capacity on low-density lipoproteins), and HDL vasodilatory capacity (HDL ability to induce the release of nitric oxide in endothelial cells).

Dynamic pre-BCR homodimers fine-tune autonomous survival signals in B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia
<p>The pre–B cell receptor (pre-BCR) is an immature form of the BCR critical for early B lymphocyte development. It is composed of the membrane-bound immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain, surrogate light chain components, and the signaling subunits Igα and Igβ. We developed monovalent quantum dot (QD)–labeled probes specific for Igβ to study the behavior of pre-BCRs engaged in autonomous, ligand-independent signaling in live B cells. Single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e tracking revealed that QD-labeled pre-BCRs engaged in transient, but frequent, homotypic interactions. Receptor motion was correlated at short <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation distances, consistent with the formation of dimers and higher-order oligomers. Repeated encounters between diffusing pre-BCRs appeared to reflect transient co-confinement in plasma membrane domains. In human B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) cells, we showed that frequent, short-lived, homotypic pre-BCR interactions stimulated survival signals, including expression of <i>BCL6</i>, which encodes a transcriptional repressor. These survival signals were blocked by inhibitory monovalent antigen-binding antibody fragments (Fabs) specific for the surrogate light chain components of the pre-BCR or by inhibitors of the tyrosine kinases Lyn and Syk. For comparison, we evaluated pre-BCR aggregation mediated by dimeric galectin-1, which has binding sites for carbohydrate and for the surrogate light chain λ5 component. Galectin-1 binding resulted in the formation of large, highly immobile pre-BCR aggregates, which was partially relieved by the addition of lactose to prevent the cross-linking of galectin-BCR complexes to other glycosylated membrane components. Analysis of the pre-BCR and its signaling partners suggested that they could be potential targets for combination therapy in BCP-ALL.</p>

ATM directs DNA damage responses and proteostasis via genetically separable pathways
<p>The protein kinase ATM is a master regulator of the DNA damage response but also responds directly to oxidative stress. Loss of ATM causes ataxia telangiectasia, a neurodegenerative disorder with pleiotropic symptoms that include cerebellar dysfunction, cancer, diabetes, and premature aging. We genetically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated the activation of ATM by DNA damage from that by oxidative stress using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation-of-function mutations. We found that deficient activation of ATM by the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex and DNA double-strand breaks resulted in loss of cell viability, checkpoint activation, and DNA end resection in response to DNA damage. In contrast, loss of oxidative activation of ATM had minimal effects on DNA damage–related outcomes but blocked ATM-mediated initiation of checkpoint responses after oxidative stress and resulted in deficiencies in mitochondrial function and autophagy. In addition, expression of a variant ATM incapable of activation by oxidative stress resulted in widespread protein aggregation. These results indicate a direct relationship between the mechanism of ATM activation and its effects on cellular metabolism and DNA damage responses in human cells and implicate ATM in the control of protein homeostasis.</p>

Probing entanglement in a many-body–localized system
<p>An interacting quantum system that is subject to disorder may cease to thermalize owing to localization of its constituents, thereby marking the breakdown of thermodynamics. The key to understanding this phenomenon lies in the system’s entanglement, which is experimentally challenging to measure. We realize such a many-body–localized system in a disordered Bose-Hubbard chain and characterize its entanglement properties through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e fluctuations and correlations. We observe that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es become localized, suppressing transport and preventing the thermalization of subsystems. Notably, we measure the development of nonlocal correlations, whose evolution is consistent with a logarithmic growth of entanglement entropy, the hallmark of many-body localization. Our work experimentally establishes many-body localization as a qualitatively distinct phenomenon from localization in noninteracting, disordered systems.</p>

Stoichiometry controls activity of phase-separated clusters of actin signaling proteins
<p>Biomolecular condensates concentrate macromolecules into foci without a surrounding membrane. Many condensates appear to form through multivalent interactions that drive liquid-liquid phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation (LLPS). LLPS increases the specific activity of actin regulatory proteins toward actin assembly by the Arp2/3 complex. We show that this increase occurs because LLPS of the Nephrin–Nck–N-WASP signaling pathway on lipid bilayers increases membrane dwell time of N-WASP and Arp2/3 complex, consequently increasing actin assembly. Dwell time varies with relative stoichiometry of the signaling proteins in the phase-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated clusters, rendering N-WASP and Arp2/3 activity stoichiometry dependent. This mechanism of controlling protein activity is enabled by the stoichiometrically undefined nature of biomolecular condensates. Such regulation should be a general feature of signaling systems that assemble through multivalent interactions and drive nonequilibrium outputs.</p>

Phase separation focuses DNA sensing
<p>The presence of any double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) in the cytosol is a potent trigger for the activation of innate immune responses. In the context of an infection, immunorecognition of “foreign” dsDNA serves as a central host strategy to detect the presence of pathogens. Under certain conditions, however, sensing of aberrant cytosolic self-dsDNA can also promote destructive inflammation in autoinflammatory diseases. A fundamental question is how cells spatially organize and biochemically regulate the recognition of intracellular dsDNA in the vast cytosolic space of a cell. On page 704 in this issue, Du and Chen (<i>1</i>) introduce an elegant explanation by demonstrating that phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of the dsDNA sensor cGAS [cyclic GMP (guanosine monophosphate)–AMP (adenosine monophosphate) synthase] enables this central task.

Coactivator condensation at super-enhancers links phase separation and gene control
<p>Super-enhancers (SEs) are clusters of enhancers that cooperatively assemble a high density of the transcriptional apparatus to drive robust expression of genes with prominent roles in cell identity. Here we demonstrate that the SE-enriched transcriptional coactivators BRD4 and MED1 form nuclear puncta at SEs that exhibit properties of liquid-like condensates and are disrupted by chemicals that perturb condensates. The intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of BRD4 and MED1 can form phase-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated droplets, and MED1-IDR droplets can compartmentalize and concentrate the transcription apparatus from nuclear extracts. These results support the idea that coactivators form phase-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated condensates at SEs that compartmentalize and concentrate the transcription apparatus, suggest a role for coactivator IDRs in this process, and offer insights into mechanisms involved in the control of key cell-identity genes.</p>

RNA buffers the phase separation behavior of prion-like RNA binding proteins
<p>Prion-like RNA binding proteins (RBPs) such as TDP43 and FUS are largely soluble in the nucleus but form solid pathological aggregates when mislocalized to the cytoplasm.

Low RNA/protein ratios promote phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation into liquid droplets, whereas high ratios prevent droplet formation in vitro. Reduction of nuclear RNA levels or genetic ablation of RNA binding causes excessive phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation and the formation of cytotoxic solid-like assemblies in cells. We propose that the nucleus is a buffered system in which high RNA concentrations keep RBPs soluble. Changes in RNA levels or RNA binding abilities of RBPs cause aberrant phase transitions.</p>

Spatial entanglement patterns and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering in Bose-Einstein condensates

Here, we use high-resolution imaging to directly measure the spin correlations between spatially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated parts of a spin-squeezed Bose-Einstein condensate. We observe entanglement that is strong enough for Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering: We can predict measurement outcomes for noncommuting observables in one spatial region on the basis of corresponding measurements in another region with an inferred uncertainty product below the Heisenberg uncertainty bound. This method could be exploited for entanglement-enhanced imaging of electromagnetic field distributions and quantum information tasks.</p>

Self-heating–induced healing of lithium dendrites
<p>Lithium (Li) metal electrodes are not deployable in rechargeable batteries because electrochemical plating and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strip</span></strong>ping invariably leads to growth of dendrites that reduce coulombic efficiency and eventually short the battery.

In our experiments, we found that when the plating and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strip</span></strong>ping current density is raised above ~9 milliamperes per square centimeter, there is substantial self-heating of the dendrites, which triggers extensive surface migration of Li. This surface diffusion heals the dendrites and smoothens the Li metal surface.

Structural insights into ion conduction by channelrhodopsin 2
<p>The light-gated ion channel channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2) from <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> is a major optogenetic tool. Photon absorption starts a well-characterized photocycle, but the structural basis for the regulation of channel opening remains unclear. We present high-resolution structures of ChR2 and the C128T mutant, which has a markedly increased open-state lifetime. The structure reveals two cavities on the intracellular side and two cavities on the extracellular side. They are connected by extended hydrogen-bonding networks involving water molecules and side-chain residues. Central is the retinal Schiff base that controls and synchronizes three gates that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate the cavities. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate from this network is the DC gate that comprises a water-mediated bond between C128 and D156 and interacts directly with the retinal Schiff base.

Revealing hidden antiferromagnetic correlations in doped Hubbard chains via string correlators

Deterministic entanglement generation from driving through quantum phase transitions
<p>Many-body entanglement is often created through the system evolution, aided by nonlinear interactions between the constituting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es.

We directly observe number squeezing of 10.7 ± 0.6 decibels and normalized collective spin length of 0.99 ± 0.01. Together, these observations allow us to infer an entanglement-enhanced phase sensitivity of ~6 decibels beyond the standard quantum limit and an entanglement breadth of ~910 atoms.

Active sites in heterogeneous ice nucleation—the example of K-rich feldspars
<p>Ice formation on aerosol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es is a process of crucial importance to Earth’s climate and the environmental sciences, but it is not understood at the molecular level.

Our molecular-scale computer simulations indicate that this alignment arises from the preferential nucleation of prismatic crystal planes of ice on high-energy (100) surface planes of feldspar. The microscopic patches of (100) surface, exposed at surface defects such as steps, cracks, and cavities, are thought to be responsible for the high ice nucleation efficacy of potassium (K)–feldspar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es.</p>

<p>Signaling from JAK (Janus kinase) protein kinases to STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) transcription factors is key to many aspects of biology and medicine, yet the mechanism by which cytokine receptors initiate signaling is enigmatic. We present a complete mechanistic model for activation of receptor-bound JAK2, based on an archetypal cytokine receptor, the growth hormone receptor. For this, we used fluorescence resonance energy transfer to monitor positioning of the JAK2 binding motif in the receptor dimer, substitution of the receptor extracellular domains with Jun zippers to control the position of its transmembrane (TM) helices, atomistic modeling of TM helix movements, and docking of the crystal structures of the JAK2 kinase and its inhibitory pseudokinase domain with an opposing kinase-pseudokinase domain pair. Activation of the receptor dimer induced a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of its JAK2 binding motifs, driven by a ligand-induced transition from a parallel TM helix pair to a left-handed crossover arrangement. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation leads to removal of the pseudokinase domain from the kinase domain of the partner JAK2 and pairing of the two kinase domains, facilitating trans-activation. This model may well generalize to other class I cytokine receptors.</p>

Multicompartment Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles with Branched Shapes: An Epitaxial Growth Mechanism
<sec><title>Tuning Mesopores</title><p>Porous materials are of interest for catalysis and filtration because the open channels lend themselves to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ating materials or function. <bold>Suteewong <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 337) report on a method to make branched mesoporous silica nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es that contain cubic (core) and hexagonally structured (branch) parts within one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e. Controlling the extent of the branched structure is achieved by tuning the concentration of additives in a simple, one-pot reaction system.</p></sec>

PROTEIN PHOSHATASE 2A B’<i>α</i> and <i>β</i> Maintain Centromeric Sister Chromatid Cohesion during Meiosis in Arabidopsis
<p>The correct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis I, and sister chromatids during meiosis II, relies on the tight control of the cohesion complex. The phosphorylation and subsequent cleavage of the meiotic recombination protein REC8 (REC8-like family protein [SYN1] in Arabidopsis [<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>]), the α-kleisin subunit of the cohesion ring, along the chromosome arms at meiosis I allows crossovers and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of homologous chromosomes without chromatid dissociation. REC8 continues to localize and function at the centromeres up to metaphase II and, in yeast and vertebrates, is protected from cleavage by means of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)-mediated dephosphorylation. Here, we show that, in plants, centromeric sister chromatid cohesion until meiosis II also requires the activity of a PP2A-type phosphatase complex. The combined absence of the regulatory subunits PP2AB′α and PP2AB′β leads to the premature loss of chromosome cohesion in meiosis I. Male meiocytes of the <i>pp2ab′αβ</i> double mutant display premature depletion of SYN1. The PP2AA1 structural and B′α regulatory subunit localize specifically to centromeres until metaphase II, supporting a role for the PP2A complex in the SYN1-mediated maintenance of centromeric cohesion in plant meiosis.</p>

CHLOROPLAST RIBOSOME ASSOCIATED Supports Translation under Stress and Interacts with the Ribosomal 30S Subunit
<p>Chloroplast ribosomes, which originated from cyanobacteria, comprise a large subunit (50S) and a small subunit (30S) containing ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and various ribosomal proteins. Genes for many chloroplast ribosomal proteins, as well as proteins with auxiliary roles in ribosome biogenesis or functioning, reside in the nucleus. Here, we identified Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) CHLOROPLAST RIBOSOME ASSOCIATED (CRASS), a member of the latter class of proteins, based on the tight coexpression of its mRNA with transcripts for nucleus-encoded chloroplast ribosomal proteins. CRASS was acquired during the evolution of embryophytes and is localized to the chloroplast stroma. Loss of CRASS results in minor defects in development, photosynthetic efficiency, and chloroplast translation activity under controlled growth conditions, but these phenotypes are greatly exacerbated under stress conditions induced by the translational inhibitors lincomycin and chloramphenicol or by cold treatment. The CRASS protein comigrates with chloroplast ribosomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>es and coimmunoprecipitates with the 16S rRNA and several chloroplast ribosomal proteins, particularly the plastid ribosomal proteins of the 30S subunit (PRPS1 and PRPS5). The association of CRASS with PRPS1 and PRPS5 is independent of rRNA and is not detectable in yeast two-hybrid experiments, implying that either CRASS interacts indirectly with PRPS1 and PRPS5 via another component of the small ribosomal subunit or that it recognizes structural features of the multiprotein/rRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particl</span></strong>e. CRASS plays a role in the biogenesis and/or stability of the chloroplast ribosome that becomes critical under certain stressful conditions when ribosomal activity is compromised.</p>

Pea Border Cell Maturation and Release Involve Complex Cell Wall Structural Dynamics
<p>The adhesion of plant cells is vital for support and protection of the plant body and is maintained by a variety of molecular associations between cell wall components. In some specialized cases, though, plant cells are programmed to detach, and root cap-derived border cells are examples of this. Border cells (in some species known as border-like cells) provide an expendable barrier between roots and the environment. Their maturation and release is an important but poorly characterized cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation event. To gain a deeper insight into the complex cellular dynamics underlying this process, we undertook a systematic, detailed analysis of pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) root tip cell walls. Our study included immunocarbohydrate microarray profiling, monosaccharide composition determination, Fourier-transformed infrared microspectroscopy, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR of cell wall biosynthetic genes, analysis of hydrolytic activities, transmission electron microscopy, and immunolocalization of cell wall components. Using this integrated glycobiology approach, we identified multiple novel modes of cell wall structural and compositional rearrangement during root cap growth and the release of border cells. Our findings provide a new level of detail about border cell maturation and enable us to develop a model of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation process. We propose that loss of adhesion by the dissolution of homogalacturonan in the middle lamellae is augmented by an active biophysical process of cell curvature driven by the polarized distribution of xyloglucan and extensin epitopes.</p>

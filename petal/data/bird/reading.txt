The validity and reproducibility of cross table radiographs compared with CT scans for the measurement of anteversion of the acetabular component after total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to assess the reproducibility and validity   of cross table radiographs for measuring the anteversion of the   acetabular component after total hip arthroplasty (THA) and to compare   it with measurements using CT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scan</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 29 patients who underwent THA between June 2010 and   January 2016 were included. There were 17 men and 12 women. Their   mean age was 43 years (26 to 65). Seven patients underwent a bilateral   procedure. Thus, 36 THAs were included in the study. Lateral radiographs   and CT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scan</span></strong>s were obtained post-operatively and radiographs repeated   three weeks later. The anteversion of the acetabular component was   measured using the method described by Woo and Morrey and the ischiolateral   method described by Pulos et al and these were compared with the   results obtained from CT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scan</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean anteversion was 18.35° (3° to 38°) using Woo and Morrey’s   method, 51.45° (30° to 85°) using the ischiolateral method and 21.22°   (2° to 48°) using CT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scan</span></strong>s. The Pearson correlation coefficient   was 0.754 for Woo and Morrey’s method and 0.925 for the ischiolateral   method. There was a linear correlation between the measurements   using the ischiolateral method and those using CT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scan</span></strong>s. We derived   a simple linear equation between the value of the CT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scan</span></strong> and that   of ischiolateral method to deduce the CT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scan</span></strong> value from that of ischiolateral   method and <i>vice versa</i>. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The anteversion of the acetabular component measured using both   plain radiographic methods was consistently valid with good interobserver   reproducibility, but the ischiolateral method which is independent   of pelvic tilt was more accurate. As CT is costly, associated with   a high dose of radiation and not readily available, the ischiolateral method   can be used for assessing the anteversion of the acetabular component.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1006–11.</p></sec>

Comparison of Clinical Interpretation With Visual Assessment and Quantitative Coronary Angiography in Patients Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in Contemporary Practice
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Studies conducted decades ago described substantial disagreement and errors in physicians’ angiographic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interpret</span></strong>ation of coronary stenosis severity. Despite the potential implications of such findings, no large-scale efforts to measure or improve clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interpret</span></strong>ation were subsequently undertaken.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We compared clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interpret</span></strong>ation of stenosis severity in coronary lesions with an independent assessment using quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) in 175 randomly selected patients undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention at 7 US hospitals in 2011. To assess agreement, we calculated mean difference in percent diameter stenosis between clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interpret</span></strong>ation and QCA and a Cohen weighted κ statistic. Of 216 treated lesions, median percent diameter stenosis was 80.0% (quartiles 1 and 3, 80.0% and 90.0%), with 213 (98.6%) assessed as ≥70%. Mean difference in percent diameter stenosis between clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interpret</span></strong>ation and QCA was 8.2±8.4%, reflecting an average higher percent diameter stenosis by clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interpret</span></strong>ation (<i>P</i><0.001). A weighted κ of 0.27 (95% confidence interval, 0.18–0.36) was found between the 2 measurements. Of 213 lesions considered ≥70% by clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interpret</span></strong>ation, 56 (26.3%) were <70% by QCA, although none were <50%. Differences between the 2 measurements were largest for intermediate lesions by QCA (50% to <70%), with variation existing across sites.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Physicians tended to assess coronary lesions treated with percutaneous coronary intervention as more severe than measurements by QCA. Almost all treated lesions were ≥70% by clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interpret</span></strong>ation, whereas approximately one quarter were <70% by QCA. These findings suggest opportunities to improve clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interpret</span></strong>ation of coronary angiography.</p></sec>

Decoding of position in the developing neural tube from antiparallel morphogen gradients
<p>Like many developing tissues, the vertebrate neural tube is patterned by antiparallel morphogen gradients. To understand how these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">input</span></strong>s are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interpret</span></strong>ed, we measured morphogen signaling and target gene expression in mouse embryos and chick ex vivo assays. From these data, we derived and validated a characteristic decoding map that relates morphogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">input</span></strong> to the positional identity of neural progenitors. Analysis of the observed responses indicates that the underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interpret</span></strong>ation strategy minimizes patterning errors in response to the joint <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">input</span></strong> of noisy opposing gradients. We reverse-engineered a transcriptional network that provides a mechanistic basis for the observed cell fate decisions and accounts for the precision and dynamics of pattern formation. Together, our data link opposing gradient dynamics in a growing tissue to precise pattern formation.</p>

Spatially structured cell populations process multiple sensory signals in parallel in intact vascular endothelium
<p>Blood flow, blood clotting, angiogenesis, vascular permeability, and vascular remodeling are each controlled by a large number of variable, noisy, and interacting chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">input</span></strong>s to the vascular endothelium. The endothelium processes the entirety of the chemical composition to which the cardiovascular system is exposed, carrying out sophisticated computations that determine physiological output. Processing this enormous quantity of information is a major challenge facing the endothelium. We analyzed the responses of hundreds of endothelial cells to carbachol (CCh) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and found that the endothelium segregates the responses to these two distinct components of the chemical environment into separate streams of complementary information that are processed in parallel. Sensitivities to CCh and ATP mapped to different clusters of cells, and each agonist generated distinct signal patterns. The distinct signals were features of agonist activation rather than properties of the cells themselves. When there was more than one stimulus present, the cells communicated and combined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">input</span></strong>s to generate new distinct signals that were nonlinear combinations of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">input</span></strong>s. Our results demonstrate that the endothelium is a structured, collaborative sensory network that simplifies the complex environment using separate cell clusters that are sensitive to distinct aspects of the overall biochemical environment and interactively compute signals from diverse but interrelated chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">input</span></strong>s. These features enable the endothelium to selectively process separate signals and perform multiple computations in an environment that is noisy and variable.</p>

Volumetric additive manufacturing via tomographic reconstruction
<p>Additive manufacturing promises enormous geometrical freedom and the potential to combine materials for complex functions. The speed, geometry, and surface quality limitations of additive processes are linked to their reliance on material layering.

We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">print</span></strong>ed features as small as 0.3 millimeters in engineering acrylate polymers and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">print</span></strong>ed soft structures with exceptionally smooth surfaces into a gelatin methacrylate hydrogel. Our process enables us to construct components that encase other preexisting solid objects, allowing for multimaterial fabrication.

Optogenetic Dissection of Entorhinal-Hippocampal Functional Connectivity
<sec><title>From Grid to Place</title><p>Grid cells are considered one of the key sources for place-cell signals in the hippocampus. The entorhinal circuit also contains other functional cell types, but it is unclear which project to the place cells of the hippocampus. <bold>Zhang <i>et al.</i></bold> (10.1126/science.1232627, see the Perspective by <bold>Poucet and Sargolini</bold>) addressed this question using optogenetics and in vivo multi-electrode electrophysiology. Hippocampal cells received <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">input</span></strong> from a broad spectrum of entorhinal neuronal cell types. Grid cells represented the biggest group of spatial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">input</span></strong>s, but border cells, head-direction cells, and a large fraction of nonspatial cells also provided <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">input</span></strong>s. Thus, hippocampal circuits have local mechanisms for processing specific types of functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">input</span></strong> from the entorhinal cortex to generate place-specific signals.</p></sec>

Biomimetic shark skin: design, fabrication and hydrodynamic function
<p>Although the functional properties of shark skin have been of considerable interest to both biologists and engineers because of the complex hydrodynamic effects of surface roughness, no study to date has successfully fabricated a flexible biomimetic shark skin that allows detailed study of hydrodynamic function. We present the first study of the design, fabrication and hydrodynamic testing of a synthetic, flexible, shark skin membrane. A three-dimensional (3D) model of shark skin denticles was constructed using micro-CT imaging of the skin of the shortfin mako (<i>Isurus oxyrinchus</i>). Using 3D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">print</span></strong>ing, thousands of rigid synthetic shark denticles were placed on flexible membranes in a controlled, linear-arrayed pattern. This flexible 3D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">print</span></strong>ed shark skin model was then tested in water using a robotic flapping device that allowed us to either hold the models in a stationary position or move them dynamically at their self-propelled swimming speed. Compared with a smooth control model without denticles, the 3D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">print</span></strong>ed shark skin showed increased swimming speed with reduced energy consumption under certain motion programs. For example, at a heave frequency of 1.5 Hz and an amplitude of ±1 cm, swimming speed increased by 6.6% and the energy cost-of-transport was reduced by 5.9%. In addition, a leading-edge vortex with greater vorticity than the smooth control was generated by the 3D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">print</span></strong>ed shark skin, which may explain the increased swimming speeds. The ability to fabricate synthetic biomimetic shark skin opens up a wide array of possible manipulations of surface roughness parameters, and the ability to examine the hydrodynamic consequences of diverse skin denticle shapes present in different shark species.</p>

The use of ultra-low-dose CT scans for the evaluation of limb fractures

A collicular visual cortex: Neocortical space for an ancient midbrain visual structure
<p>Visual responses in the cerebral cortex are believed to rely on the geniculate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">input</span></strong> to the primary visual cortex (V1). Indeed, V1 lesions substantially reduce visual responses throughout the cortex. Visual information enters the cortex also through the superior colliculus (SC), but the function of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">input</span></strong> on visual responses in the cortex is less clear. SC lesions affect cortical visual responses less than V1 lesions, and no visual cortical area appears to entirely rely on SC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">input</span></strong>s. We show that visual responses in a mouse lateral visual cortical area called the postrhinal cortex are independent of V1 and are abolished upon silencing of the SC. This area outperforms V1 in discriminating moving objects. We thus identify a collicular primary visual cortex that is independent of the geniculo-cortical pathway and is capable of motion discrimination.</p>

Behavioral time scale synaptic plasticity underlies CA1 place fields
<p>Learning is primarily mediated by activity-dependent modifications of synaptic strength within neuronal circuits. We discovered that place fields in hippocampal area CA1 are produced by a synaptic potentiation notably different from Hebbian plasticity. Place fields could be produced in vivo in a single trial by potentiation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">input</span></strong> that arrived seconds before and after complex spiking. The potentiated synaptic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">input</span></strong> was not initially coincident with action potentials or depolarization. This rule, named behavioral time scale synaptic plasticity, abruptly modifies <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">input</span></strong>s that were neither causal nor close in time to postsynaptic activation. In slices, five pairings of subthreshold presynaptic activity and calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) plateau potentials produced a large potentiation with an asymmetric seconds-long time course. This plasticity efficiently stores entire behavioral sequences within synaptic weights to produce predictive place cell activity.</p>

Selective Elimination of Membrane-Damaged Chloroplasts via Microautophagy
<p>Plant chloroplasts constantly accumulate damage caused by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visibl</span></strong>e wavelengths of light during photosynthesis. Our previous study revealed that entire photodamaged chloroplasts are subjected to vacuolar digestion through an autophagy process termed chlorophagy; however, how this process is induced and executed remained poorly understood. In this study, we monitored intracellular induction of chlorophagy in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves and found that mesophyll cells damaged by high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visibl</span></strong>e light displayed abnormal chloroplasts with a swollen shape and 2.5 times the volume of normal chloroplasts. In wild-type plants, the activation of chlorophagy decreased the number of swollen chloroplasts. In the autophagy-deficient <i>autophagy</i> mutants, the swollen chloroplasts persisted, and dysfunctional chloroplasts that had lost chlorophyll fluorescence accumulated in the cytoplasm. Chloroplast swelling and subsequent induction of chlorophagy were suppressed by the application of exogenous mannitol to increase the osmotic pressure outside chloroplasts or by overexpression of VESICLE INDUCING PROTEIN IN PLASTID1, which maintains chloroplast envelope integrity. Microscopic observations of autophagy-related membranes showed that swollen chloroplasts were partly surrounded by autophagosomal structures and were engulfed directly by the tonoplast, as in microautophagy. Our results indicate that an elevation in osmotic potential inside the chloroplast due to high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visibl</span></strong>e light-derived envelope damage results in chloroplast swelling and serves as an induction factor for chlorophagy, and this process mobilizes entire chloroplasts via tonoplast-mediated sequestering to avoid the cytosolic accumulation of dysfunctional chloroplasts.</p>

Predicted Arabidopsis Interactome Resource and Gene Set Linkage Analysis: A Transcriptomic Analysis Resource
<p>An advanced functional understanding of omics data is important for elucidating the design logic of physiological processes in plants and effectively controlling desired traits in plants. We present the latest versions of the Predicted Arabidopsis Interactome Resource (PAIR) and of the gene set linkage analysis (GSLA) tool, which enable the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interpret</span></strong>ation of an observed transcriptomic change (differentially expressed genes [DEGs]) in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) with respect to its functional impact for biological processes. PAIR version 5.0 integrates functional association data between genes in multiple forms and infers 335,301 putative functional interactions. GSLA relies on this high-confidence inferred functional association network to expand our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">percept</span></strong>ion of the functional impacts of an observed transcriptomic change. GSLA then <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interpret</span></strong>s the biological significance of the observed DEGs using established biological concepts (annotation terms), describing not only the DEGs themselves but also their potential functional impacts. This unique analytical capability can help researchers gain deeper insights into their experimental results and highlight prospective directions for further investigation. We demonstrate the utility of GSLA with two case studies in which GSLA uncovered how molecular events may have caused physiological changes through their collective functional influence on biological processes. Furthermore, we showed that typical annotation-enrichment tools were unable to produce similar insights to PAIR/GSLA. The PAIR version 5.0-inferred interactome and GSLA Web tool both can be accessed at <ext-link>http://public.synergylab.cn/pair/</ext-link>.</p>

A Cysteine-Rich Protein Kinase Associates with a Membrane Immune Complex and the Cysteine Residues Are Required for Cell Death
<p>Membrane-localized proteins perceive and respond to biotic and abiotic stresses. We performed quantitative proteomics on plasma membrane-enriched samples from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) treated with bacterial flagellin. We identified multiple receptor-like protein kinases changing in abundance, including cysteine (Cys)-rich receptor-like kinases (CRKs) that are up-regulated upon the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">percept</span></strong>ion of flagellin. CRKs possess extracellular Cys-rich domains and constitute a gene family consisting of 46 members in Arabidopsis. The single transfer DNA insertion lines <i>CRK28</i> and <i>CRK29</i>, two CRKs induced in response to flagellin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">percept</span></strong>ion, did not exhibit robust alterations in immune responses. In contrast, silencing of multiple bacterial flagellin-induced CRKs resulted in enhanced susceptibility to pathogenic <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i>, indicating functional redundancy in this large gene family. Enhanced expression of <i>CRK28</i> in Arabidopsis increased disease resistance to <i>P. syringae</i>. Expression of <i>CRK28</i> in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> induced cell death, which required intact extracellular Cys residues and a conserved kinase active site. CRK28-mediated cell death required the common receptor-like protein kinase coreceptor BAK1. CRK28 associated with BAK1 as well as the activated FLAGELLIN-SENSING2 (FLS2) immune receptor complex. CRK28 self-associated as well as associated with the closely related CRK29. These data support a model where Arabidopsis CRKs are synthesized upon pathogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">percept</span></strong>ion, associate with the FLS2 complex, and coordinately act to enhance plant immune responses.</p>

Does a less intensive surveillance protocol affect the survival of patients after treatment of a sarcoma of the limb?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>A single-centre prospective randomized trial was conducted to   investigate whether a less intensive follow-up protocol would not   be inferior to a conventional follow-up protocol, in terms of overall   survival, in patients who have undergone surgery for sarcoma of   the limb. Initial short-term results were published in 2014.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The primary objective was to show non-inferiority of a chest   radiograph (CXR) group compared with a CT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scan</span></strong> group, and of a less   frequent (six-monthly) group than a more frequent (three-monthly)   group, in two-by-two comparison. The primary outcome was overall   survival and the secondary outcome was a recurrence-free survival.   Five-year survival was compared between the CXR and CT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scan</span></strong> groups   and between the three-monthly and six-monthly groups. Of 500 patients   who were enrolled, 476 were available for follow-up. Survival analyses   were performed on a per-protocol basis (n = 412).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The updated results recorded 12 (2.4%) local recurrences, 182   (36.8%) metastases, and 56 (11.3%) combined (local + metastases)   recurrence at a median follow-up of 81 months (60 to 118). Of 68   local recurrences, 60 (88%) were identified by the patients themselves.   The six-monthly regime (overall survival (OS) 54%, recurrence-free   survival (RFS) 46%) did not lead to a worse survival and was not   inferior to the three-monthly regime (OS 55%, RFS 47%) in terms   of detecting recurrence. Although CT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scan</span></strong>s (OS 53%, RFS 54%) detected   pulmonary metastasis earlier, it did not lead to a better survival   compared with CXR (OS 56%, RFS 59%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The overall survival of patients who are treated for a sarcoma   of the limb is not inferior to those followed up with a less intensive   regimen than a more intensive protocol, in terms of frequency of   visits and mode of imaging.

Value of Progression of Coronary Artery Calcification for Risk Prediction of Coronary and Cardiovascular Events
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Computed tomography (CT) allows estimation of coronary artery calcium (CAC) progression. We evaluated several progression algorithms in our unselected, population-based cohort for risk prediction of coronary and cardiovascular events.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In 3281 participants (45–74 years of age), free from cardiovascular disease until the second visit, risk factors, and CTs at baseline (b) and after a mean of 5.1 years (5y) were measured. Hard coronary and cardiovascular events, and total cardiovascular events including revascularization, as well, were recorded during a follow-up time of 7.8±2.2 years after the second CT. The added predictive value of 10 CAC progression algorithms on top of risk factors including baseline CAC was evaluated by using survival analysis, C-statistics, net reclassification improvement, and integrated discrimination index. A subgroup analysis of risk in CAC categories was performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We observed 85 (2.6%) hard coronary, 161 (4.9%) hard cardiovascular, and 241 (7.3%) total cardiovascular events. Absolute CAC progression was higher with versus without subsequent coronary events (median, 115 [Q1–Q3, 23–360] versus 8 [0–83], <i>P</i><0.0001; similar for hard/total cardiovascular events). Some progression algorithms added to the predictive value of baseline CT and risk assessment in terms of C-statistic or integrated discrimination index, especially for total cardiovascular events. However, CAC progression did not improve models including CAC<sub>5y</sub> and 5-year risk factors.

Evaluation of the selectivity and sensitivity of isoform- and mutation-specific RAS antibodies
<p>There is intense interest in developing therapeutic strategies for RAS proteins, the most frequently mutated oncoprotein family in cancer. Development of effective anti-RAS therapies will be aided by the greater appreciation of RAS isoform–specific differences in signaling events that support neoplastic cell growth. However, critical issues that require resolution to facilitate the success of these efforts remain. In particular, the use of well-validated anti-RAS antibodies is essential for accurate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interpret</span></strong>ation of experimental data. We evaluated 22 commercially available anti-RAS antibodies with a set of distinct reagents and cell lines for their specificity and selectivity in recognizing the intended RAS isoforms and mutants. Reliability varied substantially. For example, we found that some pan- or isoform-selective anti-RAS antibodies did not adequately recognize their intended target or showed greater selectivity for another; some were valid for detecting G12D and G12V mutant RAS proteins in Western blotting, but none were valid for immunofluorescence or immunohistochemical analyses; and some antibodies recognized nonspecific bands in lysates from “Rasless” cells expressing the oncoprotein BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>. Using our validated antibodies, we identified RAS isoform–specific siRNAs and shRNAs. Our results may help to ensure the accurate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interpret</span></strong>ation of future RAS studies.</p>

Multiplex quantitative assays indicate a need for reevaluating reported small-molecule TrkB agonists
<p>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor, tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB), have emerged as key regulators of brain plasticity and represent disease-modifying targets for several brain disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease and major depressive disorder. Because of poor pharmacokinetic properties of BDNF, the interest in small-molecule TrkB agonists and modulators is high. Several compounds have been reported to act as TrkB agonists, and their increasing use in various nervous system disorder models creates the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">percept</span></strong>ion that these are reliable probes. To examine key pharmacological parameters of these compounds in detail, we have developed and optimized a series of complementary quantitative assays that measure TrkB receptor activation, TrkB-dependent downstream signaling, and gene expression in different cellular contexts. Although BDNF and other neurotrophic factors elicited robust and dose-dependent receptor activation and downstream signaling, we were unable to reproduce these activities using the reported small-molecule TrkB agonists. Our findings indicate that experimental results obtained with these compounds must be carefully <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interpret</span></strong>ed and highlight the challenge of developing reliable pharmacological activators of this key molecular target.</p>

Probing magnetism in 2D materials at the nanoscale with single-spin microscopy
<p>The discovery of ferromagnetism in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) crystals has generated widespread interest. Making further progress in this area requires quantitative knowledge of the magnetic properties of vdW magnets at the nanoscale. We used <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scan</span></strong>ning single-spin magnetometry based on diamond nitrogen-vacancy centers to image the magnetization, localized defects, and magnetic domains of atomically thin crystals of the vdW magnet chromium(III) iodide (CrI<sub>3</sub>). We determined the magnetization of CrI<sub>3</sub> monolayers to be ≈16 Bohr magnetons per square nanometer, with comparable values in samples with odd numbers of layers; however, the magnetization vanishes when the number of layers is even. We also found that structural modifications can induce switching between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interlayer ordering. These results demonstrate the benefit of using single-spin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scan</span></strong>ning magnetometry to study the magnetism of 2D vdW magnets.</p>

Adult-born hippocampal neurons bidirectionally modulate entorhinal inputs into the dentate gyrus
<p>Young adult-born granule cells (abGCs) in the dentate gyrus (DG) have a profound impact on cognition and mood. However, it remains unclear how abGCs distinctively contribute to local DG information processing. We found that the actions of abGCs in the DG depend on the origin of incoming afferents. In response to lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">input</span></strong>s, abGCs exert monosynaptic inhibition of mature granule cells (mGCs) through group II metabotropic glutamate receptors. By contrast, in response to medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">input</span></strong>s, abGCs directly excite mGCs through <i>N</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate receptors. Thus, a critical function of abGCs may be to regulate the relative synaptic strengths of LEC-driven contextual information versus MEC-driven spatial information to shape distinct neural representations in the DG.</p>

Inverse-designed metastructures that solve equations
<p>Metastructures hold the potential to bring a new twist to the field of spatial-domain optical analog computing: migrating from free-space and bulky systems into conceptually wavelength-sized elements. We introduce a metamaterial platform capable of solving integral equations using monochromatic electromagnetic fields. For an arbitrary wave as the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">input</span></strong> function to an equation associated with a prescribed integral operator, the solution of such an equation is generated as a complex-valued output electromagnetic field. Our approach is experimentally demonstrated at microwave frequencies through solving a generic integral equation and using a set of waveguides as the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">input</span></strong> and output to the designed metastructures. By exploiting subwavelength-scale light-matter interactions in a metamaterial platform, our wave-based, material-based analog computer may provide a route to achieve chip-scale, fast, and integrable computing elements.</p>

East Asian hydroclimate modulated by the position of the westerlies during Termination I

We show that this apparent contradiction can be resolved if the changes are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interpret</span></strong>ed as a lengthening of the Meiyu rains and shortened post-Meiyu stage, in accordance with a recent hypothesis.

Predictive modeling of U.S. health care spending in late life

But this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interpret</span></strong>ation presumes knowledge of who will die and when. Here we analyze how spending is distributed by predicted mortality, based on a machine-learning model of annual mortality risk built using Medicare claims. Death is highly unpredictable. Less than 5% of spending is accounted for by individuals with predicted mortality above 50%. The simple fact that we spend more on the sick—both on those who recover and those who die—accounts for 30 to 50% of the concentration of spending on the dead. Our results suggest that spending on the ex post dead does not necessarily mean that we spend on the ex ante “hopeless.”</p>

Near-infrared deep brain stimulation via upconversion nanoparticle–mediated optogenetics
<p>Optogenetics has revolutionized the experimental interrogation of neural circuits and holds promise for the treatment of neurological disorders. It is limited, however, because <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visibl</span></strong>e light cannot penetrate deep inside brain tissue. Upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) absorb tissue-penetrating near-infrared (NIR) light and emit wavelength-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visibl</span></strong>e light. Here, we demonstrate that molecularly tailored UCNPs can serve as optogenetic actuators of transcranial NIR light to stimulate deep brain neurons. Transcranial NIR UCNP-mediated optogenetics evoked dopamine release from genetically tagged neurons in the ventral tegmental area, induced brain oscillations through activation of inhibitory neurons in the medial septum, silenced seizure by inhibition of hippocampal excitatory cells, and triggered memory recall. UCNP technology will enable less-invasive optical neuronal activity manipulation with the potential for remote therapy.</p>

Pavlovian conditioning–induced hallucinations result from overweighting of perceptual priors

Using functional neuroimaging and computational modeling of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">percept</span></strong>ion, we identified processes that differentiated voice-hearers from non–voice-hearers and treatment-seekers from non–treatment-seekers and characterized a brain circuit that mediated the conditioned hallucinations.

21st-century rise in anthropogenic nitrogen deposition on a remote coral reef

The first clear change occurred just before 2000 CE, decades later than predicted by other work. The amplitude of change suggests that, by 2010, anthropogenic atmospheric N deposition represented 20 ± 5% of the annual N <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">input</span></strong> to the surface ocean in this region, which appears to be at the lower end of other estimates.</p>

Unequivocal determination of complex molecular structures using anisotropic NMR measurements

The B-Box-Containing MicroProtein miP1a/BBX31 Regulates Photomorphogenesis and UV-B Protection
<p>The bZIP transcription factor ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) represents a major hub in the light-signaling cascade both under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visibl</span></strong>e and UV-B light. The mode of transcriptional regulation of <i>HY5</i>, especially under UV-B light, is not well characterized. B-BOX (BBX) transcription factors regulate <i>HY5</i> transcription and also posttranscriptionally modulate HY5 to control photomorphogenesis under white light. Here, we identify BBX31 as a key signaling intermediate in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visibl</span></strong>e and UV-B light signal transduction in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). <i>BBX31</i> expression is induced by UV-B radiation in a fluence-dependent manner. HY5 directly binds to the promoter of <i>BBX31</i> and regulates its transcript levels. Loss- and gain-of-function mutants of <i>BBX31</i> indicate that it acts as a negative regulator of photomorphogenesis under white light but is a positive regulator of UV-B signaling. Genetic interaction studies suggest that <i>BBX31</i> regulates photomorphogenesis independent of <i>HY5</i>. We found no evidence for a direct BBX31-HY5 interaction, and they primarily regulate different sets of genes in white light. Under high doses of UV-B radiation, BBX31 promotes the accumulation of UV-protective flavonoids and phenolic compounds. It enhances tolerance to UV-B radiation by regulating genes involved in photoprotection and DNA repair in a HY5-dependent manner. Under UV-B radiation, overexpression of <i>BBX31</i> enhances <i>HY5</i> transcriptional levels in a UV RESISTANCE LOCUS8-dependent manner, suggesting that BBX31 might regulate <i>HY5</i> transcription.</p>

An Arabidopsis TIR-Lectin Two-Domain Protein Confers Defense Properties against <i>Tetranychus urticae</i>
<p>Plant immunity depends on fast and specific transcriptional reprogramming triggered by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">percept</span></strong>ion of biotic stresses. Numerous studies have been conducted to better understand the response of plants to the generalist herbivore two-spotted spider mite (<i>Tetranychus urticae</i>). However, how plants perceive mites and how this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">percept</span></strong>ion is translated into changes in gene expression are largely unknown. In this work, we identified a gene induced in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) upon spider mite attack that encodes a two-domain protein containing predicted lectin and Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor domains. The gene, previously named <i>PP2-A5</i>, belongs to the Phloem Protein2 family. Biotic assays showed that PP2-A5 confers tolerance to <i>T. urticae</i>. Overexpression or knockout of <i>PP2-A5</i> leads to transcriptional reprogramming that alters the balance of hormone accumulation and corresponding signaling pathways. The nucleocytoplasmic location of this protein supports a direct interaction with regulators of gene transcription, suggesting that the combination of two putative signaling domains in a single protein may provide a novel mechanism for regulating gene expression. Together, our results suggest that PP2-A5 improves the ability to defend against <i>T. urticae</i> by participating in the tight regulation of hormonal cross talk upon mite feeding. Further research is needed to determine the mechanism by which this two-domain protein functions and to clarify its molecular role in signaling following a spider mite attack.</p>

Redox Control of Aphid Resistance through Altered Cell Wall Composition and Nutritional Quality
<p>The mechanisms underpinning plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">percept</span></strong>ion of phloem-feeding insects, particularly aphids, remain poorly characterized. Therefore, the role of apoplastic redox state in controlling aphid infestation was explored using transgenic tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) plants that have either high (PAO) or low (TAO) ascorbate oxidase (AO) activities relative to the wild type. Only a small number of leaf transcripts and metabolites were changed in response to genotype, and cell wall composition was largely unaffected. Aphid fecundity was decreased significantly in TAO plants compared with other lines. Leaf sugar levels were increased and maximum extractable AO activities were decreased in response to aphids in all genotypes. Transcripts encoding the Respiratory Burst Oxidase Homolog F, signaling components involved in ethylene and other hormone-mediated pathways, photosynthetic electron transport components, sugar, amino acid, and cell wall metabolism, were increased significantly in the TAO plants in response to aphid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">percept</span></strong>ion relative to other lines. The levels of galactosylated xyloglucan were decreased significantly in response to aphid feeding in all the lines, the effect being the least in the TAO plants. Similarly, all lines exhibited increases in tightly bound (1→4)-β-galactan. Taken together, these findings identify AO-dependent mechanisms that limit aphid infestation.</p>

Cellulose-Derived Oligomers Act as Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns and Trigger Defense-Like Responses
<p>The plant cell wall, often the site of initial encounters between plants and their microbial pathogens, is composed of a complex mixture of cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin polysaccharides as well as proteins. The concept of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) was proposed to describe plant elicitors like oligogalacturonides (OGs), which can be derived by the breakdown of the pectin homogalacturon by pectinases. OGs act via many of the same signaling steps as pathogen- or microbe-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) to elicit defenses and provide protection against pathogens. Given both the complexity of the plant cell wall and the fact that many pathogens secrete a wide range of cell wall-degrading enzymes, we reasoned that the breakdown products of other cell wall polymers may be similarly biologically active as elicitors and may help to reinforce the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">percept</span></strong>ion of danger by plant cells. Our results indicate that oligomers derived from cellulose are perceived as signal molecules in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), triggering a signaling cascade that shares some similarities to responses to well-known elicitors such as chitooligomers and OGs. However, in contrast to other known PAMPs/DAMPs, cellobiose stimulates neither detectable reactive oxygen species production nor callose deposition. Confirming our idea that both PAMPs and DAMPs are likely to cooccur at infection sites, cotreatments of cellobiose with flg22 or chitooligomers led to synergistic increases in gene expression. Thus, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">percept</span></strong>ion of cellulose-derived oligomers may participate in cell wall integrity surveillance and represents an additional layer of signaling following plant cell wall breakdown during cell wall remodeling or pathogen attack.</p>

Ferredoxin:NADP(H) Oxidoreductase Abundance and Location Influences Redox Poise and Stress Tolerance
<p>In linear photosynthetic electron transport, ferredoxin:NADP(H) oxidoreductase (FNR) transfers electrons from ferredoxin (Fd) to NADP<sup>+</sup>. Both NADPH and reduced Fd (Fd<sup>red</sup>) are required for reductive assimilation and light/dark activation/deactivation of enzymes. FNR is therefore a hub, connecting photosynthetic electron transport to chloroplast redox metabolism. A correlation between FNR content and tolerance to oxidative stress is well established, although the precise mechanism remains unclear. We investigated the impact of altered FNR content and localization on electron transport and superoxide radical evolution in isolated thylakoids, and probed resulting changes in redox homeostasis, expression of oxidative stress markers, and tolerance to high light in planta. Our data indicate that the ratio of Fd<sup>red</sup> to FNR is critical, with either too much or too little FNR potentially leading to increased superoxide production, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">percept</span></strong>ion of oxidative stress at the level of gene transcription. In FNR overexpressing plants, which show more NADP(H) and glutathione pools, improved tolerance to high-light stress indicates that disturbance of chloroplast redox poise and increased free radical generation may help “prime” the plant and induce protective mechanisms. In <i>fnr1</i> knock-outs, the NADP(H) and glutathione pools are more oxidized relative to the wild type, and the photoprotective effect is absent despite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">percept</span></strong>ion of oxidative stress at the level of gene transcription.</p>

<p>Bats can perceive the world by using a wide range of sensory systems, and some of the systems have become highly specialized, such as auditory sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">percept</span></strong>ion. Among bat species, the Old World leaf-nosed bats and horseshoe bats (rhinolophoid bats) possess the most sophisticated echolocation systems. Here, we reported the whole-genome sequencing and <i>de novo</i> assembles of two rhinolophoid bats—the great leaf-nosed bat (<i>Hipposideros armiger</i>) and the Chinese rufous horseshoe bat (<i>Rhinolophus sinicus</i>). Comparative genomic analyses revealed the adaptation of auditory sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">percept</span></strong>ion in the rhinolophoid bat lineages, probably resulting from the extreme selectivity used in the auditory processing by these bats. Pseudogenization of some vision-related genes in rhinolophoid bats was observed, suggesting that these genes have undergone relaxed natural selection. An extensive contraction of olfactory receptor gene repertoires was observed in the lineage leading to the common ancestor of bats. Further extensive gene contractions can be observed in the branch leading to the rhinolophoid bats. Such concordance suggested that molecular changes at one sensory gene might have direct consequences for genes controlling for other sensory modalities. To characterize the population genetic structure and patterns of evolution, we re-sequenced the genome of 20 great leaf-nosed bats from four different geographical locations of China. The result showed similar sequence diversity values and little differentiation among populations. Moreover, evidence of genetic adaptations to high altitudes in the great leaf-nosed bats was observed. Taken together, our work provided a useful resource for future research on the evolution of bats.</p>

Prediction of the pre-morbid 3D anatomy of the proximal humerus based on statistical shape modelling
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Restoring the pre-morbid anatomy of the proximal humerus is a   goal of anatomical shoulder arthroplasty, but reliance is placed   on the surgeon’s experience and on anatomical estimations. The purpose   of this study was to present a novel method, ‘Statistical Shape   Modelling’, which accurately predicts the pre-morbid proximal humeral anatomy   and calculates the 3D geometric parameters needed to restore normal   anatomy in patients with severe degenerative osteoarthritis or a   fracture of the proximal humerus.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>From a database of 57 humeral CT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scan</span></strong>s 3D humeral reconstructions   were manually created. The reconstructions were used to construct   a statistical shape model (SSM), which was then tested on a second   set of 52 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scan</span></strong>s. For each humerus in the second set, 3D reconstructions   of four diaphyseal segments of varying lengths were created. These   reconstructions were chosen to mimic severe osteoarthritis, a fracture   of the surgical neck of the humerus and a proximal humeral fracture   with diaphyseal extension. The SSM was then applied to the diaphyseal   segments to see how well it predicted proximal morphology, using   the actual proximal humeral morphology for comparison.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>With the metaphysis included, mimicking osteoarthritis, the errors   of prediction for retroversion, inclination, height, radius of curvature   and posterior and medial offset of the head of the humerus were   2.9° (± 2.3°), 4.0° (± 3.3°), 1.0 mm (± 0.8 mm), 0.8 mm (± 0.6 mm),   0.7 mm (± 0.5 mm) and 1.0 mm (± 0.7 mm), respectively. With the   metaphysis excluded, mimicking a fracture of the surgical neck,   the errors of prediction for retroversion, inclination, height, radius   of curvature and posterior and medial offset of the head of the   humerus were 3.8° (± 2.9°), 3.9° (± 3.4°), 2.4 mm (± 1.9 mm), 1.3   mm (± 0.9 mm), 0.8 mm    (± 0.5 mm) and 0.9 mm (± 0.6 mm), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study reports a novel, computerised method that accurately   predicts the pre-morbid proximal humeral anatomy even in challenging   situations. This information can be used in the surgical planning   and operative reconstruction of patients with severe degenerative   osteoarthritis or with a fracture of the proximal humerus.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:927–33.</p></sec>

Early migration of a partially cemented fluted glenoid component inserted using a cannulated preparation system
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Radiostereometric analysis (RSA) allows an extremely accurate   measurement of early micromotion of components following arthroplasty. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>In this study, RSA was used to measure the migration of 11 partially   cemented fluted pegged glenoid components in patients with osteoarthritis   who underwent total shoulder arthroplasty using an improved surgical   technique (seven men, four women, mean age 68). Patients were evaluated   clinically using the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES)   and Constant-Murley scores and by CT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scan</span></strong>s two years post-operatively. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were two patterns of migration, the first showing little,   if any, migration and the second showing rotation by > 6° as early   as three months post-operatively.

Patients with   osteolysis around the central peg were those with early migration   and those with osseointegration had minimal early migration. Both groups,however,had   similar clinical results. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Rapid early migration associated with focal lucency and absence   of osseointegration was observed in three of 11 glenoid components,   suggesting that lack of initial stability leads to early movement   and failure of osseointegration.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:674–9.</p></sec>

The influence of cartilage thickness at the sigmoid notch on inclination at the distal radioulnar joint
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of this study were: firstly, to investigate the influence   of the thickness of cartilage at the sigmoid notch on the inclination   of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ), and secondly, to compare   the sensitivity and specificity of MRI with plain radiographs for   the assessment of the inclination of the articular surface of the   DRUJ in the coronal plane. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Contemporaneous MRI images and radiographs of 100 wrists from   98 asymptomatic patients (mean age 43 years, (16 to 67); 52 male,   53%) with no history of a fracture involving the wrist or surgery   to the wrist, were reviewed. The thickness of the cartilage at the   sigmoid notch, inclination of the DRUJ and Tolat Type of each DRUJ   were determined. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The assessment using MRI <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scan</span></strong>s and cortical bone correlated well   with radiographs, with a kappa value of 0.83. The mean difference   between the inclination using the cortex and cartilage on MRI <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scan</span></strong>s   was 12°, leading to a change of Tolat type of inclination in 66%   of wrists. No reverse oblique (Type 3) inclinations were found when   using the cartilage to assess inclination. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion </title><p>These data revealed that when measuring the inclination of the   DRUJ using cartilage, reverse oblique inclinations might not exist.   The data suggest that performing an ulna shortening osteotomy might   be reasonable even in distal radioulnar joints where the plain radiographic   appearance suggests an unfavourable reverse oblique inclination   in the coronal plane. We recommend using MRI to validate radiographs   in those that appear to be reverse oblique (Tolat Type 3), as the   true inclination might be different, thereby removing one possible   contraindication to ulnar shortening.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:369–75.</p></sec>

An analysis of the best method for evaluating anteversion of the acetabular component after total hip replacement on plain radiographs
<p>Several radiological methods of measuring anteversion   of the acetabular component after total hip replacement (THR) have   been described. These studies used different definitions and reference   planes to compare methods, allowing for mis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interpret</span></strong>ation of the   results. We compared the reliability and accuracy of five current   methods using plain radiographs (those of Lewinnek, Widmer, Liaw,   Pradhan, and Woo and Morrey) with CT measurements, using the same   definition and reference plane. We retrospectively studied the plain   radiographs and CT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scan</span></strong>s in 84 hips of 84 patients who underwent   primary THR. Intra- and inter-observer reliability were high for   the measurement of inclination and anteversion with all methods   on plain radiographs and CT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scan</span></strong>s. The measurements of inclination on   plain radiographs were similar to the measurements using CT (p =   0.043). The mean difference between CT measurements was 0.6° (-5.9°   to 6.8°).</p><p>Measurements using Widmer’s method were the most similar to those   using CT (p = 0.088), with a mean difference between CT measurements   of -0.9° (-10.4° to 9.1°), whereas the other four methods differed   significantly from those using CT (p < 0.001).</p><p>This study has shown that Widmer’s method is the best for evaluating   the anteversion of the acetabular component on plain radiographs.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014; 96-B:597–603.</p>

Sex Differences in the Presentation and Perception of Symptoms Among Young Patients With Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Some studies report that women are less likely to present with chest pain for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Information on symptom presentation, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">percept</span></strong>ion of symptoms, and care-seeking behaviors is limited for young patients with AMI.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We interviewed 2009 women and 976 men aged 18 to 55 years hospitalized for AMI at 103 US hospitals participating in the VIRGO study (Variation in Recovery: Role of Gender on Outcomes of Young AMI Patients). Structured patient interviews during the index AMI hospitalization were used to collect information on symptom presentation, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">percept</span></strong>ion of symptoms, and care-seeking behaviors. We compared patient characteristics and presentation information by sex. Multivariable hierarchical logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between sex and symptom presentation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The majority of women (87.0%) and men (89.5%) presented with chest pain (defined as pain, pressure, tightness, or discomfort). Women were more likely to present with ≥3 associated symptoms than men (eg, epigastric symptoms, palpitations, and pain or discomfort in the jaw, neck, arms, or between the shoulder blades; 61.9% for women versus 54.8% for men, <i>P</i><0.001). In adjusted analyses, women with an ST-segment–elevation AMI were more likely than men to present without chest pain (odds ratio, 1.51; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–2.22). In comparison with men, women were more likely to perceive symptoms as stress/anxiety (20.9% versus 11.8%, <i>P</i><0.001) but less likely to attribute symptoms to muscle pain (15.4% versus 21.2%, <i>P</i>=0.029). Approximately 29.5% of women and 22.1% of men sought medical care for similar symptoms before their hospitalization (<i>P</i><0.001); however, 53% of women reported that their provider did not think these symptoms were heart-related in comparison with 37% of men (<i>P</i><0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The presentation of AMI symptoms was similar for young women and men, with chest pain as the predominant symptom for both sexes. Women presented with a greater number of additional non–chest pain symptoms regardless of the presence of chest pain, and both women and their healthcare providers were less likely to attribute their prodromal symptoms to heart disease in comparison with men.</p></sec>

Integrated Noninvasive Physiological Assessment of Coronary Circulatory Function and Impact on Cardiovascular Mortality in Patients With Stable Coronary Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>It is suggested that the integration of maximal myocardial blood flow (MBF) and coronary flow reserve (CFR), termed coronary flow capacity, allows for comprehensive evaluation of patients with known or suspected stable coronary artery disease. Because management decisions are predicated on clinical risk, we sought to determine the independent and integrated value of maximal MBF and CFR for predicting cardiovascular death.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>MBF and CFR were quantified in 4029 consecutive patients (median age 66 years, 50.5% women) referred for rest/stress myocardial perfusion positron emission tomography <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scan</span></strong>s from January 2006 to December 2013. The primary outcome was cardiovascular mortality. Maximal MBF <1.8 mL·g<sup>−1</sup>·min<sup>−1</sup> and CFR<2 were considered impaired. Four patient groups were identified based on the concordant or discordant impairment of maximal MBF or CFR. Association of maximal MBF and CFR with cardiovascular death was assessed using Cox and Poisson regression analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 392 (9.7%) cardiovascular deaths occurred over a median follow-up of 5.6 years. CFR was a stronger predictor of cardiovascular mortality than maximal MBF beyond traditional cardiovascular risk factors, left ventricular ejection fraction, myocardial scar and ischemia, rate-pressure product, type of radiotracer or stress agent used, and revascularization after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scan</span></strong> (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.38–2.31; <i>P</i><0.001 per unit decrease in CFR after adjustment for maximal MBF and clinical covariates; and adjusted hazard ratio, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.84–1.27; <i>P</i>=0.8 per unit decrease in maximal MBF after adjustment for CFR and clinical covariates). In univariable analyses, patients with concordant impairment of CFR and maximal MBF had high cardiovascular mortality of 3.3% (95% CI, 2.9–3.7) per year. Patients with impaired CFR but preserved maximal MBF had an intermediate cardiovascular mortality of 1.7% (95% CI, 1.3–2.1) per year. These patients were predominantly women (70%). Patients with preserved CFR but impaired maximal MBF had low cardiovascular mortality of 0.9% (95% CI, 0.6–1.6) per year. Patients with concordantly preserved CFR and maximal MBF had the lowest cardiovascular mortality of 0.4% (95 CI, 0.3–0.6) per year. In multivariable analysis, the cardiovascular mortality risk gradient across the 4 concordant or discordant categories was independently driven by impaired CFR irrespective of impairment in maximal MBF.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>CFR is a stronger predictor of cardiovascular mortality than maximal MBF. Concordant and discordant categories based on integrating CFR and maximal MBF identify unique prognostic phenotypes of patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease.</p></sec>

Assessment of Remote Heart Rhythm Sampling Using the AliveCor Heart Monitor to Screen for Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Asymptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF) is increasingly common in the aging population and implicated in many ischemic strokes. Earlier identification of AF with appropriate anticoagulation may decrease stroke morbidity and mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a randomized controlled trial of AF screening using an AliveCor Kardia monitor attached to a WiFi-enabled iPod to obtain ECGs (iECGs) in ambulatory patients. Patients ≥65 years of age with a CHADS-VASc score ≥2 free from AF were randomized to the iECG arm or routine care (RC). iECG participants acquired iECGs twice weekly over 12 months (plus additional iECGs if symptomatic) onto a secure study server with overread by an automated AF detection algorithm and by a cardiac physiologist and/or consultant cardiologist. Time to diagnosis of AF was the primary outcome measure. The overall cost of the devices, ECG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interpret</span></strong>ation, and patient management were captured and used to generate the cost per AF diagnosis in iECG patients. Clinical events and patient attitudes/experience were also evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We studied 1001 patients (500 iECG, 501 RC) who were 72.6±5.4 years of age; 534 were female. Mean CHADS-VASc score was 3.0 (heart failure, 1.4%; hypertension, 54%; diabetes mellitus, 30%; prior stroke/transient ischemic attack, 6.5%; arterial disease, 15.9%; all CHADS-VASc risk factors were evenly distributed between groups). Nineteen patients in the iECG group were diagnosed with AF over the 12-month study period versus 5 in the RC arm (hazard ratio, 3.9; 95% confidence interval=1.4–10.4; <i>P</i>=0.007) at a cost per AF diagnosis of $10 780 (£8255). There was a similar number of stroke/transient ischemic attack/systemic embolic events (6 versus 10, iECG versus RC; hazard ratio=0.61; 95% confidence interval=0.22–1.69; <i>P</i>=0.34). The majority of iECG patients were satisfied with the device, finding it easy to use without restricting activities or causing anxiety.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Screening with twice-weekly single-lead iECG with remote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interpret</span></strong>ation in ambulatory patients ≥65 years of age at increased risk of stroke is significantly more likely to identify incident AF than RC over a 12-month period. This approach is also highly acceptable to this group of patients, supporting further evaluation in an appropriately powered, event-driven clinical trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.isrctn.com</ext-link>.

Dynamic Edematous Response of the Human Heart to Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Clinical protocols aimed to characterize the post–myocardial infarction (MI) heart by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) need to be standardized to take account of dynamic biological phenomena evolving early after the index ischemic event. Here, we evaluated the time course of edema reaction in patients with ST-segment–elevation MI by CMR and assessed its implications for myocardium-at-risk (MaR) quantification both in patients and in a large-animal model.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A total of 16 patients with anterior ST-segment–elevation MI successfully treated by primary angioplasty and 16 matched controls were prospectively recruited. In total, 94 clinical CMR examinations were performed: patients with ST-segment–elevation MI were serially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scan</span></strong>ned (within the first 3 hours after reperfusion and at 1, 4, 7, and 40 days), and controls were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scan</span></strong>ned only once. T2 relaxation time in the myocardium (T2 mapping) and the extent of edema on T2-weighted short-tau triple inversion-recovery (ie, CMR-MaR) were evaluated at all time points. In the experimental study, 20 pigs underwent 40-minute ischemia/reperfusion followed by serial CMR examinations at 120 minutes and 1, 4, and 7 days after reperfusion. Reference MaR was assessed by contrast-multidetector computed tomography during the index coronary occlusion. Generalized linear mixed models were used to take account of repeated measurements.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In humans, T2 relaxation time in the ischemic myocardium declines significantly from early after reperfusion to 24 hours, and then increases up to day 4, reaching a plateau from which it decreases from day 7. Consequently, edema extent measured by T2-weighted short-tau triple inversion-recovery (CMR-MaR) varied with the timing of the CMR examination. These findings were confirmed in the experimental model by showing that only CMR-MaR values for day 4 and day 7 postreperfusion, coinciding with the deferred edema wave, were similar to values measured by reference contrast-multidetector computed tomography.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Post-MI edema in patients follows a bimodal pattern that affects CMR estimates of MaR. Dynamic changes in post–ST-segment–elevation MI edema highlight the need for standardization of CMR timing to retrospectively delineate MaR and quantify myocardial salvage. According to the present clinical and experimental data, a time window between days 4 and 7 post-MI seems a good compromise solution for standardization. Further studies are needed to study the effect of other factors on these variables.</p></sec>

Neurological Injury and Cerebral Blood Flow in Single Ventricles Throughout Staged Surgical Reconstruction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients with a single ventricle experience a high rate of brain injury and adverse neurodevelopmental outcome; however, the incidence of brain abnormalities throughout surgical reconstruction and their relationship with cerebral blood flow, oxygen delivery, and carbon dioxide reactivity remain unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients with a single ventricle were studied with magnetic resonance imaging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scan</span></strong>s immediately prior to bidirectional Glenn (pre-BDG), before Fontan (BDG), and then 3 to 9 months after Fontan reconstruction.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>One hundred sixty-eight consecutive subjects recruited into the project underwent 235 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scan</span></strong>s: 63 pre-BDG (mean age, 4.8±1.7 months), 118 BDG (2.9±1.4 years), and 54 after Fontan (2.4±1.0 years). Nonacute ischemic white matter changes on T2-weighted imaging, focal tissue loss, and ventriculomegaly were all more commonly detected in BDG and Fontan compared with pre-BDG patients (<i>P</i><0.05). BDG patients had significantly higher cerebral blood flow than did Fontan patients. The odds of discovering brain injury with adjustment for surgical stage as well as ≥2 coexisting lesions within a patient decreased (63%–75% and 44%, respectively) with increasing amount of cerebral blood flow (<i>P</i><0.05).

In addition, this study demonstrated that BDG patients had greater cerebral blood flow than did Fontan patients and that an inverse association exists of various indexes of cerebral blood flow with these brain lesions.

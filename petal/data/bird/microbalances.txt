Observation of second sound in graphite at temperatures above 100 K
<p>Wavelike thermal transport in solids, referred to as second sound, is an exotic phenomenon previously limited to a handful of materials at low temperatures. The rare occurrence of this effect restricted its scientific and practical importance. We directly observed second sound in graphite at temperatures above 100 kelvins by using time-resolved optical measurements of thermal transport on the micrometer-length scale. Our experimental results are in qualitative agreement with ab initio calculations that predict wavelike phonon hydrodynamics. We believe that these results potentially indicate an important role of second sound in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microscal</span></strong>e transient heat transport in two-dimensional and layered materials in a wide temperature range.</p>

Ultralarge elastic deformation of nanoscale diamond
<p>Diamonds have substantial hardness and durability, but attempting to deform diamonds usually results in brittle fracture. We demonstrate ultralarge, fully reversible elastic deformation of nanoscale (~300 nanometers) single-crystalline and polycrystalline diamond needles. For single-crystalline diamond, the maximum tensile strains (up to 9%) approached the theoretical elastic limit, and the corresponding maximum tensile stress reached ~89 to 98 gigapascals. After combining systematic computational simulations and characterization of pre- and postdeformation structural features, we ascribe the concurrent high strength and large elastic strain to the paucity of defects in the small-volume diamond nanoneedles and to the relatively smooth surfaces compared with those of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microscal</span></strong>e and larger specimens. The discovery offers the potential for new applications through optimized design of diamond nanostructure, geometry, elastic strains, and physical properties.</p>

Interaction of 2′,3′-cAMP with Rbp47b Plays a Role in Stress Granule Formation
<p>2′,3′-cAMP is an intriguing small molecule that is conserved among different kingdoms. 2′,3′-cAMP is presumably produced during RNA degradation, with increased cellular levels observed especially under stress conditions. Previously, we observed the presence of 2′,3′-cAMP in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) protein complexes isolated from native lysate, suggesting that 2′,3′-cAMP has potential protein partners in plants. Here, affinity purification experiments revealed that 2′,3′-cAMP associates with the stress granule (SG) proteome. SGs are aggregates composed of protein and mRNA, which enable cells to selectively store mRNA for use in response to stress such as heat whereby translation initiation is impaired. Using size-exclusion chromatography and affinity purification analyses, we identified Rbp47b, the key component of SGs, as a potential interacting partner of 2′,3′-cAMP. Furthermore, SG formation was promoted in 2′,3′-cAMP-treated Arabidopsis seedlings, and interactions between 2′,3′-cAMP and RNA-binding domains of Rbp47b, RRM2 and RRM3, were confirmed in vitro using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microscal</span></strong>e thermophoresis. Taken together, these results (1) describe novel small-molecule regulation of SG formation, (2) provide evidence for the biological role of 2′,3′-cAMP, and (3) demonstrate an original biochemical pipeline for the identification of protein-metabolite interactors.</p>

Enhanced transport of nutrients powered by microscale flows of the self-spinning dinoflagellate <i>Symbiodinium</i> sp.
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Many studies suggest that complex and crowded environments slow transport from normal diffusive behavior to subdiffusive behavior, but our findings reveal that diffusivity is still enhanced with a power-law behavior in active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microscal</span></strong>e flows.</p>

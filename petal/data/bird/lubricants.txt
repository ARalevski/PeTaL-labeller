Draft genome sequence of an elite <i>Dura</i> palm and whole-genome patterns of DNA variation in oil palm
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> palm is the world’s leading source of vegetable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> and fat. <i>Dura, Pisifera</i> and <i>Tenera</i> are three forms of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> palm. The genome sequence of <i>Pisifera</i> is available whereas the <i>Dura</i> form has not been sequenced yet. We sequenced the genome of one elite <i>Dura</i> palm, and re-sequenced 17 palm genomes. The assemble genome sequence of the elite <i>Dura</i> tree contained 10,971 scaffolds and was 1.701 Gb in length, covering 94.49% of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> palm genome. 36,105 genes were predicted. Re-sequencing of 17 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional palm trees identified 18.1 million SNPs. We found high genetic variation among palms from different geographical regions, but lower variation among Southeast Asian <i>Dura</i> and <i>Pisifera</i> palms. We mapped 10,000 SNPs on the linkage map of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> palm. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, high linkage disequilibrium (LD) was detected in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> palms used in breeding populations of Southeast Asia, suggesting that LD mapping is likely to be practical in this important <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> crop. Our data provide a valuable resource for accelerating genetic improvement and studying the mechanism underlying phenotypic variations of important <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> palm traits.</p>

Selection for a Zinc-Finger Protein Contributes to Seed Oil Increase during Soybean Domestication
<p>Seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> is a momentous agronomical trait of soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) targeted by domestication in breeding. Although multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong>-related genes have been uncovered, knowledge of the regulatory mechanism of seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> biosynthesis is currently limited. We demonstrate that the seed-preferred gene <i>GmZF351</i>, encoding a tandem CCCH zinc finger protein, is selected during domestication. Further analysis shows that <i>GmZF351</i> facilitates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> accumulation by directly activating <i>WRINKLED1</i>, <i>BIOTIN CARBOXYL CARRIER PROTEIN2</i>, <i>3-KETOACYL-ACYL CARRIER PROTEIN SYNTHASE III</i>, <i>DIACYLGLYCEROL O-ACYLTRANSFERASE1</i>, and <i>OLEOSIN2</i> in transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seeds. Overexpression of <i>GmZF351</i> in transgenic soybean also activates lipid biosynthesis genes, thereby accelerating seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> accumulation. The <i>ZF351</i> haplotype from the cultivated soybean group and the wild soybean (<i>Glycine soja</i>) subgroup III correlates well with high gene expression level, seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> contents and promoter activity, suggesting that selection of <i>GmZF351</i> expression leads to increased seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> content in cultivated soybean. Our study provides novel insights into the regulatory mechanism for seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> accumulation, and the manipulation of <i>GmZF351</i> may have great potential in the improvement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> production in soybean and other related crops.</p>

MYB89 Transcription Factor Represses Seed Oil Accumulation
<p>In many higher plants, seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> accumulation is precisely controlled by intricate multilevel regulatory networks, among which transcriptional regulation mainly influences <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> biosynthesis. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the master positive transcription factors, <i>WRINKLED1</i> (<i>WRI1</i>) and <i>LEAFY COTYLEDON1-LIKE</i> (<i>L1L</i>), are important for seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> accumulation. We found that an R2R3-MYB transcription factor, MYB89, was expressed predominantly in developing seeds during maturation. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> and major fatty acid biosynthesis in seeds was significantly promoted by <i>myb89-1</i> mutation and <i>MYB89</i> knockdown; thus, MYB89 was an important repressor during seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> accumulation. RNA sequencing revealed remarkable up-regulation of numerous genes involved in seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> accumulation in <i>myb89</i> seeds at 12 d after pollination. Posttranslational activation of a MYB89-glucocorticoid receptor fusion protein and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that MYB89 inhibited seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> accumulation by directly repressing <i>WRI1</i> and five key genes and by indirectly suppressing <i>L1L</i> and 11 key genes involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> biosynthesis during seed maturation. These results help us to understand the novel function of MYB89 and provide new insights into the regulatory network of transcriptional factors controlling seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> accumulation in Arabidopsis.</p>

Effect of source/sink ratios on yield components, growth dynamics and structural characteristics of oil palm (<i>Elaeis guineensis</i>) bunches
<p>Source/sink ratios are known to be one of the main determinants of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> palm growth and development. A long-term experiment (9 years) was conducted in Indonesia on mature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> palms subjected to continuous bunch ablation and partial defoliation treatments to artificially modify source/sink ratios. During the experiment, all harvested bunches were dissected and phenological measurements were carried out to analyse the effect of source/sink ratios on yield components explaining variations in bunch number, the number of fruits per bunch and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> dry weight per fruit. An integrative variable (supply/demand ratio) describing the ratio between the assimilate supply from sources and the growing organ demand for carbohydrate was computed for each plant on a daily basis from observations of the number of developing organs and their sink strength, and of climate variables. Defoliation and bunch ablation affected the bunch number and the fruit number per bunch. Variations in bunch number per month were mainly due to variations in the fraction of aborted inflorescence and in the ratio between female and male inflorescences. Under fluctuating trophic conditions, variations in fruit number per bunch resulted both from changes in fruit-set and in the number of branches (rachillae) per inflorescence. For defoliated plants, the decrease in the number of developing reproductive sinks appeared to be sufficient to maintain fruit weight and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> concentration at the control level, without any major decrease in the concentration of non-structural carbohydrate reserves. Computation of the supply/demand ratio revealed that each yield component had a specific phase of sensitivity to supply/demand ratios during inflorescence development. Establishing quantitative relationships between supply/demand ratios, competition and yield components is the first step towards a functional model for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> palm.</p>

Hepatic thrombopoietin is required for bone marrow hematopoietic stem cell maintenance
<p>Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance depends on extrinsic cues. Currently, only local signals arising from the bone marrow niche have been shown to maintain HSCs. However, it is not known whether systemic factors also sustain HSCs. We assessed the physiological source of thrombopoietin (TPO), a key cytokine required for maintaining HSCs. Using <i>Tpo<sup>DsRed-CreER</sup></i> knock-in mice, we showed that TPO is expressed by hepatocytes but not by bone marrow cells. Deletion of <i>Tpo</i> from hematopoietic cells, osteoblasts, or bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells does not affect HSC number or function. However, when <i>Tpo</i> is deleted from hepatocytes, bone marrow HSCs are depleted. Thus, a cross-organ factor, circulating TPO made in the liver by hepatocytes, is required for bone marrow HSC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance. Our results demonstrate that systemic factors, in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion to the local niche, are a critical extrinsic component for HSC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance.</p>

Nuclear Prohibitin3 Maintains Genome Integrity and Cell Proliferation in the Root Meristem through Minichromosome Maintenance 2
<p>The nucleo-mitochondrial dual-localized proteins can act as gene expression regulators; however, few instances of these proteins have been described in plants. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) PROHIBITIN 3 (PHB3) is involved in stress responses and developmental processes, but it is unknown how these roles are achieved at the molecular level in the nucleus. In this study, we show that nucleo-mitochondrial PHB3 plays an essential role in regulating genome stability and cell proliferation. <i>PHB3</i> is up-regulated by DNA damage agents, and the stress-induced PHB3 proteins accumulate in the nucleus. Loss of function of <i>PHB3</i> results in DNA damage and defective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance of the root stem cell niche. Subsequently, the expression patterns and levels of the root stem cell regulators are altered and down-regulated, respectively. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, the <i>phb3</i> mutant shows aberrant cell division and altered expression of cell cycle–related genes, such as <i>CycB1</i> and <i>Cyclin dependent kinase 1</i>. Moreover, the minichromosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance (MCM) genes, e.g. <i>MCM2</i>, <i>MCM3</i>, <i>MCM4</i>, <i>MCM5</i>, <i>MCM6</i>, and <i>MCM7</i>, are up-regulated in the <i>phb3</i> mutant. Reducing the <i>MCM2</i> expression level substantially recovers the DNA damage in the <i>phb3</i> mutant and partially rescues the altered cell proliferation and root deficiency of <i>phb3</i> seedlings. PHB3 acts as a transcriptional coregulator that represses <i>MCM2</i> expression by competitively binding to the promoter E2F–cis-acting elements with E2Fa so as to modulate primary root growth. Collectively, these findings indicate that nuclear-localized PHB3 acts as a transcriptional coregulator that suppresses <i>MCM2</i> expression to sustain genome integrity and cell proliferation for stem cell niche <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance in Arabidopsis.</p>

Tri-Hydroxy-Triacylglycerol Is Efficiently Produced by Position-Specific Castor Acyltransferases
<p>Understanding the biochemistry of triacylglycerol (TAG) assembly is critical in tailoring seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong>s to produce high-value products. Hydroxy-fatty acid (HFA) is one such valuable modified fatty acid, which can be produced at low levels in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed through transgenic expression of the castor (<i>Ricinus communis</i>) hydroxylase. The resulting plants have low seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> content and poor seedling establishment, indicating that Arabidopsis lacks efficient metabolic networks for biosynthesis and catabolism of hydroxy-containing TAG. To improve utilization of such substrates, we expressed three castor acyltransferase enzymes that incorporate HFA at each stereochemical position during TAG synthesis. This produced abundant tri-HFA TAG and concentrated 44% of seed HFA moieties into this one TAG species. Ricinoleic acid was more abundant than any other fatty acid in these seeds, which had 3-fold more HFA by weight than that in seeds following simple hydroxylase expression, the highest yet measured in a nonnative plant. Efficient utilization of hydroxy-containing lipid substrates increased the rate of TAG synthesis 2-fold, leading to complete relief of the low-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> phenotype. Partition of HFA into specific TAG molecules increased the storage lipid available for mobilization during seedling development, resulting in a 1.9-fold increase in seedling establishment. Expression of a complete acyltransferase pathway to efficiently process HFA establishes a benchmark in the quest to successfully produce modified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong>s in plants.</p>

A Specialized Diacylglycerol Acyltransferase Contributes to the Extreme Medium-Chain Fatty Acid Content of <i>Cuphea</i> Seed Oil
<p>Seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong>s of many <i>Cuphea</i> sp. contain >90% of medium-chain fatty acids, such as decanoic acid (10:0). These seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong>s, which are among the most compositionally variant in the plant kingdom, arise from specialized fatty acid biosynthetic enzymes and specialized acyltransferases. These include lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferases (LPAT) and diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGAT) that are required for successive acylation of medium-chain fatty acids in the <i>sn</i>-2 and <i>sn</i>-3 positions of seed triacylglycerols (TAGs). Here we report the identification of a cDNA for a DGAT1-type enzyme, designated CpuDGAT1, from the transcriptome of <i>C. avigera</i> var <i>pulcherrima</i> developing seeds. Microsomes of camelina (<i>Camelina sativa</i>) seeds engineered for CpuDGAT1 expression displayed DGAT activity with 10:0-CoA and the diacylglycerol didecanoyl, that was approximately 4-fold higher than that in camelina seed microsomes lacking CpuDGAT1. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, coexpression in camelina seeds of CpuDGAT1 with a <i>C. viscosissima</i> FatB thioesterase (CvFatB1) that generates 10:0 resulted in TAGs with nearly 15 mol % of 10:0. More strikingly, expression of CpuDGAT1 and CvFatB1 with the previously described CvLPAT2, a 10:0-CoA-specific <i>Cuphea</i> LPAT, increased 10:0 amounts to 25 mol % in camelina seed TAG. These TAGs contained up to 40 mol % 10:0 in the <i>sn</i>-2 position, nearly double the amounts obtained from coexpression of CvFatB1 and CvLPAT2 alone. Although enriched in diacylglycerol, 10:0 was not detected in phosphatidylcholine in these seeds. These findings are consistent with channeling of 10:0 into TAG through the combined activities of specialized LPAT and DGAT activities and demonstrate the biotechnological use of these enzymes to generate 10:0-rich seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong>s.</p>

Functional TR was present in 88%; in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, 22 patients were also treated with the MitraClip system for mitral regurgitation as a combined procedure. The degree of TR was severe or massive in 88% of patients before the procedure. The MitraClip device was successfully implanted in the tricuspid valve in 97% of the cases. After the procedure, TR was reduced by at least 1 grade in 91% of the patients, thereof 4% that were reduced from massive to severe. In 13% of patients, TR remained severe after the procedure. Significant reductions in effective regurgitant orifice area (0.9±0.3cm<sup>2</sup> versus 0.4±0.2cm<sup>2</sup>; <i>P</i><0.001), vena contracta width (1.1±0.5 cm versus 0.6±0.3 cm; <i>P</i>=0.001), and regurgitant volume (57.2±12.8 mL/beat versus 30.8±6.9 mL/beat; <i>P</i><0.001) were observed.

Suppressing corrosion in primary aluminum–air batteries via oil displacement
<p>Primary aluminum–air batteries boast high theoretical energy densities, but negative electrode corrosion irreversibly limits their shelf life. Most corrosion mitigation methods are insufficient or compromise power and energy density. We suppressed open-circuit corrosion by displacing electrolyte from the electrode surface with a nonconducting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> during battery standby. High power and energy density are enabled by displacing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> with electrolyte for battery discharge. The underwater-oleophobic wetting properties of the designed cell surfaces allow for reversible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> displacement. We demonstrate this method in an aluminum–air cell that achieves a 420% increase in usable energy density and 99.99% reduction in corrosion, which lowers self-discharge to a rate of 0.02% a month and enables system energy densities of 700 watt-hours per liter and 900 watt-hours per kilogram.</p>

Multivalent counterions diminish the lubricity of polyelectrolyte brushes
<p>Polyelectrolyte brushes provide wear protection and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lubric</span></strong>ation in many technical, medical, physiological, and biological applications. Wear resistance and low friction are attributed to counterion osmotic pressure and the hydration layer surrounding the charged polymer segments. However, the presence of multivalent counterions in solution can strongly affect the interchain interactions and structural properties of brush layers. We evaluated the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lubric</span></strong>ation properties of polystyrene sulfonate brush layers sliding against each other in aqueous solutions containing increasing concentrations of counterions. The presence of multivalent ions (Y<sup>3+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Ba<sup>2+</sup>), even at minute concentrations, markedly increases the friction forces between brush layers owing to electrostatic bridging and brush collapse. Our results suggest that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lubric</span></strong>ating properties of polyelectrolyte brushes in multivalent solution are hindered relative to those in monovalent solution.</p>

Wrapping with a splash: High-speed encapsulation with ultrathin sheets
<p>Many complex fluids rely on surfactants to contain, protect, or isolate liquid drops in an immiscible continuous phase. Thin elastic sheets can wrap liquid drops in a spontaneous process driven by capillary forces. For encapsulation by sheets to be practically viable, a rapid, continuous, and scalable process is essential. We exploit the fast dynamics of droplet impact to achieve wrapping of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> droplets by ultrathin polymer films in a water phase. Despite the violence of splashing events, the process robustly yields wrappings that are optimally shaped to maximize the enclosed fluid volume and have near-perfect seams. We achieve wrappings of targeted three-dimensional (3D) shapes by tailoring the 2D boundary of the films and show the generality of the technique by producing both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong>-in-water and water-in-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> wrappings.</p>

Preventing mussel adhesion using lubricant-infused materials

We demonstrate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lubric</span></strong>ant-infused coatings exhibit very low preferential mussel attachment and ultralow adhesive strengths under both controlled laboratory conditions and in marine field studies. Detailed investigations across multiple length scales—from the molecular-scale characterization of deposited adhesive proteins to nanoscale contact mechanics to macroscale live observations—suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lubric</span></strong>ant infusion considerably reduces fouling by deceiving the mechanosensing ability of mussels, deterring secretion of adhesive threads, and decreasing the molecular work of adhesion.

The Role of Gβ Protein in Controlling Cell Expansion via Potential Interaction with Lipid Metabolic Pathways
<p>Heterotrimeric G-proteins influence almost all aspects of plant growth, development, and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses in plants, likely via their interaction with specific effectors. However, the identity of such effectors and their mechanism of action are mostly unknown. While investigating the roles of different G-protein subunits in modulating the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> content in Camelina (<i>Camelina sativa</i>), an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> seed crop, we uncovered a role of Gβ proteins in controlling anisotropic cell expansion. Knockdown of <i>Gβ</i> genes causes reduced longitudinal and enhanced transverse expansion, resulting in altered cell, tissue, and organ shapes in transgenic plants during vegetative and reproductive development. These plants also exhibited substantial changes in their fatty acid and phospholipid profiles, which possibly leads to the increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> content of the transgenic seeds. This increase is potentially caused by the direct interaction of Gβ proteins with a specific patatin-like phospholipase, pPLAIIIδ. Camelina plants with suppressed <i>Gβ</i> expression exhibit higher lipase activity, and show phenotypes similar to plants overexpressing <i>pPLAIIIδ</i>, suggesting that the Gβ proteins are negative regulators of pPLAIIIδ. These results reveal interactions between the G-protein–mediated and lipid signaling/metabolic pathways, where specific phospholipases may act as effectors that control key developmental and environmental responses of plants.</p>

Extracellular ATP Acts on Jasmonate Signaling to Reinforce Plant Defense
<p>Damaged cells send various signals to stimulate defense responses. Recent identification and genetic studies of the plant purinoceptor, P2K1 (also known as DORN1), have demonstrated that extracellular ATP is a signal involved in plant stress responses, including wounding, perhaps to evoke plant defense. However, it remains largely unknown how extracellular ATP induces plant defense responses. Here, we demonstrate that extracellular ATP induces plant defense mediated through activation of the intracellular signaling of jasmonate (JA), a well-characterized defense hormone. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves, ATP pretreatment induced resistance against the necrotrophic fungus, <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>. The induced resistance was enhanced in the P2K1 receptor overexpression line, but reduced in the receptor mutant, <i>dorn1</i>-<i>3</i>. Mining the transcriptome data revealed that ATP induces a set of JA-induced genes. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, the P2K1-associated coexpression network contains defense-related genes, including those encoding jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins, which play key roles as repressors of JA signaling. We examined whether extracellular ATP impacts the stability of JAZ1 in Arabidopsis. The results showed that the JAZ1 stability decreased in response to ATP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion in a proteasome-dependent manner. This reduction required intracellular signaling via second messengers—cytosolic calcium, reactive oxygen species, and nitric oxide. Interestingly, the ATP-induced JAZ1 degradation was attenuated in the JA receptor mutant, <i>coi1</i>, but not in the JA biosynthesis mutant, <i>aos</i>, or upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion of JA biosynthesis inhibitors. Immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that ATP increases the interaction between COI1 and JAZ1, suggesting direct cross talk between extracellular ATP and JA in intracellular signaling events. Taken together, these results suggest that extracellular ATP signaling directly impacts the JA signaling pathway to maximize plant defense responses.</p>

Phospholipid:Diacylglycerol Acyltransferase-Mediated Triacylglyerol Synthesis Augments Basal Thermotolerance
<p>High temperatures rapidly induce a genetically programmed heat-shock response (HSR) that is essential to establish short-term acquired thermotolerance. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, an immediate HSR-independent metabolic response is triggered, resulting in an accumulation of unsaturated triacylglycerols (TAGs) in the cytosol. The metabolic processes involved in heat-induced TAG formation in plants and their physiological significance remain to be clarified. Lipidomic analyses of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings indicated that during heat stress, polyunsaturated fatty acids from thylakoid galactolipids are incorporated into cytosolic TAGs. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, rapid conversion of plastidic monogalactosyl diacylglycerols (MGDGs) into oligogalactolipids, acylated MGDGs, and diacylglycerols (DAGs), the direct precursor of TAGs, was observed. For TAG synthesis, DAG requires a fatty acid from the acyl-CoA pool or phosphatidylcholine. Since seedlings deficient in PHOSPHOLIPID:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1 (PDAT1) were unable to accumulate TAGs after heat stress, phosphatidylcholine appears to be the major fatty acid donor. Results suggest that rapid plastid lipid metabolism drives TAG accumulation during heat stress. PDAT1-mediated TAG accumulation was found to increase heat resistance, since nonacclimated <i>pdat1</i> mutant seedlings were more sensitive to severe heat stress, as indicated by a more dramatic decline of the maximum efficiency of PSII and lower seedling survival compared to wild-type seedlings. In contrast, nonacclimated <i>trigalactosyldiacylglycerol1</i> (<i>tgd1</i>) mutants overaccumulating TAGs and oligogalactolipids were more resistant to heat stress. Hence, thylakoid lipid metabolism and TAG formation increases thermotolerance in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion to the genetically encoded HSR.</p>

A Light Harvesting Complex-Like Protein in Maintenance of Photosynthetic Components in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>
<p>Using a genetic approach, we have identified and characterized a novel protein, named Msf1 (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance factor for photosystem I), that is required for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance of specific components of the photosynthetic apparatus in the green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>. Msf1 belongs to the superfamily of light-harvesting complex proteins with three transmembrane domains and consensus chlorophyll-binding sites. Loss of Msf1 leads to reduced accumulation of photosystem I and chlorophyll-binding proteins/complexes. Msf1is a component of a thylakoid complex containing key enzymes of the tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway, thus revealing a possible link between Msf1 and chlorophyll biosynthesis. Protein interaction assays and greening experiments demonstrate that Msf1 interacts with Copper target homolog1 (CHL27B) and accumulates concomitantly with chlorophyll in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>, implying that chlorophyll stabilizes Msf1. Contrary to other light-harvesting complex-like genes, the expression of <i>Msf1</i> is not stimulated by high-light stress, but its protein level increases significantly under heat shock, iron and copper limitation, as well as in stationary cells. Based on these results, we propose that Msf1 is required for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance of photosystem I and specific protein-chlorophyll complexes especially under certain stress conditions.</p>

Tight junction protein gene expression patterns and changes in transcript abundance during development of model fish gill epithelia
<p>In vertebrates, tight junction (TJ) proteins play an important role in epithelium formation and development, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance of tissue integrity and regulation of TJ permeability. In this study, primary cultured model gill epithelia composed of pavement cells (PVCs) were used to examine TJ protein transcript abundance during the development of epithelium confluence and epithelium resistive properties. Differences in TJ protein expression patterns and transcript abundance between gill models composed of PVCs and models composed of PVCs and mitochondrion-rich cells (MRCs) were also examined. Marked alterations in TJ protein transcript abundance were observed as cells developed to confluence in flask-cultured model gill epithelia. In contrast, during the formation of tissue resistance in insert-cultured epithelia (i.e. epithelia cultured on a permeable substrate), changes in TJ protein mRNA abundance were conservative, despite paracellular marker flux decreasing by orders of magnitude. In both cases significant changes in <i>claudin-8b, -8d, -27b, -28b</i> and -<i>32a</i> transcript abundance were observed, suggesting that temporal alterations in the abundance of these genes are important end points of model gill epithelium integrity. When MRCs were present in cultured gill models, the mRNA abundance of several TJ proteins significantly altered and <i>claudin-10c, -10d</i> and -<i>33b</i> were only detected in preparations that included MRCs. These data provide insight into the role of select TJ proteins in the formation and development of gill epithelia and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance of gill barrier properties. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, observations reveal a heterogeneous distribution of claudin TJ proteins in the gill epithelial cells of rainbow trout.</p>

An increase in minimum metabolic rate and not activity explains field metabolic rate changes in a breeding seabird
<p>The field metabolic rate (FMR) of a free-ranging animal can be considered as the sum of its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance costs (minimum metabolic rate, MMR) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional costs associated with thermoregulation, digestion, production and activity. However, the relationships between FMR and BMR and how they relate to behaviour and extrinsic influences is not clear. In seabirds, FMR has been shown to increase during the breeding season. This is presumed to be the result of an increase in foraging activity, stimulated by increased food demands from growing chicks, but few studies have investigated in detail the factors that underlie these increases. We studied free-ranging Australasian gannets (<i>Morus serrator</i>) throughout their 5 month breeding season, and evaluated FMR, MMR and activity-related metabolic costs on a daily basis using the heart rate method. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, we simultaneously recorded behaviour (flying and diving) in the same individuals. FMR increased steadily throughout the breeding season, increasing by 11% from the incubation period to the long chick-brooding period. However, this was not accompanied by either an increase in flying or diving behaviour, or an increase in the energetic costs of activity. Instead, the changes in FMR could be explained exclusively by a progressive increase in MMR. Seasonal changes in MMR could be due to a change in body composition or a decrease in body condition associated with changing the allocation of resources between provisioning adults and growing chicks. Our study highlights the importance of measuring physiological parameters continuously in free-ranging animals in order to understand fully the mechanisms underpinning seasonal changes in physiology and behaviour.</p>

<i>chaoptin</i>, <i>prominin</i>, <i>eyes shut</i> and <i>crumbs</i> form a genetic network controlling the apical compartment of <i>Drosophila</i> photoreceptor cells
<p>The apical surface of epithelial cells is often highly specialised to fulfil cell type-specific functions. Many epithelial cells expand their apical surface by forming microvilli, actin-based, finger-like membrane protrusions. The apical surface of <i>Drosophila</i> photoreceptor cells (PRCs) forms tightly packed microvilli, which are organised into the photosensitive rhabdomeres. As previously shown, the GPI-anchored adhesion protein Chaoptin is required for the stability of the microvilli, whereas the transmembrane protein Crumbs is essential for proper rhabdomere morphogenesis. Here we show that <i>chaoptin</i> synergises with <i>crumbs</i> to ensure optimal rhabdomere width. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, reduction of <i>crumbs</i> ameliorates morphogenetic defects observed in PRCs mutant for <i>prominin</i> and <i>eyes shut</i>, known antagonists of <i>chaoptin</i>. These results suggest that these four genes provide a balance of adhesion and anti-adhesion to maintain microvilli development and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance. Similar to <i>crumbs</i> mutant PRCs, PRCs devoid of <i>prominin</i> or <i>eyes shut</i> undergo light-dependent retinal degeneration. Given the observation that human orthologues of <i>crumbs</i>, <i>prominin</i> and <i>eyes shut</i> result in progressive retinal degeneration and blindness, the <i>Drosophila</i> eye is ideally suited to unravel the genetic and cellular mechanisms that ensure morphogenesis of PRCs and their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance under light-mediated stress.</p>

NADPH Thioredoxin Reductase C and Thioredoxins Act Concertedly in Seedling Development
<p>Thiol-dependent redox regulation of enzyme activity plays a central role in the rapid acclimation of chloroplast metabolism to ever-fluctuating light availability. This regulatory mechanism relies on ferredoxin reduced by the photosynthetic electron transport chain, which fuels reducing power to thioredoxins (Trxs) via a ferredoxin-dependent Trx reductase. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, chloroplasts harbor an NADPH-dependent Trx reductase, which has a joint Trx domain at the carboxyl terminus, termed NTRC. Thus, a relevant issue concerning chloroplast function is to establish the relationship between these two redox systems and its impact on plant development. To address this issue, we generated Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants combining the deficiency of NTRC with those of Trxs <i>f</i>, which participate in metabolic redox regulation, and that of Trx <i>x</i>, which has antioxidant function. The <i>ntrc-trxf1f2</i> and, to a lower extent, <i>ntrc-trxx</i> mutants showed severe growth-retarded phenotypes, decreased photosynthesis performance, and almost abolished light-dependent reduction of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. Moreover, the combined deficiency of both redox systems provokes aberrant chloroplast ultrastructure. Remarkably, both the <i>ntrc-trxf1f2</i> and <i>ntrc-trxx</i> mutants showed high mortality at the seedling stage, which was overcome by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion of an exogenous carbon source. Based on these results, we propose that NTRC plays a pivotal role in chloroplast redox regulation, being necessary for the activity of diverse Trxs with unrelated functions. The interaction between the two thiol redox systems is indispensable to sustain photosynthesis performed by cotyledons chloroplasts, which is essential for early plant development.</p>

Scanning for New BRI1 Mutations via TILLING Analysis
<p>The identification and characterization of a mutational spectrum for a specific protein can help to elucidate its detailed cellular functions. BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1 (BRI1), a multidomain transmembrane receptor-like kinase, is a major receptor of brassinosteroids in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Within the last two decades, over 20 different <i>bri1</i> mutant alleles have been identified, which helped to determine the significance of each domain within BRI1. To further understand the molecular mechanisms of BRI1, we tried to identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional alleles via targeted induced local lesions in genomes. Here, we report our identification of 83 new point mutations in <i>BRI1</i>, including nine mutations that exhibit an allelic series of typical <i>bri1</i> phenotypes, from subtle to severe morphological alterations. We carried out biochemical analyses to investigate possible mechanisms of these mutations in affecting brassinosteroid signaling. A number of interesting mutations have been isolated via this study. For example, <i>bri1-702</i>, the only weak allele identified so far with a mutation in the activation loop, showed reduced autophosphorylation activity. <i>bri1-705</i>, a subtle allele with a mutation in the extracellular portion, disrupts the interaction of BRI1 with its ligand brassinolide and coreceptor BRI1-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR KINASE1. <i>bri1-706</i>, with a mutation in the extracellular portion, is a subtle defective mutant. Surprisingly, root inhibition analysis indicated that it is largely insensitive to exogenous brassinolide treatment. In this study, we found that <i>bri1-301</i> possesses kinase activity in vivo, clarifying a previous report arguing that kinase activity may not be necessary for the function of BRI1. These data provide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional insights into our understanding of the early events in the brassinosteroid signaling pathway.</p>

Stearoyl-Acyl Carrier Protein Desaturase Mutations Uncover an Impact of Stearic Acid in Leaf and Nodule Structure
<p>Stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturase (SACPD-C) has been reported to control the accumulation of seed stearic acid; however, no study has previously reported its involvement in leaf stearic acid content and impact on leaf structure and morphology. A subset of an ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenized population of soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) ‘Forrest’ was screened to identify mutants within the <i>GmSACPD-C</i> gene. Using a forward genetics approach, one nonsense and four missense <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutants were identified to have high levels of seed, nodule, and leaf stearic acid content. Homology modeling and in silico analysis of the GmSACPD-C enzyme revealed that most of these mutations were localized near or at conserved residues essential for diiron ion coordination. Soybeans carrying <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutations at conserved residues showed the highest stearic acid content, and these mutations were found to have deleterious effects on nodule development and function. Interestingly, mutations at nonconserved residues show an increase in stearic acid content yet retain healthy nodules. Thus, random mutagenesis and mutational analysis allows for the achievement of high seed stearic acid content with no associated negative agronomic characteristics. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ionally, expression analysis demonstrates that nodule leghemoglobin transcripts were significantly more abundant in soybeans with deleterious mutations at conserved residues of GmSACPD-C. Finally, we report that <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutations cause an increase in leaf stearic acid content and an alteration of leaf structure and morphology in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion to differences in nitrogen-fixing nodule structure.</p>

Regulatory Phosphorylation of Bacterial-Type PEP Carboxylase by the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-Dependent Protein Kinase RcCDPK1 in Developing Castor Oil Seeds
<p>Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) is a tightly controlled cytosolic enzyme situated at a crucial branch point of central plant metabolism. In developing castor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> seeds (<i>Ricinus communis</i>) a novel, allosterically desensitized 910-kD Class-2 PEPC hetero-octameric complex, arises from a tight interaction between 107-kD plant-type PEPC and 118-kD bacterial-type (BTPC) subunits. The native Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein kinase (CDPK) responsible for in vivo inhibitory phosphorylation of Class-2 PEPC’s BTPC subunit’s at Ser-451 was highly purified from COS and identified as RcCDPK1 (XP_002526815) by mass spectrometry. Heterologously expressed RcCDPK1 catalyzed Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent, inhibitory phosphorylation of BTPC at Ser-451 while exhibiting: (<i>i</i>) a pair of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding sites with identical dissociation constants of 5.03 μM, (<i>ii</i>) a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent electrophoretic mobility shift, and (<i>iii</i>) a marked Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent hydrophobicity. Pull-down experiments established the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent interaction of N-terminal GST-tagged RcCDPK1 with BTPC. RcCDPK1-Cherry localized to the cytosol and nucleus of tobacco bright yellow-2 cells, but colocalized with mitochondrial-surface associated BTPC-enhanced yellow fluorescent protein when both fusion proteins were coexpressed. Deletion analyses demonstrated that although its N-terminal variable domain plays an essential role in optimizing Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent RcCDPK1 autophosphorylation and BTPC transphosphorylation activity, it is not critical for in vitro or in vivo target recognition. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) CPK4 and soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) CDPKβ are RcCDPK1 orthologs that effectively phosphorylated castor BTPC at Ser-451. Overall, the results highlight a potential link between cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and the posttranslational control of respiratory CO<sub>2</sub> refixation and anaplerotic photosynthate partitioning in support of storage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> and protein biosynthesis in developing COS.</p>

A Rice <i>PECTATE LYASE-LIKE</i> Gene Is Required for Plant Growth and Leaf Senescence
<p>To better understand the molecular mechanisms behind plant growth and leaf senescence in monocot plants, we identified a mutant exhibiting dwarfism and an early-senescence leaf phenotype, termed <i>dwarf and early-senescence leaf1</i> (<i>del1</i>). Histological analysis showed that the abnormal growth was caused by a reduction in cell number. Further investigation revealed that the decline in cell number in <i>del1</i> was affected by the cell cycle. Physiological analysis, transmission electron microscopy, and TUNEL assays showed that leaf senescence was triggered by the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. The <i>DEL1</i> gene was cloned using a map-based approach. It was shown to encode a pectate lyase (PEL) precursor that contains a PelC domain. <i>DEL1</i> contains all the conserved residues of PEL and has strong similarity with plant PelC. <i>DEL1</i> is expressed in all tissues but predominantly in elongating tissues. Functional analysis revealed that mutation of <i>DEL1</i> decreased the total PEL enzymatic activity, increased the degree of methylesterified homogalacturonan, and altered the cell wall composition and structure. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, transcriptome assay revealed that a set of cell wall function- and senescence-related gene expression was altered in <i>del1</i> plants. Our research indicates that <i>DEL1</i> is involved in both the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance of normal cell division and the induction of leaf senescence. These findings reveal a new molecular mechanism for plant growth and leaf senescence mediated by <i>PECTATE LYASE-LIKE</i> genes.</p>

Dimerization in LBD16 and LBD18 Transcription Factors Is Critical for Lateral Root Formation
<p>LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES DOMAIN/ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2-LIKEs (hereafter referred to as LBD) are plant-specific transcription factors that play important roles in a plethora of plant growth and development. The leucine (Leu) zipper-like c<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong>ed-c<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> motif in the lateral organ boundaries domain of the class I LBD proteins has been proposed to mediate protein dimerization, but it has not been experimentally assessed yet. LBD16 and LBD18 have been well characterized to play important roles in lateral root development in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Here, we investigated the role of the c<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong>ed-c<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> motif in the dimerization of LBD16 and LBD18 and in transcriptional regulation and biological function. We built the molecular models of the c<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong>ed c<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> of LBD16 and LBD18, providing the probable Leu zipper models of the helix dimer. Using a variety of molecular techniques, such as bimolecular fluorescence complementation, luciferase complementation imaging, GST pull down, and coimmunoprecipitation assays, we showed that the conserved Leu or valine residues in the c<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong>ed-c<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> motif are critical for the dimerization of LBD16 or LBD18. Using transgenic Arabidopsis plants that overexpress HA:LBD16 or HA:LBD16<sup>Q</sup> in <i>lbd16</i> or HA:LBD18 or HA:LBD18<sup>Q</sup> in <i>lbd18</i>, we demonstrated that the homodimerization of LBD18 mediated by the c<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong>ed-c<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> motif is crucial for transcriptional regulation via promoter binding and for lateral root formation. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, we found that the carboxyl-terminal region beyond the c<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong>ed-c<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> motif in LBD18 acts as an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional dimerization domain.

The Microtubule-Associated Protein MAP18 Affects ROP2 GTPase Activity during Root Hair Growth
<p>Establishment and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance of the polar site are important for root hair tip growth. We previously reported that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN18 (MAP18) functions in controlling the direction of pollen tube growth and root hair elongation. Additionally, the Rop GTPase ROP2 was reported as a positive regulator of both root hair initiation and tip growth in Arabidopsis. Both loss of function of <i>ROP2</i> and knockdown of <i>MAP18</i> lead to a decrease in root hair length, whereas overexpression of either <i>MAP18</i> or <i>ROP2</i> causes multiple tips or a branching hair phenotype. However, it is unclear whether MAP18 and ROP2 coordinately regulate root hair growth. In this study, we demonstrate that MAP18 and ROP2 interact genetically and functionally. MAP18 interacts physically with ROP2 in vitro and in vivo and preferentially binds to the inactive form of the ROP2 protein. MAP18 promotes ROP2 activity during root hair tip growth. Further investigation revealed that MAP18 competes with RhoGTPase GDP DISSOCIATION INHIBITOR1/SUPERCENTIPEDE1 for binding to ROP2, in turn affecting the localization of active ROP2 in the plasma membrane of the root hair tip. These results reveal a novel function of MAP18 in the regulation of ROP2 activation during root hair growth.</p>

Two Acyltransferases Contribute Differently to Linolenic Acid Levels in Seed Oil
<p>Acyltransferases are key contributors to triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis and, thus, are of great importance for seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> quality. The effects of increased or decreased expression of <i>ACYL-COENZYME A:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1</i> (<i>DGAT1</i>) or <i>PHOSPHOLIPID:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE</i> (<i>PDAT</i>) on seed lipid composition were assessed in several <i>Camelina sativa</i> lines. Furthermore, in vitro assays of acyltransferases in microsomal fractions prepared from developing seeds of some of these lines were performed. Decreased expression of <i>DGAT1</i> led to an increased percentage of 18:3<i>n</i>-3 without any change in total lipid content of the seed. The tri-18:3 TAG increase occurred predominantly in the cotyledon, as determined with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry, whereas species with two 18:3<i>n</i>-3 acyl groups were elevated in both cotyledon and embryonal axis. <i>PDAT</i> overexpression led to a relative increase of 18:2<i>n</i>-6 at the expense of 18:3<i>n</i>-3, also without affecting the total lipid content. Differential distributions of TAG species also were observed in different parts of the seed. The microsomal assays revealed that <i>C.</i> <i>sativa</i> seeds have very high activity of diacylglycerol-phosphatidylcholine interconversion. The combination of analytical and biochemical data suggests that the higher 18:2<i>n</i>-6 content in the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> of the <i>PDAT</i> overexpressors is due to the channeling of fatty acids from phosphatidylcholine into TAG before being desaturated to 18:3<i>n</i>-3, caused by the high activity of PDAT in general and by PDAT specificity for 18:2<i>n</i>-6. The higher levels of 18:3<i>n</i>-3 in <i>DGAT1</i>-silencing lines are likely due to the compensatory activity of a TAG-synthesizing enzyme with specificity for this acyl group and more desaturation of acyl groups occurring on phosphatidylcholine.</p>

Spatial and Temporal Mapping of Key Lipid Species in <i>Brassica napus</i> Seeds
<p>The regulation of lipid synthesis in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> seeds is still not fully understood. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong>seed rape (<i>Brassica napus</i>) is the third most productive vegetable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> crop on the global market; therefore, increasing our understanding of lipid accumulation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong>seed rape seeds is of great economic, as well as intellectual, importance. Matrix-assisted laser/desorption ionization-mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) is a technique that allows the mapping of metabolites directly onto intact biological tissues, giving a spatial context to metabolism. We have used MALDI-MSI to study the spatial distribution of two major lipid species, triacylglycerols and phosphatidylcholines. A dramatic, heterogenous landscape of molecular species was revealed, demonstrating significantly different lipid compositions between the various tissue types within the seed. The embryonic axis was found to be particularly enriched in palmitic acid, while the seed coat/aleurone layer accumulated vaccenic, linoleic, and α-linoleic acids. Furthermore, the lipid composition of the inner and outer cotyledons differed from each other, a remarkable discovery given the supposed identical functionality of these two tissues. Triacylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine molecular species distribution was analyzed through a developmental time series covering early seed lipid accumulation to seed maturity. The spatial patterning of lipid molecular species did not vary significantly during seed development. Data gathered using MALDI-MSI was verified through gas chromatography analysis of dissected seeds. The distinct lipid distribution profiles observed imply differential regulation of lipid metabolism between the different tissue types of the seed. Further understanding of this differential regulation will enhance efforts to improve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong>seed rape productivity and quality.</p>

Dynamic Interplay between Nucleoid Segregation and Genome Integrity in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> Chloroplasts
<p>The chloroplast (cp) genome is organized as nucleoids that are dispersed throughout the cp stroma. Previously, a cp homolog of bacterial recombinase RecA (cpRECA) was shown to be involved in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance of cp genome integrity by repairing damaged chloroplast DNA and by suppressing aberrant recombination between short dispersed repeats in the moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. Here, overexpression and knockdown analysis of cpRECA in the green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> revealed that cpRECA was involved in cp nucleoid dynamics as well as having a role in maintaining cp genome integrity. Overexpression of <i>cpRECA</i> tagged with yellow fluorescent protein or hemagglutinin resulted in the formation of giant filamentous structures that colocalized exclusively to chloroplast DNA and cpRECA localized to cp nucleoids in a heterogenous manner. Knockdown of <i>cpRECA</i> led to a significant reduction in cp nucleoid number that was accompanied by nucleoid enlargement. This phenotype resembled those of gyrase inhibitor-treated cells and <i>monokaryotic chloroplast</i> mutant cells and suggested that cpRECA was involved in organizing cp nucleoid dynamics. The cp genome also was destabilized by induced recombination between short dispersed repeats in <i>cpRECA-</i>knockdown cells and gyrase inhibitor-treated cells. Taken together, these results suggest that cpRECA and gyrase are both involved in nucleoid dynamics and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance of genome integrity and that the mechanisms underlying these processes may be intimately related in <i>C. reinhardtii</i> cps.</p>

Insights from the Shell Proteome: Biomineralization to Adaptation
<p>Bivalves have evolved a range of complex shell forming mechanisms that are reflected by their incredible diversity in shell mineralogy and microstructures. A suite of proteins exported to the shell matrix space plays a significant role in controlling these features, in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion to underpinning some of the physical properties of the shell itself. Although, there is a general consensus that a minimum basic protein tool kit is required for shell construction, to date, this remains undefined. In this study, the shell matrix proteins (SMPs) of four highly divergent bivalves (The Pacific oyster, <i>Crassostrea gigas</i>; the blue mussel, <i>Mytilus edulis</i>; the clam, <i>Mya truncata</i>, and the king scallop, <i>Pecten maximus</i>) were analyzed in an identical fashion using proteomics pipeline. This enabled us to identify the critical elements of a “basic tool kit” for calcification processes, which were conserved across the taxa irrespective of the shell morphology and arrangement of the crystal surfaces. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, protein domains controlling the crystal layers specific to aragonite and calcite were also identified. Intriguingly, a significant number of the identified SMPs contained domains related to immune functions. These were often are unique to each species implying their involvement not only in immunity, but also environmental adaptation. This suggests that the SMPs are selectively exported in a complex mix to endow the shell with both mechanical protection and biochemical defense.</p>

Comparative Genomics of the Pine Pathogens and Beetle Symbionts in the Genus <i>Grosmannia</i>
<p>Studies on beetle/tree fungal symbionts typically characterize the ecological and geographic distributions of the fungal populations. There is limited understanding of the genome-wide evolutionary processes that act within and between species as such fungi adapt to different environments, leading to physiological differences and reproductive isolation. Here, we assess genomic evidence for such evolutionary processes by extending our recent work on <i>Grosmannia clavigera</i>, which is vectored by the mountain pine beetle and jeffrey pine beetle. We report the genome sequences of an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional 11 <i>G. clavigera</i> (Gc) sensu lato strains from the two known sibling species, <i>Grosmannia</i> sp. (Gs) and Gc. The 12 fungal genomes are structurally similar, showing large-scale synteny within and between species. We identified 103,430 single-nucleotide variations that separated the <i>Grosmannia</i> strains into divergent Gs and Gc clades, and further divided each of these clades into two subclades, one of which may represent an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional species. Comparing variable genes between these lineages, we identified truncated genes and potential pseudogenes, as well as seven genes that show evidence of positive selection. As these variable genes are involved in secondary metabolism and in detoxifying or utilizing host-tree defense chemicals (e.g., polyketide synthases, oxidoreductases, and mono-oxygenases), their variants may reflect adaptation to the specific chemistries of the host trees <i>Pinus contorta</i>, <i>P. ponderosa</i>, and <i>P. jeffreyi</i>. This work provides a comprehensive resource for developing informative markers for landscape population genomics of these ecologically and economically important fungi, and an approach that could be extended to other beetle–tree-associated fungi.</p>

Differential effects of vitamins E and C and carotenoids on growth, resistance to oxidative stress, fledging success and plumage colouration in wild great tits
<p>Oxidative stress is the imbalance between the production of reactive species and antioxidants, which causes damage to lipids, proteins and DNA. Antioxidants, like vitamins and carotenoids, can limit oxidative damage and can therefore regulate the trade-off between growth, which is a period of high reactive species production, and self-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance. However, the role of carotenoids as antioxidants <i>in vivo</i> has been debated, and it has been suggested that carotenoid-based signals indicate the availability of non-pigmentary antioxidants (e.g. vitamins) that protect carotenoids from oxidation, known as the ‘protection hypothesis’. To evaluate the importance of vitamins versus carotenoids as antioxidants during growth and to test the protection hypothesis, we supplemented nestling great tits, <i>Parus major</i>, 3, 5 and 7 days after hatching with a single dose of carotenoids and/or vitamins in a 2×2 full-factorial design. We subsequently measured body condition, antioxidant capacity, oxidative damage, fledging success and plumage reflectance. Vitamins enhanced antioxidant capacity, but did not affect oxidative damage. Vitamin-treated nestlings had higher growth rates and higher probability of fledging. In contrast, carotenoids did not affect any of these traits. Furthermore, carotenoid-based colouration increased over the breeding season in nestlings that received vitamins only. This study shows that vitamins are limiting for growth rate and fledging success, and suggests that vitamins could regulate the trade-off between growth and self-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance in favour of the former. Moreover, our results are consistent with the idea that carotenoids are minor antioxidants in birds, but they do not support the protection hypothesis.</p>

Intracellular pH and its response to CO<sub>2</sub>-driven seawater acidification in symbiotic <i>versus</i> non-symbiotic coral cells
<p>Regulating intracellular pH (pH<sub>i</sub>) is critical for optimising the metabolic activity of corals, yet the mechanisms involved in pH regulation and the buffering capacity within coral cells are not well understood. Our study investigated how the presence of symbiotic dinoflagellates affects the response of pH<sub>i</sub> to <i>P</i><sub>CO2</sub>-driven seawater acidification in cells isolated from <i>Pocillopora damicornis</i>. Using the fluorescent dye BCECF-AM, in conjunction with confocal microscopy, we simultaneously characterised the pH<sub>i</sub> response in host coral cells and their dinoflagellate symbionts, in symbiotic and non-symbiotic states under saturating light, with and without the photosynthetic inhibitor DCMU. Each treatment was run under control (pH 7.8) and CO<sub>2</sub>-acidified seawater conditions (decreasing pH from 7.8 to 6.8). After 105 min of CO<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, by which time the external pH (pH<sub>e</sub>) had declined to 6.8, the dinoflagellate symbionts had increased their pH<sub>i</sub> by 0.5 pH units above control levels when in the absence of DCMU. In contrast, in both symbiotic and non-symbiotic host coral cells, 15 min of CO<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion (0.2 pH unit drop in pH<sub>e</sub>) led to cytoplasmic acidosis equivalent to 0.3–0.4 pH units irrespective of whether DCMU was present. Despite further seawater acidification over the duration of the experiment, the pH<sub>i</sub> of non-symbiotic coral cells did not change, though in host cells containing a symbiont cell the pH<sub>i</sub> recovered to control levels when photsynthesis was not inhibited. This recovery was negated when cells were incubated with DCMU. Our results reveal that photosynthetic activity of the endosymbiont is tightly coupled with the ability of the host cell to recover from cellular acidosis after exposure to high CO<sub>2</sub>/low pH.</p>

Intertidal sea stars (<i>Pisaster ochraceus</i>) alter body shape in response to wave action
<p>Sea stars are some of the largest mobile animals able to live in the harsh flow environment of wave-exposed, rocky intertidal shores. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, some species, such as the northeastern Pacific <i>Pisaster ochraceus</i>, are ecologically significant predators in a broad range of environments, from sheltered lagoons to the most wave-exposed shorelines. How they function and survive under such an extreme range of wave exposures remains a puzzle. Here we examine the ability of <i>P. ochraceus</i> to alter body form in response to variation in flow conditions. We found that sea stars in wave-exposed sites had narrower arms and were lighter per unit arm length than those from sheltered sites. Body form was tightly correlated with maximum velocity of breaking waves across four sites and also varied over time. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, field transplant experiments showed that these differences in shape were due primarily to phenotypic plasticity. Sea stars transplanted from a sheltered site to a more wave-exposed site became lighter per unit arm length, and developed narrower arms, after 3 months. The tight correlation between water flow and morphology suggests that wave force must be a significant selective factor acting on body shape. On exposed shores, narrower arms probably reduce both lift and drag in breaking waves. On protected shores, fatter arms may provide more thermal inertia to resist overheating, or more body volume for gametes. Such plastic changes in body shape represent a unique method by which sea stars adapt to spatial, seasonal and possibly short-term variation in flow conditions.</p>

Comparison of the elution properties of commercially available gentamicin and bone cement containing vancomycin with ‘home-made’ preparations
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Vancomycin is commonly added to acrylic bone cement during revision   arthroplasty surgery.

Each disc contained the same amount of antibiotic (0.5 g gentamycin,   2 g vancomycin) and was immersed in ammonium acetate buffer in a   sealed container. Fluid from each container was sampled at eight   time points over a two-week period.

Development
The p21-activated kinase Mbt is a component of the apical protein complex in central brain neuroblasts and controls cell proliferation
<p>The final size of the central nervous system is determined by precisely controlled generation, proliferation and death of neural stem cells. We show here that the <i>Drosophila</i> PAK protein Mushroom bodies tiny (Mbt) is expressed in central brain progenitor cells (neuroblasts) and becomes enriched to the apical cortex of neuroblasts in a cell cycle- and Cdc42-dependent manner. Using mushroom body neuroblasts as a model system, we demonstrate that in the absence of Mbt function, neuroblasts and their progeny are correctly specified and are able to generate different neuron subclasses as in the wild type, but are impaired in their proliferation activity throughout development. In general, loss of Mbt function does not interfere with establishment or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mainten</span></strong>ance of cell polarity, orientation of the mitotic spindle and organization of the actin or tubulin cytoskeleton in central brain neuroblasts. However, we show that <i>mbt</i> mutant neuroblasts are significantly reduced in cell size during different stages of development, which is most pronounced for mushroom body neuroblasts. This phenotype correlates with reduced mitotic activity throughout development. Additionally, postembryonic neuroblasts are lost prematurely owing to apoptosis. Yet, preventing apoptosis did not rescue the loss of neurons seen in the adult mushroom body of <i>mbt</i> mutants. From these results, we conclude that Mbt is part of a regulatory network that is required for neuroblast growth and thereby allows proper proliferation of neuroblasts throughout development.</p>

Contribution of Impaired Parasympathetic Activity to Right Ventricular Dysfunction and Pulmonary Vascular Remodeling in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The beneficial effects of parasympathetic stimulation have been reported in left heart failure, but whether it would be beneficial for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) remains to be explored. Here, we investigated the relationship between parasympathetic activity and right ventricular (RV) function in patients with PAH, and the potential therapeutic effects of pyridostigmine (PYR), an oral drug stimulating the parasympathetic activity through acetylcholinesterase inhibition, in experimental pulmonary hypertension (PH).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Heart rate recovery after a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test was used as a surrogate for parasympathetic activity. RV ejection fraction was assessed in 112 patients with PAH. Expression of nicotinic (α-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor) and muscarinic (muscarinic acetylcholine type 2 receptor) receptors, and acetylcholinesterase activity were evaluated in RV (n=11) and lungs (n=7) from patients with PAH undergoing heart/lung transplantation and compared with tissue obtained from controls. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, we investigated the effects of PYR (40 mg/kg per day) in experimental PH. PH was induced in male rats by SU5416 (25 mg/kg subcutaneously) injection followed by 4 weeks of hypoxia. In a subgroup, sympathetic/parasympathetic modulation was assessed by power spectral analysis. At week 6, PH status was confirmed by echocardiography, and rats were randomly assigned to vehicle or treatment (both n=12). At the end of the study, echocardiography was repeated, with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional RV pressure-volume measurements, along with lung, RV histological, and protein analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Patients with PAH with lower RV ejection fraction (<41%) had a significantly reduced heart rate recovery in comparison with patients with higher RV ejection fraction. In PAH RV samples, α-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor was increased and acetylcholinesterase activity was reduced versus controls. No difference in muscarinic acetylcholine type 2 receptor expression was observed. Chronic PYR treatment in PH rats normalized the cardiovascular autonomic function, demonstrated by an increase in parasympathetic activity and baroreflex sensitivity. PYR improved survival, increased RV contractility, and reduced RV stiffness, RV hypertrophy, RV fibrosis, RV inflammation, and RV α-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and muscarinic acetylcholine type 2 receptor expression, as well. Furthermore, PYR reduced pulmonary vascular resistance, RV afterload, and pulmonary vascular remodeling, which was associated with reduced local and systemic inflammation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>RV dysfunction is associated with reduced systemic parasympathetic activity in patients with PAH, with an inadequate adaptive response of the cholinergic system in the RV.

Overweight status was defined according to the Cole classification. Hypertension was defined according to the Fourth Report on High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents from the National High Blood Pressure Education Program.

Perioperative Myocardial Injury After Noncardiac Surgery
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Perioperative myocardial injury (PMI) seems to be a contributor to mortality after noncardiac surgery.

All patients received a systematic screening using serial measurements of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T in clinical routine. PMI was defined as an absolute high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T increase of ≥14 ng/L from preoperative to postoperative measurements. Furthermore, mortality was compared among patients with PMI not fulfilling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional criteria (ischemic symptoms, new ECG changes, or imaging evidence of loss of viable myocardium) required for the diagnosis of spontaneous acute myocardial infarction versus those that did.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>From 2014 to 2015 we included 2018 consecutive patients undergoing 2546 surgeries. Patients had a median age of 74 years and 42% were women. PMI occurred after 397 of 2546 surgeries (16%; 95% confidence interval, 14%–17%) and was accompanied by typical chest pain in 24 of 397 patients (6%) and any ischemic symptoms in 72 of 397 (18%). Crude 30-day mortality was 8.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.7–12.0) in patients with PMI versus 1.5% (95% CI, 0.9–2.0) in patients without PMI (<i>P</i><0.001). Multivariable regression analysis showed an adjusted hazard ratio of 2.7 (95% CI, 1.5–4.8) for 30-day mortality.

Human Plasma Thioredoxin-80 Increases With Age and in ApoE<sup>−/−</sup> Mice Induces Inflammation, Angiogenesis, and Atherosclerosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Thioredoxin (TRX)-1, a ubiquitous 12-kDa protein, exerts antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. In contrast, the truncated form, called TRX80, produced by macrophages induces upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines. TRX80 also promotes the differentiation of mouse peritoneal and human macrophages toward a proinflammatory M1 phenotype.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>TRX1 and TRX80 plasma levels were determined with a specific ELISA. A disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein (ADAM)-10, ADAM-17, and ADAM-10 activities were measured with SensoLyte 520 ADAM10 Activity Assay Kit, Fluorimetric, and InnoZyme TACE Activity Kit, respectively. Western immunoblots were performed with specific antibodies to ADAM-10 or ADAM-17. Angiogenesis study was evaluated in vitro with human microvascular endothelial cells-1 and in vivo with the Matrigel plug angiogenesis assay in mice. The expression of macrophage phenotype markers was investigated with real-time polymerase chain reaction. Phosphorylation of Akt, mechanistic target of rapamycin, and 70S6K was determined with specific antibodies. The effect of TRX80 on NLRP3 inflammasome activity was evaluated by measuring the level of interleukin-1β and -18 in the supernatants of activated macrophages with ELISA. Hearts were used for lesion surface evaluation and immunohistochemical studies, and whole descending aorta were stained with Oil Red O. For transgenic mice generation, the human scavenger receptor (SR-A) promoter/enhancer was used to drive macrophage-specific expression of human TRX80 in mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In this study, we observed a significant increase of plasma levels of TRX80 in old subjects compared with healthy young subjects. In parallel, an increase in expression and activity of ADAM-10 and ADAM-17 in old peripheral blood mononuclear cells compared with those of young subjects was observed. Furthermore, TRX80 was found to colocalize with tumor necrosis factor-α, a macrophage M1 marker, in human atherosclerotic plaque. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, TRX80 induced the expression of murine M1 macrophage markers through Akt2/mechanistic target of rapamycin–C1/70S6K pathway and activated the inflammasome NLRP3, leading to the release of interleukin-1β and -18, potent atherogenic cytokines. Moreover, TRX80 exerts a powerful angiogenic effect in both in vitro and in vivo mouse studies. Finally, transgenic mice that overexpress human TRX80 specifically in macrophages of apoE<sup>−/−</sup> mice have a significant increase of aortic atherosclerotic lesions.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>TRX80 showed an age-dependent increase in human plasma. In mouse models, TRX80 was associated with a proinflammatory status and increased atherosclerosis.</p></sec>

Associations Between Adding a Radial Artery Graft to Single and Bilateral Internal Thoracic Artery Grafts and Outcomes
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Whether the use of the radial artery (RA) can improve clinical outcomes in coronary artery bypass graft surgery remains unclear. The ART (Arterial Revascularization Trial) was designed to compare survival after bilateral internal thoracic artery (BITA) over single left internal thoracic artery (SITA). In the ART, a large proportion of patients (≈20%) also received an RA graft instead of a saphenous vein graft (SVG). We aimed to investigate the associations between using the RA instead of an SVG to supplement SITA or BITA grafts and outcomes by performing a post hoc analysis of the ART.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients enrolled in the ART (n=3102) were classified on the basis of conduits actually received (as treated). The analysis included 2737 patients who received an RA graft (RA group; n=632) or SVG only (SVG group; n=2105) in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion to SITA or BITA grafts. The primary end point was the composite of myocardial infarction, cardiovascular death, and repeat revascularization at 5 years. Propensity score matching and stratified Cox regression were used to compare the 2 strategies.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Myocardial infarction, cardiovascular death, and repeat revascularization cumulative incidence was 2.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1–3.4), 3.5% (95% CI, 2.1–5.0), and 4.4% (95% CI, 2.8–6.0) in the RA group and 3.4% (95% CI, 2.0–4.8), 4.0% (95% CI, 2.5–5.6), and 7.6% (95% CI, 5.5–9.7) in the SVG group, respectively. The composite end point was significantly lower in the RA group (8.8%; 95% CI, 6.5–11.0) compared with the SVG group (13.6%; 95% CI, 10.8–16.3; <i>P</i>=0.005). This association was present when an RA graft was used to supplement both SITA and BITA grafts (interaction <i>P</i>=0.62).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This post hoc ART analysis showed that an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional RA was associated with lower risk for midterm major adverse cardiac events when used to supplement SITA or BITA grafts.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.situ.ox.ac.uk/surgical-trials/art</ext-link>.

Prevention of Stroke with the Addition of Ezetimibe to Statin Therapy in Patients With Acute Coronary Syndrome in IMPROVE-IT (Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients who experience an acute coronary syndrome are at heightened risk of recurrent ischemic events, including stroke. Ezetimibe improved cardiovascular outcomes when added to statin therapy in patients stabilized after acute coronary syndrome. We investigated the efficacy of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion of ezetimibe to simvastatin for the prevention of stroke and other adverse cardiovascular events in IMPROVE-IT (Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial), with a focus on patients with a stroke before randomization.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients who experienced acute coronary syndrome were randomized to a placebo/simvastatin or ezetimibe/simvastatin regimen and followed for a median of 6 years. Treatment efficacy was assessed for the entire population and by subgroups for the first and total (first and subsequent) events for the end points of stroke of any etiology, stroke subtypes, and the primary trial end point at 7 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 18 144 patients, 641 (3.5%) experienced at least 1 stroke; most were ischemic (527, 82%). Independent predictors of stroke included prior stroke, older age, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, myocardial infarction, and renal dysfunction. There was a nonsignificant reduction in the first event of stroke of any etiology (4.2% versus 4.8%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73–1.00; <i>P</i>=0.052) with ezetimibe/simvastatin versus placebo/simvastatin, driven by a significant 21% reduction in ischemic stroke (3.4% versus 4.1%; HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.67–0.94; <i>P</i>=0.008) and a nonsignificant increase in hemorrhagic stroke (0.8% versus 0.6%; HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.93–2.04; <i>P</i>=0.11). Evaluating total events, including the first and all recurrent strokes, ezetimibe/simvastatin reduced stroke of any etiology (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.70–0.98; <i>P</i>=0.029) and ischemic stroke (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.63–0.91; <i>P</i>=0.003). Patients who had experienced a stroke prior to randomization were at a higher risk of recurrence and demonstrated an absolute risk reduction of 8.6% for stroke of any etiology (10.2% versus 18.8%; number needed to treat=12; HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.38–0.95; <i>P</i>=0.030) and 7.6% for ischemic stroke (8.7% versus 16.3%; number needed to treat=13; HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.31–0.86; <i>P</i>=0.011) with ezetimibe added to simvastatin therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion of ezetimibe to simvastatin in patients stabilized after acute coronary syndrome reduces the frequency of ischemic stroke, with a particularly large effect seen in patients with a prior stroke.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

The Fluid Mechanics of Transcatheter Heart Valve Leaflet Thrombosis in the Neosinus
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Transcatheter heart valve (THV) thrombosis has been increasingly reported. In these studies, thrombus quantification has been based on a 2-dimensional assessment of a 3-dimensional phenomenon.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Postprocedural, 4-dimensional, volume-rendered CT data of patients with CoreValve, Evolut R, and SAPIEN 3 transcatheter aortic valve replacement enrolled in the RESOLVE study (Assessment of Transcatheter and Surgical Aortic Bioprosthetic Valve Dysfunction With Multimodality Imaging and Its Treatment with Anticoagulation) were included in this analysis. Patients on anticoagulation were excluded. SAPIEN 3 and CoreValve/Evolut R patients with and without hypoattenuated leaflet thickening were included to study differences between groups. Patients were classified as having THV thrombosis if there was any evidence of hypoattenuated leaflet thickening. Anatomic and THV deployment geometries were analyzed, and thrombus volumes were computed through manual 3-dimensional reconstruction. We aimed to identify and evaluate risk factors that contribute to THV thrombosis through the combination of retrospective clinical data analysis and in vitro imaging in the space between the native and THV leaflets (neosinus).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>SAPIEN 3 valves with leaflet thrombosis were on average 10% further expanded (by diameter) than those without (95.5±5.2% versus 85.4±3.9%; <i>P</i><0.001). However, this relationship was not evident with the CoreValve/Evolut R. In CoreValve/Evolut Rs with thrombosis, the thrombus volume increased linearly with implant depth (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>=0.7, <i>P</i><0.001). This finding was not seen in the SAPIEN 3. The in vitro analysis showed that a supraannular THV deployment resulted in a nearly 7-fold decrease in stagnation zone size (velocities <0.1 m/s) when compared with an intraannular deployment. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, the in vitro model indicated that the size of the stagnation zone increased as cardiac output decreased.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Although transcatheter aortic valve replacement thrombosis is a multifactorial process involving foreign materials, patient-specific blood chemistry, and complex flow patterns, our study indicates that deployed THV geometry may have implications on the occurrence of thrombosis. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, a supraannular neosinus may reduce thrombosis risk because of reduced flow stasis. Although <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional prospective studies are needed to further develop strategies for minimizing thrombus burden, these results may help identify patients at higher thrombosis risk and aid in the development of next-generation devices with reduced thrombosis risk.</p></sec>

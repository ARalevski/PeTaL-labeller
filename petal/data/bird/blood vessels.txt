Study Comparing Vein Integrity and Clinical Outcomes in Open Vein Harvesting and 2 Types of Endoscopic Vein Harvesting for Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Current consensus statements maintain that endoscopic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong> harvesting (EVH) should be standard care in coronary artery bypass graft surgery, but <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong> quality and clinical outcomes have been questioned. The VICO trial (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong> Integrity and Clinical Outcomes) was designed to assess the impact of different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong> harvesting methods on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong> damage and whether this contributes to clinical outcomes after coronary artery bypass grafting.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In this single-center, randomized clinical trial, patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with an internal mammary artery and with 1 to 4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong> grafts were recruited. All <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong>s were harvested by a single experienced practitioner. We randomly allocated 300 patients into closed tunnel CO<sub>2</sub> EVH (n=100), open tunnel CO<sub>2</sub> EVH (n=100), and traditional open <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong> harvesting (n=100) groups. The primary end point was endothelial integrity and muscular damage of the harvested <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong>. Secondary end points included clinical outcomes (major adverse cardiac events), use of healthcare resources, and impact on health status (quality-adjusted life-years).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The open <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong> harvesting group demonstrated marginally better endothelial integrity in random samples (85% versus 88% versus 93% for closed tunnel EVH, open tunnel EVH, and open <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong> harvesting; <i>P</i><0.001). Closed tunnel EVH displayed the lowest longitudinal hypertrophy (1% versus 13.5% versus 3%; <i>P</i>=0.001). However, no differences in endothelial stretching were observed between groups (37% versus 37% versus 31%; <i>P</i>=0.62). Secondary clinical outcomes demonstrated no significant differences in composite major adverse cardiac event scores at each time point up to 48 months. The quality-adjusted life-year gain per patient was 0.11 (<i>P</i><0.001) for closed tunnel EVH and 0.07 (<i>P</i>=0.003) for open tunnel EVH compared with open <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong> harvesting. The likelihood of being cost-effective, at a predefined threshold of £20 000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, was 75% for closed tunnel EVH, 19% for open tunnel EVH, and 6% for open <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong> harvesting.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our study demonstrates that harvesting techniques affect the integrity of different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong> layers, albeit only slightly. Secondary outcomes suggest that histological findings do not directly contribute to major adverse cardiac event outcomes. Gains in health status were observed, and cost-effectiveness was better with closed tunnel EVH. High-level experience with endoscopic harvesting performed by a dedicated specialist practitioner gives optimal results comparable to those of open <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong> harvesting.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.isrctn.com</ext-link>.

Disturbed Flow Promotes Arterial Stiffening Through Thrombospondin-1
<sec><title>Background:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>al stiffness and wall shear stress are powerful determinants of cardiovascular health, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>al stiffness is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. Low and oscillatory wall shear stress, termed disturbed flow (d-flow), promotes atherosclerotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>al remodeling, but the relationship between d-flow and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>al stiffness is not well understood. The objective of this study was to define the role of d-flow on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>al stiffening and discover the relevant signaling pathways by which d-flow stiffens <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>es.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>D-flow was induced in the carotid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>es of young and old mice of both sexes. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>al stiffness was quantified ex vivo with cylindrical biaxial mechanical testing and in vivo from duplex ultrasound and compared with unmanipulated carotid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>es from 80-week-old mice. Gene expression and pathway analysis was performed on endothelial cell–enriched RNA and validated by immunohistochemistry. In vitro testing of signaling pathways was performed under oscillatory and laminar wall shear stress conditions. Human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>es from regions of d-flow and stable flow were tested ex vivo to validate critical results from the animal model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>D-flow induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>al stiffening through collagen deposition after partial carotid ligation, and the degree of stiffening was similar to that of unmanipulated carotid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>es from 80-week-old mice. Intimal gene pathway analyses identified transforming growth factor-β pathways as having a prominent role in this stiffened <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>al response, but this was attributable to thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) stimulation of profibrotic genes and not changes to transforming growth factor-β. In vitro and in vivo testing under d-flow conditions identified a possible role for TSP-1 activation of transforming growth factor-β in the upregulation of these genes. TSP-1 knockout animals had significantly less <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>al stiffening in response to d-flow than wild-type carotid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>es. Human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>es exposed to d-flow had similar increases TSP-1 and collagen gene expression as seen in our model.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>TSP-1 has a critical role in shear-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>al stiffening that is mediated in part through TSP-1’s activation of the profibrotic signaling pathways of transforming growth factor-β. Molecular targets in this pathway may lead to novel therapies to limit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>al stiffening and the progression of disease in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>es exposed to d-flow.</p></sec>

Second Arterial Versus Venous Conduits for Multivessel Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery in California
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Whether a second <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>al conduit improves outcomes after multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong> coronary artery bypass grafting remains unclear. Consequently, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>al conduits other than the left internal thoracic artery are seldom used in the United States.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using a state-maintained clinical registry including all 126 nonfederal hospitals in California, we compared all-cause mortality and rates of stroke, myocardial infarction, repeat revascularization, and sternal wound infection between propensity score–matched cohorts who underwent primary, isolated multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong> coronary artery bypass grafting with the left internal thoracic artery, and who received a second <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>al conduit (right internal thoracic artery or radial artery, n=5866) or a venous conduit (n=53 566) between 2006 and 2011.

These findings suggest surgeons should consider lowering their threshold for using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>al grafts, and the radial artery may be the preferred second conduit.</p></sec>

Tree Physiology
Partitioning of vessel resistivity in three liana species
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong>s with simple perforation plates, found in the majority of angiosperms, are considered the evolutionarily most advanced conduits, least impeding the xylem sap flow. Nevertheless, when measured, their hydraulic resistivity (<i>R</i>, i.e., inverse value of hydraulic conductivity) is significantly higher than resistivity predicted using Hagen–Poiseuille equation (<i>R</i><sub>HP</sub>). In our study we aimed (i) to quantify two basic components of the total <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong> resistivity – <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong> lumen resistivity and end wall resistivity, and (ii) to analyze how the variable inner diameter of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong> along its longitudinal axis affects resistivity. We measured flow rates through progressively shortened stems of hop (<i>Humulus lupulus</i> L.), grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i> L.), and clematis (<i>Clematis vitalba</i> L.) and used elastomer injection for identification of open <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong>s and for measurement of changing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong> inner diameters along its axis. The relative contribution of end wall resistivity to total <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong> resistivity was 0.46 for hop, 0.55 for grapevine, and 0.30 for clematis. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong> lumen resistivity calculated from our measurements was substantially higher than theoretical resistivity – about 43% for hop, 58% for grapevine, and 52% for clematis. We identified variation in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong> inner diameter as an important source of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong> resistivity. The coefficient of variation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong> inner diameter was a good predictor for the increase of the ratio of integral <i>R</i><sub>HP</sub> to <i>R</i><sub>HP</sub> calculated from the mean value of inner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong> diameter. We discuss the fact that we dealt with the longest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong>s in a given stem sample, which may lead to the overestimation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong> lumen resistivity, which consequently precludes decision whether the variable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong> inner diameter explains fully the difference between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong> lumen resistivity and <i>R</i><sub>HP</sub> we observed.</p>

Nitrite and <i>S</i>-Nitrosohemoglobin Exchange Across the Human Cerebral and Femoral Circulation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The mechanisms underlying red <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> cell (RBC)–mediated hypoxic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vasodil</span></strong>ation remain controversial, with separate roles for nitrite ([Formula]) and <i>S</i>-nitrosohemoglobin (SNO-Hb) widely contested given their ability to transduce nitric oxide bioactivity within the microcirculation.

Low Vulnerability to Xylem Embolism in Leaves and Stems of North American Oaks
<p>Although recent findings suggest that xylem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embol</span></strong>ism represents a significant, drought-induced damaging process in land plants, substantial debate surrounds the capacity of long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong>ed, ring-porous species to resist <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embol</span></strong>ism. We investigated whether recent methodological developments could help resolve this controversy within <i>Quercus</i>, a long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong>ed, ring-porous temperate angiosperm genus, and shed further light on the importance of xylem vulnerability to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embol</span></strong>ism as an indicator of drought tolerance. We used the optical technique to quantify leaf and stem xylem vulnerability to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embol</span></strong>ism of eight <i>Quercus</i> species from the Mediterranean-type climate region of California to examine absolute measures of resistance to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embol</span></strong>ism as well as any potential hydraulic segmentation between tissue types. We demonstrated that our optical assessment reflected flow impairment for a subset of our sample species by quantifying changes in leaf hydraulic conductance in dehydrating branches. Air-entry water potential varied 2-fold in leaves, ranging from −1.7 ± 0.25 MPa to −3.74 ± 0.23 MPa, and 4-fold in stems, ranging from −1.17 ± 0.04 MPa to −4.91 ± 0.3 MPa. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embol</span></strong>ism occurred earlier in leaves than in stems in only one out of eight sample species, and plants always lost turgor before experiencing stem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embol</span></strong>ism. Our results show that long-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong>ed North American <i>Quercus</i> species are more resistant to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embol</span></strong>ism than previously thought and support the hypothesis that avoiding stem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embol</span></strong>ism is a critical component of drought tolerance in woody trees. Accurately quantifying xylem vulnerability to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embol</span></strong>ism is essential for understanding species distributions along aridity gradients and predicting plant mortality during drought.</p>

Potent Thrombolytic Effect of <i>N</i>-Acetylcysteine on Arterial Thrombi
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Platelet cross-linking during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>al thrombosis involves von Willebrand Factor (VWF) multimers. Therefore, proteolysis of VWF appears promising to disaggregate platelet-rich thrombi and restore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong> patency in acute thrombotic disorders such as ischemic stroke, acute coronary syndrome, or acute limb ischemia. <i>N</i>-Acetylcysteine (NAC, a clinically approved mucolytic drug) can reduce intrachain disulfide bonds in large polymeric proteins. In the present study, we postulated that NAC might cleave the VWF multimers inside occlusive thrombi, thereby leading to their dissolution and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>al recanalization.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Experimental models of thrombotic stroke induced by either intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>al thrombin injection or ferric chloride application followed by measurement of cerebral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> flow using a combination of laser Doppler flowmetry and MRI were performed to uncover the effects of NAC on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>al thrombi. To investigate the effect of NAC on larger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong>s, we also performed ferric chloride–induced carotid artery thrombosis. In vitro experiments were performed to study the molecular bases of NAC thrombolytic effect, including platelet aggregometry, platelet-rich thrombi lysis assays, thromboelastography (ROTEM), and high-shear VWF string formation using microfluidic devices. We also investigated the putative prohemorrhagic effect of NAC in a mouse model of intracranial hemorrhage induced by in situ collagenase type VII injection.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We demonstrated that intravenous NAC administration promotes lysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>al thrombi that are resistant to conventional approaches such as recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator, direct thrombin inhibitors, and antiplatelet treatments. Through in vitro and in vivo experiments, we provide evidence that the molecular target underlying the thrombolytic effects of NAC is principally the VWF that cross-link platelets in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>al thrombi. Coadministration of NAC and a nonpeptidic GpIIb/IIIa inhibitor further improved its thrombolytic efficacy, essentially by accelerating thrombus dissolution and preventing rethrombosis. Thus, in a new large-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong> thrombo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embol</span></strong>ic stroke model in mice, this cotreatment significantly improved ischemic lesion size and neurological outcome. It is important to note that NAC did not worsen hemorrhagic stroke outcome, suggesting that it exerts thrombolytic effects without significantly impairing normal hemostasis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We provide evidence that NAC is an effective and safe alternative to currently available antithrombotic agents to restore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong> patency after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>al occlusion.</p></sec>

A PLCγ1-Dependent, Force-Sensitive Signaling Network in the Myogenic Constriction of Cerebral Arteries
<sec><title>Maintaining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> Flow to the Brain</title><p>Cerebral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>es continually adjust to changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure to ensure constant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> flow to the brain. In response to increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure, the smooth muscle cells in cerebral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>es contract, resulting in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong> constriction.

Severe Pulmonary Vein Stenosis Resulting From Ablation for Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The frequency of pulmonary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong> stenosis (PVS) after ablation for atrial fibrillation has decreased, but it remains a highly morbid condition. Although treatment strategies including pulmonary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong> dilation and stenting have been described, the long-term impacts of these interventions are unknown. We evaluated the presentation of severe PVS, and examined the risk for restenosis after intervention using either balloon angioplasty (BA) alone or BA with stenting.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This was a prospective, observational study of 124 patients with severe PVS evaluated between 2000 and 2014.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>All 124 patients were identified as having severe PVS by computed tomography in 219 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong>s. One hundred two patients (82%) were symptomatic at diagnosis. The most common symptoms were dyspnea (67%), cough (45%), fatigue (45%), and decreased exercise tolerance (45%). Twenty-seven percent of patients experienced hemoptysis. Ninety-two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong>s were treated with BA, 86 were treated with stenting, and 41 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong>s were not treated. A 94% acute procedural success rate was observed and did not differ by initial management. Major procedural complications occurred in 4 of the 113 patients (3.5%) who underwent invasive assessment, and minor complications occurred in 15 patients (13.3%). Overall, 42% of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong>s developed restenosis including 27% of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong>s (n=23) treated with stenting and 57% of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong>s (n=52) treated with BA. The 3-year overall rate of restenosis was 37%, with 49% of BA-treated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong>s and 25% of stented <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong>s developing restenosis (hazard ratio, 2.77; 95% confidence interval, 1.72–4.45; <i>P</i><0.001). After adjustment for age, CHA2DS2-VASc score, hypertension, and the time period of the study, there was still a significant difference in the risk of restenosis for BA versus stenting (hazard ratio, 2.46; 95% confidence interval, 1.47–4.12; <i>P</i><0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The diagnosis of PVS is challenging because of nonspecific symptoms and the need for dedicated pulmonary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong> imaging. There is no difference in acute success by type of initial intervention; however, stenting significantly reduces the risk of subsequent pulmonary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong> restenosis in comparison with BA.</p></sec>

Ser<sup>1928</sup> phosphorylation by PKA stimulates the L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 and vasoconstriction during acute hyperglycemia and diabetes
<p>Hypercontractility of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>al myocytes and enhanced vascular tone during diabetes are, in part, attributed to the effects of increased glucose (hyperglycemia) on L-type Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels. In murine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>al myocytes, kinase-dependent mechanisms mediate the increase in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 activity in response to increased extracellular glucose. We identified a subpopulation of the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel pore-forming subunit (α1<sub>C</sub>) within nanometer proximity of protein kinase A (PKA) at the sarcolemma of murine and human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>al myocytes. This arrangement depended upon scaffolding of PKA by an A-kinase anchoring protein 150 (AKAP150) in mice. Glucose-mediated increases in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel activity were associated with PKA activity, leading to α1<sub>C</sub> phosphorylation at Ser<sup>1928</sup>. Compared to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>es from low-fat diet (LFD)–fed mice and nondiabetic patients, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>es from high-fat diet (HFD)–fed mice and from diabetic patients had increased Ser<sup>1928</sup> phosphorylation and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 activity. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>al myocytes and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>es from mice lacking AKAP150 or expressing mutant AKAP150 unable to bind PKA did not exhibit increased Ser<sup>1928</sup> phosphorylation and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 current density in response to increased glucose or to HFD. Consistent with a functional role for Ser<sup>1928</sup> phosphorylation, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>al myocytes and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>es from knockin mice expressing a Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 with Ser<sup>1928</sup> mutated to alanine (S1928A) lacked glucose-mediated increases in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 activity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vasoconstrict</span></strong>ion. Furthermore, the HFD-induced increases in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 current density and myogenic tone were prevented in S1928A knockin mice. These findings reveal an essential role for α1<sub>C</sub> phosphorylation at Ser<sup>1928</sup> in stimulating Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel activity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vasoconstrict</span></strong>ion by AKAP-targeted PKA upon exposure to increased glucose and in diabetes.</p>

RSK2 contributes to myogenic vasoconstriction of resistance arteries by activating smooth muscle myosin and the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger
<p>Smooth muscle contraction is triggered when Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) phosphorylates the regulatory light chain of myosin (RLC<sub>20</sub>). However, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong>s from <i>Mlck</i>-deficient mouse embryos retain the ability to contract, suggesting the existence of additional regulatory mechanisms. We showed that the p90 ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (RSK2) also phosphorylated RLC<sub>20</sub> to promote smooth muscle contractility. Active, phosphorylated RSK2 was present in mouse resistance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>es under normal basal tone, and phosphorylation of RSK2 increased with myogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vasoconstrict</span></strong>ion or agonist stimulation. Resistance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>es from <i>Rsk2</i>-deficient mice were dilated and showed reduced myogenic tone and RLC<sub>20</sub> phosphorylation. RSK2 phosphorylated Ser<sup>19</sup> in RLC in vitro. In addition, RSK2 phosphorylated an activating site in the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger (NHE-1), resulting in cytosolic alkalinization and an increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> that promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vasoconstrict</span></strong>ion. NHE-1 activity increased upon myogenic constriction, and the increase in intracellular pH was suppressed in <i>Rsk2</i>-deficient mice. In pressured <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>es, RSK2-dependent activation of NHE-1 was associated with increased intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, which would be expected to increase MLCK activity, thereby contributing to basal tone and myogenic responses. Accordingly, <i>Rsk2</i>-deficient mice had lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure than normal littermates. Thus, RSK2 mediates a procontractile signaling pathway that contributes to the regulation of basal vascular tone, myogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vasoconstrict</span></strong>ion, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure and may be a potential therapeutic target in smooth muscle contractility disorders.</p>

Bmal1 in Perivascular Adipose Tissue Regulates Resting-Phase Blood Pressure Through Transcriptional Regulation of Angiotensinogen
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) surrounding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong>s constitutes a distinct functional integral layer of the vasculature required to preserve vascular tone under physiological conditions. However, there is little information on the relationship between PVAT and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure regulation, including its potential contributions to circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure variation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using unique brown adipocyte–specific aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like protein 1 (Bmal1) and angiotensinogen knockout mice, we determined the vasoactivity of homogenized PVAT in aortic rings and how brown adipocyte peripheral expression of Bmal1 and angiotensinogen in PVAT regulates the amplitude of diurnal change in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure in mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We uncovered a peripheral clock in PVAT and demonstrated that loss of Bmal1 in PVAT reduces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure in mice during the resting phase, leading to a superdipper phenotype. PVAT extracts from wild-type mice significantly induced contractility of isolated aortic rings in vitro in an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">endothelium</span></strong>-independent manner. This property was impaired in PVAT from brown adipocyte–selective Bmal1-deficient (BA-Bmal1-KO) mice. The PVAT contractile properties were mediated by local angiotensin II, operating through angiotensin II type 1 receptor–dependent signaling in the isolated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong>s and linked to PVAT circadian regulation of angiotensinogen. Indeed, angiotensinogen mRNA and angiotensin II levels in PVAT of BA-Bmal1-KO mice were significantly reduced. Systemic infusion of angiotensin II, in turn, reduced Bmal1 expression in PVAT while eliminating the hypotensive phenotype during the resting phase in BA-Bmal1-KO mice. Angiotensinogen, highly expressed in PVAT, shows circadian expression in PVAT, and selective deletion of angiotensinogen in brown adipocytes recapitulates the phenotype of selective deletion of Bmal1 in brown adipocytes. Furthermore, angiotensinogen is a transcriptional target of Bmal1 in PVAT.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These data indicate that local Bmal1 in PVAT regulates angiotensinogen expression and the ensuing increase in angiotensin II, which acts on smooth muscle cells in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong> walls to regulate vasoactivity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure in a circadian fashion during the resting phase. These findings will contribute to a better understanding of the cardiovascular complications of circadian disorders, alterations in the circadian dipping phenotype, and cross-talk between systemic and peripheral regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure.</p></sec>

Hypoxic cancer–associated fibroblasts increase NCBP2-AS2/HIAR to promote endothelial sprouting through enhanced VEGF signaling
<p>Intratumoral hypoxia causes the formation of dysfunctional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong>s, which contribute to tumor metastasis and reduce the efficacy of therapeutic treatments. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong>s are embedded in the tumor stroma of which cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) constitute a prominent cellular component. We found that hypoxic human mammary CAFs promoted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s in CAF-endothelial cell cocultures in vitro. Mass spectrometry–based proteomic analysis of the CAF secretome unraveled that hypoxic CAFs contributed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong> abnormalities by altering their secretion of various pro- and anti-angiogenic factors. Hypoxia induced pronounced remodeling of the CAF proteome, including proteins that have not been previously related to this process. Among those, the uncharacterized protein NCBP2-AS2 that we renamed HIAR (hypoxia-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s regulator) was the protein most increased in abundance in hypoxic CAFs. Silencing of HIAR abrogated the pro-angiogenic and pro-migratory function of hypoxic CAFs by decreasing secretion of the pro-angiogenic factor VEGFA and consequently reducing VEGF/VEGFR downstream signaling in the endothelial cells. Our study has identified a regulator of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s and provides a map of hypoxia-induced molecular alterations in mammary CAFs.</p>

Genome-wide functional analysis reveals central signaling regulators of lymphatic endothelial cell migration and remodeling
<p>Lymphatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong>s constitute a specialized vasculature that is involved in development, cancer, obesity, and immune regulation. The migration of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) is critical for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong> growth (lymph<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong> remodeling, processes that modify the lymphatic network in response to developmental or pathological demands. Using the publicly accessible results of our genome-wide siRNA screen, we characterized the migratome of primary human LECs and identified individual genes and signaling pathways that regulate LEC migration. We compared our data set with mRNA differential expression data from endothelial and stromal cells derived from two in vivo models of lymphatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong> remodeling, viral infection and contact hypersensitivity–induced inflammation, which identified genes selectively involved in regulating LEC migration and remodeling. We also characterized the top candidates in the LEC migratome in primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> vascular endothelial cells to identify genes with functions common to lymphatic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> vascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">endothelium</span></strong>.

<p>Membrane depolarization of smooth muscle cells (myocytes) in the small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>es that regulate regional organ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> flow leads to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vasoconstrict</span></strong>ion. Membrane depolarization also activates large-conductance calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>)–activated potassium (BK) channels, which limits Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activity that promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vasoconstrict</span></strong>ion, thus leading to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vasodil</span></strong>ation. We showed that in human and rat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>al myocytes, membrane depolarization rapidly increased the cell surface abundance of auxiliary BK β1 subunits but not that of the pore-forming BKα channels. Membrane depolarization stimulated voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, leading to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and the activation of Rho kinase (ROCK) 1 and 2. ROCK1/2-mediated activation of Rab11A promoted the delivery of β1 subunits to the plasma membrane by Rab11A-positive recycling endosomes. These additional β1 subunits associated with BKα channels already at the plasma membrane, leading to an increase in apparent Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity and activation of the channels in pressurized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>al myocytes and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vasodil</span></strong>ation. Thus, membrane depolarization activates BK channels through stimulation of ROCK- and Rab11A-dependent trafficking of β1 subunits to the surface of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>al myocytes.</p>

SHORTROOT-Mediated Increase in Stomatal Density Has No Impact on Photosynthetic Efficiency
<p>The coordinated positioning of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong>s, mesophyll cells, and stomata across a leaf is crucial for efficient gas exchange and transpiration and, therefore, for overall function. In monocot leaves, stomatal cell files are positioned at the flanks of underlying longitudinal leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong>s, rather than directly above or below. This pattern suggests either that stomatal formation is inhibited in epidermal cells directly in contact with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong> or that specification is induced in cell files beyond the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong>. The SHORTROOT pathway specifies distinct cell types around the vasculature in subepidermal layers of both root and shoots, with cell type identity determined by distance from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong>. To test whether the pathway has the potential to similarly pattern epidermal cell types, we expanded the expression domain of the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> ssp <i>japonica</i>) <i>OsSHR2</i> gene, which we show is restricted to developing leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong>s, to include bundle sheath cells encircling the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong>. In transgenic lines, which were generated using the orthologous <i>ZmSHR1</i> gene to avoid potential silencing of <i>OsSHR2</i>, stomatal cell files were observed both in the normal position and in more distant positions from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong>. Contrary to theoretical predictions, and to phenotypes observed in eudicot leaves, the increase in stomatal density did not enhance photosynthetic capacity or increase mesophyll cell density. Collectively, these results suggest that the SHORTROOT pathway may coordinate the positioning of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong>s and stomata in monocot leaves and that distinct mechanisms may operate in monocot and eudicot leaves to coordinate stomatal patterning with the development of underlying mesophyll cells.</p>

Extracellular Matrix Proteomics Reveals Interplay of Aggrecan and Aggrecanases in Vascular Remodeling of Stented Coronary Arteries
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling contributes to in-stent restenosis and thrombosis. Despite its important clinical implications, little is known about ECM changes post–stent implantation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Bare-metal and drug-eluting stents were implanted in pig coronary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>es with an overstretch under optical coherence tomography guidance. Stented segments were harvested 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 days post-stenting for proteomics analysis of the media and neointima.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 151 ECM and ECM-associated proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. After stent implantation, proteins involved in regulating calcification were upregulated in the neointima of drug-eluting stents. The earliest changes in the media were proteins involved in inflammation and thrombosis, followed by changes in regulatory ECM proteins. By day 28, basement membrane proteins were reduced in drug-eluting stents in comparison with bare-metal stents. In contrast, the large aggregating proteoglycan aggrecan was increased. Aggrecanases of the ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) family contribute to the catabolism of vascular proteoglycans. An increase in ADAMTS-specific aggrecan fragments was accompanied by a notable shift from <i>ADAMTS1</i> and <i>ADAMTS5</i> to <i>ADAMTS4</i> gene expression after stent implantation. Immunostaining in human stented coronary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>es confirmed the presence of aggrecan and aggrecan fragments, in particular, at the contacts of the stent struts with the artery. Further investigation of aggrecan presence in the human vasculature revealed that aggrecan and aggrecan cleavage were more abundant in human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>es than in human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong>s. In addition, aggrecan synthesis was induced on grafting a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong> into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>al circulation, suggesting an important role for aggrecan in vascular plasticity. Finally, lack of ADAMTS-5 activity in mice resulted in an accumulation of aggrecan and a dilation of the thoracic aorta, confirming that aggrecanase activity regulates aggrecan abundance in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>al wall and contributes to vascular remodeling.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Significant differences were identified by proteomics in the ECM of coronary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>es after bare-metal and drug-eluting stent implantation, most notably an upregulation of aggrecan, a major ECM component of cartilaginous tissues that confers resistance to compression. The accumulation of aggrecan coincided with a shift in <i>ADAMTS</i> gene expression. This study provides the first evidence implicating aggrecan and aggrecanases in the vascular injury response after stenting.</p></sec>

Inhibition of Endothelial Notch Signaling Impairs Fatty Acid Transport and Leads to Metabolic and Vascular Remodeling of the Adult Heart
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Nutrients are transported through endothelial cells before being metabolized in muscle cells. However, little is known about the regulation of endothelial transport processes. Notch signaling is a critical regulator of metabolism and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s during development. Here, we studied how genetic and pharmacological manipulation of endothelial Notch signaling in adult mice affects endothelial fatty acid transport, cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s, and heart function.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Endothelial-specific Notch inhibition was achieved by conditional genetic inactivation of Rbp-jκ in adult mice to analyze fatty acid metabolism and heart function. Wild-type mice were treated with neutralizing antibodies against the Notch ligand Delta-like 4. Fatty acid transport was studied in cultured endothelial cells and transgenic mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Treatment of wild-type mice with Delta-like 4 neutralizing antibodies for 8 weeks impaired fractional shortening and ejection fraction in the majority of mice. Inhibition of Notch signaling specifically in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">endothelium</span></strong> of adult mice by genetic ablation of Rbp-jκ caused heart hypertrophy and failure. Impaired heart function was preceded by alterations in fatty acid metabolism and an increase in cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong> density. Endothelial Notch signaling controlled the expression of endothelial lipase, Angptl4, CD36, and Fabp4, which are all needed for fatty acid transport across the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong> wall. In endothelial-specific Rbp-jκ–mutant mice, lipase activity and transendothelial transport of long-chain fatty acids to muscle cells were impaired. In turn, lipids accumulated in the plasma and liver. The attenuated supply of cardiomyocytes with long-chain fatty acids was accompanied by higher glucose uptake, increased concentration of glycolysis intermediates, and mTOR-S6K signaling. Treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin or displacing glucose as cardiac substrate by feeding a ketogenic diet prolonged the survival of endothelial-specific Rbp-jκ–deficient mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This study identifies Notch signaling as a novel regulator of fatty acid transport across the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">endothelium</span></strong> and as an essential repressor of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s in the adult heart. The data imply that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">endothelium</span></strong> controls cardiomyocyte metabolism and function.</p></sec>

Day-to-Day Blood Pressure Variability and Risk of Dementia in a General Japanese Elderly Population
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Several observational studies have reported that higher visit-to-visit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure variability is a risk factor for cognitive impairment and dementia.

These associations remained unchanged after adjustment for potential confounding factors, including home SBP. Compared with subjects in the first quartile of CoV levels of home SBP, the risks of the development of all-cause dementia, VaD, and AD were significantly higher in those in the fourth quartile (hazard ratio=2.27, 95% confidence interval=1.45–3.55, <i>P</i><0.001 for all-cause dementia; hazard ratio=2.79, 95% confidence interval=1.04–7.51, <i>P</i>=0.03 for VaD; hazard ratio=2.22, 95% confidence interval=1.31–3.75, <i>P</i><0.001 for AD). Similar associations were observed for CoV levels of home diastolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> pressure.

Does Use of Bilateral Internal Mammary Artery Grafting Reduce Long-Term Risk of Repeat Coronary Revascularization?
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although previous studies have demonstrated that patients receiving bilateral internal mammary artery (BIMA) conduits during coronary artery bypass grafting have better long-term survival than those receiving a single internal mammary artery (SIMA), data on risk of repeat revascularization are more limited. In this analysis, we compare the timing, frequency, and type of repeat coronary revascularization among patients receiving BIMA and SIMA.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a multicenter, retrospective analysis of 47 984 consecutive coronary artery bypass grafting surgeries performed from 1992 to 2014 among 7 medical centers reporting to a prospectively maintained clinical registry. Among the study population, 1482 coronary artery bypass grafting surgeries with BIMA were identified, and 1297 patients receiving BIMA were propensity-matched to 1297 patients receiving SIMA. The primary end point was freedom from repeat coronary revascularization.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The median duration of follow-up was 13.2 (IQR, 7.4–17.7) years. Patients were well matched by age, body mass index, major comorbidities, and cardiac function. There was a higher freedom from repeat revascularization among patients receiving BIMA than among patients receiving SIMA (hazard ratio [HR], 0.78 [95% CI, 0.65–0.94]; <i>P</i>=0.009). Among the matched cohort, 19.4% (n=252) of patients receiving SIMA underwent repeat revascularization, whereas this frequency was 15.1% (n=196) among patients receiving BIMA (<i>P</i>=0.004). The majority of repeat revascularization procedures were percutaneous coronary interventions (94.2%), and this did not differ between groups (<i>P</i>=0.274).

A MicroRNA93–Interferon Regulatory Factor-9–Immunoresponsive Gene-1–Itaconic Acid Pathway Modulates M2-Like Macrophage Polarization to Revascularize Ischemic Muscle
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Currently, no therapies exist for treating and improving outcomes in patients with severe peripheral artery disease (PAD). MicroRNA93 (miR93) has been shown to favorably modulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s and to reduce tissue loss in genetic PAD models. However, the cell-specific function, downstream mechanisms, or signaling involved in miR93-mediated ischemic muscle neovascularization is not clear. Macrophages were best known to modulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>ogenic response in PAD, and the extent of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>ogenic response induced by macrophages is dependent on greater M2 to M1 activation/polarization state. In the present study, we identified a novel mechanism by which miR93 regulates macrophage polarization to promote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>ogenesis to revascularize ischemic muscle in experimental PAD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In vitro (macrophages, endothelial cells, skeletal muscle cells under normal and hypoxia serum starvation conditions) and in vivo experiments in preclinical PAD models (unilateral femoral artery ligation and resection) were conducted to examine the role of miR93-interferon regulatory factor-9–immunoresponsive gene-1 (IRG1)–itaconic acid pathway in macrophage polarization, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>ogenesis, and perfusion recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In vivo, compared with wild-type controls, miR106b-93-25 cluster–deficient mice (miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup>) showed decreased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>ogenesis correlating with increased M1-like macrophages after experimental PAD. Intramuscular delivery of miR93 in miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup> PAD mice increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>ogenesis, and the extent of perfusion, which correlated with more M2-like macrophages in the proximal and distal hind-limb muscles. In vitro, miR93 promotes and sustains M2-like polarization even under M1-like polarizing conditions (hypoxia serum starvation). Delivery of bone marrow–derived macrophages from miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup> to wild-type ischemic muscle decreased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>ogenesis, and perfusion, whereas transfer of wild-type macrophages to miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup> had the opposite effect. Systematic analysis of top differentially upregulated genes from RNA sequencing between miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup> and wild-type ischemic muscle showed that miR93 regulates IRG1 function to modulate itaconic acid production and macrophage polarization. The 3′ untranslated region luciferase assays performed to determine whether IRG1 is a direct target of miR93 revealed that IRG1 is not an miR93 target but that interferon regulatory factor-9, which can regulate IRG1 expression, is an miR93 target. In vitro, increased expression of interferon regulatory factor-9 and IRG1 and itaconic acid treatment significantly decreased endothelial angiogenic potential.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>miR93 inhibits interferon regulatory factor-9 to decrease IRG1–itaconic acid production to induce M2-like polarization in ischemic muscle to enhance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>ogenesis, and perfusion recovery in experimental PAD.</p></sec>

Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase Promotes Pulmonary Vascular Remodeling and Is a Therapeutic Target in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Pulmonary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>al hypertension is a severe and progressive disease, a hallmark of which is pulmonary vascular remodeling. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is a cytozyme that regulates intracellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide levels and cellular redox state, regulates histone deacetylases, promotes cell proliferation, and inhibits apoptosis.

NAMPT activity promoted human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell proliferation via a paracrine effect. In addition, recombinant NAMPT stimulated human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell proliferation via enhancement of store-operated calcium entry by enhancing expression of Orai2 and STIM2.

Gene expression profiles of brain endothelial cells during embryonic development at bulk and single-cell levels
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong>-brain barrier is a dynamic interface that separates the brain from the circulatory system, and it is formed by highly specialized endothelial cells. To explore the molecular mechanisms defining the unique nature of vascular development and differentiation in the brain, we generated high-resolution gene expression profiles of mouse embryonic brain endothelial cells using translating ribosome affinity purification and single-cell RNA sequencing. We compared the brain vascular translatome with the vascular translatomes of other organs and analyzed the vascular translatomes of the brain at different time points during embryonic development. Because canonical Wnt signaling is implicated in the formation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong>-brain barrier, we also compared the brain endothelial translatome of wild-type mice with that of mice lacking the transcriptional cofactor β-catenin (<i>Ctnnb1</i>). Our analysis revealed extensive molecular changes during the embryonic development of the brain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">endothelium</span></strong>. We identified genes encoding brain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">endothelium</span></strong>–specific transcription factors (<i>Foxf2</i>, <i>Foxl2</i>, <i>Foxq1</i>, <i>Lef1</i>, <i>Ppard</i>, <i>Zfp551</i>, and <i>Zic3</i>) that are associated with maturation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong>-brain barrier and act downstream of the Wnt–β-catenin signaling pathway. Profiling of individual brain endothelial cells revealed substantial heterogeneity in the population. Nevertheless, the high abundance of <i>Foxf2</i>, <i>Foxq1</i>, <i>Ppard</i>, or <i>Zic3</i> transcripts correlated with the increased expression of genes encoding markers of brain endothelial cell differentiation. Expression of <i>Foxf2</i> and <i>Zic3</i> in human umbilical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong> endothelial cells induced the production of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong>-brain barrier differentiation markers. This comprehensive data set may help to improve the engineering of in vitro <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong>-brain barrier models.</p>

Transcription Factors VND1-VND3 Contribute to Cotyledon Xylem Vessel Formation
<p>Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>VASCULAR-RELATED NAC-DOMAIN1</i> (<i>VND1</i>) to <i>VND7</i> encode a group of NAC domain transcription factors that function as master regulators of xylem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong> element differentiation. These transcription factors activate the transcription of genes required for secondary cell wall formation and programmed cell death, key events in xylem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong> element differentiation. Because constitutive overexpression of VND6 and VND7 induces ectopic xylem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong> element differentiation, functional studies of VND proteins have largely focused on these two proteins. Here, we report the roles of VND1, VND2, and VND3 in xylem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong> formation in cotyledons. Using our newly established in vitro system in which excised Arabidopsis cotyledons are stimulated to undergo xylem cell differentiation by cytokinin, auxin, and brassinosteroid treatment, we found that ectopic xylem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong> element differentiation required VND1, VND2, and VND3 but not VND6 or VND7. The importance of VND1, VND2, and VND3 also was indicated in vivo; in the <i>vnd1 vnd2 vnd3</i> seedlings, xylem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong> element differentiation of secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong>s in cotyledons was inhibited under dark conditions. Furthermore, the light responsiveness of <i>VND</i> gene expression was disturbed in the <i>vnd1 vnd2 vnd3</i> mutant, and <i>vnd1 vnd2 vnd3</i> failed to recover lateral root development in response to the change of light conditions. These findings suggest that VND1 to VND3 have specific molecular functions, possibly linking light conditions to xylem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong> formation, during seedling development.</p>

Stomatal Closure, Basal Leaf Embolism, and Shedding Protect the Hydraulic Integrity of Grape Stems
<p>The time scale of stomatal closure and xylem cavitation during plant dehydration, as well as the fate of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embol</span></strong>ized organs, are under debate, largely due to methodological limitations in the evaluation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embol</span></strong>ism. While some argue that complete stomatal closure precedes the occurrence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embol</span></strong>ism, others believe that the two are contemporaneous processes that are accompanied by daily xylem refilling. Here, we utilize an optical light transmission method to continuously monitor xylem cavitation in leaves of dehydrating grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) in concert with stomatal conductance and stem and petiole hydraulic measurements. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to continuously monitor xylem cavitation and flow rates in the stem of an intact vine during 10 d of dehydration. The results showed that complete stomatal closure preceded the appearance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embol</span></strong>ism in the leaves and the stem by several days. Basal leaves were more vulnerable to xylem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embol</span></strong>ism than apical leaves and, once <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embol</span></strong>ized, were shed, thereby preventing further water loss and protecting the hydraulic integrity of younger leaves and the stem. As a result, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embol</span></strong>ism in the stem was minimal even when drought led to complete leaf shedding. These findings suggest that grapevine avoids xylem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embol</span></strong>ism rather than tolerates it.</p>

Reversible Leaf Xylem Collapse: A Potential “Circuit Breaker” against Cavitation
<p>We report a novel form of xylem dysfunction in angiosperms: reversible collapse of the xylem conduits of the smallest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong> orders that demarcate and intrusively irrigate the areoles of red oak (<i>Quercus rubra</i>) leaves. Cryo-scanning electron microscopy revealed gradual increases in collapse from approximately −2 MPa down to −3 MPa, saturating thereafter (to −4 MPa). Over this range, cavitation remained negligible in these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong>s. Imaging of rehydration experiments showed spatially variable recovery from collapse within 20 s and complete recovery after 2 min. More broadly, the patterns of deformation induced by desiccation in both mesophyll and xylem suggest that cell wall collapse is unlikely to depend solely on individual wall properties, as mechanical constraints imposed by neighbors appear to be important. From the perspective of equilibrium leaf water potentials, petioles, whose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong>s extend into the major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong>s, showed a vulnerability to cavitation that overlapped in the water potential domain with both minor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong> collapse and buckling (turgor loss) of the living cells. However, models of transpiration transients showed that minor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong> collapse and mesophyll capacitance could effectively buffer major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong>s from cavitation over time scales relevant to the rectification of stomatal wrong-way responses.

Evidence for Hydraulic Vulnerability Segmentation and Lack of Xylem Refilling under Tension
<p>The vascular system of grapevine (<i>Vitis</i> spp.) has been reported as being highly vulnerable, even though grapevine regularly experiences seasonal drought. Consequently, stomata would remain open below water potentials that would generate a high loss of stem hydraulic conductivity via xylem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embol</span></strong>ism. This situation would necessitate daily cycles of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embol</span></strong>ism repair to restore hydraulic function. However, a more parsimonious explanation is that some hydraulic techniques are prone to artifacts in species with long <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong>s, leading to the overestimation of vulnerability. The aim of this study was to provide an unbiased assessment of (1) the vulnerability to drought-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embol</span></strong>ism in perennial and annual organs and (2) the ability to refill <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embol</span></strong>ized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong>s in two <i>Vitis</i> species X-ray micro-computed tomography observations of intact plants indicated that both <i>Vitis</i> <i>vinifera</i> and <i>Vitis</i> <i>riparia</i> were relatively vulnerable, with the pressure inducing 50% loss of stem hydraulic conductivity = −1.7 and −1.3 MPa, respectively. In <i>V. vinifera</i>, both the stem and petiole had similar sigmoidal vulnerability curves but differed in pressure inducing 50% loss of hydraulic conductivity (−1.7 and −1 MPa for stem and petiole, respectively). Refilling was not observed as long as bulk xylem pressure remained negative (e.g. at the apical part of the plants; −0.11 ± 0.02 MPa) and change in percentage loss of conductivity was 0.02% ± 0.01%. However, positive xylem pressure was observed at the basal part of the plant (0.04 ± 0.01 MPa), leading to a recovery of conductance (change in percentage loss of conductivity = −0.24% ± 0.12%). Our findings provide evidence that grapevine is unable to repair <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embol</span></strong>ized xylem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong>s under negative pressure, but its hydraulic vulnerability segmentation provides significant protection of the perennial stem.</p>

Inhibition of JAK-STAT Signaling Suppresses Pathogenic Immune Responses in Medium and Large Vessel Vasculitis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Giant cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>tis, a chronic autoimmune disease of the aorta and its large branches, is complicated by aneurysm formation, dissection, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>al occlusions. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>al wall dendritic cells attract CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and macrophages to form prototypic granulomatous infiltrates. Vasculitic lesions contain a diverse array of effector T cells that persist despite corticosteroid therapy and sustain chronic, smoldering vasculitis. Transmural inflammation induces microvascular neo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s and results in lumen-occlusive intimal hyperplasia. We have examined whether persistent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong> wall inflammation is maintained by lesional T cells, including the newly identified tissue-resident memory T cells, and whether such T cells are sensitive to the cytokine-signaling inhibitor tofacitinib, a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor targeting JAK3 and JAK1.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Vascular inflammation was induced in human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>es engrafted into immunodeficient mice that were reconstituted with T cells and monocytes from patients with giant cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>tis.

Loss of Endothelial CXCR7 Impairs Vascular Homeostasis and Cardiac Remodeling After Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Genome-wide association studies identified the association of the <i>CXCL12</i> genetic locus (which encodes the chemokine CXCL12, also known as stromal cell–derived factor 1) with coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction (MI). Unlike CXCR4, the classic receptor for CXCL12, the function of CXCR7 (the most recently identified receptor) in vascular responses to injury and in MI remains unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Tissue expression of CXCR7 was examined in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>es from mice and humans. Mice that harbored floxed <i>CXCR7</i> and <i>Cdh5</i>-promoter driven <i>CreERT2</i> were treated with tamoxifen to induce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">endothelium</span></strong>-restricted deletion of CXCR7. The resulting conditional knockout mice and littermate controls were studied for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>al response to angioplasty wire injury and cardiac response to coronary artery ligation. The role of CXCR7 in endothelial cell proliferation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s was determined in vitro with cells from mice and humans. The effects of adenoviral delivery of <i>CXCR7</i> gene and pharmacological activation of CXCR7 were evaluated in mice subjected to MI.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Injured <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>es from both humans and mice exhibited endothelial CXCR7 expression. Conditional endothelial CXCR7 deletion promoted neointimal formation without altering plasma lipid levels after endothelial injury and exacerbated heart functional impairment after MI, with increased both mortality and infarct sizes. Mechanistically, the exacerbated responses in vascular and cardiac remodeling are attributable to the key role of CXCR7 in promoting endothelial proliferation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s. Impressively, the impaired post-MI cardiac remodeling occurred with elevated levels of CXCL12, which was previously thought to mediate cardiac protection by exclusively engaging its cognate receptor, CXCR4. In addition, both <i>CXCR7</i> gene delivery via left ventricular injection and treatment with a CXCR7 agonist offered cardiac protection after MI.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>CXCR7 represents a novel regulator of vascular homeostasis that functions in the endothelial compartment with sufficient capacity to affect cardiac function and remodeling after MI.

Lymph node blood vessels provide exit routes for metastatic tumor cell dissemination in mice
<p>During metastasis, malignant cells escape the primary tumor, intravasate lymphatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong>s, and reach draining sentinel lymph nodes before they colonize distant organs via the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> circulation. Although lymph node metastasis in cancer patients correlates with poor prognosis, evidence is lacking as to whether and how tumor cells enter the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong>stream via lymph nodes. To investigate this question, we delivered carcinoma cells into the lymph nodes of mice by microinfusing the cells into afferent lymphatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong>s. We found that tumor cells rapidly infiltrated the lymph node parenchyma, invaded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong>s, and seeded lung metastases without involvement of the thoracic duct. These results suggest that the lymph node <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong>s can serve as an exit route for systemic dissemination of cancer cells in experimental mouse models. Whether this form of tumor cell spreading occurs in cancer patients remains to be determined.</p>

Targeting angiogenic metabolism in disease
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong>s, which are lined by endothelial cells (ECs), supply oxygen and nutrients to every cell in the body. When tissues (or tumors) grow, they stimulate ECs to form new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong>s (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s), so that they become better nourished. Hence, inhibiting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s to starve tumors has become a clinically approved therapy. For more than 40 years, antiangiogenic medicine has focused on targeting angiogenic signaling proteins, such as vascular endothelial growth f actor (VEGF). However, the success of VEGF-targeted therapy for cancer and neovascular ocular diseases is limited by insufficient efficacy and/or drug resistance, necessitating a fundamentally different approach. Targeting EC metabolism is gaining increasing attention as a possible alternative for inhibiting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiogenesi</span></strong>s.</p>

Spatiotemporal Coupling of Vessel Cavitation and Discharge of Stored Xylem Water in a Tree Sapling
<p>Water discharge from stem internal storage compartments is thought to minimize the risk of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong> cavitation. Based on this concept, one would expect that water storage compartments involved in the buffering of xylem tensions empty before the onset of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong> cavitation under drought stress, and potentially refill after soil saturation. However, scant in vivo data exist that elucidate this localized spatiotemporal coupling. In this study on intact saplings of American chestnut (<i>Castanea dentata</i>), x-ray computed microtomography (microCT) showed that the xylem matrix surrounding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong>s releases stored water and becomes air-filled either concurrent to or after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong> cavitation under progressive drought stress. Among annual growth rings, the xylem matrix of the current year remained largely water-filled even under severe drought stress. In comparison, microtomography images collected on excised stems showed that applied pressures of much greater than 0 MPa were required to induce water release from the xylem matrix. Viability staining highlighted that water release from the xylem matrix was associated primarily with emptying of dead fibers. Refilling of the xylem matrix and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong>s was detected in intact saplings when the canopy was bagged and stem water potential was close to 0 MPa, and in leafless saplings over the winter period. In conclusion, this study indicates that the bulk of water stored in the xylem matrix is released after the onset of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong> cavitation, and suggests that capillary water contributes to overall stem water storage under drought but is not used primarily for the prevention of drought-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong> cavitation in this species.</p>

Linking Auxin with Photosynthetic Rate via Leaf Venation
<p>Land plants lose vast quantities of water to the atmosphere during photosynthetic gas exchange. In angiosperms, a complex network of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong>s irrigates the leaf, and it is widely held that the density and placement of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong>s determines maximum leaf hydraulic capacity and thus maximum photosynthetic rate. This theory is largely based on interspecific comparisons and has never been tested using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong> mutants to examine the specific impact of leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong> morphology on plant water relations. Here we characterize mutants at the <i>Crispoid</i> (<i>Crd</i>) locus in pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>), which have altered auxin homeostasis and activity in developing leaves, as well as reduced leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong> density and aberrant placement of free-ending <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong>lets. This altered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong> phenotype in <i>crd</i> mutant plants results in a significant reduction in leaf hydraulic conductance and leaf gas exchange. We find <i>Crispoid</i> to be a member of the <i>YUCCA</i> family of auxin biosynthetic genes. Our results link auxin biosynthesis with maximum photosynthetic rate through leaf venation and substantiate the theory that an increase in the density of leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong>s coupled with their efficient placement can drive increases in leaf photosynthetic capacity.</p>

Furthermore, normal and diseased human femoral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>es were harvested, and various in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro models of VSMC phenotype switching were conducted to examine miR-22 expression during VSMC phenotype switching.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Expression of miR-22 was closely regulated during VSMC phenotypic modulation. miR-22 overexpression significantly increased expression of VSMC marker genes and inhibited VSMC proliferation and migration, whereas the opposite effect was observed when endogenous miR-22 was knocked down. As expected, 2 previously reported miR-22 target genes, MECP2 (methyl-CpG binding protein 2) and histone deacetylase 4, exhibited a regulatory role in VSMC phenotypic modulation. A transcriptional regulator and oncoprotein, EVI1 (ecotropic virus integration site 1 protein homolog), has been identified as a novel miR-22 target gene in VSMC phenotypic modulation. It is noteworthy that overexpression of miR-22 in the injured <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong>s significantly reduced the expression of its target genes, decreased VSMC proliferation, and inhibited neointima formation in wire-injured femoral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>es, whereas the opposite effect was observed with local application of a miR-22 inhibitor to injured <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>es.

Vascular CXCR4 Limits Atherosclerosis by Maintaining Arterial Integrity
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The CXCL12/CXCR4 chemokine ligand/receptor axis controls (progenitor) cell homeostasis and trafficking. So far, an atheroprotective role of CXCL12/CXCR4 has only been implied through pharmacological intervention, in particular, because the somatic deletion of the <i>CXCR4</i> gene in mice is embryonically lethal. Moreover, cell-specific effects of CXCR4 in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>al wall and underlying mechanisms remain elusive, prompting us to investigate the relevance of CXCR4 in vascular cell types for atheroprotection.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We examined the role of vascular CXCR4 in atherosclerosis and plaque composition by inducing an endothelial cell (BmxCreER<sup>T2</sup>-driven)–specific or smooth muscle cell (SMC, SmmhcCreER<sup>T2</sup>- or TaglnCre-driven)–specific deficiency of <i>CXCR4</i> in an apolipoprotein E–deficient mouse model. To identify underlying mechanisms for effects of CXCR4, we studied endothelial permeability, intravital leukocyte adhesion, involvement of the Akt/WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway and relevant phosphatases in VE-cadherin expression and function, vascular tone in aortic rings, cholesterol efflux from macrophages, and expression of SMC phenotypic markers. Finally, we analyzed associations of common genetic variants at the <i>CXCR4</i> locus with the risk for coronary heart disease, along with <i>CXCR4</i> transcript expression in human atherosclerotic plaques.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The cell-specific deletion of <i>CXCR4</i> in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>al endothelial cells (n=12–15) or SMCs (n=13–24) markedly increased atherosclerotic lesion formation in hyperlipidemic mice. Endothelial barrier function was promoted by CXCL12/CXCR4, which triggered Akt/WNT/β-catenin signaling to drive VE-cadherin expression and stabilized junctional VE-cadherin complexes through associated phosphatases. Conversely, endothelial <i>CXCR4</i> deficiency caused <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>al leakage and inflammatory leukocyte recruitment during atherogenesis. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>al SMCs, CXCR4 sustained normal vascular reactivity and contractile responses, whereas <i>CXCR4</i> deficiency favored a synthetic phenotype, the occurrence of macrophage-like SMCs in the lesions, and impaired cholesterol efflux. Regression analyses in humans (n=259 796) identified the C-allele at <i>rs2322864</i> within the <i>CXCR4</i> locus to be associated with increased risk for coronary heart disease. In line, C/C risk genotype carriers showed reduced CXCR4 expression in carotid artery plaques (n=188), which was furthermore associated with symptomatic disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our data clearly establish that vascular CXCR4 limits atherosclerosis by maintaining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>al integrity, preserving endothelial barrier function, and a normal contractile SMC phenotype. Enhancing these beneficial functions of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>al CXCR4 by selective modulators might open novel therapeutic options in atherosclerosis.</p></sec>

Enhanced Therapeutic and Long-Term Dynamic Vascularization Effects of Human Pluripotent Stem Cell–Derived Endothelial Cells Encapsulated in a Nanomatrix Gel
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)–derived endothelial cells (ECs) have limited clinical utility because of undefined components in the differentiation system and poor cell survival in vivo. Here, we aimed to develop a fully defined and clinically compatible system to differentiate hPSCs into ECs. Furthermore, we aimed to enhance cell survival, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong> formation, and therapeutic potential by encapsulating hPSC-ECs with a peptide amphiphile (PA) nanomatrix gel.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We induced differentiation of hPSCs into the mesodermal lineage by culturing on collagen-coated plates with a glycogen synthase kinase 3β inhibitor. Next, vascular endothelial growth factor, endothelial growth factor, and basic fibroblast growth factor were added for endothelial lineage differentiation, followed by sorting for CDH5 (VE-cadherin). We constructed an extracellular matrix–mimicking PA nanomatrix gel (PA-RGDS) by incorporating the cell adhesive ligand Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS) and a matrix metalloproteinase-2–degradable sequence. We then evaluated whether the encapsulation of hPSC-CDH5<sup>+</sup> cells in PA-RGDS could enhance long-term cell survival and vascular regenerative effects in a hind-limb ischemia model with laser Doppler perfusion imaging, bioluminescence imaging, real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction, and histological analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The resultant hPSC-derived CDH5<sup>+</sup> cells (hPSC-ECs) showed highly enriched and genuine EC characteristics and proangiogenic activities. When injected into ischemic hind limbs, hPSC-ECs showed better perfusion recovery and higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong>-forming capacity compared with media-, PA-RGDS–, or human umbilical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong> EC–injected groups. However, the group receiving the PA-RGDS–encapsulated hPSC-ECs showed better perfusion recovery, more robust and longer cell survival (> 10 months), and higher and prolonged angiogenic and vascular incorporation capabilities than the bare hPSC-EC–injected group. Surprisingly, the engrafted hPSC-ECs demonstrated previously unknown sustained and dynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong>-forming behavior: initial perivascular concentration, a guiding role for new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong> formation, and progressive incorporation into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong>s over 10 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We generated highly enriched hPSC-ECs via a clinically compatible system. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that a biocompatible PA-RGDS nanomatrix gel substantially improved long-term survival of hPSC-ECs in an ischemic environment and improved neovascularization effects of hPSC-ECs via prolonged and unique angiogenic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vessel</span></strong>-forming properties. This PA-RGDS–mediated transplantation of hPSC-ECs can serve as a novel platform for cell-based therapy and investigation of long-term behavior of hPSC-ECs.</p></sec>

Interferon Regulatory Factor 4 Inhibits Neointima Formation by Engaging Krüppel-Like Factor 4 Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The mechanisms underlying neointima formation remain unclear. Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), which are key innate immune regulators, play important roles in cardiometabolic diseases. However, the function of IRF4 in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>al restenosis is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>IRF4 expression was first detected in human and mouse restenotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>es. Then, the effects of IRF4 on neointima formation were evaluated with universal IRF4-deficient mouse and rat carotid artery injury models. We performed immunostaining to identify IRF4-expressing cells in the lesions. Smooth muscle cell (SMC)–specific IRF4-knockout (KO) and -transgenic (TG) mice were generated to evaluate the effects of SMC-IRF4 on neointima formation. We used microarray, bioinformatics analysis, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay to identify the downstream signals of IRF4 and to verify the targets in vitro. We compared SMC-IRF4-KO/Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4)–TG mice with SMC-IRF4-KO mice and SMC-specific IRF4-TG/KLF4-KO mice with SMC-specific IRF4-TG mice to investigate whether the effect of IRF4 on neointima formation is KLF4-dependent. The effect of IRF4 on SMC phenotype switching was also evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>IRF4 expression in both the human and mouse restenotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>es is eventually downregulated. Universal IRF4 ablation potentiates neointima formation in both mice and rats. Immunostaining indicated that IRF4 was expressed primarily in SMCs in restenotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>es. After injury, SMC-IRF4-KO mice developed a thicker neointima than control mice. This change was accompanied by increased SMC proliferation and migration. However, SMC-specific IRF4-TG mice exhibited the opposite phenotype, demonstrating that IRF4 exerts protective effects against neointima formation. The mechanistic study indicated that IRF4 promotes KLF4 expression by directly binding to its promoter. Genetic overexpression of KLF4 in SMCs largely reversed the neointima-promoting effect of IRF4 ablation, whereas ablation of KLF4 abolished the protective function of IRF4, indicating that the protective effects of IRF4 against neointima formation are KLF4-dependent. In addition, IRF4 promoted SMC dedifferentiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>IRF4 protects <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>es against neointima formation by promoting the expression of KLF4 by directly binding to its promoter. Our findings suggest that this previously undiscovered IRF4-KLF4 axis plays a key role in vasculoproliferative pathology and may be a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>al restenosis.</p></sec>

Percutaneous Therapies for Peripheral Artery Disease
<p>Percutaneous therapies for peripheral artery disease continue to evolve with new techniques and devices. Although guidelines-recommended therapies have impacted cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, endovascular interventions have been shown to reduce limb pain, improve quality of life, and prolong walking distance for those with claudication and to reduce amputation rates among those with critical limb ischemia. Novel devices such as drug-eluting stents and drug-coated balloons have improved patency for moderate-length lesions, whereas others allow treatment of heavily calcified and tortuous segments. New adjunctive devices to cross lesions and reduce or modify associated plaque have also been developed, although level 1 data regarding their efficacy are sparse. There has also been a better mechanistic understanding of lower extremity endovascular treatment using tools such as intravascular ultrasound. This information has highlighted the need for better stent size selection for the femoropopliteal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>al segments and larger balloon diameters for the tibial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>es. Moreover, a wound perfusion approach with direct in-line flow, the so-called angiosome approach, and reconstruction of the pedal loop have been advocated for improved wound healing. Technical advances such as the tibiopedal access and reentry methods have allowed crossing of lesions that were considered no option for the endovascular approach in the past. Collectively, there has been increased awareness, interest, and commitment by various specialty societies and organizations to advance the treatment of peripheral artery disease and critical limb ischemia. This is also evident by the recent coalition of 7 professional societies and organizations that represented >150 000 allied health professionals and millions of patients with peripheral artery disease at the 2015 Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services Medicare Evidence Development and Coverage Analysis Committee meeting. The percutaneous therapies for peripheral artery disease continue to evolve with longer follow-up with randomized data and larger prospective registries. In the future, it is hopeful that we will treat the lower extremity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arteri</span></strong>es according to segments, taking into account plaque morphology, luminal versus subintimal crossing, location, and stenotic versus occlusive disease. Until then, we must identify the most cost-effective, efficacious, and safe treatment for each patient. The goal of this article is to aid the practicing vascular specialist consider the optimal choices for the management of patients with vascular disease.</p>

Point-of-Care Hemostatic Testing in Cardiac Surgery
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac surgery is frequently complicated by coagulopathic bleeding that is difficult to optimally manage using standard hemostatic testing. We hypothesized that point-of-care hemostatic testing within the context of an integrated transfusion algorithm would improve the management of coagulopathy in cardiac surgery and thereby reduce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> transfusions.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a pragmatic multicenter stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial of a point-of-care–based transfusion algorithm in consecutive patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass at 12 hospitals from October 6, 2014, to May 1, 2015. Following a 1-month data collection at all participating hospitals, a transfusion algorithm incorporating point-of-care hemostatic testing was sequentially implemented at 2 hospitals at a time in 1-month intervals, with the implementation order randomly assigned. No other aspects of care were modified. The primary outcome was red <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> cell transfusion from surgery to postoperative day 7. Other outcomes included transfusion of other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> products, major bleeding, and major complications. The analysis adjusted for secular time trends, within-hospital clustering, and patient-level risk factors. All outcomes and analyses were prespecified before study initiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among the 7402 patients studied, 3555 underwent surgery during the control phase and 3847 during the intervention phase. Overall, 3329 (45.0%) received red <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> cells, 1863 (25.2%) received platelets, 1645 (22.2%) received plasma, and 394 (5.3%) received cryoprecipitate. Major bleeding occurred in 1773 (24.1%) patients, and major complications occurred in 740 (10.2%) patients. The trial intervention reduced rates of red <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> cell transfusion (adjusted relative risk, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.85–0.98; <i>P</i>=0.02; number needed to treat, 24.7), platelet transfusion (relative risk, 0.77; 95% confidence interval, 0.68–0.87; <i>P</i><0.001; number needed to treat, 16.7), and major bleeding (relative risk, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.72–0.94; <i>P</i>=0.004; number needed to treat, 22.6), but had no effect on other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> product transfusions or major complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Implementation of point-of-care hemostatic testing within the context of an integrated transfusion algorithm reduces red <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood</span></strong> cell transfusions, platelet transfusions, and major bleeding following cardiac surgery.

Outside-Xylem Vulnerability, Not Xylem Embolism, Controls Leaf Hydraulic Decline during Dehydration<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[CC-BY]</sup></xref>
<p>Leaf hydraulic supply is crucial to maintaining open stomata for CO<sub>2</sub> capture and plant growth. During drought-induced dehydration, the leaf hydraulic conductance (<i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub>) declines, which contributes to stomatal closure and, eventually, to leaf death. Previous studies have tended to attribute the decline of <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embol</span></strong>ism in the leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong> xylem. We visualized at high resolution and quantified experimentally the hydraulic vulnerability of xylem and outside-xylem pathways and modeled their respective influences on plant water transport. Evidence from all approaches indicated that the decline of <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> during dehydration arose first and foremost due to the vulnerability of outside-xylem tissues. In vivo x-ray microcomputed tomography of dehydrating leaves of four diverse angiosperm species showed that, at the turgor loss point, only small fractions of leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vein</span></strong> xylem conduits were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embol</span></strong>ized, and substantial xylem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embol</span></strong>ism arose only under severe dehydration. Experiments on an expanded set of eight angiosperm species showed that outside-xylem hydraulic vulnerability explained 75% to 100% of <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> decline across the range of dehydration from mild water stress to beyond turgor loss point. Spatially explicit modeling of leaf water transport pointed to a role for reduced membrane conductivity consistent with published data for cells and tissues. Plant-scale modeling suggested that outside-xylem hydraulic vulnerability can protect the xylem from tensions that would induce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">embol</span></strong>ism and disruption of water transport under mild to moderate soil and atmospheric droughts. These findings pinpoint outside-xylem tissues as a central locus for the control of leaf and plant water transport during progressive drought.</p>

Solving the Towers of Hanoi – how an amoeboid organism efficiently constructs transport networks
<p>Many biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s require extensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s to transport resources and information. Biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s must trade-off <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> efficiency with the risk of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> failure. Yet, biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s develop in the absence of centralised control from the interactions of many components. Moreover, many biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s need to be able to adapt when conditions change and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> requires modification. We used the slime mould <i>Physarum polycephalum</i> (Schwein) to study how the organism adapts its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> after disruption. To allow us to determine the efficiency of the constructed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s, we used a well-known shortest-path problem: the Towers of Hanoi maze. We first show that while <i>P. polycephalum</i> is capable of building <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s with minimal length paths through the maze, most solutions are sub-optimal. We then disrupted the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> by severing the main connecting path while opening a new path in the maze. In response to dynamic changes to the environment, <i>P. polycephalum</i> reconstructed more efficient solutions, with all replicates building <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s with minimal length paths through the maze after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> disruption. While <i>P. polycephalum</i> altered some of its existing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> to accommodate changes in the environment, it also reconstructed large sections of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> from scratch. We compared the results obtained from <i>P. polycephalum</i> with those obtained using another distributed biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>: ant colonies. We hypothesise that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> construction in ants hinges upon stronger positive feedback than for slime mould, ensuring that ants converge more accurately upon the shortest path but are more constrained by the history of their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s in dynamic environments.</p>

Local and Systemic Metabolic Responses during Light-Induced Rapid Systemic Signaling
<p>Plants evolved multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathways that transduce light-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>s between leaves. These are thought to improve light stress acclimation in a process termed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic acquired acclimation. Although responses to light stress have been studied extensively in local leaves, and to a lesser degree in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic leaves, little is known about the responses that occur in the different tissues that connect the local to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic leaves. These could be important in defining the specificity of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic response as well as in supporting the generation of different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>s. Here, we report that local application of light stress to one rosette leaf of bolting Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants resulted in a metabolic response that encompassed local, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic and transport tissues (stem tissues that connect the local to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic tissues), demonstrating a high degree of physical and metabolic continuity between different tissues throughout the plant. Our results further indicate that the response of many of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ically altered metabolites is associated with the function of the reactive oxygen species wave and that the levels of eight different metabolites are altered in a similar manner in all tissues tested (local, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic, and transport). These compounds could define a core metabolic signature for light stress that propagates from the local to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic leaves. Our findings suggest that metabolic changes occurring in cells that connect the local and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic tissues play an important role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic acquired acclimation and could convey specificity to the rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic response of plants to light stress.</p>

Prior experience with conspecific signals enhances auditory midbrain responsiveness to conspecific vocalizations
<p>There is a long history in neuroethology of investigating how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong></span></strong>ation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>s influence the brain and behavior. It has become increasingly clear that brain areas associated with sensory processing are plastic in adults and that this plasticity is related to reproductive condition. However, the role of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong></span></strong>ation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> reception in adult auditory plasticity has received relatively little attention. Here, we investigated whether the reception of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong></span></strong>ation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>s (a frog chorus) could enhance the responsiveness of the auditory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> to future reception of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong></span></strong>ation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>s (a single male call). We found that animals that had been exposed to 10 days of a male chorus had stronger auditory midbrain immediate early gene expression than animals that had been exposed to 10 days of random tones when tested with 30 min of male calls or 30 min of tones. Our results suggest that exposure to dynamic social stimuli, like frog choruses, may play an important role in shaping the neural and behavioral responses to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong></span></strong>ation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>s.</p>

Network Modeling Unravels Mechanisms of Crosstalk between Ethylene and Salicylate Signaling in Potato
<p>To develop novel crop breeding strategies, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms underlying the interaction between plants and their pathogens. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> modeling represents a powerful tool that can unravel properties of complex biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. In this study, we aimed to use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> modeling to better understand immune <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing in potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>). For this, we first built on a reliable Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) immune <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing model, extending it with the information from diverse publicly available resources. Next, we translated the resulting prior knowledge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> (20,012 nodes and 70,091 connections) to potato and superimposed it with an ensemble <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> inferred from time-resolved transcriptomics data for potato. We used different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> modeling approaches to generate specific hypotheses of potato immune <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing mechanisms. An interesting finding was the identification of a string of molecular events illuminating the ethylene pathway <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ation of the salicylic acid pathway through Nonexpressor of PR Genes1 gene expression. Functional validations confirmed this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ation, thus supporting the potential of our integrative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> modeling approach for unraveling molecular mechanisms in complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. In addition, this approach can ultimately result in improved breeding strategies for potato and other sensitive crops.</p>

Spatially structured cell populations process multiple sensory signals in parallel in intact vascular endothelium
<p>Blood flow, blood clotting, angiogenesis, vascular permeability, and vascular remodeling are each controlled by a large number of variable, noisy, and interacting chemical inputs to the vascular endothelium. The endothelium processes the entirety of the chemical composition to which the cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> is exposed, carrying out sophisticated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ations that determine physiological output. Processing this enormous quantity of information is a major challenge facing the endothelium. We analyzed the responses of hundreds of endothelial cells to carbachol (CCh) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and found that the endothelium segregates the responses to these two distinct components of the chemical environment into separate streams of complementary information that are processed in parallel. Sensitivities to CCh and ATP mapped to different clusters of cells, and each agonist generated distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> patterns. The distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>s were features of agonist activation rather than properties of the cells themselves. When there was more than one stimulus present, the cells <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong></span></strong>ated and combined inputs to generate new distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>s that were nonlinear combinations of the inputs. Our results demonstrate that the endothelium is a structured, collaborative sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> that simplifies the complex environment using separate cell clusters that are sensitive to distinct aspects of the overall biochemical environment and interactively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>e <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>s from diverse but interrelated chemical inputs. These features enable the endothelium to selectively process separate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>s and perform multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ations in an environment that is noisy and variable.</p>

Soluble gp130 prevents interleukin-6 and interleukin-11 cluster signaling but not intracellular autocrine responses
<p>Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a proinflammatory cytokine of the IL-6 family, members of which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> through a complex of a cytokine-specific receptor and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>-transducing subunit gp130. The interaction of IL-6 with the membrane-bound IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) and gp130 stimulates “classic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing,” whereas the binding of IL-6 and a soluble version of the IL-6R to gp130 stimulates “trans-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing.” Alternatively, “cluster <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing” occurs when membrane-bound IL-6:IL-6R complexes on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmitt</span></strong>er cells activate gp130 receptors on neighboring receiver cells. The soluble form of gp130 (sgp130) is a selective trans-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing inhibitor, but it does not affect classic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing. We demonstrated that the interaction of soluble gp130 with natural and synthetic membrane-bound IL-6:IL-6R complexes inhibited IL-6 cluster <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing. Similarly, IL-11 cluster <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing through the IL-11R to gp130 was also inhibited by soluble gp130. However, autocrine classic and trans-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing was not inhibited by extracellular inhibitors such as sgp130 or gp130 antibodies. Together, our results suggest that autocrine IL-6 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing may occur intracellularly.</p>

Vocal production complexity correlates with neural instructions in the oyster toadfish (<i>Opsanus tau</i>)
<p>Sound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong></span></strong>ation is fundamental to many social interactions and essential to courtship and agonistic behaviours in many vertebrates. The swimbladder and associated muscles in batrachoidid fishes (midshipman and toadfish) is a unique vertebrate sound production <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, wherein fundamental frequencies are determined directly by the firing rate of a vocal-acoustic neural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> that drives the contraction frequency of superfast swimbladder muscles. The oyster toadfish boatwhistle call starts with an irregular sound waveform that could be an emergent property of the peripheral nonlinear sound-producing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> or reflect complex encoding in the central nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. Here, we demonstrate that the start of the boatwhistle is indicative of a chaotic strange attractor, and tested whether its origin lies in the peripheral sound-producing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> or in the vocal motor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>. We recorded sound and swimbladder muscle activity in awake, freely behaving toadfish during motor nerve stimulation, and recorded sound, motor nerve and muscle activity during spontaneous grunts. The results show that rhythmic motor volleys do not cause complex sound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>s. However, arrhythmic recruitment of swimbladder muscle during spontaneous grunts correlates with complex sounds. This supports the hypothesis that the irregular start of the boatwhistle is encoded in the vocal pre-motor neural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>, and not caused by peripheral interactions with the sound-producing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. We suggest that sound production <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> demands across vocal tetrapods have selected for muscles and motorneurons adapted for speed, which can execute complex neural instructions into equivalently complex vocalisations.</p>

Sheet-Like Remodeling of the Transverse Tubular System in Human Heart Failure Impairs Excitation-Contraction Coupling and Functional Recovery by Mechanical Unloading
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac recovery in response to mechanical unloading by left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) has been demonstrated in subgroups of patients with chronic heart failure (HF). Hallmarks of HF are depletion and disorganization of the transverse tubular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> (t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>) in cardiomyocytes. Here, we investigated remodeling of the t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> in human end-stage HF and its role in cardiac recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Left ventricular biopsies were obtained from 5 donors and 26 patients with chronic HF undergoing implantation of LVADs. Three-dimensional confocal microscopy and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ational image analysis were applied to assess t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> structure, density, and distance of ryanodine receptor clusters to the sarcolemma, including the t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. Recovery of cardiac function in response to mechanical unloading was assessed by echocardiography during turndown of the LVAD.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The majority of HF myocytes showed remarkable t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> remodeling, particularly sheet-like invaginations of the sarcolemma. Circularity of t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> components was decreased in HF versus controls (0.37±0.01 versus 0.46±0.02; <i>P</i><0.01), and the volume/length ratio was increased in HF (0.36±0.01 versus 0.25±0.02 µm<sup>2</sup>; <i>P</i><0.0001). T-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> density was reduced in HF, leading to increased ryanodine receptor–sarcolemma distances (0.96±0.05 versus 0.64±0.1 µm; <i>P</i><0.01). Low ryanodine receptor–sarcolemma distances at the time of LVAD implantation predicted high post-LVAD left ventricular ejection fractions (<i>P</i><0.01) and ejection fraction increases during unloading (<i>P</i><0.01). Ejection fraction in patients with pre-LVAD ryanodine receptor–sarcolemma distances >1 µm did not improve after mechanical unloading. In addition, calcium transients were recorded in field-stimulated isolated human cardiomyocytes and analyzed with respect to local t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> density. Calcium release in HF myocytes was restricted to regions proximal to the sarcolemma. Local calcium upstroke was delayed (23.9±4.9 versus 10.3±1.7 milliseconds; <i>P</i><0.05) and more asynchronous (18.1±1.5 versus 8.9±2.2 milliseconds; <i>P</i><0.01) in HF cells with low t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> density versus cells with high t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> density.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> in end-stage human HF presents a characteristic novel phenotype consisting of sheet-like invaginations of the sarcolemma. Our results suggest that the remodeled t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> impairs excitation-contraction coupling and functional recovery during chronic LVAD unloading. An intact t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> at the time of LVAD implantation may constitute a precondition and predictor for functional cardiac recovery after mechanical unloading.</p></sec>

The conformational state of hERG1 channels determines integrin association, downstream signaling, and cancer progression
<p>Ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration in normal and neoplastic cells through cell-cell and cell–extracellular matrix (ECM) transmembrane receptors called integrins. K<sup>+</sup> flux through the human ether-à-go-go–related gene 1 (hERG1) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> shapes action potential firing in excitable cells such as cardiomyocytes. Its abundance is often aberrantly high in tumors, where it <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ates integrin-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing. We found that hERG1 interacted with the β<sub>1</sub> integrin subunit at the plasma membrane of human cancer cells. This interaction was not detected in cardiomyocytes because of the presence of the hERG1 auxiliary subunit KCNE1 (potassium voltage-gated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> subfamily E regulatory subunit 1), which blocked the β<sub>1</sub> integrin–hERG1 interaction. Although open hERG1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s did not interact as strongly with β<sub>1</sub> integrins as did closed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s, current flow through hERG1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s was necessary to activate the integrin-dependent phosphorylation of Tyr<sup>397</sup> in focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in both normal and cancer cells. In immunodeficient mice, proliferation was inhibited in breast cancer cells expressing forms of hERG1 with impaired K<sup>+</sup> flow, whereas metastasis of breast cancer cells was reduced when the hERG1/β<sub>1</sub> integrin interaction was disrupted. We conclude that the interaction of β<sub>1</sub> integrins with hERG1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s in cancer cells stimulated distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathways that depended on the conformational state of hERG1 and affected different aspects of tumor progression.</p>

Activation mechanism of a human SK-calmodulin channel complex elucidated by cryo-EM structures

Here we report cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of a human SK4-CaM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> complex in closed and activated states at 3.4- and 3.5-angstrom resolution, respectively. Four CaM molecules bind to one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> tetramer. Each lobe of CaM serves a distinct function: The C-lobe binds to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> constitutively, whereas the N-lobe interacts with the S4-S5 linker in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner. The S4-S5 linker, which contains two distinct helices, undergoes conformational changes upon CaM binding to open the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> pore. These structures reveal the gating mechanism of SK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s and provide a basis for understanding SK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> pharmacology.</p>

VAMP721 Conformations Unmask an Extended Motif for K<sup>+</sup> Channel Binding and Gating Control
<p>Soluble <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins play a major role in membrane fusion and contribute to cell expansion, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing, and polar growth in plants. The SNARE SYP121 of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> that facilitates vesicle fusion at the plasma membrane also binds with, and regulates, K<sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s already present at the plasma membrane to affect K<sup>+</sup> uptake and K<sup>+</sup>-dependent growth. Here, we report that its cognate partner VAMP721, which assembles with SYP121 to drive membrane fusion, binds to the KAT1 K<sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> via two sites on the protein, only one of which contributes to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>-gating control. Binding to the VAMP721 SNARE domain suppressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> gating. By contrast, interaction with the amino-terminal longin domain conferred specificity on VAMP721 binding without influencing gating. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> binding was defined by a linear motif within the longin domain. The SNARE domain is thought to wrap around this structure when not assembled with SYP121 in the SNARE complex. Fluorescence lifetime analysis showed that mutations within this motif, which suppressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> binding and its effects on gating, also altered the conformational displacement between the VAMP721 SNARE and longin domains. The presence of these two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>-binding sites on VAMP721, one also required for SNARE complex assembly, implies a well-defined sequence of events coordinating K<sup>+</sup> uptake and the final stages of vesicle traffic. It suggests that binding begins with VAMP721, and subsequently with SYP121, thereby coordinating K<sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> gating during SNARE assembly and vesicle fusion. Thus, our findings also are consistent with the idea that the K<sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s are nucleation points for SNARE complex assembly.</p>

Late-phase synthesis of IκBα insulates the TLR4-activated canonical NF-κB pathway from noncanonical NF-κB signaling in macrophages
<p>The nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) transcription factors coordinate the inflammatory immune response during microbial infection. Pathogenic substances engage canonical NF-κB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing through the heterodimer RelA:p50, which is subjected to rapid negative feedback by inhibitor of κBα (IκBα). The noncanonical NF-κB pathway is required for the differentiation of immune cells; however, cross-talk between both pathways can occur. Concomitantly activated noncanonical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing generates p52 from the p100 precursor. The synthesis of p100 is induced by canonical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing, leading to the formation of the late-acting RelA:p52 heterodimer. This cross-talk prolongs inflammatory RelA activity in epithelial cells to ensure pathogen clearance. We found that the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)–activated canonical NF-κB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathway is insulated from lymphotoxin β receptor (LTβR)–induced noncanonical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing in mouse macrophage cell lines. Combined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ational and biochemical studies indicated that the extent of NF-κB–responsive expression of <i>Nfkbia</i>, which encodes IκBα, inversely correlated with cross-talk. The <i>Nfkbia</i> promoter showed enhanced responsiveness to NF-κB activation in macrophages compared to that in fibroblasts. We found that this hyperresponsive promoter engaged the RelA:p52 dimer generated during costimulation of macrophages through TLR4 and LTβR to trigger synthesis of IκBα at late time points, which prevented the late-acting RelA cross-talk response. Together, these data suggest that, despite the presence of identical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s in cells of diverse lineages, emergent cross-talk between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathways is subject to cell type–specific regulation. We propose that the insulation of canonical and noncanonical NF-κB pathways limits the deleterious effects of macrophage-mediated inflammation.</p>

Phosphoproteomic analysis of chimeric antigen receptor signaling reveals kinetic and quantitative differences that affect cell function
<p>Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) link an antigen recognition domain to intracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing domains to redirect T cell specificity and function. T cells expressing CARs with CD28/CD3ζ or 4-1BB/CD3ζ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing domains are effective at treating refractory B cell malignancies but exhibit differences in effector function, clinical efficacy, and toxicity that are assumed to result from the activation of divergent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing cascades. We analyzed stimulation-induced phosphorylation events in primary human CD8<sup>+</sup> CD28/CD3ζ and 4-1BB/CD3ζ CAR T cells by mass spectrometry and found that both CAR constructs activated similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing intermediates. Stimulation of CD28/CD3ζ CARs activated faster and larger-magnitude changes in protein phosphorylation, which correlated with an effector T cell–like phenotype and function. In contrast, 4-1BB/CD3ζ CAR T cells preferentially expressed T cell memory–associated genes and exhibited sustained antitumor activity against established tumors in vivo. Mutagenesis of the CAR CD28 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing domain demonstrated that the increased CD28/CD3ζ CAR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> intensity was partly related to constitutive association of Lck with this domain in CAR complexes. Our data show that CAR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathways cannot be predicted solely by the domains used to construct the receptor and that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> strength is a key determinant of T cell fate.

A calcium-sensing receptor mutation causing hypocalcemia disrupts a transmembrane salt bridge to activate β-arrestin–biased signaling
<p>The calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is a G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>s through G<sub>q/11</sub> and G<sub>i/o</sub> to stimulate cytosolic calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>i</sub>) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing to control extracellular calcium homeostasis. Studies of loss- and gain-of-function <i>CASR</i> mutations, which cause familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia type 1 (FHH1) and autosomal dominant hypocalcemia type 1 (ADH1), respectively, have revealed that the CaSR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>s in a biased manner. Thus, some mutations associated with FHH1 lead to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing predominantly through the MAPK pathway, whereas mutations associated with ADH1 preferentially enhance Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>i</sub> responses. We report a previously unidentified ADH1-associated R680G CaSR mutation, which led to the identification of a CaSR structural motif that mediates biased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing. Expressing CaSR<sup>R680G</sup> in HEK 293 cells showed that this mutation increased MAPK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing without altering Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>i</sub> responses. Moreover, this gain of function in MAPK activity occurred independently of G<sub>q/11</sub> and G<sub>i/o</sub> and was mediated instead by a noncanonical pathway involving β-arrestin proteins. Homology modeling and mutagenesis studies showed that the R680G CaSR mutation selectively enhanced β-arrestin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing by disrupting a salt bridge formed between Arg<sup>680</sup> and Glu<sup>767</sup>, which are located in CaSR transmembrane domain 3 and extracellular loop 2, respectively. Thus, our results demonstrate CaSR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing through β-arrestin and the importance of the Arg<sup>680</sup>-Glu<sup>767</sup> salt bridge in mediating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing bias.</p>

ATP promotes the fast migration of dendritic cells through the activity of pannexin 1 channels and P2X<sub>7</sub> receptors
<p>Upon its release from injured cells, such as infected, transformed, inflamed, or necrotic cells, extracellular adenosine-5′-triphosphate (ATP) acts as a danger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> that recruits phagocytes, such as neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs), to the site of injury. The sensing of extracellular ATP occurs through purinergic (P2) receptors. We investigated the cellular mechanisms linking purinergic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing to DC motility. We found that ATP stimulated fast DC motility through an autocrine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing loop, which was initiated by the activation of P2X<sub>7</sub> receptors and further amplified by pannexin 1 (Panx1) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s. Upon stimulation of the P2X<sub>7</sub> receptor by ATP, Panx1 contributed to fast DC motility by increasing the permeability of the plasma membrane, which resulted in supplementary ATP release. In the absence of Panx1, DCs failed to increase their speed of migration in response to ATP, despite exhibiting a normal P2X<sub>7</sub> receptor–mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> response. In addition to DC migration, Panx1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>– and P2X<sub>7</sub> receptor–dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing was further required to stimulate the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. In vivo, functional Panx1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s were required for the homing of DCs to lymph nodes, although they were dispensable for DC maturation. These data suggest that P2X<sub>7</sub> receptors and Panx1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s are crucial players in the regulation of DC migration to endogenous danger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>s.</p>

Discovering relationships between nuclear receptor signaling pathways, genes, and tissues in Transcriptomine
<p>We previously developed a web tool, Transcriptomine, to explore expression profiling data sets involving small-molecule or genetic manipulations of nuclear receptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathways. We describe advances in biocuration, query <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interfac</span></strong>e design, and data visualization that enhance the discovery of uncharacterized biology in these pathways using this tool. Transcriptomine currently contains about 45 million data points encompassing more than 2000 experiments in a reference library of nearly 550 data sets retrieved from public archives and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>atically curated. To make the underlying data points more accessible to bench biologists, we classified experimental small molecules and gene manipulations into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathways and experimental tissues and cell lines into physiological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s and organs. Incorporation of these mappings into Transcriptomine enables the user to readily evaluate tissue-specific regulation of gene expression by nuclear receptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathways. Data points from animal and cell model experiments and from clinical data sets elucidate the roles of nuclear receptor pathways in gene expression events accompanying various normal and pathological cellular processes. In addition, data sets targeting non-nuclear receptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathways highlight transcriptional cross-talk between nuclear receptors and other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathways. We demonstrate with specific examples how data points that exist in isolation in individual data sets validate each other when connected and made accessible to the user in a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interfac</span></strong>e. In summary, Transcriptomine allows bench biologists to routinely develop research hypotheses, validate experimental data, or model relationships between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathways, genes, and tissues.</p>

Using neuroscience to develop artificial intelligence
<p>When the mathematician Alan Turing posed the question “Can machines think?” in the first line of his seminal 1950 paper that ushered in the quest for artificial intelligence (AI) (<i>1</i>), the only known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s carrying out complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ations were biological nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. It is not surprising, therefore, that scientists in the nascent field of AI turned to brain circuits as a source for guidance. One path that was taken since the early attempts to perform intelligent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ation by brain-like circuits (<i>2</i>), and which led recently to remarkable successes, can be described as a highly reductionist approach to model cortical circuitry. In its basic current form, known as a “deep <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>” (or deep net) architecture, this brain-inspired model is built from successive layers of neuron-like elements, connected by adjustable weights, called “synapses” after their biological counterparts (<i>3</i>). The application of deep nets and related methods to AI <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s has been transformative. They proved superior to previously known methods in central areas of AI research, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>er vision, speech recognition and production, and playing complex games. Practical applications are already in broad use, in areas such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>er vision and speech and text translation, and large-scale efforts are under way in many other areas. Here, I discuss how additional aspects of brain circuitry could supply cues for guiding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> models toward broader aspects of cognition and general AI.</p>

Social network plasticity decreases disease transmission in a eusocial insect
<p>Animal social <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s are shaped by multiple selection pressures, including the need to ensure efficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong></span></strong>ation and functioning while simultaneously limiting disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion. Social animals could potentially further reduce epidemic risk by altering their social <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s in the presence of pathogens, yet there is currently no evidence for such pathogen-triggered responses. We tested this hypothesis experimentally in the ant <i>Lasius niger</i> using a combination of automated tracking, controlled pathogen exposure, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion quantification, and temporally explicit simulations. Pathogen exposure induced behavioral changes in both exposed ants and their nestmates, which helped contain the disease by reinforcing key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion-inhibitory properties of the colony’s contact <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>. This suggests that social <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> plasticity in response to pathogens is an effective strategy for mitigating the effects of disease in social groups.</p>

The fundamental advantages of temporal networks

Extracellular ATP Shapes a Defense-Related Transcriptome Both Independently and along with Other Defense Signaling Pathways
<p>ATP is not only an essential metabolite of cellular biochemistry but also acts as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> in the extracellular milieu. In plants, extracellular ATP is monitored by the purinergic receptor P2K1. Recent studies have revealed that extracellular ATP acts as a damage-associated molecular pattern in plants, and its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing through P2K1 is important for mounting an effective defense response against various pathogenic microorganisms. Biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens attack plants using different strategies, to which plants respond accordingly with salicylate-based or jasmonate/ethylene-based defensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing, respectively. Interestingly, defense mediated by P2K1 is effective against pathogens of both lifestyles, raising the question of the level of interplay between extracellular ATP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing and that of jasmonate, ethylene, and salicylate. To address this issue, we analyzed ATP-induced transcriptomes in wild-type Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings and mutant seedlings defective in essential components in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathways of jasmonate, ethylene, and salicylate (classic defense hormones) as well as a mutant and an overexpression line of the P2K1 receptor. We found that P2K1 function is crucial for faithful ATP-induced transcriptional changes and that a subset of genes is more responsive in the P2K1 overexpression line. We also found that more than half of the ATP-responsive genes required <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing by one or more of the pathways for the classical defense hormones, with the jasmonate-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing being more critical than others. By contrast, the other ATP-responsive genes were unaffected by deficiencies in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing for any of the classical defense hormones. These ATP-responsive genes were highly enriched for defense-related Gene Ontology terms. We further tested the ATP-induced genes in knockout mutants of transcription factors, demonstrating that MYCs acting downstream of the jasmonate receptor complex and cal<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>in-binding transcription activators are nuclear transducers of P2K1-mediated extracellular ATP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing.</p>

Guard Cell Salicylic Acid Signaling Is Integrated into Abscisic Acid Signaling via the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CPK-Dependent Pathway

Here, we show that SA-induced stomatal closure and SA activation of slow-type anion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> are impaired in the CPK disruption mutant <i>cpk3-2 cpk6-1</i> but not in the OST1 disruption mutant <i>ost1-3</i>.

Strawberry fleshy fruit develops from the floral receptacle and its ripening is nonclimacteric. The external seed configuration of strawberry fruit facilitates the study of seed-to-fruit cross tissue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong></span></strong>ation, particularly phytohormone biosynthesis and transport. To investigate strawberry fruit development, we previously generated spatial and temporal transcriptome data profiling <i>F. vesca</i> flower and fruit development pre- and postfertilization.

Further, we experimentally tested hypotheses based on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s, including increased iron transport from the receptacle to the seed postfertilization and characterized a <i>F. vesca</i> floral mutant and its candidate gene.

A Genetic Network for Systemic RNA Silencing in Plants
<p>Non-cell autonomous RNA silencing can spread from cell to cell and over long distances in animals and plants. However, the genetic requirements and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>s involved in plant mobile gene silencing are poorly understood. Here, we identified a <i>DICER-LIKE2</i> (<i>DCL2</i>)<i>-</i>dependent mechanism for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic spread of posttranscriptional RNA silencing, also known as posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS), in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. Using a suite of transgenic <i>DCL</i> RNAi lines coupled with a GFP reporter, we demonstrated that <i>N. benthamiana</i> DCL1, DCL2, DCL3, and DCL4 are required to produce microRNAs and 22, 24, and 21nt small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), respectively. All investigated siRNAs produced in local incipient cells were present at low levels in distal tissues. Inhibition of <i>DCL2</i> expression reduced the spread of gene silencing, while suppression of <i>DCL3</i> or <i>DCL4</i> expression enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS. In contrast to <i>DCL4</i> RNAi lines, <i>DCL2</i>-<i>DCL4</i> double-RNAi lines developed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS similar to that observed in <i>DCL2</i> RNAi. We further showed that the 21 or 24 nt local siRNAs produced by DCL4 or DCL3 were not involved in long-distance gene silencing. Grafting experiments demonstrated that <i>DCL2</i> was required in the scion to respond to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>, but not in the rootstock to produce/send the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>. These results suggest a coordinated <i>DCL</i> genetic pathway in which <i>DCL2</i> plays an essential role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS in <i>N. benthamiana</i>, while both <i>DCL4</i> and <i>DCL3</i> attenuate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS.

Extracellular ATP Acts on Jasmonate Signaling to Reinforce Plant Defense
<p>Damaged cells send various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>s to stimulate defense responses. Recent identification and genetic studies of the plant purinoceptor, P2K1 (also known as DORN1), have demonstrated that extracellular ATP is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> involved in plant stress responses, including wounding, perhaps to evoke plant defense. However, it remains largely unknown how extracellular ATP induces plant defense responses. Here, we demonstrate that extracellular ATP induces plant defense mediated through activation of the intracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing of jasmonate (JA), a well-characterized defense hormone. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves, ATP pretreatment induced resistance against the necrotrophic fungus, <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>. The induced resistance was enhanced in the P2K1 receptor overexpression line, but reduced in the receptor mutant, <i>dorn1</i>-<i>3</i>. Mining the transcriptome data revealed that ATP induces a set of JA-induced genes. In addition, the P2K1-associated coexpression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> contains defense-related genes, including those encoding jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins, which play key roles as repressors of JA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing. We examined whether extracellular ATP impacts the stability of JAZ1 in Arabidopsis. The results showed that the JAZ1 stability decreased in response to ATP addition in a proteasome-dependent manner. This reduction required intracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing via second messengers—cytosolic calcium, reactive oxygen species, and nitric oxide. Interestingly, the ATP-induced JAZ1 degradation was attenuated in the JA receptor mutant, <i>coi1</i>, but not in the JA biosynthesis mutant, <i>aos</i>, or upon addition of JA biosynthesis inhibitors. Immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that ATP increases the interaction between COI1 and JAZ1, suggesting direct cross talk between extracellular ATP and JA in intracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing events. Taken together, these results suggest that extracellular ATP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing directly impacts the JA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathway to maximize plant defense responses.</p>

Functional selectivity profiling of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor using pathway-wide BRET signaling sensors

Understanding all the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing events and biases that contribute to both the beneficial and adverse effects of GPCR stimulation by given ligands is important for drug discovery. Here, we report the design, validation, and use of pathway-selective bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) biosensors that monitor the engagement and activation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing effectors downstream of G proteins, including protein kinase C (PKC), phospholipase C (PLC), p63RhoGEF, and Rho. Combined with G protein and β-arrestin BRET biosensors, our sensors enabled real-time monitoring of GPCR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing at different levels in downstream pathways in both native and engineered cells. Profiling of the responses to 14 angiotensin II (AngII) type 1 receptor (AT1R) ligands enabled the clustering of compounds into different subfamilies of biased ligands and showed that, in addition to the previously reported functional selectivity between Gα<sub>q</sub> and β-arrestin, there are also biases among G protein subtypes. We also demonstrated that biases observed at the receptor and G protein levels propagated to downstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathways and that these biases could occur through the engagement of different G proteins to activate a common effector. We also used these tools to determine how naturally occurring AT1R variants affected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing bias. This suite of BRET biosensors provides a useful resource for fingerprinting biased ligands and mutant receptors and for dissecting functional selectivity at various levels of GPCR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing.</p>

Integrated proximal proteomics reveals IRS2 as a determinant of cell survival in ALK-driven neuroblastoma
<p>Oncogenic anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is one of the few druggable targets in neuroblastoma, and therapy resistance to ALK-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) comprises an inevitable clinical challenge. Therefore, a better understanding of the oncogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> rewiring driven by ALK is necessary to improve and guide future therapies. Here, we performed quantitative mass spectrometry–based proteomics on neuroblastoma cells treated with one of three clinically relevant ALK TKIs (crizotinib, LDK378, or lorlatinib) or an experimentally used ALK TKI (TAE684) to unravel aberrant ALK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathways. Our integrated proximal proteomics (IPP) strategy included multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing layers, such as the ALK interactome, phosphotyrosine interactome, phosphoproteome, and proteome. We identified the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing adaptor protein IRS2 (insulin receptor substrate 2) as a major ALK target and an ALK TKI–sensitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing node in neuroblastoma cells driven by oncogenic ALK. TKI treatment decreased the recruitment of IRS2 to ALK and reduced the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS2. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated depletion of ALK or IRS2 decreased the phosphorylation of the survival-promoting kinase Akt and of a downstream target, the transcription factor FoxO3, and reduced the viability of three ALK-driven neuroblastoma cell lines. Collectively, our IPP analysis provides insight into the proximal architecture of oncogenic ALK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing by revealing IRS2 as an adaptor protein that links ALK to neuroblastoma cell survival through the Akt-FoxO3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing axis.</p>

Sphingosine 1-phosphate stimulates eyelid closure in the developing rat by stimulating EGFR signaling

Loss-of-function mutations affecting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathway cause an eyes-open-at-birth (EOB) phenotype in rodents. We identified an insertional mutation in <i>Spinster homolog 2</i> (<i>Spns2</i>) in a strain of transgenic rats exhibiting the EOB phenotype. Spns2, a sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) transporter that releases S1P from cells, was enriched at the tip of developing eyelids in wild-type rat embryos. <i>Spns2</i> expression or treatment with S1P or any one of several EGFR ligands rescued the EOB <i>Spns2</i> mutant phenotype in vivo and in tissue explants in vitro and rescued the formation of stress fibers in primary keratinocytes from mutants.

This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>-to-gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong></span></strong>ation is facilitated by posttranslational modifications such as S-nitrosylation, the covalent attachment of a nitric oxide (NO) moiety to cysteine thiols. In the cerebral cortex, S-nitrosylation of histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) is required for gene transcription during neuronal development, but few other nuclear targets of S-nitrosylation have been identified to date. We used S-nitrosothiol resin-assisted capture on NO donor-treated nuclear extracts from rat cortical neurons and identified 614 S-nitrosylated nuclear proteins. Of these, 131 proteins have not previously been shown to be S-nitrosylated in any <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, and 555 are previously unidentified targets of S-nitrosylation in neurons. The sites of S-nitrosylation were identified for 59% of the targets, and motifs containing single lysines were found at 33% of these sites. In addition, lysine motifs were necessary for promoting the S-nitrosylation of HDAC2 and methyl-CpG binding protein 3 (MBD3). Moreover, S-nitrosylation of the histone-binding protein RBBP7 was necessary for dendritogenesis of cortical neurons in culture. Together, our findings characterize S-nitrosylated nuclear proteins in neurons and identify S-nitrosylation motifs that may be shared with other targets of NO <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing.</p>

Integration of protein phosphorylation, acetylation, and methylation data sets to outline lung cancer signaling networks
<p>Protein posttranslational modifications (PTMs) have typically been studied independently, yet many proteins are modified by more than one PTM type, and cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathways somehow integrate this information. We coupled immunoprecipitation using PTM-specific antibodies with tandem mass tag (TMT) mass spectrometry to simultaneously examine phosphorylation, methylation, and acetylation in 45 lung cancer cell lines compared to normal lung tissue and to cell lines treated with anticancer drugs. This simultaneous, large-scale, integrative analysis of these PTMs using a cluster-filtered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> (CFN) approach revealed that cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathways were outlined by clustering patterns in PTMs. We used the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) method to identify PTM clusters and then integrated each with known protein-protein interactions (PPIs) to elucidate functional cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathways. The CFN identified known and previously unknown cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathways in lung cancer cells that were not present in normal lung epithelial tissue. In various proteins modified by more than one type of PTM, the incidence of those PTMs exhibited inverse relationships, suggesting that molecular exclusive “OR” gates determine a large number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> transduction events. We also showed that the acetyltransferase EP300 appears to be a hub in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> of pathways involving different PTMs. In addition, the data shed light on the mechanism of action of geldanamycin, an HSP90 inhibitor. Together, the findings reveal that cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathways mediated by acetylation, methylation, and phosphorylation regulate the cytoskeleton, membrane traffic, and RNA binding protein–mediated control of gene expression.</p>

mTORC1 controls lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release through the two-pore channel TPC2
<p>Two-pore segment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> 2 (TPC2) is a ubiquitously expressed, lysosomally targeted ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> that aids in terminating autophagy and is inhibited upon its association with mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). It is controversial whether TPC2 mediates lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release or selectively conducts Na<sup>+</sup> and whether the binding of nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) or phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate [PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>] is required for the activity of this ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>. We show that TPC2 is required for intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing in response to NAADP or to mTOR inhibition by rapamycin. In pulmonary arterial myocytes, rapamycin and NAADP evoked global Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients that were blocked by depletion of lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores. Preincubation of cells with high concentrations of rapamycin resulted in desensitization and blocked NAADP-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>s. Moreover, rapamycin and NAADP did not evoke discernable Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in myocytes derived from <i>Tpcn2</i> knockout mice, which showed normal responses to other Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mobilizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>s. In HEK293 cells stably overexpressing human TPC2, shRNA-mediated knockdown of mTOR blocked rapamycin- and NAADP-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>s. Confocal imaging of a genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator fused to TPC2 demonstrated that rapamycin-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>s localized to lysosomes and were in close proximity to TPC2. Therefore, inactivation of mTOR may activate TPC2 and consequently lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release.</p>

Inflammatory but not mitogenic contexts prime synovial fibroblasts for compensatory signaling responses to p38 inhibition
<p>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disorder that causes joint pain, swelling, and loss of function. Development of effective new drugs has proven challenging in part because of the complexities and interconnected nature of intracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s that complicate the effects of pharmacological interventions. We characterized the kinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathways that are activated in RA and evaluated the multivariate effects of targeted inhibitors. Synovial fluids from RA patients activated the kinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathways JAK, JNK, p38, and MEK in synovial fibroblasts (SFs), a stromal cell type that promotes RA progression. Kinase inhibitors enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing of “off-target” pathways in a manner dependent on stimulatory context. Inhibitors of p38, which have been widely explored in clinical trials for RA, resulted in undesirable increases in nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), JNK, and MEK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing in SFs in inflammatory, but not mitogenic, contexts. This was mediated by the transcription factor CREB, which functions in part within a negative feedback loop in MAPK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing. CREB activation was induced predominately by p38 in response to inflammatory stimuli, but by MEK in response to mitogenic stimuli; hence, the effects of drugs targeting p38 or MEK were markedly different in SFs cultured under mitogenic or inflammatory conditions. Together, these findings illustrate how stimulatory context can alter dominance in pathway cross-talk even for a fixed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> topology, thereby providing a rationale for why p38 inhibitors deliver limited benefits in RA and demonstrating the need for careful consideration of p38-targeted drugs in inflammation-related disorders.</p>

RAF1/BRAF dimerization integrates the signal from RAS to ERK and ROKα
<p>Downstream of growth factor receptors and of the guanine triphosphatase (GTPase) RAS, heterodimers of the serine/threonine kinases BRAF and RAF1 are critical upstream kinases and activators of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>e containing the mitogen-activated and extracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>–regulated kinase kinase (MEK) and their targets, the extracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>–regulated kinase (ERK) family. Either direct or scaffold protein–mediated interactions among the components of the ERK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>e (the MAPKKKs BRAF and RAF1, MEK, and ERK) facilitate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong></span></strong>ion. RAF1 also has essential functions in the control of tumorigenesis and migration that are mediated through its interaction with the kinase ROKα, an effector of the GTPase RHO and regulator of cytoskeletal rearrangements. We combined mutational and kinetic analysis with mathematical modeling to show that the interaction of RAF1 with ROKα is coordinated with the role of RAF1 in the ERK pathway. We found that the phosphorylated form of RAF1 that interacted with and inhibited ROKα was generated during the interaction of RAF1 with the ERK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>e. This mechanism adds plasticity to the ERK pathway, enabling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> diversification at the level of both ERK and RAF. Furthermore, by connecting ERK activation with the regulation of ROKα and cytoskeletal rearrangements by RAF1, this mechanism has the potential to precisely coordinate the proper timing of proliferation with changes in cell shape, adhesion, or motility.</p>

Dampening oncogenic RAS signaling
<p>The control of normal cellular homeostasis is a function of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing by the RAS guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) KRAS, NRAS, and HRAS and their downstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing proteins, such as the RAF kinases (BRAF and CRAF), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (MEK), and extracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>–regulated kinase (ERK), which together constitute the RAS-MAPK pathway (<i>1</i>). This pathway is dysregulated in human diseases, particularly cancer, in which mutations or other nongenetic events hyperactivate the pathway in more than 50% of cases (<i>1</i>). Activating mutations in RAS genes occur in more than 30% of all cancers and seemingly lock RAS into a constitutively active, GTP-bound state to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> autonomously without the need for upstream input (<i>1</i>). Therapeutic suppression of pathogenic RASMAPK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing to maximize disease control in cancer patients remains an elusive goal. Multiple strategies targeting upstream [e.g., receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)] or downstream (e.g., MEK) RAS pathway proteins to limit RAS-GTP–mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing in RAS-MAPK pathway–driven cancers are under evaluation (<i>1</i>–<i>3</i>). However, recent studies have extended our knowledge of how certain forms of oncogenic RAS and other oncogenic MAPK pathway proteins function not in an autonomous manner but instead semiautonomously, such that they still respond to upstream regulation (<i>4</i>–<i>8</i>). These findings reveal mechanisms by which RAS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing is dysregulated in cancer and highlight newly identified therapeutic strategies with the potential to target oncogenic RAS-MAPK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing.</p>

Glutamate signaling at cytoneme synapses
<p>We investigated the roles of components of neuronal synapses for development of the <i>Drosophila</i> air sac primordium (ASP). The ASP, an epithelial tube, extends specialized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing filopodia called cytonemes that take up <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>s such as Dpp (Decapentaplegic, a homolog of the vertebrate bone morphogenetic protein) from the wing imaginal disc. Dpp <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing in the ASP was compromised if disc cells lacked Synaptobrevin and Synaptotagmin-1 (which function in vesicle transport at neuronal synapses), the glutamate transporter, and a voltage-gated calcium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>, or if ASP cells lacked Synaptotagmin-4 or the glutamate receptor GluRII. Transient elevations of intracellular calcium in ASP cytonemes correlate with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing activity. Calcium transients in ASP cells depend on GluRII, are activated by <sc>l</sc>-glutamate and by stimulation of an optogenetic ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> expressed in the wing disc, and are inhibited by EGTA and by the GluR inhibitor NASPM (1-naphthylacetyl spermine trihydrochloride).

An evolutionarily conserved gene family encodes proton-selective ion channels

A Mobile Auxin Signal Connects Temperature Sensing in Cotyledons with Growth Responses in Hypocotyls
<p>Plants have a remarkable capacity to adjust their growth and development to elevated ambient temperatures. Increased elongation growth of roots, hypocotyls, and petioles in warm temperatures are hallmarks of seedling thermomorphogenesis. In the last decade, significant progress has been made to identify the molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing components regulating these growth responses. Increased ambient temperature utilizes diverse components of the light sensing and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> transduction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> to trigger growth adjustments. However, it remains unknown whether temperature sensing and responses are universal processes that occur uniformly in all plant organs. Alternatively, temperature sensing may be confined to specific tissues or organs, which would require a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> that mediates responses in distal parts of the plant. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings show organ-specific transcriptome responses to elevated temperatures and that thermomorphogenesis involves both autonomous and organ-interdependent temperature sensing and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing. Seedling roots can sense and respond to temperature in a shoot-independent manner, whereas shoot temperature responses require both local and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic processes. The induction of cell elongation in hypocotyls requires temperature sensing in cotyledons, followed by the generation of a mobile auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>. Subsequently, auxin travels to the hypocotyl, where it triggers local brassinosteroid-induced cell elongation in seedling stems, which depends upon a distinct, permissive temperature sensor in the hypocotyl.</p>

Both pathways involve leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases acting in shoots and proposed to perceive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing peptides produced in roots depending on soil nutrient availability. In this study, we characterized in the <i>M. truncatula</i> Jemalong A17 genotype a mutant allelic series affecting the Compact Root Architecture2 (CRA2) receptor. These analyses revealed that this pathway acts <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ically from shoots to positively regulate nodulation and is required for the activity of carboxyl-terminally encoded peptides (CEPs).

The Ring-Type E3 Ubiquitin Ligase JUL1 Targets the VQ-Motif Protein JAV1 to Coordinate Jasmonate Signaling
<p>Jasmonates regulate plant defense and development. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), JASMONATE-ASSOCIATED VQ-MOTIF GENE1 (JAV1/VQ22) is a repressor of jasmonate-mediated defense responses and is degraded through the ubiquitin<i>-</i>26S proteasome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> after herbivory. We found that JAV1-ASSOCIATED UBIQUITIN LIGASE1 (JUL1), a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, interacted with JAV1. JUL1 interacted with JAV1 in the nucleus to ubiquitinate JAV1, leading to proteasomal degradation of JAV1. The transcript levels of <i>JUL1</i> and <i>JAV1</i> were coordinately and positively regulated by the CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathway in the jasmonate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>, but in a manner that was not dependent on CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing upon herbivory by <i>Spodoptera litura</i>.

This common regulator can explain why perturbation of the mitochondrial function leads to transcriptomic responses overlapping with responses to biotic stress.</p>

Quartet-Net: A Quartet-Based Method to Reconstruct Phylogenetic Networks
<p>Phylogenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s can model reticulate evolutionary events such as hybridization, recombination, and horizontal gene transfer. However, reconstructing such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s is not trivial. Popular character-based methods are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ationally inefficient, whereas distance-based methods cannot guarantee reconstruction accuracy because pairwise genetic distances only reflect partial information about a reticulate phylogeny. To balance accuracy and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ational efficiency, here we introduce a quartet-based method to construct a phylogenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> from a multiple sequence alignment. Unlike distances that only reflect the relationship between a pair of taxa, quartets contain information on the relationships among four taxa; these quartets provide adequate capacity to infer a more accurate phylogenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>. In applications to simulated and biological data sets, we demonstrate that this novel method is robust and effective in reconstructing reticulate evolutionary events and it has the potential to infer more accurate phylogenetic distances than other conventional phylogenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> construction methods such as Neighbor-Joining, Neighbor-Net, and Split Decomposition. This method can be used in constructing phylogenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s from simple evolutionary events involving a few reticulate events to complex evolutionary histories involving a large number of reticulate events.

In human and mammalian models, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MYD88) is known for its central role as an adaptor molecule in interleukin 1 receptor (IL-1R) and TLR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing. The zebrafish is increasingly used as a complementary model <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> for disease research and drug screening. Here, we describe a zebrafish line with a truncated version of MyD88 as the first zebrafish mutant for a TLR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing component. We show that this immune-compromised mutant has a lower survival rate under standard rearing conditions and is more susceptible to challenge with the acute bacterial pathogens <i>Edwardsiella tarda</i> and <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>. Microarray and quantitative PCR analysis revealed that expression of genes for transcription factors central to innate immunity (including NF-ĸB and AP-1) and the pro-inflammatory cytokine Il1b, is dependent on MyD88 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing during these bacterial infections. Nevertheless, expression of immune genes independent of MyD88 in the <i>myd88</i> mutant line was sufficient to limit growth of an attenuated <i>S. typhimurium</i> strain. In the case of infection with the chronic bacterial pathogen <i>Mycobacterium marinum</i>, we show that MyD88 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing has an important protective role during early pathogenesis. During mycobacterial infection, the <i>myd88</i> mutant shows accelerated formation of granuloma-like aggregates and increased bacterial burden, with associated lower induction of genes central to innate immunity. This zebrafish <i>myd88</i> mutant will be a valuable tool for further study of the role of IL1R and TLR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing in the innate immunity processes underlying infectious diseases, inflammatory disorders and cancer.</p>

Endothelial Dab1 signaling orchestrates neuro-glia-vessel communication in the central nervous system
<p>The architecture of the neurovascular unit (NVU) is controlled by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong></span></strong>ation of neurons, glia, and vascular cells. We found that the neuronal guidance cue reelin possesses proangiogenic activities that ensure the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong></span></strong>ation of endothelial cells (ECs) with the glia to control neuronal migration and the establishment of the blood-brain barrier in the mouse brain. Apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2) and Disabled1 (Dab1) expressed in ECs are required for vascularization of the retina and the cerebral cortex. Deletion of Dab1 in ECs leads to a reduced secretion of laminin-α4 and decreased activation of integrin-β1 in glial cells, which in turn control neuronal migration and barrier properties of the NVU. Thus, reelin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing in the endothelium is an instructive and integrative cue essential for neuro-glia-vascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong></span></strong>ation.</p>

In vivo brain GPCR signaling elucidated by phosphoproteomics
<p>A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s view of G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing in its native environment is central to the development of GPCR therapeutics with fewer side effects. Using the kappa opioid receptor (KOR) as a model, we employed high-throughput phosphoproteomics to investigate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing induced by structurally diverse agonists in five mouse brain regions. Quantification of 50,000 different phosphosites provided a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s view of KOR in vivo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing, revealing novel mechanisms of drug action. Thus, we discovered enrichment of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway by U-50,488H, an agonist causing aversion, which is a typical KOR-mediated side effect. Consequently, mTOR inhibition during KOR activation abolished aversion while preserving beneficial antinociceptive and anticonvulsant effects. Our results establish high-throughput phosphoproteomics as a general strategy to investigate GPCR in vivo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing, enabling prediction and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ation of behavioral outcomes.</p>

Harmful networks in the brain and beyond
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong></span></strong>ation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s is the basis of many social and biological functions.

In several malignancies such as incurable brain tumors, long protrusions extend from cancer cells, connecting them to a functional syncytium and colonizing normal tissue.

Systematic discovery of antiphage defense systems in the microbial pangenome
<p>The arms race between bacteria and phages led to the development of sophisticated antiphage defense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s, including CRISPR-Cas and restriction-modification <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. Evidence suggests that known and unknown defense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s are located in “defense islands” in microbial genomes. Here, we comprehensively characterized the bacterial defensive arsenal by examining gene families that are clustered next to known defense genes in prokaryotic genomes. Candidate defense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>atically engineered and validated in model bacteria for their antiphage activities. We report nine previously unknown antiphage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s and one antiplasmid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> that are widespread in microbes and strongly protect against foreign invaders. These include <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s that adopted components of the bacterial flagella and condensin complexes. Our data also suggest a common, ancient ancestry of innate immunity components shared between animals, plants, and bacteria.</p>

All-printed thin-film transistors from networks of liquid-exfoliated nanosheets
<p>All-printed transistors consisting of interconnected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s of various types of two-dimensional nanosheets are an important goal in nanoscience. Using electrolytic gating, we demonstrate all-printed, vertically stacked transistors with graphene source, drain, and gate electrodes, a transition metal dichalcogenide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>, and a boron nitride (BN) separator, all formed from nanosheet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s. The BN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> contains an ionic liquid within its porous interior that allows electrolytic gating in a solid-like structure. Nanosheet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s display on:off ratios of up to 600, transconductances exceeding 5 millisiemens, and mobilities of >0.1 square centimeters per volt per second. Unusually, the on-currents scaled with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> thickness and volumetric capacitance. In contrast to other devices with comparable mobility, large capacitances, while hindering switching speeds, allow these devices to carry higher currents at relatively low drive voltages.</p>

Plasticity in the Neurotransmitter Repertoire
<p>In the earliest days of neuroscience, it was thought that a neuron made and released only a single chemical, known as a neuro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmitt</span></strong>er, to send a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> across a synapse to an adjacent neuron (<i>1</i>). At the same time, it was deeply mysterious why so many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing molecules were used in nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. Subsequently, it became clear that many, if not most, neurons (including those in mammals) make and release two or more neuro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmitt</span></strong>ers including small-molecules and neuropeptides (<i>2</i>–<i>4</i>). As the list of these potential co<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmitt</span></strong>ers and their receptors has increased, we are faced with understanding the functional relevance of this embarrassment of riches for neural circuits and behavior. Neuro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmitt</span></strong>ers and neuro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ators (substances often released with small-molecule neuro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmitt</span></strong>ers) can elicit a variety of different actions on their neuron targets, including directly opening ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s or acting through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> transduction pathways to alter neuronal excitability or synaptic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion. Thus, characterizing the mixture of co<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmitt</span></strong>ers released by a neuron is important for understanding how neuronal circuits operate. The mechanisms that change the profile of neuro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmitt</span></strong>er release provide opportunities for plastic changes in circuit function, and consequently in organism behavior. On page 449 of this issue, Dulcis <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) report changes in the neuro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmitt</span></strong>er profile of neurons that underlie photoperiod-triggered changes in animal behavior. The findings argue that neuro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmitt</span></strong>er switching is a new mechanism for neuroplasticity (<i>6</i>) in adult nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s.</p>

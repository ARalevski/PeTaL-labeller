Heterogeneous to homogeneous melting transition visualized with ultrafast electron diffraction
<p>The ultrafast laser excitation of matters leads to nonequilibrium states with complex solid-liquid phase-transition dynamics. We used electron diffraction at mega–electron volt energies to visualize the ultrafast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>ing of gold on the atomic scale length. For energy densities approaching the irreversible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>ing regime, we first observed heterogeneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>ing on time scales of 100 to 1000 picoseconds, transitioning to homogeneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>ing that occurs catastrophically within 10 to 20 picoseconds at higher energy densities. We showed evidence for the heterogeneous coexistence of solid and liquid. We determined the ion and electron temperature evolution and found superheated conditions. Our results constrain the electron-ion coupling rate, determine the Debye temperature, and reveal the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>ing sensitivity to nucleation seeds.</p>

Signatures of exciton condensation in a transition metal dichalcogenide
<p>Bose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ation has shaped our understanding of macroscopic quantum phenomena, having been realized in superconductors, atomic gases, and liquid helium. Excitons are bosons that have been predicted to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>e into either a superfluid or an insulating electronic crystal. Using the recently developed technique of momentum‐resolved electron energy‐loss spectroscopy (M-EELS), we studied electronic collective modes in the transition metal dichalcogenide semimetal 1<i>T</i>‐TiSe<sub>2</sub>. Near the phase-transition temperature (190 kelvin), the energy of the electronic mode fell to zero at nonzero momentum, indicating dynamical slowing of plasma fluctuations and crystallization of the valence electrons into an exciton <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ate. Our study provides compelling evidence for exciton <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ation in a three-dimensional solid and establishes M-EELS as a versatile technique sensitive to valence band excitations in quantum materials.</p>

Universal space-time scaling symmetry in the dynamics of bosons across a quantum phase transition
<p>The dynamics of many-body systems spanning <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ed matter, cosmology, and beyond are hypothesized to be universal when the systems cross continuous phase transitions. The universal dynamics are expected to satisfy a scaling symmetry of space and time with the crossing rate, inspired by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. We test this symmetry based on Bose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ates in a shaken optical lattice. Shaking the lattice drives <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ates across an effectively ferromagnetic quantum phase transition. After crossing the critical point, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ates manifest delayed growth of spin fluctuations and develop antiferromagnetic spatial correlations resulting from the sub-Poisson distribution of the spacing between topological defects. The fluctuations and correlations are invariant in scaled space-time coordinates, in support of the scaling symmetry of quantum critical dynamics.</p>

Melting of Iron at Earth’s Inner Core Boundary Based on Fast X-ray Diffraction
<sec><title>Hot Enough to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong> Iron</title><p>Earth's core is divided into a fluid outer core and a solid inner core, both composed predominately of iron at extremely high pressures and temperatures.

Stoichiometry controls activity of phase-separated clusters of actin signaling proteins
<p>Biomolecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ates concentrate macromolecules into foci without a surrounding membrane. Many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ates appear to form through multivalent interactions that drive liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). LLPS increases the specific activity of actin regulatory proteins toward actin assembly by the Arp2/3 complex. We show that this increase occurs because LLPS of the Nephrin–Nck–N-WASP signaling pathway on lipid bilayers increases membrane dwell time of N-WASP and Arp2/3 complex, consequently increasing actin assembly. Dwell time varies with relative stoichiometry of the signaling proteins in the phase-separated clusters, rendering N-WASP and Arp2/3 activity stoichiometry dependent. This mechanism of controlling protein activity is enabled by the stoichiometrically undefined nature of biomolecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ates. Such regulation should be a general feature of signaling systems that assemble through multivalent interactions and drive nonequilibrium outputs.</p>

Coactivator condensation at super-enhancers links phase separation and gene control
<p>Super-enhancers (SEs) are clusters of enhancers that cooperatively assemble a high density of the transcriptional apparatus to drive robust expression of genes with prominent roles in cell identity. Here we demonstrate that the SE-enriched transcriptional coactivators BRD4 and MED1 form nuclear puncta at SEs that exhibit properties of liquid-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ates and are disrupted by chemicals that perturb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ates. The intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of BRD4 and MED1 can form phase-separated droplets, and MED1-IDR droplets can compartmentalize and concentrate the transcription apparatus from nuclear extracts. These results support the idea that coactivators form phase-separated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ates at SEs that compartmentalize and concentrate the transcription apparatus, suggest a role for coactivator IDRs in this process, and offer insights into mechanisms involved in the control of key cell-identity genes.</p>

Inflammation boosts bacteriophage transfer between <i>Salmonella</i> spp.
<p>Bacteriophage transfer (lysogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion) promotes bacterial virulence evolution. There is limited understanding of the factors that determine lysogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion dynamics within infected hosts. A murine <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium (<i>S</i>.Tm) diarrhea model was used to study the transfer of SopEΦ, a prophage from <i>S</i>.Tm SL1344, to <i>S</i>.Tm ATCC14028S. Gut inflammation and enteric disease triggered >55% lysogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion of ATCC14028S within 3 days. Without inflammation, SopEΦ transfer was reduced by up to 10<sup>5</sup>-fold. This was because inflammation (e.g., reactive oxygen species, reactive nitrogen species, hypochlorite) triggers the bacterial SOS response, boosts expression of the phage antirepressor Tum, and thereby promotes free phage production and subsequent transfer. Mucosal vaccination prevented a dense intestinal <i>S</i>.Tm population from inducing inflammation and consequently abolished SopEΦ transfer. Vaccination may be a general strategy for blocking pathogen evolution that requires disease-driven transfer of temperate bacteriophages.</p>

Melting of subducted basalt at the core-mantle boundary
<p>The geological materials in Earth's lowermost mantle control the characteristics and interpretation of seismic ultra–low velocity zones at the base of the core-mantle boundary. Partial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>ing of the bulk lower mantle is often advocated as the cause, but this does not explain the nonubiquitous character of these regional seismic features. We explored the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>ing properties of mid-oceanic ridge basalt (MORB), which can reach the lowermost mantle after subduction of oceanic crust. At a pressure representative of the core-mantle boundary (135 gigapascals), the onset of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>ing occurs at ~3800 kelvin, which is ~350 kelvin below the mantle solidus. The SiO<sub>2</sub>-rich liquid generated either remains trapped in the MORB material or solidifies after reacting with the surrounding MgO-rich mantle, remixing subducted MORB with the lowermost mantle.</p>

SOX17 Regulates Conversion of Human Fibroblasts Into Endothelial Cells and Erythroblasts by Dedifferentiation Into CD34<sup>+</sup> Progenitor Cells
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The mechanisms underlying the dedifferentiation and lineage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion of adult human fibroblasts into functional endothelial cells have not yet been fully defined. Furthermore, it is not known whether fibroblast dedifferentiation recapitulates the generation of multipotent progenitors during embryonic development, which give rise to endothelial and hematopoietic cell lineages. Here we established the role of the developmental transcription factor SOX17 in regulating the bilineage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion of fibroblasts by the generation of intermediate progenitors.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>CD34<sup>+</sup> progenitors were generated after the dedifferentiation of human adult dermal fibroblasts by overexpression of pluripotency transcription factors.

The therapeutic potential of the generated cells was assessed in an experimental model of myocardial infarction.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Induced endothelial cells expressed specific endothelial cell surface markers and also exhibited the capacity for cell proliferation and neovascularization. Induced erythroblasts expressed erythroid surface markers and formed erythroid colonies. Endothelial lineage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion was dependent on the upregulation of the developmental transcription factor SOX17, whereas suppression of SOX17 instead directed the cells toward an erythroid fate. Implantation of these human bipotential CD34<sup>+</sup> progenitors into nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD-SCID) mice resulted in the formation of microvessels derived from human fibroblasts perfused with mouse and human erythrocytes. Endothelial cells generated from human fibroblasts also showed upregulation of telomerase.

Classifying drivers of global forest loss
<p>Global maps of forest loss depict the scale and magnitude of forest disturbance, yet companies, governments, and nongovernmental organizations need to distinguish permanent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion (i.e., deforestation) from temporary loss from forestry or wildfire. Using satellite imagery, we developed a forest loss classification model to determine a spatial attribution of forest disturbance to the dominant drivers of land cover and land use change over the period 2001 to 2015. Our results indicate that 27% of global forest loss can be attributed to deforestation through permanent land use change for commodity production. The remaining areas maintained the same land use over 15 years; in those areas, loss was attributed to forestry (26%), shifting agriculture (24%), and wildfire (23%). Despite corporate commitments, the rate of commodity-driven deforestation has not declined. To end deforestation, companies must eliminate 5 million hectares of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion from supply chains each year.</p>

Phase changes in neurotransmission
<p>Clusters of synaptic vesicles (SVs) are distinctive features of axon terminals in neurons. SVs contain neurotransmitters that are released upon electrical activity. The discovery of SVs as defined packages of neurotransmitters provided the molecular basis for the quantized theory of synaptic transmission in discrete units of information (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). It has remained enigmatic what holds these vesicles together in clusters. On page 604 of this issue, Milovanovic <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) show that synapsin 1, a protein that is essential for SV cluster formation, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>es into liquid droplets in vitro.

Mediator and RNA polymerase II clusters associate in transcription-dependent condensates
<p>Models of gene control have emerged from genetic and biochemical studies, with limited consideration of the spatial organization and dynamics of key components in living cells. We used live-cell superresolution and light-sheet imaging to study the organization and dynamics of the Mediator coactivator and RNA polymerase II (Pol II) directly. Mediator and Pol II each form small transient and large stable clusters in living embryonic stem cells. Mediator and Pol II are colocalized in the stable clusters, which associate with chromatin, have properties of phase-separated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ates, and are sensitive to transcriptional inhibitors. We suggest that large clusters of Mediator, recruited by transcription factors at large or clustered enhancer elements, interact with large Pol II clusters in transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ates in vivo.</p>

Atmospheric new particle formation from sulfuric acid and amines in a Chinese megacity
<p>Atmospheric new particle formation (NPF) is an important global phenomenon that is nevertheless sensitive to ambient conditions. According to both observation and theoretical arguments, NPF usually requires a relatively high sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) concentration to promote the formation of new particles and a low preexisting aerosol loading to minimize the sink of new particles. We investigated NPF in Shanghai and were able to observe both precursor vapors (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) and initial clusters at a molecular level in a megacity. High NPF rates were observed to coincide with several familiar markers suggestive of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>–dimethylamine (DMA)–water (H<sub>2</sub>O) nucleation, including sulfuric acid dimers and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>-DMA clusters. In a cluster kinetics simulation, the observed concentration of sulfuric acid was high enough to explain the particle growth to ~3 nanometers under the very high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ation sink, whereas the subsequent higher growth rate beyond this size is believed to result from the added contribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ing organic species. These findings will help in understanding urban NPF and its air quality and climate effects, as well as in formulating policies to mitigate secondary particle formation in China.</p>

3D charge and 2D phonon transports leading to high out-of-plane <i>ZT</i> in n-type SnSe crystals
<p>Thermoelectric technology enables the harvest of waste heat and its direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion into electricity. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion efficiency is determined by the materials figure of merit <i>ZT</i>. Here we show a maximum <i>ZT</i> of ~2.8 ± 0.5 at 773 kelvin in n-type tin selenide (SnSe) crystals out of plane. The thermal conductivity in layered SnSe crystals is the lowest in the out-of-plane direction [two-dimensional (2D) phonon transport]. We doped SnSe with bromine to make n-type SnSe crystals with the overlapping interlayer charge density (3D charge transport). A continuous phase transition increases the symmetry and diverges two converged conduction bands. These two factors improve carrier mobility, while preserving a large Seebeck coefficient. Our findings can be applied in 2D layered materials and provide a new strategy to enhance out-of-plane electrical transport properties without degrading thermal properties.</p>

GDV1 induces sexual commitment of malaria parasites by antagonizing HP1-dependent gene silencing
<p>Malaria is caused by <i>Plasmodium</i> parasites that proliferate in the bloodstream. During each replication cycle, some parasites differentiate into gametocytes, the only forms able to infect the mosquito vector and transmit malaria. Sexual commitment is triggered by activation of AP2-G, the master transcriptional regulator of gametocytogenesis. Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1)–dependent silencing of <i>ap2-g</i> prevents sexual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion in proliferating parasites. In this study, we identified <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> gametocyte development 1 (GDV1) as an upstream activator of sexual commitment. We found that GDV1 targeted heterochromatin and triggered HP1 eviction, thus derepressing <i>ap2-g</i>. Expression of GDV1 was responsive to environmental triggers of sexual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion and controlled via a <i>gdv1</i> antisense RNA. Hence, GDV1 appears to act as an effector protein that induces sexual differentiation by antagonizing HP1-dependent gene silencing.</p>

RNA polymerase motions during promoter melting
<p>All cellular RNA polymerases (RNAPs), from those of bacteria to those of man, possess a clamp that can open and close, and it has been assumed that the open RNAP separates promoter DNA strands and then closes to establish a tight grip on the DNA template. Here, we resolve successive motions of the initiating bacterial RNAP by studying real-time signatures of fluorescent reporters placed on RNAP and DNA in the presence of ligands locking the clamp in distinct conformations. We report evidence for an unexpected and obligatory step early in the initiation involving a transient clamp closure as a prerequisite for DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>ing.

Reovirus infection triggers inflammatory responses to dietary antigens and development of celiac disease
<p>Viral infections have been proposed to elicit pathological processes leading to the initiation of T helper 1 (T<sub>H</sub>1) immunity against dietary gluten and celiac disease (CeD). To test this hypothesis and gain insights into mechanisms underlying virus-induced loss of tolerance to dietary antigens, we developed a viral infection model that makes use of two reovirus strains that infect the intestine but differ in their immunopathological outcomes. Reovirus is an avirulent pathogen that elicits protective immunity, but we discovered that it can nonetheless disrupt intestinal immune homeostasis at inductive and effector sites of oral tolerance by suppressing peripheral regulatory T cell (pT<sub>reg</sub>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion and promoting T<sub>H</sub>1 immunity to dietary antigen. Initiation of T<sub>H</sub>1 immunity to dietary antigen was dependent on interferon regulatory factor 1 and dissociated from suppression of pT<sub>reg</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion, which was mediated by type-1 interferon. Last, our study in humans supports a role for infection with reovirus, a seemingly innocuous virus, in triggering the development of CeD.</p>

Experimental constraints on the damp peridotite solidus and oceanic mantle potential temperature

The oceanic upper mantle contains ~50 to 200 micrograms per gram of water (H<sub>2</sub>O) dissolved in nominally anhydrous minerals, which—relative to its low concentration—has a disproportionate effect on the solidus that has not been quantified experimentally. Here, we present results from an experimental determination of the peridotite solidus containing known amounts of dissolved hydrogen.

Reconciling geophysical observations of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>ing regime beneath the East Pacific Rise with our experimental results requires that existing estimates for the oceanic upper mantle potential temperature be adjusted upward by about 60°C.</p>

Deterministic entanglement generation from driving through quantum phase transitions
<p>Many-body entanglement is often created through the system evolution, aided by nonlinear interactions between the constituting particles. These very dynamics, however, can also lead to fluctuations and degradation of the entanglement if the interactions cannot be controlled. Here, we demonstrate near-deterministic generation of an entangled twin-Fock <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ate of ~11,000 atoms by driving a<sub> </sub>arubidium-87 Bose-Einstein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ate undergoing spin mixing through two consecutive quantum phase transitions (QPTs). We directly observe number squeezing of 10.7 ± 0.6 decibels and normalized collective spin length of 0.99 ± 0.01. Together, these observations allow us to infer an entanglement-enhanced phase sensitivity of ~6 decibels beyond the standard quantum limit and an entanglement breadth of ~910 atoms. Our work highlights the power of generating large-scale useful entanglement by taking advantage of the different entanglement landscapes separated by QPTs.</p>

PCC 6803 (<i>Synechocystis</i> 6803) as the starting point encompassing 593 reactions. The flux elucidation revealed nearly complete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion (greater than 96%) of the assimilated carbon into biomass in <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973. In contrast, <i>Synechocystis</i> 6803 achieves complete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion of only 86% of the assimilated carbon. This high biomass yield was enabled by the reincorporation of the fixed carbons lost in anabolic and photorespiratory pathways in conjunction with flux rerouting through a nondecarboxylating reaction such as phosphoketolase. This reincorporation of lost CO<sub>2</sub> sustains a higher flux through the photorespiratory C2 cycle that fully meets the glycine and serine demands for growth. In accordance with the high carbon efficiency drive, acetyl-coenzyme A was entirely produced using the carbon-efficient phosphoketolase pathway. Comparison of the <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973 flux map with that of <i>Synechocystis</i> 6803 revealed differences in the use of Calvin cycle and photorespiratory pathway reactions. The two species used different reactions for the synthesis of metabolites such as fructose-6-phosphate, glycine, sedoheptulose-7-phosphate, and Ser. These findings allude to a highly carbon-efficient metabolism alongside the fast carbon uptake rate in <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973, which explains its faster growth rate.</p>

Reconfigured Cyanogenic Glucoside Biosynthesis in <i>Eucalyptus cladocalyx</i> Involves a Cytochrome P450 CYP706C55
<p>Cyanogenic glucosides are a class of specialized metabolites widespread in the plant kingdom. Cyanogenic glucosides are α-hydroxynitriles, and their hydrolysis releases toxic hydrogen cyanide, providing an effective chemical defense against herbivores. <i>Eucalyptus cladocalyx</i> is a cyanogenic tree, allocating up to 20% of leaf nitrogen to the biosynthesis of the cyanogenic monoglucoside, prunasin. Here, mass spectrometry analyses of <i>E. cladocalyx</i> tissues revealed spatial and ontogenetic variations in prunasin content, as well as the presence of the cyanogenic diglucoside amygdalin in flower buds and flowers. The identification and biochemical characterization of the prunasin biosynthetic enzymes revealed a unique enzyme configuration for prunasin production in <i>E. cladocalyx</i>. This result indicates that a multifunctional cytochrome P450 (CYP), CYP79A125, catalyzes the initial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion of <sc>l</sc>-phenylalanine into its corresponding aldoxime, phenylacetaldoxime; a function consistent with other members of the CYP79 family. In contrast to the single multifunctional CYP known from other plant species, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion of phenylacetaldoxime to the α-hydroxynitrile, mandelonitrile, is catalyzed by two distinct CYPs. CYP706C55 catalyzes the dehydration of phenylacetaldoxime, an unusual CYP reaction. The resulting phenylacetonitrile is subsequently hydroxylatedby CYP71B103 to form mandelonitrile. The final glucosylation step to yield prunasin is catalyzed by a UDP-glucosyltransferase, UGT85A59. Members of the CYP706 family have not been reported previously to participate in the biosynthesis of cyanogenic glucosides, and the pathway structure in <i>E. cladocalyx</i> represents an example of convergent evolution in the biosynthesis of cyanogenic glucosides in plants.</p>

DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE and DIACYLGLYCEROL KINASE Modulate Triacylglycerol and Phosphatidic Acid Production in the Plant Response to Freezing Stress
<p>Plants accumulate the lipids phosphatidic acid (PA), diacylglycerol (DAG), and triacylglycerol (TAG) during cold stress, but how plants balance the levels of these lipids to mediate cold responses remains unknown. The enzymes ACYL-COENZYME A:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE (DGAT) and DIACYLGLYCEROL KINASE (DGK) catalyze the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion of DAG to TAG and PA, respectively. Here, we show that DGAT1, DGK2, DGK3, and DGK5 contribute to the response to cold in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). With or without cold acclimation, the <i>dgat1</i> mutants exhibited higher sensitivity upon freezing exposure compared with the wild type. Under cold conditions, the <i>dgat1</i> mutants showed reduced expression of <i>C-REPEAT/DRE BINDING FACTOR2</i> and its regulons, which are essential for the acquisition of cold tolerance. Lipid profiling revealed that freezing significantly increased the levels of PA and DAG while decreasing TAG in the rosettes of <i>dgat1</i> mutant plants. During freezing stress, the accumulation of PA in <i>dgat1</i> plants stimulated NADPH oxidase activity and enhanced RbohD-dependent hydrogen peroxide production compared with the wild type. Moreover, the cold-inducible transcripts of <i>DGK2</i>, <i>DGK3</i>, and <i>DGK5</i> were significantly more up-regulated in the <i>dgat1</i> mutants than in the wild type during cold stress. Consistent with this observation, <i>dgk2</i>, <i>dgk3</i>, and <i>dgk5</i> knockout mutants showed improved tolerance and attenuated PA production in response to freezing temperatures. Our findings demonstrate that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion of DAG to TAG by <i>DGAT1</i> is critical for plant freezing tolerance, acting by balancing TAG and PA production in Arabidopsis.</p>

Phospholipase Dζ Enhances Diacylglycerol Flux into Triacylglycerol<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plant seeds are the primary source of triacylglycerols (TAG) for food, feed, fuel, and industrial applications. As TAG is produced from diacylglycerol (DAG), successful engineering strategies to enhance TAG levels have focused on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion of DAG to TAG. However, the production of TAG can be limited by flux through the enzymatic reactions that supply DAG. In this study, two <i>Arabidopsis phospholipase D</i><sub>ζ</sub> genes (<i>AtPLD<sub>ζ1</sub></i> and <i>AtPLD<sub>ζ2</sub></i>) were coexpressed in <i>Camelina sativa</i> to test whether the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion of phosphatidylcholine to DAG impacts TAG levels in seeds. The resulting transgenic plants produced 2% to 3% more TAG as a component of total seed biomass and had increased 18:3 and 20:1 fatty acid levels relative to wild type. Increased DAG and decreased PC levels were examined through the kinetics of lipid assembly by [<sup>14</sup>C]acetate and [<sup>14</sup>C]glycerol incorporation into glycerolipids. [<sup>14</sup>C]acetate was rapidly incorporated into TAG in both wild-type and overexpression lines, indicating a significant flux of nascent and elongated acyl-CoAs into the <i>sn</i>-3 position of TAG. Stereochemical analysis revealed that newly synthesized fatty acids were preferentially incorporated into the <i>sn</i>-2 position of PC, but the <i>sn</i>-1 position of de novo DAG and indicated similar rates of nascent acyl groups into the Kennedy pathway and acyl editing. [<sup>14</sup>C]glycerol studies demonstrated PC-derived DAG is the major source of DAG for TAG synthesis in both tissues. The results emphasize that the inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ions of DAG and PC pools can impact oil production and composition.</p>

Seasonal accumulation of acetylated triacylglycerols by a freeze-tolerant insect
<p>Most animals store energy as long-chain triacylglycerols (lcTAGs). Trace amounts of acetylated triacylglycerols (acTAGs) have been reported in animals, but are not accumulated, likely because they have lower energy density than lcTAGs. Here we report that acTAGs comprise 36% of the neutral lipid pool of overwintering prepupae of the goldenrod gall fly, <i>Eurosta solidaginis</i>, while only 17% of the neutral lipid pool is made up of typical lcTAGs. These high concentrations of acTAGs, present only during winter, appear to be synthesized by <i>E. solidaginis</i> and are not found in other freeze-tolerant insects, nor in the plant host. The mixture of acTAGs found in <i>E. solidaginis</i> has a significantly lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>ing point than equivalent lcTAGs, and thus remains liquid at temperatures at which <i>E. solidaginis</i> is frozen in the field, and depresses the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>ing point of aqueous solutions in a manner unusual for neutral lipids. We note that accumulation of acTAGs coincides with preparation for overwintering and the seasonal acquisition of freeze tolerance. This is the first observation of accumulation of acTAGs by an animal, and the first evidence of dynamic inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion between acTAGs and lcTAGs during development and in response to stress.</p>

Ventricular Fibrillation Conversion Testing After Implantation of a Subcutaneous Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Compared with transvenous implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), subcutaneous (S)-ICDs require a higher energy for effective defibrillation.

Moderate excess of pyruvate augments osteoclastogenesis
<p>Cell differentiation leads to adaptive changes in energy metabolism. Conversely, hyperglycemia induces malfunction of many body systems, including bone, suggesting that energy metabolism reciprocally affects cell differentiation. We investigated how the differentiation of bone-resorbing osteoclasts, large polykaryons formed through fusion and growth of cells of monocytic origin, is affected by excess of energy substrate pyruvate and how energy metabolism changes during osteoclast differentiation. Surprisingly, small increases in pyruvate (1–2 mM above basal levels) augmented osteoclastogenesis <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, while larger increases were not effective <i>in vitro</i>. Osteoclast differentiation increased cell mitochondrial activity and ATP levels, which were further augmented in energy-rich conditions. Conversely, the inhibition of respiration significantly reduced osteoclast number and size. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) acts as a metabolic sensor, which is inhibited in energy-rich conditions. We found that osteoclast differentiation was associated with an increase in AMPK levels and a change in AMPK isoform composition. Increased osteoclast size induced by pyruvate (1 mM above basal levels) was prevented in the presence of AMPK activator 5-amino-4-imidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR). In keeping, inhibition of AMPK using dorsomorphin or siRNA to AMPKγ increased osteoclast size in control cultures to the level observed in the presence of pyruvate. Thus, we have found that a moderate excess of pyruvate enhances osteoclastogenesis, and that AMPK acts to tailor osteoclastogenesis to a cell's bioenergetics capacity.</p>

Gametophyte Development Needs Mitochondrial Coproporphyrinogen III Oxidase Function
<p>Tetrapyrrole biosynthesis is one of the most essential metabolic pathways in almost all organisms. Coproporphyrinogen III oxidase (CPO) catalyzes the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion of coproporphyrinogen III into protoporphyrinogen IX in this pathway. Here, we report that mutation in the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) CPO-coding gene <i>At5g63290</i> (<i>AtHEMN1</i>) adversely affects silique length, ovule number, and seed set. <i>Athemn1</i> mutant alleles were transmitted via both male and female gametes, but homozygous mutants were never recovered. Plants carrying <i>Athemn1</i> mutant alleles showed defects in gametophyte development, including nonviable pollen and embryo sacs with unfused polar nuclei. Improper differentiation of the central cell led to defects in endosperm development. Consequently, embryo development was arrested at the globular stage. The mutant phenotype was completely rescued by transgenic expression of <i>AtHEMN1</i>. Promoter and transcript analyses indicated that <i>AtHEMN1</i> is expressed mainly in floral tissues and developing seeds. AtHEMN1-green fluorescent protein fusion protein was found targeted to mitochondria. Loss of <i>AtHEMN1</i> function increased coproporphyrinogen III level and reduced protoporphyrinogen IX level, suggesting the impairment of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis. Blockage of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis in the <i>AtHEMN1</i> mutant led to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation in anthers and embryo sacs, as evidenced by nitroblue tetrazolium staining. Our results suggest that the accumulated ROS disrupts mitochondrial function by altering their membrane polarity in floral tissues. This study highlights the role of mitochondrial ROS homeostasis in gametophyte and seed development and sheds new light on tetrapyrrole/heme biosynthesis in plant mitochondria.</p>

Chloroplast Preproteins Bind to the Dimer Interface of the Toc159 Receptor during Import
<p>Most chloroplast proteins are synthesized in the cytosol as higher molecular weight preproteins and imported via the translocons in the outer (TOC) and inner (TIC) envelope membranes of chloroplasts. Toc159 functions as a primary receptor and directly binds preproteins through its dimeric GTPase domain. As a first step toward a molecular understanding of how Toc159 mediates preprotein import, we mapped the preprotein-binding regions on the Toc159 GTPase domain (Toc159G) of pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) using cleavage by bound preproteins conjugated with the artificial protease FeBABE and cysteine-cysteine cross-linking. Our results show that residues at the dimer interface and the switch II region of Toc159G are in close proximity to preproteins. The mature portion of preproteins was observed preferentially at the dimer interface, whereas the transit peptide was found at both regions equally. Chloroplasts from transgenic plants expressing engineered Toc159 with a cysteine placed at the dimer interface showed increased cross-linking to bound preproteins. Our data suggest that, during preprotein import, the Toc159G dimer disengages and the dimer interface contacts translocating preproteins, which is consistent with a model in which conformational changes induced by dimer-monomer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion in Toc159 play a direct role in facilitating preprotein import.</p>

Glycerolipid Characterization and Nutrient Deprivation-Associated Changes in the Green Picoalga <i>Ostreococcus tauri</i>
<p>The picoalga <i>Ostreococcus tauri</i> is a minimal photosynthetic eukaryote that has been used as a model system. <i>O. tauri</i> is known to efficiently produce docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). We provide a comprehensive study of the glycerolipidome of <i>O. tauri</i> and validate this species as model for related picoeukaryotes. <i>O. tauri</i> lipids displayed unique features that combined traits from the green and the chromalveolate lineages. The betaine lipid diacylglyceryl-hydroxymethyl-trimethyl-β-alanine and phosphatidyldimethylpropanethiol, both hallmarks of chromalveolates, were identified as presumed extraplastidial lipids. DHA was confined to these lipids, while plastidial lipids of prokaryotic type were characterized by the overwhelming presence of ω-3 C18 polyunsaturated fatty acids (FAs), 18:5 being restricted to galactolipids. C16:4, an FA typical of green microalgae galactolipids, also was a major component of <i>O. tauri</i> extraplastidial lipids, while the 16:4-coenzyme A (CoA) species was not detected. Triacylglycerols (TAGs) displayed the complete panel of FAs, and many species exhibited combinations of FAs diagnostic for plastidial and extraplastidial lipids. Importantly, under nutrient deprivation, 16:4 and ω-3 C18 polyunsaturated FAs accumulated into de novo synthesized TAGs while DHA-TAG species remained rather stable, indicating an increased contribution of FAs of plastidial origin to TAG synthesis. Nutrient deprivation further severely down-regulated the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion of 18:3 to 18:4, resulting in obvious inversion of the 18:3/18:4 ratio in plastidial lipids, TAGs, as well as acyl-CoAs. The fine-tuned and dynamic regulation of the 18:3/18:4 ratio suggested an important physiological role of these FAs in photosynthetic membranes. Acyl position in structural and storage lipids together with acyl-CoA analysis further help to determine mechanisms possibly involved in glycerolipid synthesis.</p>

The Sites of Evaporation within Leaves
<p>The sites of evaporation within leaves are unknown, but they have drawn attention for decades due to their perceived implications for many factors, including patterns of leaf isotopic enrichment, the maintenance of mesophyll water status, stomatal regulation, and the interpretation of measured stomatal and leaf hydraulic conductances. We used a spatially explicit model of coupled water and heat transport outside the xylem, MOFLO 2.0, to map the distribution of net evaporation across leaf tissues in relation to anatomy and environmental parameters. Our results corroborate earlier predictions that most evaporation occurs from the epidermis at low light and moderate humidity but that the mesophyll contributes substantially when the leaf center is warmed by light absorption, and more so under high humidity. We also found that the bundle sheath provides a significant minority of evaporation (15% in darkness and 18% in high light), that the vertical center of amphistomatous leaves supports net <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ation, and that vertical temperature gradients caused by light absorption vary over 10-fold across species, reaching 0.3°C. We show that several hypotheses that depend on the evaporating sites require revision in light of our findings, including that experimental measurements of stomatal and hydraulic conductances should be affected directly by changes in the location of the evaporating sites. We propose a new conceptual model that accounts for mixed-phase water transport outside the xylem. These conclusions have far-reaching implications for inferences in leaf hydraulics, gas exchange, water use, and isotope physiology.</p>

The Acyl Desaturase CER17 Is Involved in Producing Wax Unsaturated Primary Alcohols and Cutin Monomers

The Arabidopsis <i>cer17</i> mutant was completely deficient in these monounsaturated alcohols, and <i>CER17</i> was found to encode a predicted ACYL-COENZYME A DESATURASE LIKE4 (ADS4). Studies of the Arabidopsis <i>cer4</i> mutant and yeast variously expressing <i>CER4</i> (a predicted fatty acyl-CoA reductase) with <i>CER17/ADS4</i>, demonstrated <i>CER4</i>’s principal role in synthesis of these monounsaturated alcohols. Besides unsaturated alcohol deficiency, <i>cer17</i> mutants exhibited a thickened and irregular cuticle ultrastructure and increased amounts of cutin monomers. Although unsaturated alcohols were absent throughout the <i>cer17</i> stem, the mutation’s effects on cutin monomers and cuticle ultrastructure were much more severe in distal than basal stems, consistent with observations that the <i>CER17/ADS4</i> transcript was much more abundant in distal than basal stems. Furthermore, distal but not basal stems of a double mutant deficient for both CER17/ADS4 and LONG-CHAIN ACYL-COA SYNTHETASE1 produced even more cutin monomers and a thicker and more disorganized cuticle ultrastructure and higher cuticle permeability than observed for wild type or either mutant parent, indicating a dramatic genetic interaction on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion of very long chain acyl-CoA precursors. These results provide evidence that CER17/ADS4 performs <i>n</i>-6 desaturation of very long chain acyl-CoAs in both distal and basal stems and has a major function associated with governing cutin monomer amounts primarily in the distal segments of the inflorescence stem.</p>

Forever Young: The Role of Ubiquitin Receptor DA1 and E3 Ligase BIG BROTHER in Controlling Leaf Growth and Development
<p>The final size of plant organs is determined by a combination of cell proliferation and cell expansion. Leaves account for a large part of above-ground biomass and provide energy to complete the plant’s life cycle. Although the final size of leaves is remarkably constant under fixed environmental conditions, several genes have been described to enhance leaf growth when their expression is modulated. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), mutations in <i>DA1</i> and <i>BB</i> increase leaf size, an effect that is synergistically enhanced in the double mutant. Here, we show that overexpression of a dominant-negative version of <i>DA1</i> enhances leaf size in a broad range of natural accessions of this species, indicating a highly conserved role of this protein in controlling organ size. We also found that during early stages of development, leaves of <i>da1-1</i> and <i>bb/eod1-2</i> mutants were already larger than the isogenic Col-0 wild type, but this phenotype was triggered by different cellular mechanisms. Later during development, <i>da1-1</i> and <i>bb/eod1-2</i> leaves showed a prolonged longevity, which was enhanced in the double mutant. Conversely, ectopic expression of <i>DA1</i> or <i>BB</i> restricted growth and promoted leaf senescence. In concert, shortly upon induction of <i>DA1</i> and <i>BB</i> expression, several marker genes for the transition from proliferation to expansion were highly up-regulated. Additionally, multiple genes involved in maintaining the mitotic cell cycle were rapidly down-regulated and senescence genes were strongly up-regulated, particularly upon <i>BB</i> induction. With these results, we demonstrate that DA1 and BB restrict leaf size and promote senescence through converging and different mechanisms.</p>

Diurnal Solar Energy Conversion and Photoprotection in Rice Canopies
<p>Genetic improvement of photosynthetic performance of cereal crops and increasing the efficiency with which solar radiation is converted into biomass has recently become a major focus for crop physiologists and breeders. The pulse amplitude modulated chlorophyll fluorescence technique (PAM) allows quantitative leaf level monitoring of the utilization of energy for photochemical light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion and photoprotection in natural environments, potentially over the entire crop lifecycle. Here, the diurnal relationship between electron transport rate (ETR) and irradiance was measured in five cultivars of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) in canopy conditions with PAM fluorescence under natural solar radiation. This relationship differed substantially from that observed for conventional short term light response curves measured under controlled actinic light with the same leaves. This difference was characterized by a reduced curvature factor when curve fitting was used to model this diurnal response. The engagement of photoprotective processes in chloroplast electron transport in leaves under canopy solar radiation was shown to be a major contributor to this difference. Genotypic variation in the irradiance at which energy flux into photoprotective dissipation became greater than ETR was observed. Cultivars capable of higher ETR at midrange light intensities were shown to produce greater leaf area over time, estimated by noninvasive imaging.</p>

The Arabidopsis Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) Components AtBMI1A, B, and C Impact Gene Networks throughout All Stages of Plant Development
<p>Polycomb Group regulation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) is required to maintain cell differentiation and allow developmental phase transitions. This is achieved by the activity of three PcG repressive complex 2s (PRC2s) and the participation of a yet poorly defined PRC1. Previous results showed that apparent PRC1 components perform discrete roles during plant development, suggesting the existence of PRC1 variants; however, it is not clear in how many processes these components participate. We show that AtBMI1 proteins are required to promote all developmental phase transitions and to control cell proliferation during organ growth and development, expanding their proposed range of action. While AtBMI1 function during germination is closely linked to B3 domain transcription factors VAL1/2 possibly in combination with <i>GT-box</i> binding factors, other AtBMI1 regulatory networks require participation of different factor combinations. Conversely, EMF1 and LHP1 bind many H3K27me3 positive genes up-regulated in <i>atbmi1a/b/c</i> mutants; however, loss of their function affects expression of a different subset, suggesting that even if EMF1, LHP1, and AtBMI1 exist in a common PRC1 variant, their role in repression depends on the functional context.</p>

cis-Cinnamic Acid Is a Novel, Natural Auxin Efflux Inhibitor That Promotes Lateral Root Formation
<p>Auxin steers numerous physiological processes in plants, making the tight control of its endogenous levels and spatiotemporal distribution a necessity. This regulation is achieved by different mechanisms, including auxin biosynthesis, metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ions, degradation, and transport. Here, we introduce cis-cinnamic acid (<i>c</i>-CA) as a novel and unique addition to a small group of endogenous molecules affecting in planta auxin concentrations. <i>c-CA</i> is the photo-isomerization product of the phenylpropanoid pathway intermediate trans-CA (<i>t</i>-CA). When grown on <i>c</i>-CA-containing medium, an evolutionary diverse set of plant species were shown to exhibit phenotypes characteristic for high auxin levels, including inhibition of primary root growth, induction of root hairs, and promotion of adventitious and lateral rooting. By molecular docking and receptor binding assays, we showed that <i>c</i>-CA itself is neither an auxin nor an anti-auxin, and auxin profiling data revealed that <i>c</i>-CA does not significantly interfere with auxin biosynthesis. Single cell-based auxin accumulation assays showed that <i>c</i>-CA, and not <i>t</i>-CA, is a potent inhibitor of auxin efflux. Auxin signaling reporters detected changes in spatiotemporal distribution of the auxin response along the root of <i>c</i>-CA-treated plants, and long-distance auxin transport assays showed no inhibition of rootward auxin transport. Overall, these results suggest that the phenotypes of <i>c</i>-CA-treated plants are the consequence of a local change in auxin accumulation, induced by the inhibition of auxin efflux. This work reveals a novel mechanism how plants may regulate auxin levels and adds a novel, naturally occurring molecule to the chemical toolbox for the studies of auxin homeostasis.</p>

Methyl Transfer in Glucosinolate Biosynthesis Mediated by Indole Glucosinolate <i>O</i>-Methyltransferase 5
<p>Indole glucosinolates (IGs) are plant secondary metabolites that are derived from the amino acid tryptophan. The product of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) IG core biosynthesis, indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate (I3M), can be modified by hydroxylation and subsequent methoxylation of the indole ring in position 1 (1-IG modification) or 4 (4-IG modification). Products of the 4-IG modification pathway mediate plant-enemy interactions and are particularly important for Arabidopsis innate immunity. While <i>CYP81F</i>s encoding cytochrome P450 monooxygenases and <i>IGMT</i>s encoding indole glucosinolate <i>O</i>-methyltransferases have been identified as key genes for IG modification, our knowledge about the IG modification pathways is not complete. In particular, it is unknown which enzyme is responsible for methyl transfer in the 1-IG modification pathway and whether this pathway plays a role in defense, similar to 4-IG modification. Here, we analyze two Arabidopsis transfer DNA insertion lines with targeted metabolomics. We show that biosynthesis of 1-methoxyindol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate (1MOI3M) from I3M involves the predicted unstable intermediate 1-hydroxyindol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate (1OHI3M) and that <i>IGMT5</i>, a gene with moderate similarity to previously characterized <i>IGMT</i>s, encodes the methyltransferase that is responsible for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion of 1OHI3M to 1MOI3M. Disruption of IGMT5 function increases resistance against the root-knot nematode <i>Meloidogyne javanica</i> and suggests a potential role for the 1-IG modification pathway in Arabidopsis belowground defense.</p>

The α-Terpineol to 1,8-Cineole Cyclization Reaction of Tobacco Terpene Synthases
<p>Flowers of <i>Nicotiana</i> species emit a characteristic blend including the cineole cassette monoterpenes. This set of terpenes is synthesized by multiproduct enzymes, with either 1,8-cineole or α-terpineol contributing most to the volatile spectrum, thus referring to cineole or terpineol synthase, respectively. To understand the molecular and structural requirements of the enzymes that favor the biochemical formation of α-terpineol and 1,8-cineole, site-directed mutagenesis, in silico modeling, and semiempiric calculations were performed. Our results indicate the formation of α-terpineol by a nucleophilic attack of water. During this attack, the α-terpinyl cation is stabilized by π-stacking with a tryptophan side chain (tryptophan-253). The hypothesized catalytic mechanism of α-terpineol-to-1,8-cineole <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion is initiated by a catalytic dyad (histidine-502 and glutamate-249), acting as a base, and a threonine (threonine-278) providing the subsequent rearrangement from terpineol to cineol by catalyzing the autoprotonation of (<i>S</i>)-(−)-α-terpineol, which is the favored enantiomer product of the recombinant enzymes. Furthermore, by site-directed mutagenesis, we were able to identify amino acids at positions 147, 148, and 266 that determine the different terpineol-cineole ratios in <i>Nicotiana</i> <i>suaveolens</i> cineole synthase and <i>Nicotiana</i> <i>langsdorffii</i> terpineol synthase. Since amino acid 266 is more than 10 ÅÅ away from the active site, an indirect effect of this amino acid exchange on the catalysis is discussed.</p>

Class II Cytochrome P450 Reductase Governs the Biosynthesis of Alkaloids
<p>Expansion of the biosynthesis of plant specialized metabolites notably results from the massive recruitment of cytochrome P450s that catalyze multiple types of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion of biosynthetic intermediates. For catalysis, P450s require a two-electron transfer catalyzed by shared cytochrome P450 oxidoreductases (CPRs), making these auxiliary proteins an essential component of specialized metabolism. CPR isoforms usually group into two distinct classes with different proposed roles, namely involvement in primary and basal specialized metabolisms for class I and inducible specialized metabolism for class II. By studying the role of CPRs in the biosynthesis of monoterpene indole alkaloids, we provide compelling evidence of an operational specialization of CPR isoforms in <i>Catharanthus roseus</i> (Madagascar periwinkle). Global analyses of gene expression correlation combined with transcript localization in specific leaf tissues and gene-silencing experiments of both classes of CPR all point to the strict requirement of class II CPRs for monoterpene indole alkaloid biosynthesis with a minimal or null role of class I. Direct assays of interaction and reduction of P450s in vitro, however, showed that both classes of CPR performed equally well. Such high specialization of class II CPRs in planta highlights the evolutionary strategy that ensures an efficient reduction of P450s in specialized metabolism.</p>

The NDH-1L-PSI Supercomplex Is Important for Efficient Cyclic Electron Transport in Cyanobacteria
<p>Two mutants isolated from a tagging library of <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. strain PCC 6803 were sensitive to high light and had a tag in <i>sll1471</i> encoding CpcG2, a linker protein for photosystem I (PSI)-specific antenna. Both mutants demonstrated strongly impaired NDH-1-dependent cyclic electron transport. Blue native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting and mass spectrometry analyses of the wild type and a mutant containing CpcG2 fused with yellow fluorescent protein-histidine6 indicated the presence of a novel NDH-1L-CpcG2-PSI supercomplex, which was absent in the <i>cpcG2</i> deletion mutant, the PSI-less mutant, and several other strains deficient in NDH-1L and/or NDH-1M. Coimmunoprecipitation and pull-down analyses on CpcG2-yellow fluorescent protein-histidine6, using antibody against green fluorescent protein and nickel column chromatography, confirmed the association of CpcG2 with the supercomplex. Conversely, the use of antibodies against NdhH or NdhK after blue native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and in coimmunoprecipitation experiments verified the necessity of CpcG2 in stabilizing the supercomplex. Furthermore, deletion of CpcG2 destabilized NDH-1L as well as its degradation product NDH-1M and significantly decreased the number of functional PSI centers, consistent with the involvement of CpcG2 in NDH-1-dependent cyclic electron transport. The CpcG2 deletion, however, had no effect on respiration. Thus, we propose that the formation of an NDH-1L-CpcG2-PSI supercomplex in cyanobacteria facilitates PSI cyclic electron transport via NDH-1L.</p>

Rapid Functional and Sequence Differentiation of a Tandemly Repeated Species-Specific Multigene Family in <i>Drosophila</i>
<p>Gene clusters of recently duplicated genes are hotbeds for evolutionary change. However, our understanding of how mutational mechanisms and evolutionary forces shape the structural and functional evolution of these clusters is hindered by the high sequence identity among the copies, which typically results in their inaccurate representation in genome assemblies. The presumed testis-specific, chimeric gene <i>Sdic</i> originated, and tandemly expanded in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, contributing to increased male-male competition. Using various types of massively parallel sequencing data, we studied the organization, sequence evolution, and functional attributes of the different <i>Sdic</i> copies. By leveraging long-read sequencing data, we uncovered both copy number and order differences from the currently accepted annotation for the <i>Sdic</i> region. Despite evidence for pervasive gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion affecting the <i>Sdic</i> copies, we also detected signatures of two episodes of diversifying selection, which have contributed to the evolution of a variety of C-termini and miRNA binding site compositions. Expression analyses involving RNA-seq datasets from 59 different biological conditions revealed distinctive expression breadths among the copies, with three copies being transcribed in females, opening the possibility to a sexually antagonistic effect. Phenotypic assays using <i>Sdic</i> knock-out strains indicated that should this antagonistic effect exist, it does not compromise female fertility. Our results strongly suggest that the genome consolidation of the <i>Sdic</i> gene cluster is more the result of a quick exploration of different paths of molecular tinkering by different copies than a mere dosage increase, which could be a recurrent evolutionary outcome in the presence of persistent sexual selection.</p>

Old but Not (So) Degenerated—Slow Evolution of Largely Homomorphic Sex Chromosomes in Ratites
<p>Degeneration of the nonrecombining chromosome is a common feature of sex chromosome evolution, readily evident by the presence of a pair of largely heteromorphic chromosomes, like in eutherian mammals and birds. However, in ratites (order Palaeognathae, including, e.g., ostrich), the Z and W chromosomes are similar in size and largely undifferentiated, despite avian sex chromosome evolution was initiated > 130 Ma. To better understand what may limit sex chromosome evolution, we performed ostrich transcriptome sequencing and studied genes from the nonrecombining region of the W chromosome. Fourteen gametologous gene pairs present on the W chromosome and Z chromosome were identified, with synonymous sequence divergence of 0.027–0.177. The location of these genes on the Z chromosome was consistent with a sequential increase in divergence, starting 110–157 and ending 24–30 Ma. On the basis of the occurrence of Z-linked genes hemizygous in females, we estimate that about one-third of the Z chromosome does not recombine with the W chromosome in female meiosis. Pairwise <i>d</i><sub>N</sub><i>/d</i><sub>S</sub> between gametologs decreased with age, suggesting strong evolutionary constraint in old gametologs. Lineage-specific <i>d</i><sub>N</sub><i>/d</i><sub>S</sub> was consistently higher in W-linked genes, in accordance with the lower efficacy of selection expected in nonrecombining chromosomes. A higher ratio of GC > AT:AT > GC substitutions in W-linked genes supports a role for GC-biased gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion in differentially driving base composition on the two sex chromosomes. A male-to-female (M:F) expression ratio of close to one for recombining genes and close to two for Z-linked genes lacking a W copy show that dosage compensation is essentially absent. Some gametologous genes have retained active expression of the W copy in females (giving a M:F ratio of 1 for the gametologous gene pair), whereas for others W expression has become severely reduced resulting in a M:F ratio of close to 2. These observations resemble the patterns of sex chromosome evolution seen in other avian and mammalian lineages, suggesting similar underlying evolutionary processes, although the rate of sex chromosome differentiation has been atypically low. Lack of dosage compensation may be a factor hindering sex chromosome evolution in this lineage.</p>

Evidence from a House Finch (<i>Haemorhous mexicanus</i>) Spleen Transcriptome for Adaptive Evolution and Biased Gene Conversion in Passerine Birds
<p>Identifying genes influenced by natural selection can provide information about lineage-specific adaptations, and transcriptomes generated by next-generation sequencing are a useful resource for identifying such genes. Here, we utilize a spleen transcriptome for the house finch (<i>Haemorhous mexicanus</i>), an emerging model for sexual selection and disease ecology, together with previously sequenced avian genomes (chicken, turkey, and zebra finch), to investigate lineage-specific adaptations within birds. An analysis of 4,398 orthologous genes revealed a significantly higher ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions and significantly higher GC content in passerines than in galliforms, an observation deviating from strictly neutral expectations but consistent with an effect of biased gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convers</span></strong>ion on the evolutionary rate in passerines. These data also showed that genes exhibiting signs of positive selection and fast evolution in passerines have functional roles related to fat metabolism, neurodevelopment, and ion binding.</p>

Trans-generational plasticity in physiological thermal tolerance is modulated by maternal pre-reproductive environment in the polychaete <i>Ophryotrocha labronica</i>
<p>Maternal temperature is known to affect many aspects of offspring phenotype, but its effect on offspring physiological thermal tolerance has received less attention, despite the importance of physiological traits in defining organismal ability to cope with temperature changes. To fill this gap, we used the marine polychaete <i>Ophryotrocha labronica</i> to investigate the influence of maternal temperature on offspring upper and lower thermal tolerance limits, and assess whether maternal influence changed according to the stage of offspring pre-zygotic development at which a thermal cue was provided. Measurements were taken on adult offspring acclimated to 18 or 30°C, produced by mothers previously reared at 24°C and then exposed to 18 or 30°C at an early and late stage of oogenesis. When the shift from 24°C was provided early during oogenesis, mothers produced offspring with greater cold and heat tolerance whenever mother–offspring temperatures did not match, with respect to when they matched, suggesting the presence of an anticipatory maternal effect triggered by the thermal variation. Conversely, when the cue was provided later during oogenesis, more tolerant offspring were observed when temperatures persisted across generations. In this case, maternal exposure to 18 or 30°C may have benefited offspring performance, while limitations in the transmission of the thermal cue may account for the lack of correlation between maternal experiences and offspring performance when mother–offspring environments did not match. Our results provided evidence for a trans-generational effect of temperature on physiological performance characterised by a high context dependency, and are discussed in the light of maternal pre-reproductive experiences.</p>

Physiological basis of starvation resistance in <i>Drosophila leontia</i>: analysis of sexual dimorphism
<p>Geographically varying starvation stress has often been considered as a natural selector that constrains between-population differences for starvation resistance (SR) in <i>Drosophila</i> species. On the Indian subcontinent, a dozen <i>Drosophila</i> species have shown clinal variations in SR across latitude, but the evolved physiological basis of such contrasting adaptations is largely unknown. In the present study, I untangled the physiological basis of sex-specific as well as between-population divergence for SR in <i>D. leontia</i>, collected across a latitudinal transect of the Indian subcontinent (11°45′–31°19′N). Secondly, I tested the assumptions that hardening to starvation stress facilitates an increased survival under subsequent lethal levels of starvation, and such plastic effects differ between the sexes. I observed several interesting results. In contrast to a steeper cline of starvation-related traits with latitude in females, a shallower gradient was observed for males. Females stored higher (~1.3-fold) dry-mass-specific levels of body lipids and glycogen contents, and utilized these both of these energy resources under starvation stress, whereas the starved males metabolized only body lipids as a source of energy. Conversely, the rate of body lipid utilization and threshold need were considerably higher in females as compared with males. Between-population differences were significant for storage levels of energy reserves only, but not for other avenues (rate of metabolite utilization and threshold need) of SR for both sexes. These findings indicate that multiple pathways shape the physiological basis of sexual dimorphism for SR in <i>D. leontia</i>. Further, single or multiple bouts of starvation hardening conferred an increased longevity (~4–9 h; <i>P</i><0.001) under subsequent lethal levels of starvation stress for females only, and such plastic responses were consistent with a decrease in rate of metabolite utilization. Nevertheless, between-population effects were non-significant for absolute hardening capacity (AHC=<i>K</i><sub>SR</sub>–C). Altogether, these findings suggest that similar evolutionary constraints have resulted in divergent genetic as well as plastic responses to evolve adaptations under starvation stress, and account for the observed sexual dimorphism for basal SR in <i>D. leontia</i>.</p>

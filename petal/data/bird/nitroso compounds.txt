Proteomic analysis of S-nitrosylated nuclear proteins in rat cortical neurons
<p>Neurons modulate gene expression in response to extrinsic signals to enable brain development, cognition, and learning and to process stimuli that regulate systemic physiological functions. This signal-to-gene communication is facilitated by posttranslational modifications such as S-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrosyl</span></strong>ation, the covalent attachment of a nitric oxide (NO) moiety to cysteine thiols. In the cerebral cortex, S-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrosyl</span></strong>ation of histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) is required for gene transcription during neuronal development, but few other nuclear targets of S-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrosyl</span></strong>ation have been identified to date. We used S-nitrosothiol resin-assisted capture on NO donor-treated nuclear extracts from rat cortical neurons and identified 614 S-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrosyl</span></strong>ated nuclear proteins. Of these, 131 proteins have not previously been shown to be S-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrosyl</span></strong>ated in any system, and 555 are previously unidentified targets of S-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrosyl</span></strong>ation in neurons. The sites of S-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrosyl</span></strong>ation were identified for 59% of the targets, and motifs containing single lysines were found at 33% of these sites. In addition, lysine motifs were necessary for promoting the S-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrosyl</span></strong>ation of HDAC2 and methyl-CpG binding protein 3 (MBD3). Moreover, S-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrosyl</span></strong>ation of the histone-binding protein RBBP7 was necessary for dendritogenesis of cortical neurons in culture. Together, our findings characterize S-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrosyl</span></strong>ated nuclear proteins in neurons and identify S-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrosyl</span></strong>ation motifs that may be shared with other targets of NO signaling.</p>

Nitrosylation of GAPDH augments pathological tau acetylation upon exposure to amyloid-β
<p>Acetylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau promotes its polymerization into neurofibrillary tangles that are implicated in the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The gaseous neurotransmitter nitric oxide (NO) regulates cell signaling through the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrosyl</span></strong>ation of proteins. We found that NO production and tau acetylation at Lys<sup>280</sup> occurred in the brain tissue in mice and in cultured mouse cortical neurons in response to exposure to amyloid-β<sub>1–42</sub> (Aβ<sub>1–42</sub>), a peptide that is also implicated in AD. An increased abundance of NO facilitated the <i>S</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrosyl</span></strong>ation (SNO) of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). <i>S</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrosyl</span></strong>ated GAPDH (GAPDH-SNO) promoted the acetylation and activation of the acetyltransferase p300 and facilitated the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrosyl</span></strong>ation and inactivation of the deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1). The abundance of GAPDH-SNO was increased in postmortem brain samples from AD patients. Preventing the increase in GAPDH-SNO abundance in both cultured neurons and mice, either by overexpression of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrosyl</span></strong>ation mutant of GAPDH (GAPDH C150S) or by treatment with the GAPDH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrosyl</span></strong>ation inhibitor CGP3466B (also known as omigapil), abrogated Aβ<sub>1–42</sub>–induced tau acetylation, memory impairment, and locomotor dysfunction in mice, suggesting that this drug might be repurposed to treat patients with AD.</p>

IRE1α prevents hepatic steatosis by processing and promoting the degradation of select microRNAs
<p>Obesity or a high-fat diet represses the endoribonuclease activity of inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α), a transducer of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in cells under endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. An impaired UPR is associated with hepatic steatosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is caused by lipid accumulation in the liver. We found that IRE1α was critical to maintaining lipid homeostasis in the liver by repressing the biogenesis of microRNAs (miRNAs) that regulate lipid mobilization. In mice fed normal chow, the endoribonuclease function of IRE1α processed a subset of precursor miRNAs in the liver, including those of the miR-200 and miR-34 families, such that IRE1α promoted their degradation through the process of regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD). A high-fat diet in mice or hepatic steatosis in patients was associated with the S-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrosyl</span></strong>ation of IRE1α and inactivation of its endoribonuclease activity. This resulted in an increased abundance of these miRNA families in the liver and, consequently, a decreased abundance of their targets, which included peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor α (PPARα) and the deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), regulators of fatty acid oxidation and triglyceride lipolysis. IRE1α deficiency exacerbated hepatic steatosis in mice. The abundance of the miR-200 and miR-34 families was also increased in cultured, lipid-overloaded hepatocytes and in the livers of patients with hepatic steatosis. Our findings reveal a mechanism by which IRE1α maintains lipid homeostasis through its regulation of miRNAs, a regulatory pathway distinct from the canonical IRE1α-UPR pathway under acute ER stress.</p>

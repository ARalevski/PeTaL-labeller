Bioinspired spring origami
<p>Origami enables <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong>ing of objects into a variety of shapes in arts, engineering, and biological systems. In contrast to well-known paper-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong>ed objects, the wing of the earwig has an exquisite natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong>ing system that cannot be sufficiently described by current origami models. Such an unusual biological system displays incompatible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong>ing patterns, remains open by a bistable locking mechanism during flight, and self-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong>s rapidly without muscular actuation. We show that these notable functionalities arise from the protein-rich joints of the earwig wing, which work as extensional and rotational springs between facets. Inspired by this biological wing, we establish a spring origami model that broadens the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong>ing design space of traditional origami and allows for the fabrication of precisely tunable, four-dimensional–printed objects with programmable bioinspired morphing functionalities.</p>

Packing of apolar side chains enables accurate design of highly stable membrane proteins
<p>The features that stabilize the structures of membrane proteins remain poorly understood. Polar interactions contribute modestly, and the hydrophobic effect contributes little to the energetics of apolar side-chain packing in membranes. Disruption of steric packing can destabilize the native <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong>s of membrane proteins, but is packing alone sufficient to drive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong>ing in lipids? If so, then membrane proteins stabilized by this feature should be readily designed and structurally characterized—yet this has not been achieved. Through simulation of the natural protein phospholamban and redesign of variants, we define a steric packing code underlying its assembly. Synthetic membrane proteins designed using this code and stabilized entirely by apolar side chains conform to the intended <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong>. Although highly stable, the steric complementarity required for their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong>ing is surprisingly stringent. Structural informatics shows that the designed packing motif recurs across the proteome, emphasizing a prominent role for precise apolar packing in membrane protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong>ing, stabilization, and evolution.</p>

Global analysis of protein folding using massively parallel design, synthesis, and testing
<p>Proteins <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong> into unique native structures stabilized by thousands of weak interactions that collectively overcome the entropic cost of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong>ing. Although these forces are “encoded” in the thousands of known protein structures, “decoding” them is challenging because of the complexity of natural proteins that have evolved for function, not stability. We combined computational protein design, next-generation gene synthesis, and a high-throughput protease susceptibility assay to measure <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong>ing and stability for more than 15,000 de novo designed miniproteins, 1000 natural proteins, 10,000 point mutants, and 30,000 negative control sequences. This analysis identified more than 2500 stable designed proteins in four basic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong>s—a number sufficient to enable us to systematically examine how sequence determines <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong>ing and stability in uncharted protein space. Iteration between design and experiment increased the design success rate from 6% to 47%, produced stable proteins unlike those found in nature for topologies where design was initially unsuccessful, and revealed subtle contributions to stability as designs became increasingly optimized. Our approach achieves the long-standing goal of a tight feedback cycle between computation and experiment and has the potential to transform computational protein design into a data-driven science.</p>

Single-stranded DNA and RNA origami
<p>Self-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong>ing of an information-carrying polymer into a defined structure is foundational to biology and offers attractive potential as a synthetic strategy. Although multicomponent self-assembly has produced complex synthetic nanostructures, unimolecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong>ing has seen limited progress. We describe a framework to design and synthesize a single DNA or RNA strand to self-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong> into a complex yet unknotted structure that approximates an arbitrary user-prescribed shape. We experimentally construct diverse multikilobase single-stranded structures, including a ~10,000-nucleotide (nt) DNA structure and a ~6000-nt RNA structure. We demonstrate facile replication of the strand in vitro and in living cells. The work here thus establishes unimolecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong>ing as a general strategy for constructing complex and replicable nucleic acid nanostructures, and expands the design space and material scalability for bottom-up nanotechnology.</p>

Sugar Potentiation of Fatty Acid and Triacylglycerol Accumulation
<p>Photosynthetically derived sugar provides carbon skeletons for lipid biosynthesis. We used mutants of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and the expression of oleogenic factors to investigate relationships among sugar availability, lipid synthesis, and the accumulation of triacylglycerol (TAG) in leaf tissue. The <i>adg1</i> mutation disables the small subunit of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, the first step in starch synthesis, and the <i>suc2</i> mutation disables a sucrose/proton symporter that facilitates sucrose loading from leaves into phloem. The <i>adg1suc2</i> double mutant increases glucose plus sucrose content in leaves 80-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong> relative to the wild type, total fatty acid (FA) content 1.8-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong> to 8.3% dry weight, and TAG more than 10-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong> to 1.2% dry weight. The WRINKLED1 transcription factor also accumulates to higher levels in these leaves, and the rate of FA synthesis increases by 58%. Adding <i>tt4</i>, which disables chalcone synthase, had little effect, but adding the <i>tgd1</i> mutation, which disables an importer of lipids into plastids to create <i>adg1suc2tt4tgd1</i>, increased total leaf FA to 13.5% dry weight and TAG to 3.8% dry weight, demonstrating a synergistic effect upon combining these mutations. Combining <i>adg1suc2</i> with the <i>sdp1</i> mutation, deficient in the predominant TAG lipase, had little effect on total FA content but increased the TAG accumulation by 66% to 2% dry weight. Expression of the <i>WRINKLED1</i> transcription factor, along with <i>DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1</i> and the <i>OLEOSIN1</i> oil body-associated protein, in the <i>adg1suc2</i> mutant doubled leaf FA content and increased TAG content to 2.3% dry weight, a level 4.6-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong> higher than that resulting from expression of the same factors in the wild type.</p>

Bacterial pseudokinase catalyzes protein polyglutamylation to inhibit the SidE-family ubiquitin ligases
<p>Enzymes with a protein kinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong> transfer phosphate from adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) to substrates in a process known as phosphorylation.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Tri-Hydroxy-Triacylglycerol Is Efficiently Produced by Position-Specific Castor Acyltransferases
<p>Understanding the biochemistry of triacylglycerol (TAG) assembly is critical in tailoring seed oils to produce high-value products. Hydroxy-fatty acid (HFA) is one such valuable modified fatty acid, which can be produced at low levels in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed through transgenic expression of the castor (<i>Ricinus communis</i>) hydroxylase. The resulting plants have low seed oil content and poor seedling establishment, indicating that Arabidopsis lacks efficient metabolic networks for biosynthesis and catabolism of hydroxy-containing TAG. To improve utilization of such substrates, we expressed three castor acyltransferase enzymes that incorporate HFA at each stereochemical position during TAG synthesis. This produced abundant tri-HFA TAG and concentrated 44% of seed HFA moieties into this one TAG species. Ricinoleic acid was more abundant than any other fatty acid in these seeds, which had 3-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong> more HFA by weight than that in seeds following simple hydroxylase expression, the highest yet measured in a nonnative plant. Efficient utilization of hydroxy-containing lipid substrates increased the rate of TAG synthesis 2-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong>, leading to complete relief of the low-oil phenotype. Partition of HFA into specific TAG molecules increased the storage lipid available for mobilization during seedling development, resulting in a 1.9-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong> increase in seedling establishment. Expression of a complete acyltransferase pathway to efficiently process HFA establishes a benchmark in the quest to successfully produce modified oils in plants.</p>

Different Routes for Conifer- and Sinapaldehyde and Higher Saccharification upon Deficiency in the Dehydrogenase CAD1
<p>In the search for renewable energy sources, genetic engineering is a promising strategy to improve plant cell wall composition for biofuel and bioproducts generation. Lignin is a major factor determining saccharification efficiency and, therefore, is a prime target to engineer. Here, lignin content and composition were modified in poplar (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus alba</i>) by specifically down-regulating <i>CINNAMYL ALCOHOL DEHYDROGENASE1</i> (<i>CAD1</i>) by a hairpin-RNA-mediated silencing approach, which resulted in only 5% residual <i>CAD1</i> transcript abundance. These transgenic lines showed no biomass penalty despite a 10% reduction in Klason lignin content and severe shifts in lignin composition. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and thioacidolysis revealed a strong increase (up to 20-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong>) in sinapaldehyde incorporation into lignin, whereas coniferaldehyde was not increased markedly. Accordingly, ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based phenolic profiling revealed a more than 24,000-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong> accumulation of a newly identified compound made from 8-8 coupling of two sinapaldehyde radicals. However, no additional cinnamaldehyde coupling products could be detected in the CAD1-deficient poplars. Instead, the transgenic lines accumulated a range of hydroxycinnamate-derived metabolites, of which the most prominent accumulation (over 8,500-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong>) was observed for a compound that was identified by purification and nuclear magnetic resonance as syringyl lactic acid hexoside. Our data suggest that, upon down-regulation of <i>CAD1</i>, coniferaldehyde is converted into ferulic acid and derivatives, whereas sinapaldehyde is either oxidatively coupled into S′(8-8)S′ and lignin or converted to sinapic acid and derivatives. The most prominent sink of the increased flux to hydroxycinnamates is syringyl lactic acid hexoside. Furthermore, low-extent saccharification assays, under different pretreatment conditions, showed strongly increased glucose (up to +81%) and xylose (up to +153%) release, suggesting that down-regulating <i>CAD1</i> is a promising strategy for improving lignocellulosic biomass for the sugar platform industry.</p>

Diacylglycerol Acyltransferase 1 Is Regulated by Its N-Terminal Domain in Response to Allosteric Effectors
<p>Diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) is an integral membrane enzyme catalyzing the final and committed step in the acyl-coenzyme A (CoA)-dependent biosynthesis of triacylglycerol (TAG). The biochemical regulation of TAG assembly remains one of the least understood areas of primary metabolism to date. Here, we report that the hydrophilic N-terminal domain of <i>Brassica napus</i> DGAT1 (BnaDGAT1<sub>1-113</sub>) regulates activity based on acyl-CoA/CoA levels. The N-terminal domain is not necessary for acyltransferase activity and is composed of an intrinsically disordered region and a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong>ed segment. We show that the disordered region has an autoinhibitory function and a dimerization interface, which appears to mediate positive cooperativity, whereas the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong>ed segment of the cytosolic region was found to have an allosteric site for acyl-CoA/CoA. Under increasing acyl-CoA levels, the binding of acyl-CoA with this noncatalytic site facilitates homotropic allosteric activation. Enzyme activation, on the other hand, is prevented under limiting acyl-CoA conditions (low acyl-CoA-to-CoA ratio), whereby CoA acts as a noncompetitive feedback inhibitor through interaction with the same <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong>ed segment. The three-dimensional NMR solution structure of the allosteric site revealed an α-helix with a loop connecting a coil fragment. The conserved amino acid residues in the loop interacting with CoA were identified, revealing details of this important regulatory element for allosteric regulation. Based on these results, a model is proposed illustrating the role of the N-terminal domain of BnaDGAT1 as a positive and negative modulator of TAG biosynthesis.</p>

Cell-Type-Specific H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase Activity in Root Tissues Enables K<sup>+</sup> Retention and Mediates Acclimation of Barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) to Salinity Stress
<p>While the importance of cell type specificity in plant adaptive responses is widely accepted, only a limited number of studies have addressed this issue at the functional level. We have combined electrophysiological, imaging, and biochemical techniques to reveal the physiological mechanisms conferring higher sensitivity of apical root cells to salinity in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>). We show that salinity application to the root apex arrests root growth in a highly tissue- and treatment-specific manner. Although salinity-induced transient net Na<sup>+</sup> uptake was about 4-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong> higher in the root apex compared with the mature zone, mature root cells accumulated more cytosolic and vacuolar Na<sup>+</sup>, suggesting that the higher sensitivity of apical cells to salt is not related to either enhanced Na<sup>+</sup> exclusion or sequestration inside the root. Rather, the above differential sensitivity between the two zones originates from a 10-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong> difference in K<sup>+</sup> efflux between the mature zone and the apical region (much poorer in the root apex) of the root. Major factors contributing to this poor K<sup>+</sup> retention ability are (1) an intrinsically lower H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity in the root apex, (2) greater salt-induced membrane depolarization, and (3) a higher reactive oxygen species production under NaCl and a larger density of reactive oxygen species-activated cation currents in the apex. Salinity treatment increased (2- to 5-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong>) the content of 10 (out of 25 detected) amino acids in the root apex but not in the mature zone and changed the organic acid and sugar contents. The causal link between the observed changes in the root metabolic profile and the regulation of transporter activity is discussed.</p>

In multivariate analysis, younger age, absence of obesity, absence of diabetes mellitus, shortness of breath, and a short delay between pain onset and call to emergency medical services were the main predictors of SCA. A score built from these variables predicted SCA, with the risk increasing 2-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong> in patients with a score between 10 and 19, 4-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong> in those with a score between 20 and 29, and >18-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong> in patients with a score ≥30 compared with those with scores <10.

A posttranslational modification code for CFTR maturation is altered in cystic fibrosis
<p>The multistep process regulating the maturation of membrane proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the secretory pathway is disrupted in many protein mis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong>ing disorders. Mutations in the ion channel CFTR that impair its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong>ing and subsequent localization to the plasma membrane cause cystic fibrosis (CF), an inherited and eventually lethal disease that impairs the function of multiple organs, mostly the lungs. Here, we found that proper maturation of CFTR is dependent on cross-talk between phosphorylation and methylation events in the regulatory insertion (RI) element of the protein. Manipulating these posttranslational modifications (PTMs) prevented the maturation of wild-type CFTR and instead induced its degradation by ER quality control systems. Deletion of Phe<sup>508</sup> (ΔF508), the most prevalent mutation in CF, and other mutations in CFTR that impair its trafficking, such as N1303K, also led to quantitative and qualitative PTM changes that prevented the maturation of mis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong>ed CFTR. Further analysis revealed that a wild-type CFTR–like PTM pattern and function was restored in ΔF508 CFTR when cells were cultured at 28°C but only in the presence of the kinase CK2α. Furthermore, the ability to replicate this PTM pattern predicted the efficacy of treatments in restoring ΔF508 CFTR activity. Accordingly, evaluation of patient information revealed that point mutations of several of the modification sites are associated with clinical CF. These findings identify a minimal quantitative and qualitative PTM code for CFTR maturation that distinguishes correctly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong>ed from mis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong>ed CFTR.</p>

A disease-linked <i>ULBP6</i> polymorphism inhibits NKG2D-mediated target cell killing by enhancing the stability of NKG2D ligand binding
<p>NKG2D (natural killer group 2, member D) is an activating receptor found on the surface of immune cells, including natural killer (NK) cells, which regulates innate and adaptive immunity through recognition of the stress-induced ligands ULBP1 (UL16 binding protein 1) to ULBP6 and MICA/B. Similar to class I human leukocyte antigen (HLA), these NKG2D ligands have a major histocompatibility complex–like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong> and exhibit pronounced polymorphism, which influences human disease susceptibility. However, whereas class I HLA polymorphisms occur predominantly in the α1α2 groove and affect antigen binding, the effects of most NKG2D ligand polymorphisms are unclear. We studied the molecular and functional consequences of the two major alleles of <i>ULBP6</i>, the most polymorphic <i>ULBP</i> gene, which are associated with autoimmunity and relapse after stem cell transplantation. Surface plasmon resonance and crystallography studies revealed that the arginine-to-leucine polymorphism within ULBP0602 affected the NKG2D-ULBP6 interaction by generating an energetic hotspot. This resulted in an NKG2D-ULBP0602 affinity of 15.5 nM, which is 10- to 1000-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong> greater than the affinities of other ULBP-NKG2D interactions and limited NKG2D-mediated activation. In addition, soluble ULBP0602 exhibited high-affinity competitive binding for NKG2D and partially suppressed NKG2D-mediated activation of NK cells by other NKG2D ligands. These effects resulted in a decrease in a range of NKG2D-mediated effector functions. Our results reveal that <i>ULBP</i> polymorphisms affect the strength of human lymphocyte responses to cellular stress signals and may offer opportunities for therapeutic intervention.</p>

Innovative scattering analysis shows that hydrophobic disordered proteins are expanded in water

We applied this procedure to a variety of IDPs and found that even IDPs with low net charge and high hydrophobicity remain highly expanded in water, contrary to the general expectation that protein-like sequences collapse in water. Our results suggest that the un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong>ed state of most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong>able sequences is expanded; we conjecture that this property was selected by evolution to minimize mis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong>ing and aggregation.</p>

Although RNA G-quadruplexes have been implicated in posttranscriptional gene regulation and diseases, direct evidence for their formation in cells has been lacking. Here, we identified thousands of mammalian RNA regions that can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong> into G-quadruplexes in vitro, but in contrast to previous assumptions, these regions were overwhelmingly un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong>ed in cells. Model RNA G-quadruplexes that were un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong>ed in eukaryotic cells were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong>ed when ectopically expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i>; however, they impaired translation and growth, which helps explain why we detected few G-quadruplex–forming regions in bacterial transcriptomes. Our results suggest that eukaryotes have a robust machinery that globally un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong>s RNA G-quadruplexes, whereas some bacteria have instead undergone evolutionary depletion of G-quadruplex–forming sequences.</p>

An ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR-MYB Transcription Complex Regulates Furaneol Biosynthesis by Activating <i>QUINONE OXIDOREDUCTASE</i> Expression in Strawberry
<p>4-Hydroxy-2,5-dimethyl-3(2H)-furanone is a major contributor to the aroma of strawberry (<i>Fragaria</i> × <i>ananassa</i>) fruit, and the last step in its biosynthesis is catalyzed by strawberry quinone oxidoreductase (FaQR). Here, an ethylene response factor (FaERF#9) was characterized as a positive regulator of the <i>FaQR</i> promoter. Linear regression analysis indicated that <i>FaERF#9</i> transcript levels were correlated significantly with both <i>FaQR</i> transcripts and furanone content in different strawberry cultivars. Transient overexpression of <i>FaERF#9</i> in strawberry fruit significantly increased <i>FaQR</i> expression and furaneol production. Yeast one-hybrid assays, however, indicated that FaERF#9 by itself did not bind to the <i>FaQR</i> promoter. An MYB transcription factor (FaMYB98) identified in yeast one-hybrid screening of the strawberry cDNA library was capable of both binding to the promoter and activating the transcription of <i>FaQR</i> by ∼5.6-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong>. Yeast two-hybrid assay and bimolecular fluorescence complementation confirmed a direct protein-protein interaction between FaERF#9 and FaMYB98, and in combination, they activated the <i>FaQR</i> promoter 14-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong> in transactivation assays. These results indicate that an ERF-MYB complex containing FaERF#9 and FaMYB98 activates the <i>FaQR</i> promoter and up-regulates 4-hydroxy-2,5-dimethyl-3(2H)-furanone biosynthesis in strawberry.</p>

Low Vulnerability to Xylem Embolism in Leaves and Stems of North American Oaks
<p>Although recent findings suggest that xylem embolism represents a significant, drought-induced damaging process in land plants, substantial debate surrounds the capacity of long-vesseled, ring-porous species to resist embolism. We investigated whether recent methodological developments could help resolve this controversy within <i>Quercus</i>, a long-vesseled, ring-porous temperate angiosperm genus, and shed further light on the importance of xylem vulnerability to embolism as an indicator of drought tolerance. We used the optical technique to quantify leaf and stem xylem vulnerability to embolism of eight <i>Quercus</i> species from the Mediterranean-type climate region of California to examine absolute measures of resistance to embolism as well as any potential hydraulic segmentation between tissue types. We demonstrated that our optical assessment reflected flow impairment for a subset of our sample species by quantifying changes in leaf hydraulic conductance in dehydrating branches. Air-entry water potential varied 2-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong> in leaves, ranging from −1.7 ± 0.25 MPa to −3.74 ± 0.23 MPa, and 4-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong> in stems, ranging from −1.17 ± 0.04 MPa to −4.91 ± 0.3 MPa. Embolism occurred earlier in leaves than in stems in only one out of eight sample species, and plants always lost turgor before experiencing stem embolism. Our results show that long-vesseled North American <i>Quercus</i> species are more resistant to embolism than previously thought and support the hypothesis that avoiding stem embolism is a critical component of drought tolerance in woody trees. Accurately quantifying xylem vulnerability to embolism is essential for understanding species distributions along aridity gradients and predicting plant mortality during drought.</p>

A Putative Protein <i>O</i>-Fucosyltransferase Facilitates Pollen Tube Penetration through the Stigma<i>–</i>Style Interface
<p>During pollen-pistil interactions in angiosperms, the male gametophyte (pollen) germinates to produce a pollen tube. To fertilize ovules located within the female pistil, the pollen tube must physically penetrate specialized tissues. Whereas the process of pollen tube penetration through the pistil has been anatomically well described, the genetic regulation remains poorly understood. In this study, we identify a novel Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) gene, <i>O-FUCOSYLTRANSFERASE1</i> (<i>AtOFT1</i>), which plays a key role in pollen tube penetration through the stigma-style interface. Semi-in vivo growth assays demonstrate that <i>oft1</i> mutant pollen tubes have a reduced ability to penetrate the stigma-style interface, leading to a nearly 2,000-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong> decrease in <i>oft1</i> pollen transmission efficiency and a 5- to 10-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong> decreased seed set. We also demonstrate that AtOFT1 is localized to the Golgi apparatus, indicating its potential role in cellular glycosylation events. Finally, we demonstrate that <i>AtOFT1</i> and other similar Arabidopsis genes represent a novel clade of sequences related to metazoan protein <i>O</i>-fucosyltransferases and that mutation of residues that are important for <i>O</i>-fucosyltransferase activity compromises AtOFT1 function in vivo. The results of this study elucidate a physiological function for AtOFT1 in pollen tube penetration through the stigma-style interface and highlight the potential importance of protein <i>O</i>-glycosylation events in pollen-pistil interactions.</p>

Regular Motifs in Xylan Modulate Molecular Flexibility and Interactions with Cellulose Surfaces
<p>Xylan is tightly associated with cellulose and lignin in secondary plant cell walls, contributing to its rigidity and structural integrity in vascular plants. However, the molecular features and the nanoscale forces that control the interactions among cellulose microfibrils, hemicelluloses, and lignin are still not well understood. Here, we combine comprehensive mass spectrometric glycan sequencing and molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the substitution pattern in softwood xylans and to investigate the effect of distinct intramolecular motifs on xylan conformation and on the interaction with cellulose surfaces in Norway spruce (<i>Picea abies</i>). We confirm the presence of motifs with evenly spaced glycosyl decorations on the xylan backbone, together with minor motifs with consecutive glucuronation. These domains are differently enriched in xylan fractions extracted by alkali and subcritical water, which indicates their preferential positioning in the secondary plant cell wall ultrastructure. The flexibility of the 3-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong> screw conformation of xylan in solution is enhanced by the presence of arabinofuranosyl decorations. Additionally, molecular dynamic simulations suggest that the glycosyl substitutions in xylan are not only sterically tolerated by the cellulose surfaces but that they increase the affinity for cellulose and favor the stabilization of the 2-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong> screw conformation. This effect is more significant for the hydrophobic surface compared with the hydrophilic ones, which demonstrates the importance of nonpolar driving forces on the structural integrity of secondary plant cell walls. These novel molecular insights contribute to an improved understanding of the supramolecular architecture of plant secondary cell walls and have fundamental implications for overcoming lignocellulose recalcitrance and for the design of advanced wood-based materials.</p>

Efficient Plastid Transformation in Arabidopsis
<p>Plastid transformation is routine in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) but 100-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong> less frequent in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), preventing its use in plastid biology. A recent study revealed that null mutations in <i>ACC2</i>, encoding a plastid-targeted acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase, cause hypersensitivity to spectinomycin. We hypothesized that plastid transformation efficiency should increase in the <i>acc2</i> background, because when ACC2 is absent, fatty acid biosynthesis becomes dependent on translation of the plastid-encoded ACC β-carboxylase subunit. We bombarded <i>ACC2</i>-defective Arabidopsis leaves with a vector carrying a selectable spectinomycin resistance (<i>aadA</i>) gene and <i>gfp</i>, encoding the green fluorescence protein GFP. Spectinomycin-resistant clones were identified as green cell clusters on a spectinomycin medium. Plastid transformation was confirmed by GFP accumulation from the second open reading frame of a polycistronic messenger RNA, which would not be translated in the cytoplasm. We obtained one to two plastid transformation events per bombarded sample in spectinomycin-hypersensitive Slavice and Columbia <i>acc2</i> knockout backgrounds, an approximately 100-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong> enhanced plastid transformation frequency. Slavice and Columbia are accessions in which plant regeneration is uncharacterized or difficult to obtain. A practical system for Arabidopsis plastid transformation will be obtained by creating an <i>ACC2</i> null background in a regenerable Arabidopsis accession. The recognition that the duplicated ACCase in Arabidopsis is an impediment to plastid transformation provides a rational template to implement plastid transformation in related recalcitrant crops.</p>

Fueling the engine: induction of AMP-activated protein kinase in trout skeletal muscle by swimming
<p>AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is well known to be induced by exercise and to mediate important metabolic changes in the skeletal muscle of mammals. Despite the physiological importance of exercise as a modulator of energy use by locomotory muscle, the regulation of this enzyme by swimming has not been investigated in fish. We found that sustained swimming (40 days at 0.75 body lengths s<sup>−1</sup>) increased AMPK activity in red and white trout skeletal muscle (3.9- and 2.2-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong>, respectively) as well as the expression of AMPK target genes involved in energy use: lipoprotein lipase and citrate synthase in red and white muscle and CPT1β1b and PGC-1α in red muscle. Furthermore, electrical pulse stimulation of cultured trout myotubes increased AMPK activity and glucose uptake (1.9- and 1.2-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong>, respectively) in an AMPK-dependent manner. These results suggest that AMPK may play an important mediatory role in the metabolic adaptation to swimming in fish skeletal muscle.</p>

Nicotinamide Riboside Preserves Cardiac Function in a Mouse Model of Dilated Cardiomyopathy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Myocardial metabolic impairment is a major feature in chronic heart failure. As the major coenzyme in fuel oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation and a substrate for enzymes signaling energy stress and oxidative stress response, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) is emerging as a metabolic target in a number of diseases including heart failure. Little is known on the mechanisms regulating homeostasis of NAD<sup>+</sup> in the failing heart.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To explore possible alterations of NAD<sup>+</sup> homeostasis in the failing heart, we quantified the expression of NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthetic enzymes in the human failing heart and in the heart of a mouse model of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) triggered by Serum Response Factor transcription factor depletion in the heart (SRF<sup>HKO</sup>) or of cardiac hypertrophy triggered by transverse aorta constriction. We studied the impact of NAD<sup>+</sup> precursor supplementation on cardiac function in both mouse models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We observed a 30% loss in levels of NAD<sup>+</sup> in the murine failing heart of both DCM and transverse aorta constriction mice that was accompanied by a decrease in expression of the nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase enzyme that recycles the nicotinamide precursor, whereas the nicotinamide riboside kinase 2 (NMRK2) that phosphorylates the nicotinamide riboside precursor is increased, to a higher level in the DCM (40-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong>) than in transverse aorta constriction (4-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong>). This shift was also observed in human failing heart biopsies in comparison with nonfailing controls. We show that the <i>Nmrk2</i> gene is an AMP-activated protein kinase and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α responsive gene that is activated by energy stress and NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion in isolated rat cardiomyocytes. Nicotinamide riboside efficiently rescues NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis in response to FK866-mediated inhibition of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase and stimulates glycolysis in cardiomyocytes. Accordingly, we show that nicotinamide riboside supplementation in food attenuates the development of heart failure in mice, more robustly in DCM, and partially after transverse aorta constriction, by stabilizing myocardial NAD<sup>+</sup> levels in the failing heart. Nicotinamide riboside treatment also robustly increases the myocardial levels of 3 metabolites, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide, methylnicotinamide, and N1-methyl-4-pyridone-5-carboxamide, that can be used as validation biomarkers for the treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The data show that nicotinamide riboside, the most energy-efficient among NAD precursors, could be useful for treatment of heart failure, notably in the context of DCM, a disease with few therapeutic options.</p></sec>

At the index age of 45 years, the lifetime risk for any HF through 90 years of age was higher in men than women (27.4% versus 23.8%). Among HF subtypes, the lifetime risk for HFrEF was higher in men than women (10.6% versus 5.8%). In contrast, the lifetime risk for HFpEF was similar in men and women.

Augmentation of Muscle Blood Flow by Ultrasound Cavitation Is Mediated by ATP and Purinergic Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Augmentation of tissue blood flow by therapeutic ultrasound is thought to rely on convective shear. Microbubble contrast agents that undergo ultrasound-mediated cavitation markedly amplify these effects. We hypothesized that purinergic signaling is responsible for shear-dependent increases in muscle perfusion during therapeutic cavitation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Unilateral exposure of the proximal hindlimb of mice (with or without ischemia produced by iliac ligation) to therapeutic ultrasound (1.3 MHz, mechanical index 1.3) was performed for 10 minutes after intravenous injection of 2×10<sup>8</sup> lipid microbubbles. Microvascular perfusion was evaluated by low-power contrast ultrasound perfusion imaging. In vivo muscle ATP release and in vitro ATP release from endothelial cells or erythrocytes were assessed by a luciferin-luciferase assay. Purinergic signaling pathways were assessed by studying interventions that (1) accelerated ATP degradation; (2) inhibited P2Y receptors, adenosine receptors, or K<sub>ATP</sub> channels; or (3) inhibited downstream signaling pathways involving endothelial nitric oxide synthase or prostanoid production (indomethacin). Augmentation in muscle perfusion by ultrasound cavitation was assessed in a proof-of-concept clinical trial in 12 subjects with stable sickle cell disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Therapeutic ultrasound cavitation increased muscle perfusion by 7-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong> in normal mice, reversed tissue ischemia for up to 24 hours in the murine model of peripheral artery disease, and doubled muscle perfusion in patients with sickle cell disease. Augmentation in flow extended well beyond the region of ultrasound exposure. Ultrasound cavitation produced an ≈40-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong> focal and sustained increase in ATP, the source of which included both endothelial cells and erythrocytes. Inhibitory studies indicated that ATP was a critical mediator of flow augmentation that acts primarily through either P2Y receptors or adenosine produced by ectonucleotidase activity.

Functional Analysis of Cellulose Synthase (CESA) Protein Class Specificity
<p>The cellulose synthase complex (CSC) exhibits a 6-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong> symmetry and is known as a “rosette.” Each CSC is believed to contain between 18 and 24 CESA proteins that each synthesize an individual glucan chain. These chains form the microfibrils that confer the remarkable structural properties of cellulose. At least three different classes of CESA proteins are essential to form the CSC. However, while organization of the CSC determines microfibril structure, how individual CESA proteins are organized within the CSC remains unclear. Parts of the plant CESA proteins map sufficiently well onto the bacterial CESA (BcsA) structure, indicating that they are likely to share a common catalytic mechanism. However, plant CESA proteins are much larger than the bacterial BcsA protein, prompting the suggestion that these plant-specific regions are important for interactions between CESA proteins and for conferring CESA class specificity. In this study, we have undertaken a comprehensive analysis of well-defined regions of secondary cell wall CESA proteins, with the aim of defining what distinguishes different CESA proteins and hence what determines the specificity of each CESA class. Our results demonstrate that CESA class specificity extends throughout the protein and not just in the highly variable regions. Furthermore, we find that different CESA isoforms vary greatly in their levels of site specificity and this is likely to be determined by the constraints imposed by their position within the CSC rather than their primary structure.</p>

Proteomes and Ubiquitylomes Analysis Reveals the Involvement of Ubiquitination in Protein Degradation in Petunias
<p>Petal senescence is a complex programmed process. It has been demonstrated previously that treatment with ethylene, a plant hormone involved in senescence, can extensively alter transcriptome and proteome profiles in plants. However, little is known regarding the impact of ethylene on posttranslational modification (PTM) or the association between PTM and the proteome. Protein degradation is one of the hallmarks of senescence, and ubiquitination, a major PTM in eukaryotes, plays important roles in protein degradation. In this study, we first obtained reference petunia (<i>Petunia hybrida</i>) transcriptome data via RNA sequencing. Next, we quantitatively investigated the petunia proteome and ubiquitylome and the association between them in petunia corollas following ethylene treatment. In total, 51,799 unigenes, 3,606 proteins, and 2,270 ubiquitination sites were quantified 16 h after ethylene treatment. Treatment with ethylene resulted in 14,448 down-regulated and 6,303 up-regulated unigenes (absolute log<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong> change > 1 and false discovery rate < 0.001), 284 down-regulated and 233 up-regulated proteins, and 320 up-regulated and 127 down-regulated ubiquitination sites using a 1.5-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong> threshold (<i>P</i> < 0.05), indicating that global ubiquitination levels increase during ethylene-mediated corolla senescence in petunia. Several putative ubiquitin ligases were up-regulated at the protein and transcription levels. Our results showed that the global proteome and ubiquitylome were negatively correlated and that ubiquitination could be involved in the degradation of proteins during ethylene-mediated corolla senescence in petunia. Ethylene regulates hormone signaling transduction pathways at both the protein and ubiquitination levels in petunia corollas. In addition, our results revealed that ethylene increases the ubiquitination levels of proteins involved in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation.</p>

Calcium Deficiency Triggers Phloem Remobilization of Cadmium in a Hyperaccumulating Species
<p>Understanding cadmium (Cd) accumulation in plants is critical for the development of plant-based strategies for soil remediation and crop safety. <i>Sedum alfredii</i> is a nonbrassica plant species known to hyperaccumulate Cd. The characteristics of Cd uptake, distribution, and retranslocation affected by the Ca status were investigated at cellular levels in <i>S. alfredii</i>. Low Ca supply significantly increased Cd contents in shoots of <i>S. alfredii</i>, particularly in the young leaves. Micro x-ray fluorescence images confirmed that sequestration of Cd was greatly enhanced in the young leaves under Ca deficiency stress, with a significant amount of Cd localized in mesophyll cells, compared to the young leaves supplied with high Ca levels. Cd influx into protoplasts isolated from young leaves was significantly inhibited by the addition of Ca channel inhibitors, but not by pre-exposure to Ca deficiency. In stems, the Cd signal in vascular systems under low Ca levels was 10-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong> higher than in those treated with higher Ca levels. A detailed investigation of vascular bundles revealed that an extremely high Cd signal induced by low Ca supply occurred in the phloem tissues, but not in the xylem tissues. Transfer of Cd pretreated plants to nutrient solutions at different Ca levels confirmed that a much higher amount of Cd was reallocated to the new growth tissues under low Ca stress compared to plants supplied with sufficient Ca. These results suggest that Ca deficiency triggered a highly efficient phloem remobilization of Cd in <i>S. alfredii</i> and subsequently enhanced Cd accumulation in its young leaves.</p>

Transcriptome and Degradome Sequencing Reveals Dormancy Mechanisms of <i>Cunninghamia lanceolata</i> Seeds<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Seeds with physiological dormancy usually experience primary and secondary dormancy in the nature; however, little is known about the differential regulation of primary and secondary dormancy. We combined multiple approaches to investigate cytological changes, hormonal levels, and gene expression dynamics in <i>Cunninghamia lanceolata</i> seeds during primary dormancy release and secondary dormancy induction. Light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy revealed that protein bodies in the embryo cells coalesced during primary dormancy release and then separated during secondary dormancy induction. Transcriptomic profiling demonstrated that expression of genes negatively regulating gibberellic acid (GA) sensitivity reduced specifically during primary dormancy release, whereas the expression of genes positively regulating abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis increased during secondary dormancy induction. Parallel analysis of RNA ends revealed uncapped transcripts for ∼55% of all unigenes. A negative correlation between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong> changes in expression levels of uncapped versus capped mRNAs was observed during primary dormancy release. However, this correlation was loose during secondary dormancy induction. Our analyses suggest that the reversible changes in cytology and gene expression during dormancy release and induction are related to ABA/GA balance. Moreover, mRNA degradation functions as a critical posttranscriptional regulator during primary dormancy release. These findings provide a mechanistic framework for understanding physiological dormancy in seeds.</p>

Evolution of Protein Domain Repeats in Metazoa
<p>Repeats are ubiquitous elements of proteins and they play important roles for cellular function and during evolution. Repeats are, however, also notoriously difficult to capture computationally and large scale studies so far had difficulties in linking genetic causes, structural properties and evolutionary trajectories of protein repeats. Here we apply recently developed methods for repeat detection and analysis to a large dataset comprising over hundred metazoan genomes. We find that repeats in larger protein families experience generally very few insertions or deletions (indels) of repeat units but there is also a significant fraction of noteworthy volatile outliers with very high indel rates. Analysis of structural data indicates that repeats with an open structure and independently <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong>ing units are more volatile and more likely to be intrinsically disordered. Such disordered repeats are also significantly enriched in sites with a high functional potential such as linear motifs. Furthermore, the most volatile repeats have a high sequence similarity between their units. Since many volatile repeats also show signs of recombination, we conclude they are often shaped by concerted evolution. Intriguingly, many of these conserved yet volatile repeats are involved in host-pathogen interactions where they might foster fast but subtle adaptation in biological arms races.</p><p><bold><i>Key Words</i>:</bold> protein evolution, domain rearrangements, protein repeats, concerted evolution.</p>

Whole-Genome Sequencing of Tibetan Macaque (<i>Macaca thibetana</i>) Provides New Insight into the Macaque Evolutionary History
<p>Macaques are the most widely distributed nonhuman primates and used as animal models in biomedical research. The availability of full-genome sequences from them would be essential to both biomedical and primate evolutionary studies. Previous studies have reported whole-genome sequences from rhesus macaque (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>) and cynomolgus macaque (<i>M. fascicularis</i>, CE), both of which belong to the <i>fascicularis</i> group. Here, we present a 37-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong> coverage genome sequence of the Tibetan macaque (<i>M. thibetana</i>; TM). TM is an endemic species to China belonging to the <i>sinica</i> group<i>.</i> On the basis of mapping to the rhesus macaque genome, we identified approximately 11.9 million single-nucleotide variants), of which 3.9 million were TM specific, as assessed by comparison two Chinese rhesus macaques (CR) and two CE genomes. Some genes carried TM-specific homozygous nonsynonymous variants (TSHNVs), which were scored as deleterious in human by both PolyPhen-2 and SIFT (Sorting Tolerant From Intolerant) and were enriched in the eye disease genes. In total, 273 immune response and disease-related genes carried at least one TSHNV. The heterozygosity rates of two CRs (0.002617 and 0.002612) and two CEs (0.003004 and 0.003179) were approximately three times higher than that of TM (0.000898). Polymerase chain reaction resequencing of 18 TM individuals showed that 29 TSHNVs exhibited high allele frequencies, thus confirming their low heterozygosity. Genome-wide genetic divergence analysis demonstrated that TM was more closely related to CR than to CE. We further detected unusual low divergence regions between TM and CR. In addition, after applying statistical criteria to detect putative introgression regions (PIRs) in the TM genome, up to 239,620 kb PIRs (8.84% of the genome) were identified. Given that TM and CR have overlapping geographical distributions, had the same refuge during the Middle Pleistocene, and show similar mating behaviors, it is highly likely that there was an ancient introgression event between them. Moreover, demographic inferences revealed that TM exhibited a similar demographic history as other macaques until 0.5 Ma, but then it maintained a lower effective population size until present time. Our study has provided new insight into the macaque evolutionary history, confirming hybridization events between macaque species groups based on genome-wide data.</p>

Physiological basis of starvation resistance in <i>Drosophila leontia</i>: analysis of sexual dimorphism
<p>Geographically varying starvation stress has often been considered as a natural selector that constrains between-population differences for starvation resistance (SR) in <i>Drosophila</i> species. On the Indian subcontinent, a dozen <i>Drosophila</i> species have shown clinal variations in SR across latitude, but the evolved physiological basis of such contrasting adaptations is largely unknown. In the present study, I untangled the physiological basis of sex-specific as well as between-population divergence for SR in <i>D. leontia</i>, collected across a latitudinal transect of the Indian subcontinent (11°45′–31°19′N). Secondly, I tested the assumptions that hardening to starvation stress facilitates an increased survival under subsequent lethal levels of starvation, and such plastic effects differ between the sexes. I observed several interesting results. In contrast to a steeper cline of starvation-related traits with latitude in females, a shallower gradient was observed for males. Females stored higher (~1.3-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong>) dry-mass-specific levels of body lipids and glycogen contents, and utilized these both of these energy resources under starvation stress, whereas the starved males metabolized only body lipids as a source of energy. Conversely, the rate of body lipid utilization and threshold need were considerably higher in females as compared with males. Between-population differences were significant for storage levels of energy reserves only, but not for other avenues (rate of metabolite utilization and threshold need) of SR for both sexes. These findings indicate that multiple pathways shape the physiological basis of sexual dimorphism for SR in <i>D. leontia</i>. Further, single or multiple bouts of starvation hardening conferred an increased longevity (~4–9 h; <i>P</i><0.001) under subsequent lethal levels of starvation stress for females only, and such plastic responses were consistent with a decrease in rate of metabolite utilization. Nevertheless, between-population effects were non-significant for absolute hardening capacity (AHC=<i>K</i><sub>SR</sub>–C). Altogether, these findings suggest that similar evolutionary constraints have resulted in divergent genetic as well as plastic responses to evolve adaptations under starvation stress, and account for the observed sexual dimorphism for basal SR in <i>D. leontia</i>.</p>

Regulation of succinate-fuelled mitochondrial respiration in liver and skeletal muscle of hibernating thirteen-lined ground squirrels
<p>Hibernating ground squirrels (<i>Ictidomys tridecemlineatus</i>) alternate between two distinct metabolic states throughout winter: torpor, during which metabolic rate (MR) and body temperature (<i>T</i><sub>b</sub>) are considerably suppressed, and interbout euthermia (IBE), during which MR and <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> briefly return to euthermic levels. Previous studies showed suppression of succinate-fuelled respiration during torpor in liver and skeletal muscle mitochondria; however, these studies used only a single, saturating succinate concentration. Therefore, they could not address whether mitochondrial metabolic suppression occurs under physiological substrate concentrations or whether differences in the kinetics of mitochondrial responses to changing substrate concentration might also contribute to mitochondrial metabolic regulation during torpor. The present study confirmed that succinate oxidation is reduced during torpor in liver and skeletal muscle at 37 and 10°C over a 100-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong> range of succinate concentrations. At 37°C, this suppression resulted from inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), which had a greater affinity for oxaloacetate (an SDH inhibitor) during torpor. At 10°C, SDH was not inhibited, suggesting that SDH inhibition initiates but does not maintain mitochondrial suppression during torpor. Moreover, in both liver and skeletal muscle, mitochondria from torpid animals maintained relatively higher respiration rates at low succinate concentrations, which reduces the extent of energy savings that can be achieved during torpor, but may also maintain mitochondrial oxidative capacity above some lower critical threshold, thereby preventing cellular and/or mitochondrial injury during torpor and facilitating rapid recruitment of oxidative capacity during arousal.</p>

Obesity in total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The purpose of our study is to summarise the current scientific   findings regarding the impact of obesity on total hip arthroplasty   (THA); specifically the influence of obesity on the timing of THA,   incidence of complications, and effect on clinical and functional   outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We performed a systematic review that was compliant with the   Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses   guidelines to identify prospective studies from the PubMed/Medline,   Embase, and Cochrane Library databases that evaluated primary THA   in obese (body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were 17 articles included in the review, which encompassed   13 722 THA patients.

The use of ultra-low-dose CT scans for the evaluation of limb fractures
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To evaluate whether an ultra-low-dose CT protocol can diagnose   selected limb fractures as well as conventional CT (C-CT).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We prospectively studied 40 consecutive patients with a limb   fracture in whom a CT scan was indicated. These were scanned using   an ultra-low-dose CT Reduced Effective Dose Using Computed Tomography   In Orthopaedic Injury (REDUCTION) protocol. Studies from 16 selected   cases were compared with 16 C-CT scans matched for age, gender and   type of fracture. Studies were assessed for diagnosis and image   quality. Descriptive and reliability statistics were calculated.   The total effective radiation dose for each scanned site was compared.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean estimated effective dose (ED) for the REDUCTION protocol   was 0.03 milliSieverts (mSv) and 0.43 mSv (p < 0.005) for C-CT.   The sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value   (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the REDUCTION protocol   to detect fractures were 0.98, 0.89, 0.98 and 0.89 respectively   when two occult fractures were excluded. Inter- and intra-observer   reliability for diagnosis using the REDUCTION protocol (κ = 0.75, κ =   0.71) were similar to those of C-CT (κ = 0.85, κ = 0.82). Using   the REDUCTION protocol, 3D CT reconstructions were equivalent in   quality and diagnostic information to those generated by C-CT (κ =   0.87, κ = 0.94).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>With a near 14-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong> reduction in estimated ED compared with C-CT,   the REDUCTION protocol reduces the amount of CT radiation substantially   without significant diagnostic decay. It produces images that appear   to be comparable with those of C-CT for evaluating fractures of   the limbs.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2016;98-B:1668-73.</p></sec>

Association of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection and Risk of Peripheral Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The effect of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on the development of peripheral artery disease (PAD) remains unclear. We investigated whether HIV infection is associated with an increased risk of PAD after adjustment for traditional atherosclerotic risk factors in a large cohort of HIV-infected (HIV+) and demographically similar HIV-uninfected veterans.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied participants in the Veterans Aging Cohort Study from April 1, 2003 through December 31, 2014. We excluded participants with known prior PAD or prevalent cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary heart disease, and congestive heart failure) and analyzed the effect of HIV status on the risk of incident PAD events after adjusting for demographics, PAD risk factors, substance use, CD4 cell count, HIV-1 ribonucleic acid, and antiretroviral therapy. The primary outcome is incident peripheral artery disease events. Secondary outcomes include mortality and amputation in subjects with incident PAD events by HIV infection status, viral load, and CD4 count.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 91 953 participants, over a median follow up of 9.0 years, there were 7708 incident PAD events. Rates of incident PAD events per 1000 person-years were higher among HIV+ (11.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 11.5–12.4) than uninfected veterans (9.9; 95% CI, 9.6–10.1). After adjustment for demographics, PAD risk factors, and other covariates, HIV+ veterans had an increased risk of incident PAD events compared with uninfected veterans (hazard ratio [HR], 1.19; 95% CI, 1.13–1.25). This risk was highest among those with time-updated HIV viral load >500 copies/mL (HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.38–1.65) and CD4 cell counts <200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> (HR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.71–2.13). In contrast, HIV+ veterans with time updated CD4 cell count ≥500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> had no increased risk of PAD (HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.96–1.11). Mortality rates after incident PAD events are high regardless of HIV status. HIV infection did not affect rates of amputation after incident PAD events.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Infection with HIV is associated with a 19% increased risk of PAD beyond that explained by traditional atherosclerotic risk factors. However, for those with sustained CD4 cell counts <200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, the risk of incident PAD events is nearly 2-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fold</span></strong> higher whereas for those with sustained CD4 cell counts ≥500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> there is no excess risk of incident PAD events compared with uninfected people.</p></sec>

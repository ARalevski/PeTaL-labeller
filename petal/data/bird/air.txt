Intense threat switches dorsal raphe serotonin neurons to a paradoxical operational mode
<p>Survival depends on the selection of behaviors adaptive for the current <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment. For example, a mouse should run from a rapidly looming hawk but should freeze if the hawk is coasting across the sky. Although serotonin has been implicated in adaptive behavior, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>mental regulation of its functional role remains poorly understood. In mice, we found that stimulation of dorsal raphe serotonin neurons suppressed movement in low- and moderate-threat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments but induced escape behavior in high-threat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments, and that movement-related dorsal raphe serotonin neural dynamics inverted in high-threat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments. Stimulation of dorsal raphe γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons promoted movement in negative but not positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments, and movement-related GABA neural dynamics inverted between positive and negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments. Thus, dorsal raphe circuits switch between distinct operational modes to promote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment-specific adaptive behaviors.</p>

Mars’ atmospheric history derived from upper-atmosphere measurements of <sup>38</sup>Ar/<sup>36</sup>Ar
<p>The history of Mars’ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e is important for understanding the geological evolution and potential habitability of the planet. We determine the amount of gas lost to space through time using measurements of the upper-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic structure made by the Mars <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) spacecraft. We derive the structure of <sup>38</sup>Ar/<sup>36</sup>Ar between the homopause and exobase altitudes. Fractionation of argon occurs as a result of loss of gas to space by pickup-ion sputtering, which preferentially removes the lighter atom. The measurements require that 66% of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic argon has been lost to space. Thus, a large fraction of Mars’ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic gas has been lost to space, contributing to the transition in climate from an early, warm, wet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment to today’s cold, dry <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e.</p>

Above- and belowground controls on water use by trees of different wood types in an eastern US deciduous forest
<p>Stomata control tree transpiration by sensing and integrating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>mental signals originating in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e and soil, and co-occurring species may differ in inherent stomatal sensitivity to these above- and belowground signals and in the types of signals to which they respond. Stomatal responsiveness to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>mental signals is likely to differ across species having different types of wood (e.g., ring-porous, diffuse-porous and coniferous) because each wood type differs in the structure, size and spatial distribution of its xylem conduits as well as in the scaling of hydraulic properties with stem diameter. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of variation in soil water availability and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic evaporative demand on stomatal regulation of transpiration in seven co-occurring temperate deciduous forest species representing three wood types. We measured whole-tree sap flux and soil and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic variables in a mixed deciduous forest in central Pennsylvania over the course of a growing season characterized by severe drought and large fluctuations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic vapor pressure deficit (<i>D</i>). The relative sensitivity of sap flux to soil drying was ∼2.2–2.3 times greater in the diffuse-porous and coniferous species than in the ring-porous species. Stomata of the ring-porous oaks were only about half as responsive to increased <i>D</i> as those of trees of the other two wood types. These differences in responsiveness to changes in the below- and aboveground <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment implied that regulation of leaf water potential in the ring-porous oaks was less stringent than that in the diffuse-porous angiosperms or the conifers. The results suggest that increases in the frequency or intensity of summer droughts in the study region could have multiple consequences for forest function, including altered successional time courses or climax species composition and cumulative effects on whole-tree architecture, resulting in a structural and physiological legacy that would restrict the ability of trees to respond rapidly to more favorable growth conditions.</p>

Chemical interactions between Saturn’s atmosphere and its rings

The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic He/H<sub>2</sub> ratio is 10 to 16%.

Spatially structured cell populations process multiple sensory signals in parallel in intact vascular endothelium
<p>Blood flow, blood clotting, angiogenesis, vascular permeability, and vascular remodeling are each controlled by a large number of variable, noisy, and interacting chemical inputs to the vascular endothelium. The endothelium processes the entirety of the chemical composition to which the cardiovascular system is exposed, carrying out sophisticated computations that determine physiological output. Processing this enormous quantity of information is a major challenge facing the endothelium. We analyzed the responses of hundreds of endothelial cells to carbachol (CCh) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and found that the endothelium segregates the responses to these two distinct components of the chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment into separate streams of complementary information that are processed in parallel. Sensitivities to CCh and ATP mapped to different clusters of cells, and each agonist generated distinct signal patterns. The distinct signals were features of agonist activation rather than properties of the cells themselves. When there was more than one stimulus present, the cells communicated and combined inputs to generate new distinct signals that were nonlinear combinations of the inputs. Our results demonstrate that the endothelium is a structured, collaborative sensory network that simplifies the complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment using separate cell clusters that are sensitive to distinct aspects of the overall biochemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment and interactively compute signals from diverse but interrelated chemical inputs. These features enable the endothelium to selectively process separate signals and perform multiple computations in an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment that is noisy and variable.</p>

Dust grains fall from Saturn’s D-ring into its equatorial upper atmosphere
<p>The sizes of Saturn’s ring particles range from meters (boulders) to nanometers (dust). Determination of the rings’ ages depends on loss processes, including the transport of dust into Saturn’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e. During the Grand Finale orbits of the Cassini spacecraft, its instruments measured tiny dust grains that compose the innermost D-ring of Saturn. The nanometer-sized dust experiences collisions with exospheric (upper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e) hydrogen and molecular hydrogen, which forces it to fall from the ring into the ionosphere and lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e. We used the Magnetospheric Imaging Instrument to detect and characterize this dust transport and also found that diffusion dominates above and near the altitude of peak ionospheric density. This mechanism results in a mass deposition into the equatorial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e of ~5 kilograms per second, constraining the age of the D-ring.</p>

HAT-P-26b: A Neptune-mass exoplanet with a well-constrained heavy element abundance
<p>A correlation between giant-planet mass and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic heavy elemental abundance was first noted in the past century from observations of planets in our own Solar System and has served as a cornerstone of planet-formation theory. Using data from the Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes from 0.5 to 5 micrometers, we conducted a detailed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic study of the transiting Neptune-mass exoplanet HAT-P-26b.

Using the water abundance as a proxy for metallicity, we measured HAT-P-26b’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic heavy element content ([Formula] times solar).

Global atmospheric particle formation from CERN CLOUD measurements
<p>Fundamental questions remain about the origin of newly formed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic aerosol particles because data from laboratory measurements have been insufficient to build global models. In contrast, gas-phase chemistry models have been based on laboratory kinetics measurements for decades. We built a global model of aerosol formation by using extensive laboratory measurements of rates of nucleation involving sulfuric acid, ammonia, ions, and organic compounds conducted in the CERN CLOUD (Cosmics Leaving Outdoor Droplets) chamber. The simulations and a comparison with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic observations show that nearly all nucleation throughout the present-day <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e involves ammonia or biogenic organic compounds, in addition to sulfuric acid. A considerable fraction of nucleation involves ions, but the relatively weak dependence on ion concentrations indicates that for the processes studied, variations in cosmic ray intensity do not appreciably affect climate through nucleation in the present-day <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e.</p>

Schema cells in the macaque hippocampus

In both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments, animals searched for a hidden reward goal only defined in relation to landmarks. With learning, many neurons developed a firing map integrating goal-centered and task-related information of the novel maze that matched that for the familiar maze.

Spectrally resolved helium absorption from the extended atmosphere of a warm Neptune-mass exoplanet
<p>Stellar heating causes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>es of close-in exoplanets to expand and escape. These extended <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>es are difficult to observe because their main spectral signature—neutral hydrogen at ultraviolet wavelengths—is strongly absorbed by interstellar medium. We report the detection of the near-infrared triplet of neutral helium in the transiting warm Neptune-mass exoplanet HAT-P-11b by using ground-based, high-resolution observations. The helium feature is repeatable over two independent transits, with an average absorption depth of 1.08 ± 0.05%. Interpreting absorption spectra with three-dimensional simulations of the planet’s upper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e suggests that it extends beyond 5 planetary radii, with a large-scale height and a helium mass loss rate of ≲3 × 10<sup>5</sup> grams per second.

A radiation belt of energetic protons located between Saturn and its rings
<p>Saturn has a sufficiently strong dipole magnetic field to trap high-energy charged particles and form radiation belts, which have been observed outside its rings.

Diatom ooze—A large marine mercury sink
<p>The role of algae for sequestration of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic mercury in the ocean is largely unknown owing to a lack of marine sediment data.

Diatom ooze exhibits the highest mercury accumulation rates ever reported for the marine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment and provides a large sink of anthropogenic mercury, surpassing existing model estimates by as much as a factor of 7. Anthropogenic pollution of the Southern Ocean began ~150 years ago, and up to 20% of anthropogenic mercury emitted to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e may have been stored in diatom ooze. These findings reveal the crucial role of diatoms as a fast vector for mercury sequestration and diatom ooze as a large marine mercury sink.</p>

Ancient convergent losses of <i>Paraoxonase 1</i> yield potential risks for modern marine mammals
<p>Mammals diversified by colonizing drastically different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments, with each transition yielding numerous molecular changes, including losses of protein function. Though not initially deleterious, these losses could subsequently carry deleterious pleiotropic consequences. We have used phylogenetic methods to identify convergent functional losses across independent marine mammal lineages. In one extreme case, <i>Paraoxonase 1</i> (<i>PON1</i>) accrued lesions in all marine lineages, while remaining intact in all terrestrial mammals. These lesions coincide with PON1 enzymatic activity loss in marine species’ blood plasma. This convergent loss is likely explained by parallel shifts in marine ancestors’ lipid metabolism and/or bloodstream oxidative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment affecting PON1’s role in fatty acid oxidation. PON1 loss also eliminates marine mammals’ main defense against neurotoxicity from specific man-made organophosphorus compounds, implying potential risks in modern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments.</p>

Convergent evidence for widespread rock nitrogen sources in Earth’s surface environment

Evidence drawn from the planet’s nitrogen balance, geochemical proxies, and our spatial weathering model reveal that ~19 to 31 teragrams of nitrogen are mobilized from near-surface rocks annually. About 11 to 18 teragrams of this nitrogen are chemically weathered in situ, thereby increasing the unmanaged (preindustrial) terrestrial nitrogen balance from 8 to 26%. These findings provide a global perspective to reconcile Earth’s nitrogen budget, with implications for nutrient-driven controls over the terrestrial carbon sink.</p>

Heterochronic Genes Turn Back the Clock in Old Neurons
<p>Although some neuron types regenerate better than others, all neurons lose the ability to regenerate with age. This intrinsic decline is the primary cause of regeneration failure even in permissive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments. This was shown in 1995 by comparing the regeneration ability of retinal neurons from different aged retinas growing into tectums of different ages (<i>1</i>). Embryonic retinal axons regrew into tectum of any age, including older tectum with an inhibitory glial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment, whereas postnatal day 2 or older retinal axons failed to regrow even into embryonic tectum. This indicated a “programmed” loss of axon regeneration ability with neuron age. Similarly, young hindbrain neurons transplanted into older spinal cords could regenerate axons into a normally inhibitory myelinated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment (<i>2</i>). Despite the clear therapeutic implications of these observations, the underlying molecular mechanisms controlling age-dependent regenerative capacity were unclear. On page 372 in this issue, Zou <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) report that the highly conserved <i>let-7</i>–LIN-41 heterochronic signaling pathway is responsible for part of the age-related decline in axon regeneration in the worm <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>.</p>

EZ-Root-VIS: A Software Pipeline for the Rapid Analysis and Visual Reconstruction of Root System Architecture
<p>If we want to understand how the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment has shaped the appearance and behavior of living creatures, we need to compare groups of individuals that differ in genetic makeup and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment experience. For complex phenotypic features, such as body posture or facial expression in humans, comparison is not straightforward because some of the contributing factors cannot easily be quantified or averaged across individuals. Therefore, computational methods are used to reconstruct representative prototypes using a range of algorithms for filling in missing information and calculating means. The same problem applies to the root system architecture (RSA) of plants. Several computer programs are available for extracting numerical data from root images, but they usually do not offer customized data analysis or visual reconstruction of RSA. We developed Root-VIS, a free software tool that facilitates the determination of means and variance of many different RSA features across user-selected sets of root images. Furthermore, Root-VIS offers several options to generate visual reconstructions of root systems from the averaged data to enable screening and modeling. We confirmed the suitability of Root-VIS, combined with a new version of EZ-Rhizo, for the rapid characterization of genotype-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment interactions and gene discovery through genome-wide association studies in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>).</p>

Mineral Deposits in <i>Ficus</i> Leaves: Morphologies and Locations in Relation to Function
<p><i>Ficus</i> trees are adapted to diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments and have some of the highest rates of photosynthesis among trees. <i>Ficus</i> leaves can deposit one or more of the three major mineral types found in leaves: amorphous calcium carbonate cystoliths, calcium oxalates, and silica phytoliths. In order to better understand the functions of these minerals and the control that the leaf exerts over mineral deposition, we investigated leaves from 10 <i>Ficus</i> species from vastly different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments (Rehovot, Israel; Bologna, Italy; Issa Valley, Tanzania; and Ngogo, Uganda). We identified the mineral locations in the soft tissues, the relative distributions of the minerals, and mineral volume contents using microcomputed tomography. Each <i>Ficus</i> species is characterized by a unique 3D mineral distribution that is preserved in different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments. The mineral distribution patterns are generally different on the adaxial and abaxial sides of the leaf. All species examined have abundant calcium oxalate deposits around the veins. We used micromodulated fluorimetry to examine the effect of cystoliths on photosynthetic efficiency in two species having cystoliths abaxially and adaxially (<i>Ficus</i> <i>microcarpa</i>) or only abaxially (<i>Ficus</i> <i>carica</i>). In <i>F. microcarpa</i>, both adaxial and abaxial cystoliths efficiently contributed to light redistribution inside the leaf and, hence, increased photosynthetic efficiency, whereas in <i>F. carica</i>, the abaxial cystoliths did not increase photosynthetic efficiency.</p>

A Dynamic Hydro-Mechanical and Biochemical Model of Stomatal Conductance for C<sub>4</sub> Photosynthesis
<p>C<sub>4</sub> plants are major grain (maize [<i>Zea mays</i>] and sorghum [<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>]), sugar (sugarcane [<i>Saccharum officinarum</i>]), and biofuel (<i>Miscanthus</i> spp.) producers and contribute ∼20% to global productivity. Plants lose water through stomatal pores in order to acquire CO<sub>2</sub> (assimilation [<i>A</i>]) and control their carbon-for-water balance by regulating stomatal conductance (<i>g</i><sub>S</sub>). The ability to mechanistically predict <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> and <i>A</i> in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic CO<sub>2</sub>, water availability, and time is critical for simulating stomatal control of plant-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic carbon and water exchange under current, past, or future <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>mental conditions. Yet, dynamic mechanistic models for <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> are lacking, especially for C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. We developed and coupled a hydromechanical model of stomatal behavior with a biochemical model of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis, calibrated using gas-exchange measurements in maize, and extended the coupled model with time-explicit functions to predict dynamic responses. We demonstrated the wider applicability of the model with three additional C<sub>4</sub> grass species in which interspecific differences in stomatal behavior could be accounted for by fitting a single parameter. The model accurately predicted steady-state responses of <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> to light, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic CO<sub>2</sub> and oxygen, soil drying, and evaporative demand as well as dynamic responses to light intensity. Further analyses suggest that the effect of variable leaf hydraulic conductance is negligible. Based on the model, we derived a set of equations suitable for incorporation in land surface models. Our model illuminates the processes underpinning stomatal control in C<sub>4</sub> plants and suggests that the hydraulic benefits associated with fast stomatal responses of C<sub>4</sub> grasses may have supported the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis.</p>

The Liverwort, <i>Marchantia</i>, Drives Alternative Electron Flow Using a Flavodiiron Protein to Protect PSI
<p>The diffusion efficiency of oxygen in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e, like that of CO<sub>2</sub>, is approximately 10<sup>4</sup> times greater than that in aqueous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments. Consequently, terrestrial photosynthetic organisms need mechanisms to protect against potential oxidative damage. The liverwort <i>Marchantia polymorpha</i>, a basal land plant, has habitats where it is exposed to both water and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e. Furthermore, like cyanobacteria, <i>M. polymorpha</i> has genes encoding flavodiiron proteins (FLV). In cyanobacteria, FLVs mediate oxygen-dependent alternative electron flow (AEF) to suppress the production of reactive oxygen species. Here, we investigated whether FLVs are required for the protection of photosynthesis in <i>M. polymorpha</i>. A mutant deficient in the FLV1 isozyme (Δ<i>MpFlv1</i>) sustained photooxidative damage to photosystem I (PSI) following repetitive short-saturation pulses of light. Compared with the wild type (Takaragaike-1), Δ<i>MpFlv1</i> showed the same photosynthetic oxygen evolution rate but a lower electron transport rate during the induction phase of photosynthesis. Additionally, the reaction center chlorophyll in PSI, P700, was highly reduced in Δ<i>MpFlv1</i> but not in Takaragaike-1. These results indicate that the gene product of <i>MpFlv1</i> drives AEF to oxidize PSI, as in cyanobacteria. Furthermore, FLV-mediated AEF supports the production of a proton motive force to possibly induce the nonphotochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence and suppress electron transport in the cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub>/<i>f</i> complex. After submerging the thalli, a decrease in photosystem II operating efficiency was observed, particularly in Δ<i>MpFlv1</i>, which implies that species living in these sorts of habitats require FLV-mediated AEF.</p>

Genomic Basis of Adaptive Evolution: The Survival of Amur Ide (<i>Leuciscu</i>s <i>waleckii</i>) in an Extremely Alkaline Environment
<p>The Amur ide (<i>Leuciscus waleckii</i>) is a cyprinid fish that is widely distributed in Northeast Asia. The Lake Dali Nur population inhabits one of the most extreme aquatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments on Earth, with an alkalinity up to 50 mmol/L (pH 9.6), thus providing an exceptional model with which to characterize the mechanisms of genomic evolution underlying adaptation to extreme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments. Here, we developed the reference genome assembly for <i>L. waleckii</i> from Lake Dali Nur. Intriguingly, we identified unusual expanded long terminal repeats (LTRs) with higher nucleotide substitution rates than in many other teleosts, suggesting their more recent insertion into the <i>L. waleckii</i> genome. We also identified expansions in genes encoding egg coat proteins and natriuretic peptide receptors, possibly underlying the adaptation to extreme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>mental stress. We further sequenced the genomes of 10 additional individuals from freshwater and 18 from Lake Dali Nur populations, and we detected a total of 7.6 million SNPs from both populations. In a genome scan and comparison of these two populations, we identified a set of genomic regions under selective sweeps that harbor genes involved in ion homoeostasis, acid-base regulation, unfolded protein response, reactive oxygen species elimination, and urea excretion. Our findings provide comprehensive insight into the genomic mechanisms of teleost fish that underlie their adaptation to extreme alkaline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments.</p>

Genetic and phenotypically flexible components of seasonal variation in immune function
<p>Animals cope with seasonal variation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>mental factors by adjustments of physiology and life history. When seasonal variation is partly predictable, such adjustments can be based on a genetic component or be phenotypically flexible. Animals have to allocate limited resources over different demands, including immune function. Accordingly, immune traits could change seasonally, and such changes could have a genetic component that differs between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments. We tested this hypothesis in genotypically distinct groups of a widespread songbird, the stonechat (<i>Saxicola torquata</i>). We compared variation in immunity during 1 year in long-distance migrants, short-distance migrants, tropical residents and hybrids in a common garden <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment. Additionally, we investigated phenotypically flexible responses to temperature by applying different temperature regimes to one group. We assessed constitutive immunity by measuring hemagglutination, hemolysis, haptoglobin and bactericidal ability against <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. Genotypic groups differed in patterns of variation of all measured immune indices except haptoglobin. Hybrids differed from, but were rarely intermediate to, parental subspecies. Temperature treatment only influenced patterns of hemolysis and bactericidal ability against <i>E. coli.</i> We conclude that seasonal variation in constitutive immunity has a genetic component, that heredity does not follow simple Mendelian rules, and that some immune measures are relatively rigid while others are more flexible. Furthermore, our results support the idea that seasonal variability in constitutive immunity is associated with variability in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment and annual-cycle demands. This study stresses the importance of considering seasonal variation in immune function in relation to the ecology and life history of the organism of interest.</p>

Brains over brawn: experience overcomes a size disadvantage in fish social hierarchies
<p>Life experiences can alter cognitive abilities and subsequent behavior. Here we asked whether differences in experience could affect social status. In hierarchical animal societies, high-ranking males that typically win aggressive encounters gain territories and hence access to mates. To understand the relative contributions of social experience and physical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment on status, we used a highly territorial African cichlid fish species, <i>Astatotilapia burtoni</i>, that lives in a dynamic lek-like social hierarchy. <i>Astatotilapia burtoni</i> males are either dominant or submissive and can switch status rapidly depending on the local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment. Although dominant males are innately aggressive, we wondered whether they modulated their aggression based on experience. We hypothesized that as males mature they might hone their fighting tactics based on observation of other males fighting. We compared males of different ages and sizes in distinctly different physical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments and subsequently tested their fighting skills. We found that a size difference previously thought negligible (<10% body length) gave a significant advantage to the larger opponent. In contrast, we found no evidence that increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>mental complexity affected status outcomes. Surprisingly, we found that males only a few days older than their opponents had a significant advantage during territorial disputes so that being older compensated for the disadvantage of being smaller. Moreover, the slightly older winners exploited a consistent fighting strategy, starting with lower levels of aggression on the first day that significantly increased on the second day, a pattern absent in younger winners. These data suggest that experience is an advantage during fights for status, and that social learning provides more relevant experience than the physical complexity of the territory.</p>

Thermal tolerance breadths among groundwater crustaceans living in a thermally constant environment
<p>The climate variability hypothesis assumes that the thermal tolerance breadth of a species is primarily determined by temperature variations experienced in its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment. If so, aquatic invertebrates living in thermally buffered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments would be expected to exhibit narrow thermal tolerance breadths (stenothermy). We tested this prediction by studying the thermal physiology of three isopods (Asellidae, <i>Proasellus</i>) colonizing groundwater habitats characterized by an annual temperature amplitude of less than 1°C. The species responses to temperature variation were assessed in the laboratory using five physiological variables: survival, locomotor activity, aerobic respiration, immune defense and concentrations of total free amino acids and sugars. The three species exhibited contrasted thermal physiologies, although all variables were not equally informative. In accordance with the climate variability hypothesis, two species were extremely sensitive even to moderate changes in temperature (2°C) below and above their habitat temperature. In contrast, the third species exhibited a surprisingly high thermal tolerance breadth (11°C). Differences in response to temperature variation among <i>Proasellus</i> species indicated that their thermal physiology was not solely shaped by the current temperature seasonality in their natural habitats. More particularly, recent gene flow among populations living in thermally constant yet contrasted habitats might explain the occurrence of eurytherm species in thermally buffered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments.</p>

Aging and its modulation in a long-lived worker caste of the honey bee
<p>Highly social animals provide alternative aging models in which vastly different lifespan patterns are flexible, and linked to social caste. Research in these species aims to reveal how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment, including social cues, can shape the transition between short-lived and extremely long-lived phenotypes with negligible senescence. Among honey bee workers, short to intermediate lifespans are typical for summer castes, while the winter caste can live up to 10 times longer. For summer castes, experimental interventions could predictably accelerate, slow or revert functional senescence. In contrast, little is known about the partic ular conditions under which periods of negligible senescence in winter castes can be disrupted or sustained. We asked how manipulation of social <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment in colonies with long-lived winter bees might alter the pace of functional senescence, measured as learning performance, as well as of cellular senescence, measured as lipofuscin accumulation. We show that behavioral senescence becomes rapidly detectable when the winter state is disrupted, and changes in social task behaviors and social <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment (brood) are induced. Likewise, we found that cellular senescence was induced by such social intervention. However, cellular senescence showed marked regional differences, suggesting that particular brain regions age slower than others. Finally, by preventing post-winter colonies from brood rearing, behavioral senescence became undetectable, even after transition to the usually short-lived phenotypes had occurred. We envision that social regulation of negligible functional senescence and highly dynamic accumulation of a universal symptom of cellular aging (lipofuscin) offers rewarding perspectives to target proximate mechanisms of slowed aging.</p>

Solving the Towers of Hanoi – how an amoeboid organism efficiently constructs transport networks
<p>Many biological systems require extensive networks to transport resources and information. Biological networks must trade-off network efficiency with the risk of network failure. Yet, biological networks develop in the absence of centralised control from the interactions of many components. Moreover, many biological systems need to be able to adapt when conditions change and the network requires modification. We used the slime mould <i>Physarum polycephalum</i> (Schwein) to study how the organism adapts its network after disruption. To allow us to determine the efficiency of the constructed networks, we used a well-known shortest-path problem: the Towers of Hanoi maze. We first show that while <i>P. polycephalum</i> is capable of building networks with minimal length paths through the maze, most solutions are sub-optimal. We then disrupted the network by severing the main connecting path while opening a new path in the maze. In response to dynamic changes to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment, <i>P. polycephalum</i> reconstructed more efficient solutions, with all replicates building networks with minimal length paths through the maze after network disruption. While <i>P. polycephalum</i> altered some of its existing network to accommodate changes in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment, it also reconstructed large sections of the network from scratch. We compared the results obtained from <i>P. polycephalum</i> with those obtained using another distributed biological system: ant colonies. We hypothesise that network construction in ants hinges upon stronger positive feedback than for slime mould, ensuring that ants converge more accurately upon the shortest path but are more constrained by the history of their networks in dynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments.</p>

In Pakistan, surveillance for polio reveals a paradox
<p>Last year polio fighters could smell victory in Pakistan, which many believe will be the last country on Earth to harbor the virus. Cases dropped to an all-time low. Blood tests showed that immunity to the poliovirus had never been higher. Surely, there were not enough susceptible children to sustain transmission, and the virus would burn itself out within a year. Unsettling new findings, however, show it is far from gone. In the most extensive effort in any country to scour the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment for traces of the virus, polio workers are finding it widely across Pakistan, in places they thought it had disappeared. They are wondering "just what the hell is going on" and how worried they should be, says epidemiologist Chris Maher of the World Health Organization in Geneva, Switzerland, who runs polio operations in the eastern Mediterranean region. Does this mean the virus is more entrenched than anyone realized and is poised to resurge? Or is this how a virus behaves in its final days—persisting in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment but not causing disease until it fades out? </p>

In situ measurements of Saturn’s ionosphere show that it is dynamic and interacts with the rings

The Radio and Plasma Wave Science instrument detected a cold, dense, and dynamic ionosphere at Saturn that interacts with the rings. Plasma densities reached up to 1000 cubic centimeters, and electron temperatures were below 1160 kelvin near closest approach. The density varied between orbits by up to two orders of magnitude.

Contrasting carbon cycle responses of the tropical continents to the 2015–2016 El Niño

Global climatic drivers of leaf size
<p>Leaf size varies by over a 100,000-fold among species worldwide. Although 19th-century plant geographers noted that the wet tropics harbor plants with exceptionally large leaves, the latitudinal gradient of leaf size has not been well quantified nor the key climatic drivers convincingly identified. Here, we characterize worldwide patterns in leaf size. Large-leaved species predominate in wet, hot, sunny <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments; small-leaved species typify hot, sunny <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments only in arid conditions; small leaves are also found in high latitudes and elevations. By modeling the balance of leaf energy inputs and outputs, we show that daytime and nighttime leaf-to-air temperature differences are key to geographic gradients in leaf size. This knowledge can enrich “next-generation” vegetation models in which leaf temperature and water use during photosynthesis play key roles.</p>

Tubular clathrin/AP-2 lattices pinch collagen fibers to support 3D cell migration

Focal adhesions are less prominent in cells migrating in three-dimensional (3D) as compared with 2D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments. We looked for alternative adhesion structures supporting cell migration. We analyzed the dynamics of clathrin-coated pits in cells migrating in a 3D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment of collagen fibers. Both topological cues and local engagement of integrins triggered the accumulation of clathrin-coated structures on fibers. Clathrin/adaptor protein 2 (AP-2) lattices pinched collagen fibers by adopting a tube-like morphology and regulated adhesion to fibers in an endocytosis-independent manner. During migration, tubular clathrin/AP-2 lattices stabilized cellular protrusions by providing anchoring points to collagen fibers. Thus, tubular clathrin/AP-2 lattices promote cell adhesion that, in coordination with focal adhesions, supports cell migration in 3D.</p>

21st-century rise in anthropogenic nitrogen deposition on a remote coral reef

Greater role for Atlantic inflows on sea-ice loss in the Eurasian Basin of the Arctic Ocean
<p>Arctic sea-ice loss is a leading indicator of climate change and can be attributed, in large part, to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic forcing. Here, we show that recent ice reductions, weakening of the halocline, and shoaling of the intermediate-depth Atlantic Water layer in the eastern Eurasian Basin have increased winter ventilation in the ocean interior, making this region structurally similar to that of the western Eurasian Basin. The associated enhanced release of oceanic heat has reduced winter sea-ice formation at a rate now comparable to losses from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic thermodynamic forcing, thus explaining the recent reduction in sea-ice cover in the eastern Eurasian Basin. This encroaching “atlantification” of the Eurasian Basin represents an essential step toward a new Arctic climate state, with a substantially greater role for Atlantic inflows.</p>

The geologic history of seawater pH
<p>Although pH is a fundamental property of Earth’s oceans, critical to our understanding of seawater biogeochemistry, its long-timescale geologic history is poorly constrained. We constrain seawater pH through time by accounting for the cycles of the major components of seawater. We infer an increase from early Archean pH values between ~6.5 and 7.0 and Phanerozoic values between ~7.5 and 9.0, which was caused by a gradual decrease in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> in response to solar brightening, alongside a decrease in hydrothermal exchange between seawater and the ocean crust.

This signature is characteristic of aliphatic organic matter and is mainly localized on a broad region of ~1000 square kilometers close to the ~50-kilometer Ernutet crater. The combined presence on Ceres of ammonia-bearing hydrated minerals, water ice, carbonates, salts, and organic material indicates a very complex chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment, suggesting favorable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments to prebiotic chemistry.</p>

Developmental Programming of Thermonastic Leaf Movement
<p>Plants exhibit diverse polar behaviors in response to directional and nondirectional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>mental signals, termed tropic and nastic movements, respectively. The ways in which plants incorporate directional information into tropic behaviors is well understood, but it is less well understood how nondirectional stimuli, such as ambient temperatures, specify the polarity of nastic behaviors. Here, we demonstrate that a developmentally programmed polarity of auxin flow underlies thermo-induced leaf hyponasty in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). In warm <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments, PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR4 (PIF4) stimulates auxin production in the leaf. This results in the accumulation of auxin in leaf petioles, where PIF4 directly activates a gene encoding the PINOID (PID) protein kinase. PID is involved in polarization of the auxin transporter PIN-FORMED3 to the outer membranes of petiole cells. Notably, the leaf polarity-determining ASYMMETRIC LEAVES1 (AS1) directs the induction of <i>PID</i> to occur predominantly in the abaxial petiole region. These observations indicate that the integration of PIF4-mediated auxin biosynthesis and polar transport, and the AS1-mediated developmental shaping of polar auxin flow, coordinate leaf thermonasty, which facilitates leaf cooling in warm <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments. We believe that leaf thermonasty is a suitable model system for studying the developmental programming of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>mental adaptation in plants.</p>

A Simple Method for Measuring Apoplast Hydration and Collecting Apoplast Contents
<p>The plant leaf apoplast is a dynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment subject to a variety of both internal and external stimuli. In addition to being a conduit for water vapor and gas exchange involved in transpiration and photosynthesis, the apoplast also accumulates many nutrients transported from the soil as well as those produced through photosynthesis. The internal leaf also provides a protective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment for endophytic and pathogenic microbes alike. Given the diverse array of physiological processes occurring in the apoplast, it is expedient to develop methods to study its contents. Many established methods rely on vacuum infiltration of an apoplast wash solution followed by centrifugation. In this study, we describe a refined method optimized for maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) seedling leaves, which not only provides a simple procedure for obtaining apoplast fluid, but also allows direct calculation of apoplast hydration at the time of harvest for every sample. In addition, we describe an abbreviated method for estimating apoplast hydration if the full apoplast extraction is not necessary. Finally, we show the applicability of this optimized apoplast extraction procedure for plants infected with the maize pathogen <i>Pantoea stewartii</i> ssp <i>stewartii</i>, including the efficient isolation of bacteria previously residing in the apoplast. The approaches to establishing this method should make it generally applicable to other types of plants.</p>

Leaf Amino Acid Supply Affects Photosynthetic and Plant Nitrogen Use Efficiency under Nitrogen Stress
<p>The coordinated distribution of nitrogen to source leaves and sinks is essential for supporting leaf metabolism while also supplying sufficient nitrogen to seeds for development. This study aimed to understand how regulated amino acid allocation to leaves affects photosynthesis and overall plant nitrogen use efficiency in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and how soil nitrogen availability influences these processes. Arabidopsis plants with a knockout of <i>AAP2</i>, encoding an amino acid permease involved in xylem-to-phloem transfer of root-derived amino acids, were grown in low-, moderate-, and high-nitrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments. We analyzed nitrogen allocation to shoot tissues, photosynthesis, and photosynthetic and plant nitrogen use efficiency in these knockout plants. Our results demonstrate that, independent of nitrogen conditions, <i>aap2</i> plants allocate more nitrogen to leaves than wild-type plants. Increased leaf nitrogen supply positively affected chlorophyll and Rubisco levels, photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency, and carbon assimilation and transport to sinks. The <i>aap2</i> plants outperformed wild-type plants with respect to growth, seed yield and carbon storage pools, and nitrogen use efficiency in both high and deficient nitrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments. Overall, this study demonstrates that increasing nitrogen allocation to leaves represents an effective strategy for improving carbon fixation and photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency. The results indicate that an optimized coordination of nitrogen and carbon partitioning processes is critical for high oilseed production in Arabidopsis, including in plants exposed to limiting nitrogen conditions.</p>

Acclimation to Fluctuating Light Impacts the Rapidity of Response and Diurnal Rhythm of Stomatal Conductance<sup><xref>1</xref></sup>
<p>Plant acclimation to growth light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment has been studied extensively; however, the majority of these studies have focused on light intensity and photo-acclimation, with few studies exploring the impact of dynamic growth light on stomatal acclimation and behavior. To assess the impact of growth light regime on stomatal acclimation, we grew Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants in three different lighting regimes (with the same average daily intensity), fluctuating with a fixed pattern of light, fluctuating with a randomized pattern of light (sinusoidal), and nonfluctuating (square wave), to assess the effect of light regime dynamics on gas exchange. We demonstrated that <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> (stomatal conductance to water vapor) acclimation is influenced by both intensity and light pattern, modifying the stomatal kinetics at different times of the day and resulting in differences in the rapidity and magnitude of the <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> response. We also describe and quantify the response to an internal signal that uncouples variation in <i>A</i> and <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> over the majority of the diurnal period and represents 25% of the total diurnal <i>g<sub>s</sub></i>. This <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> response can be characterized by a Gaussian element and when incorporated into the widely used Ball-Berry model greatly improved the prediction of <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> in a dynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment. From these findings, we conclude that acclimation of <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> to growth light could be an important strategy for maintaining carbon fixation and overall plant water status and should be considered when inferring responses in the field from laboratory-based experiments.</p>

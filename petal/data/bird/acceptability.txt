Distribution of Estimated 10-Year Risk of Recurrent Vascular Events and Residual Risk in a Secondary Prevention Population
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Among patients with clinically manifest vascular disease, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of recurrent vascular events is likely to vary. We assessed the distribution of estimated 10-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of recurrent vascular events in a secondary prevention population. We also estimated the potential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> reduction and residual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> that can be achieved if patients reach guideline-recommended <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factor targets.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The SMART score (Second Manifestations of Arterial Disease) for 10-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of myocardial infarction, stroke, or vascular death was applied to 6904 patients with vascular disease. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> score was externally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valid</span></strong>ated in 18 436 patients with various manifestations of vascular disease from the TNT (Treating to New Targets), IDEAL (Incremental Decrease in End Points Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering), SPARCL (Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels), and CAPRIE (Clopidogrel Versus Aspirin in Patients at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of Ischemic Events) trials. The residual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> at guideline-recommended targets was estimated by applying relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> reductions from meta-analyses to the estimated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> for targets for systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, physical activity, and use of antithrombotic agents.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The external performance of the SMART <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> score was reasonable, apart from overestimation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> in patients with 10-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> >40%. In patients with various manifestations of vascular disease, median 10-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of a recurrent major vascular event was 17% (interquartile range, 11%–28%), varying from <10% in 18% to >30% in 22% of the patients. If <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors were at guideline-recommended targets, the residual 10-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> would be <10% in 47% and >30% in 9% of the patients (median, 11%; interquartile range, 7%–17%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among patients with vascular disease, there is very substantial variation in estimated 10-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of recurrent vascular events. If all modifiable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors were at guideline-recommended targets, half of the patients would have a 10-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> <10%. These data suggest that even with optimal treatment, many patients with vascular disease will remain at >20% and even >30% 10-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>, clearly delineating an area of substantial unmet medical need.</p></sec>

Genetic Predisposition, Clinical Risk Factor Burden, and Lifetime Risk of Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The long-term probability of developing atrial fibrillation (AF) considering genetic predisposition and clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factor burden is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We estimated the lifetime <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of AF in individuals from the community-based Framingham Heart Study. Polygenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> for AF was derived using a score of ≈1000 AF-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factor burden was calculated for each individual using a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valid</span></strong>ated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> score for incident AF comprised of height, weight, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, current smoking status, antihypertensive medication use, diabetes mellitus, history of myocardial infarction, and history of heart failure. We estimated the lifetime <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of AF within tertiles of polygenic and clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 4606 participants without AF at 55 years of age, 580 developed incident AF (median follow-up, 9.4 years; 25th–75th percentile, 4.4–14.3 years). The lifetime <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of AF >55 years of age was 37.1% and was substantially influenced by both polygenic and clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factor burden. Among individuals free of AF at 55 years of age, those in low-polygenic and clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> tertiles had a lifetime <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of AF of 22.3% (95% confidence interval, 15.4−9.1), whereas those in high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> tertiles had a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of 48.2% (95% confidence interval, 41.3−55.1). A lower clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factor burden was associated with later AF onset after adjusting for genetic predisposition (<i>P</i><0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In our community-based cohort, the lifetime <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of AF was 37%. Estimation of polygenic AF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> is feasible and together with clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factor burden explains a substantial gradient in long-term AF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>.</p></sec>

Polygenic Risk Score Identifies Subgroup With Higher Burden of Atherosclerosis and Greater Relative Benefit From Statin Therapy in the Primary Prevention Setting
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> reduction with statin therapy has been consistent across nearly all subgroups studied to date. However, in analyses of 2 randomized controlled primary prevention trials (ASCOT [Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial–Lipid-Lowering Arm] and JUPITER [Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin]), statin therapy led to a greater relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> reduction among a subgroup at high genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>. Here, we aimed to confirm this observation in a third primary prevention randomized controlled trial. In addition, we assessed whether those at high genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> had a greater burden of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied participants from a randomized controlled trial of primary prevention with statin therapy (WOSCOPS [West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study]; n=4910) and 2 observational cohort studies (CARDIA [Coronary Artery <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> Development in Young Adults] and BioImage; n=1154 and 4392, respectively). For each participant, we calculated a polygenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> score derived from up to 57 common DNA sequence variants previously associated with coronary heart disease. We compared the relative efficacy of statin therapy in those at high genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> (top quintile of polygenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> score) versus all others (WOSCOPS), as well as the association between the polygenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> score and coronary artery calcification (CARDIA) and carotid artery plaque burden (BioImage).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among WOSCOPS trial participants at high genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>, statin therapy was associated with a relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> reduction of 44% (95% confidence interval [CI], 22–60; <i>P</i><0.001), whereas in all others, the relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> reduction was 24% (95% CI, 8–37; <i>P</i>=0.004) despite similar low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering. In a study-level meta-analysis across the WOSCOPS, ASCOT, and JUPITER primary prevention, relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> reduction in those at high genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> was 46% versus 26% in all others (<i>P</i> for heterogeneity=0.05).

Risk of Cerebrovascular Events in 178 962 Five-Year Survivors of Cancer Diagnosed at 15 to 39 Years of Age
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Survivors of teenage and young adult cancer are at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of cerebrovascular events, but the magnitude of and extent to which this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> varies by cancer type, decade of diagnosis, age at diagnosis, and attained age remains uncertain. This is the largest-ever cohort study to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s of hospitalization for a cerebrovascular event among long-term survivors of teenage and young adult cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The population-based TYACSS (Teenage and Young Adult Cancer Survivor Study) (N=178,962) was linked to Hospital Episode Statistics data for England to investigate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s of hospitalization for a cerebrovascular event among 5-year survivors of cancer diagnosed when 15 to 39 years of age. Observed numbers of first hospitalizations for cerebrovascular events were compared with that expected from the general population using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>ized hospitalization ratios (SHRs) and absolute excess <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s per 10 000 person-years. Cumulative incidence was calculated with death considered a competing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, 2782 cancer survivors were hospitalized for a cerebrovascular event—40% higher than expected (SHR=1.4, 95% confidence interval, 1.3–1.4). Survivors of central nervous system (CNS) tumors (SHR=4.6, 95% confidence interval, 4.3–5.0), head and neck tumors (SHR=2.6, 95% confidence interval, 2.2–3.1), and leukemia (SHR=2.5, 95% confidence interval, 1.9–3.1) were at grea<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>.

Oral Anticoagulation in Very Elderly Patients With Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Stroke prevention with oral anticoagulants (OACs) is the cornerstone for the management of atrial fibrillation (AF). However, data about the use of OACs among patients ≥90 years of age are limited. We aimed to investigate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of ischemic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and the net clinical benefit of OAC treatment for very elderly patients with AF (≥90 years of age).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This study used the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s of ischemic stroke and ICH were compared between 11 064 and 14 658 patients with and without AF ≥90 years of age without antithrombotic therapy from 1996 to 2011. Patients with AF (n=15 756) were divided into 3 groups (no treatment, antiplatelet agents, and warfarin), and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s of stroke and ICH were analyzed. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s of ischemic stroke and ICH were further compared between patients treated with warfarin and nonvitamin K antagonist OACs (NOACs) from 2012 to 2015 when NOACs were available in Taiwan.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Compared with patients without AF, patients with AF had an increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of ischemic stroke (event number/patient number, incidence = 742/11 064, 5.75%/y versus 1399/14 658, 3.00%/y; hazard ratio, 1.93; 95% confidence interval, 1.74–2.14) and similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of ICH (131/11 064, 0.97%/y versus 206/14 658, 0.54%/y; hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.66–1.09) in competing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> analysis for mortality.

Female Sex Is a Risk Modifier Rather Than a Risk Factor for Stroke in Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> in atrial fibrillation is assessed by using the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score. Sex category (Sc, ie, female sex) confers 1 point on CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc. We hypothesized that female sex is a stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> modifier, rather than an overall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factor, when added to a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA (sex-independent thromboembolism <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>) score scale.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using 3 nationwide registries, we identified patients with incident nonvalvular atrial fibrillation from January 1, 1997, through December 31, 2015. Patients receiving oral anticoagulant treatment at baseline were excluded, and person-time was censored at the time of treatment initiation (if any). CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA scores were calculated for men and women, and were followed for up to 1 year in the Danish National Patient Registry. The primary outcome was a primary hospital code for ischemic stroke or systemic embolism (thromboembolism). We calculated crude event rates for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> strata as events per 100 person-years. For quantifying absolute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of stroke, we calculated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s based on the pseudovalue method. Female sex as a prognostic factor was investigated by inclusion as an interaction term on the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA score to calculate the thromboembolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> ratio for different score points.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 239 671 patients with atrial fibrillation (48.7% women) contributed to the analyses. The mean ages for women and men were 76.6 years and 70.3 years, respectively; the mean CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA scores were 2.7 for women and 2.3 for men. The overall 1-year thromboembolic rate per 100 person-years for women was 7.3 and 5.7 for men. The 1-year absolute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of thromboembolism was 0.5% among men and women with a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA score of 0 and increased up to >7% among very comorbid patients (score >5). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> ratio (male as reference) across points >1 indicated that women exhibit a higher stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>. The interaction was statistically significant (<i>P</i><0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Female sex is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> modifier for stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Initial decisions on oral anticoagulant treatment could be guided by a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA score (ie, excluding the sex category criterion), but the Sc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> component modifies and accentuates stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> in women who would have been eligible for oral anticoagulant treatment on the basis of ≥2 additional stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors.</p></sec>

Median follow-up time was 12.6 (to a maximum of 28.2) years.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Fewer AF cases were observed in women (N=1796; 4.4%), than in men (N=2465; 6.4%). Cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factor distribution and lipid profile at baseline were less beneficial in men than in women, and cardiovascular disease was more prevalent in men. Cumulative incidence increased markedly after the age of 50 years in men and after 60 years in women. The lifetime <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> was similar (>30%) for both sexes. Subjects with incident AF had a 3.5-fold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of death in comparison with those without AF. Multivariable-adjusted models showed sex differences for the association of body mass index and AF (hazard ratio per <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> deviation increase, 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12–1.23 in women versus 1.31; 95% CI 1.25–1.38 in men; interaction <i>P</i> value of 0.001). Total cholesterol was inversely associated with incident AF with a greater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> reduction in women (hazard ratio per SD, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.81–0.90 versus 0.92; 95% CI, 0.88–0.97 in men; interaction <i>P</i> value of 0.023).

Genetic Risk Prediction of Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) has a substantial genetic basis. Identification of individuals at grea<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> AF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> could minimize the incidence of cardioembolic stroke.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To determine whether genetic data can stratify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> for development of AF, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">examin</span></strong>ed associations between AF genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> scores and incident AF in 5 prospective studies comprising 18 919 individuals of European ancestry. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">examin</span></strong>ed associations between AF genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> scores and ischemic stroke in a separate study of 509 ischemic stroke cases (202 cardioembolic [40%]) and 3028 referents. Scores were based on 11 to 719 common variants (≥5%) associated with AF at <i>P</i> values ranging from <1×10<sup>−3</sup> to <1×10<sup>−8</sup> in a prior independent genetic association study.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Incident AF occurred in 1032 individuals (5.5%). AF genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> scores were associated with new-onset AF after adjustment for clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors. The pooled hazard ratio for incident AF for the highest versus lowest quartile of genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> scores ranged from 1.28 (719 variants; 95% confidence interval, 1.13–1.46; <i>P</i>=1.5×10<sup>−4</sup>) to 1.67 (25 variants; 95% confidence interval, 1.47–1.90; <i>P</i>=9.3×10<sup>−15</sup>). Discrimination of combined clinical and genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> scores varied across studies and scores (maximum C statistic, 0.629–0.811; maximum ΔC statistic from clinical score alone, 0.009–0.017). AF genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> was associated with stroke in age- and sex-adjusted models. For example, individuals in the highest versus lowest quartile of a 127-variant score had a 2.49-fold increased odds of cardioembolic stroke (95% confidence interval, 1.39–4.58; <i>P</i>=2.7×10<sup>−3</sup>). The effect persisted after the exclusion of individuals (n=70) with known AF (odds ratio, 2.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.20–4.40; <i>P</i>=0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Comprehensive AF genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> scores were associated with incident AF beyond associations for clinical AF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors but offered small im<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prove</span></strong>ments in discrimination. AF genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> was also associated with cardioembolic stroke in age- and sex-adjusted analyses. Efforts are warranted to determine whether AF genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> may im<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prove</span></strong> identification of subclinical AF or help distinguish between stroke mechanisms.</p></sec>

Revised Framingham Stroke Risk Profile to Reflect Temporal Trends
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Age-adjusted stroke incidence has decreased over the past 50 years, likely as a result of changes in the prevalence and impact of various stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors. An updated version of the Framingham Stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> Profile (FSRP) might better predict current <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s in the FHS (Framingham Heart Study) and other cohorts.

Lack of Concordance Between Empirical Scores and Physician Assessments of Stroke and Bleeding Risk in Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Physicians treating patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) must weigh the benefits of anticoagulation in preventing stroke versus the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of bleeding. Although empirical models have been developed to predict such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s, the degree to which these coincide with clinicians’ estimates is unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">examin</span></strong>ed 10 094 AF patients enrolled in the Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of AF (ORBIT-AF) registry between June 2010 and August 2011. Empirical stroke and bleeding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s were assessed by using the congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥75 years, diabetes mellitus, and previous stroke or transient ischemic attack (CHADS<sub>2</sub>) and Anticoagulation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> Factors in Atrial Fibrillation (ATRIA) scores, respectively. Separately, physicians were asked to categorize their patients’ stroke and bleeding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s: low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> (<3%); intermediate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> (3%–6%); and high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> (>6%). Overall, 72% (n=7251) in ORBIT-AF had high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> CHADS<sub>2</sub> scores (≥2). However, only 16% were assessed as high stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> by physicians. Although 17% (n=1749) had high ATRIA bleeding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> (score ≥5), only 7% (n=719) were considered so by physicians. The associations between empirical and physician-estimated stroke and bleeding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s were low (weighted Kappa 0.1 and 0.11, respectively). Physicians weighed hypertension, heart failure, and diabetes mellitus less significantly than empirical models in estimating stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>; physicians weighted anemia and dialysis less significantly than empirical models when estimating bleeding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s. Anticoagulation use was highest among patients with high stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>, assessed by either empirical model or physician estimates. In contrast, physician and empirical estimates of bleeding had limited impact on treatment choice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>There is little agreement between provider-assessed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> and empirical scores in AF.

Cardiovascular Risk Prediction Functions Underestimate Risk in HIV Infection
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> is elevated in HIV-infected individuals, with contributions from both traditional and nontraditional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors. The accuracy of established CVD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> prediction functions in HIV is uncertain. We sought to assess the performance of 3 established CVD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> prediction functions in a longitudinal cohort of HIV-infected men.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The FHS (Framingham Heart Study) functions for hard coronary heart disease (FHS CHD) and atherosclerotic CVD (FHS ASCVD) and the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association ASCVD function were applied to the Partners HIV cohort. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> scores were calculated between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2008. Outcomes included CHD (myocardial infarction or coronary death) for the FHS CHD function and ASCVD (myocardial infarction, stroke, or coronary death) for the FHS ASCVD and American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association ASCVD functions. We investigated the accuracy of CVD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> prediction for each function when applied to the HIV cohort using comparison of Cox regression coefficients, discrimination, and calibration.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The HIV cohort was comprised of 1272 men followed for a median of 4.4 years.

Risk Factors of Sudden Cardiac Death in the Young
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Prevention of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) in the young remains a largely unsolved public health problem, and sports activity is an established trigger. Although the presence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors in the young can link to future morbidity and mortality in adulthood, the potential contribution of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors to SCA in the young has not been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We prospectively ascertained subjects who experienced SCA between the ages of 5 and 34 years in the Portland, Oregon, metropolitan area (2002–2015, catchment population ≈1 million).

We specifically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated the association of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors and SCA, and sports as a trigger for SCA in the young.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 3775 SCAs in all age groups, 186 (5%) occurred in the young (mean age 25.9±6.8, 67% male). In SCA in the young, overall prevalence of warning signs before SCA was low (29%), and 26 (14%) were associated with sports as a trigger. The remainder (n=160) occurred in other settings categorized as nonsports. Sports-related SCAs accounted for 39% of SCAs in patients aged ≤18, 13% of SCAs in patients aged 19 to 25, and 7% of SCAs in patients aged 25 to 34. Sports-related SCA cases were more likely to present with shockable rhythms, and survival from cardiac arrest was 2.5-fold higher in sports-related versus nonsports SCA (28% versus 11%; <i>P</i>=0.05). Overall, the most common SCA-related conditions were sudden arrhythmic death syndrome (31%), coronary artery disease (22%), and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (14%).

Each patient   was assigned an individualised baseline VTE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> score based on   a system using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample. Symptomatic VTE,   including pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT),   were identified in the first 90 days post-operatively. Statistical   analyses were performed with logistic regression accounting for   baseline VTE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The adjusted incidence of PE following SBTKA was 1.0% (95% confidence   interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.2) with aspirin and 2.2% (95% CI 2.0 to   2.4) with warfarin. Similarly, the adjusted incidence of VTE following   SBTKA was 1.6% (95% CI 1.1 to 2.3) with aspirin and 2.5% (95% CI   1.9 to 3.3) with warfarin. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of PE and VTE were reduced by   66% (odds ratio (OR) 0.44, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.78) and 38% (OR 0.62,   95% CI 0.38 to 1.0), respectively, using aspirin. In addition, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>   of PE was 204% higher for patients undergoing SBTKA relative to   those undergoing UTKA. For each ten-point increase in baseline VTE   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of PE increased by 25.5% for patients undergoing   SBTKA compared with 10.5% for those undergoing UTKA.

Value of Progression of Coronary Artery Calcification for Risk Prediction of Coronary and Cardiovascular Events
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Computed tomography (CT) allows estimation of coronary artery calcium (CAC) progression. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated several progression algorithms in our unselected, population-based cohort for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> prediction of coronary and cardiovascular events.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In 3281 participants (45–74 years of age), free from cardiovascular disease until the second visit, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors, and CTs at baseline (b) and after a mean of 5.1 years (5y) were measured. Hard coronary and cardiovascular events, and total cardiovascular events including revascularization, as well, were recorded during a follow-up time of 7.8±2.2 years after the second CT. The added predictive value of 10 CAC progression algorithms on top of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors including baseline CAC was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated by using survival analysis, C-statistics, net reclassification im<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prove</span></strong>ment, and integrated discrimination index. A subgroup analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> in CAC categories was performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We observed 85 (2.6%) hard coronary, 161 (4.9%) hard cardiovascular, and 241 (7.3%) total cardiovascular events. Absolute CAC progression was higher with versus without subsequent coronary events (median, 115 [Q1–Q3, 23–360] versus 8 [0–83], <i>P</i><0.0001; similar for hard/total cardiovascular events). Some progression algorithms added to the predictive value of baseline CT and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> assessment in terms of C-statistic or integrated discrimination index, especially for total cardiovascular events. However, CAC progression did not im<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prove</span></strong> models including CAC<sub>5y</sub> and 5-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors. An excellent prognosis was found for 921 participants with double-zero CAC<sub>b</sub>=CAC<sub>5y</sub>=0 (10-year coronary and hard/total cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>: 1.4%, 2.0%, and 2.8%), which was for participants with incident CAC 1.8%, 3.8%, and 6.6%, respectively. When CAC<sub>b</sub> progressed from 1 to 399 to CAC<sub>5y</sub>≥400, coronary and total cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> were nearly 2-fold in comparison with subjects who remained below CAC<sub>5y</sub>=400. Participants with CAC<sub>b</sub>≥400 had high rates of hard coronary and hard/total cardiovascular events (10-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>: 12.0%, 13.5%, and 30.9%, respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>CAC progression is associated with coronary and cardiovascular event rates, but adds only weakly to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> prediction. What counts is the most recent CAC value and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factor assessment. Therefore, a repeat scan >5 years after the first scan may be of additional value, except when a double-zero CT scan is present or when the subjects are already at high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>.</p></sec>

Improving Assessment of Drug Safety Through Proteomics
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Early detection of adverse effects of novel therapies and understanding of their mechanisms could im<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prove</span></strong> the safety and efficiency of drug development. We have retrospectively applied large-scale proteomics to blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es from ILLUMINATE (Investigation of Lipid Level Management to Understand its Impact in Atherosclerotic Events), a trial of torcetrapib (a cholesterol ester transfer protein inhibitor), that involved 15 067 participants at high cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>. ILLUMINATE was terminated at a median of 550 days because of significant absolute increases of 1.2% in cardiovascular events and 0.4% in mortality with torcetrapib. The aims of our analysis were to determine whether a proteomic analysis might reveal biological mechanisms responsible for these harmful effects and whether harmful effects of torcetrapib could have been detected early in the ILLUMINATE trial with proteomics.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A nested case-control analysis of paired plasma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es at baseline and at 3 months was performed in 249 participants assigned to torcetrapib plus atorvastatin and 223 participants assigned to atorvastatin only. Within each treatment arm, cases with events were matched to controls 1:1. Main outcomes were a survey of 1129 proteins for discovery of biological pathways altered by torcetrapib and a 9-protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> score <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valid</span></strong>ated to predict myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, or death.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Plasma concentrations of 200 proteins changed significantly with torcetrapib.

Echocardiographic Screening for Rheumatic Heart Disease in High and Low Risk Australian Children
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Echocardiographic screening for rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is becoming more widespread, but screening studies to date have used different echocardiographic definitions. The World Heart Federation has recently published new criteria for the echocardiographic diagnosis of RHD. We aimed to establish the prevalence of RHD in high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> Indigenous Australian children using these criteria and to compare the findings with a group of Australian children at low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> for RHD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Portable echocardiography was performed on high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> Indigenous children aged 5 to15 years living in remote communities of northern Australia. A comparison group of low-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>, non-Indigenous children living in urban centers was also screened. Echocardiograms were reported in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>ized, blinded fashion. Of 3946 high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> children, 34 met World Heart Federation criteria for definite RHD (prevalence, 8.6 per 1000 [95% confidence interval, 6.0–12.0]) and 66 for borderline RHD (prevalence, 16.7 per 1000 [95% confidence interval, 13.0–21.2]). Of 1053 low-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> children, none met the criteria for definite RHD, and 5 met the criteria for borderline RHD.

Association of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection and Risk of Peripheral Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The effect of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on the development of peripheral artery disease (PAD) remains unclear. We investigated whether HIV infection is associated with an increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of PAD after adjustment for traditional atherosclerotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors in a large cohort of HIV-infected (HIV+) and demographically similar HIV-uninfected veterans.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied participants in the Veterans Aging Cohort Study from April 1, 2003 through December 31, 2014. We excluded participants with known prior PAD or prevalent cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary heart disease, and congestive heart failure) and analyzed the effect of HIV status on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of incident PAD events after adjusting for demographics, PAD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors, substance use, CD4 cell count, HIV-1 ribonucleic acid, and antiretroviral therapy. The primary outcome is incident peripheral artery disease events. Secondary outcomes include mortality and amputation in subjects with incident PAD events by HIV infection status, viral load, and CD4 count.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 91 953 participants, over a median follow up of 9.0 years, there were 7708 incident PAD events. Rates of incident PAD events per 1000 person-years were higher among HIV+ (11.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 11.5–12.4) than uninfected veterans (9.9; 95% CI, 9.6–10.1). After adjustment for demographics, PAD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors, and other covariates, HIV+ veterans had an increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of incident PAD events compared with uninfected veterans (hazard ratio [HR], 1.19; 95% CI, 1.13–1.25).

Frequency, Predictors, and Impact of Combined Antiplatelet Therapy on Venous Thromboembolism in Patients With Symptomatic Atherosclerosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Observational studies suggest that symptomatic atherosclerosis may be associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Prior randomized studies have demonstrated a significant reduction in recurrent VTE with aspirin monotherapy. Whether VTE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> is associated with more severe symptomatic atherosclerosis and more intensive antiplatelet therapy reduces VTE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> beyond aspirin monotherapy is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>TRA2P-TIMI 50 (Thrombin Receptor Antagonist in Secondary Prevention of Atherothrombotic Ischemic Events–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) (vorapaxar) and PEGASUS-TIMI 54 (Prevention of Cardiovascular Events in Patients With Prior Heart Attack Using Ticagrelor Compared to Placebo on a Background of Aspirin–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 54) (ticagrelor) were blinded, randomized placebo-controlled trials of antiplatelet therapy for the prevention of ischemic events in stable patients with symptomatic atherosclerosis. Two blinded vascular specialists systematically identified symptomatic venous thromboembolic events in both trials.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 47 611 patients with stable vascular disease followed for 3 years in both studies there were 343 VTE events in 301 patients (Kaplan-Meier rate at 3 years, 0.9% for placebo). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of VTE was independently associated with age, body mass index, polyvascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and malignancy. The burden of atherosclerosis manifested as an increasing number of symptomatic vascular territories was associated with a graded increase in the 3-year rates of VTE (0.76% for 1, 1.53% for 2, and 2.45% for 3 territories). More intensive antiplatelet therapy (vorapaxar and ticagrelor pooled) significantly reduced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of VTE by 29% compared with background antiplatelet therapy, from 0.93% to 0.64% at 3 years (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% confidence interval, 0.56–0.89; <i>P</i>=0.003).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The rate of VTE in patients with atherosclerosis is ≈0.3% per year while on treatment with ≥1 antiplatelet agent, with increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> independently associated with the number of symptomatic vascular territories.

Additionally, the role of contemporary measures of longitudinal strain and diastolic dysfunction in defining HF stages is unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>HF stages were classified in 6118 participants in the Atherosclerosis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> in Communities study (67–91 years of age) at the fifth study visit as follows: A (asymptomatic with HF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors but no cardiac structural or functional abnormalities), B (asymptomatic with structural abnormalities, defined as left ventricular hypertrophy, dilation or dysfunction, or significant valvular disease), C1 (clinical HF without prior hospitalization), and C2 (clinical HF with earlier hospitalization).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Using the traditional definitions of HF stages, only 5% of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">examin</span></strong>ed participants were free of HF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors or structural heart disease (Stage 0), 52% were categorized as Stage A, 30% Stage B, 7% Stage C1, and 6% Stage C2. Worse HF stage was associated with a greater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of incident HF hospitalization or death at a median follow-up of 608 days. Left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction was preserved in 77% and 65% in Stages C1 and C2, respectively. Incorporation of longitudinal strain and diastolic dysfunction into the Stage B definition reclassified 14% of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e from Stage A to B and im<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prove</span></strong>d the net reclassification index (<i>P</i>=0.028) and integrated discrimination index (<i>P</i>=0.016). Abnormal LV structure, systolic function (based on LV ejection fraction and longitudinal strain), and diastolic function (based on e’, E/e’, and left atrial volume index) were each independently and additively associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of incident HF hospitalization or death in Stage A and B participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The majority of older adults in the community are at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> for HF (Stages A or B), appreciably more compared with previous reports in younger community-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es. LV ejection fraction is robustly preserved in at least two-thirds of older adults with prevalent HF (Stage C), highlighting the burden of HF with preserved LV ejection fraction in the elderly.

Digital chemical test impresses
<p>Toxicologists this week unveiled a chemical safety screening tool that could greatly reduce the need for six common animal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>s. Those <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>s account for nearly 60% of the estimated 3 million to 4 million animals used annually in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing worldwide. The computerized tool—built on a massive database of molecular structures and existing safety data—appears to match, and sometimes im<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prove</span></strong> on, the results of animal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>s for properties such as skin sensitization and eye irritation, the researchers report in today's issue of <i>Toxicological Sciences</i>. But it also has limitations; for instance, the method can't <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reliabl</span></strong>y <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ate a chemical's <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of causing cancer. And it's not clear how open regulatory agencies will be to adopting a nonanimal approach, although both European and U.S. regulators say they are open to the idea. Still, the big data approach is encouraging to those seeking to reduce and replace animal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing.</p>

Inflammatory and Cholesterol Risk in the FOURIER Trial
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In the FOURIER trial (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Patients With Elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>), the PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitor evolocumab reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>. It is not known whether the efficacy of evolocumab is modified by baseline inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>. We explored the efficacy of evolocumab stratified by baseline high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). We also assessed the importance of inflammatory and residual cholesterol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> across the range of on-treatment LDL-C concentrations.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients (n=27 564) with stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and LDL-C ≥70 mg/dL on a statin were randomly assigned to evolocumab versus placebo and followed for a median of 2.2 years (1.8–2.5). The effects of evolocumab on the primary end point of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina or coronary revascularization, and the key secondary end point of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke were compared across strata of baseline hsCRP (<1, 1–3, and >3 mg/dL). Outcomes were also assessed across values for baseline hsCRP and 1-month LDL-C in the entire trial population. Multivariable models adjusted for variables associated with hsCRP and 1-month LDL-C were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 7981 (29%) patients had a baseline hsCRP<1 mg/L, 11 177 (41%) had a hsCRP 1 to 3 mg/L, and 8337 (30%) had a hsCRP >3 mg/L. Median (interquartile range) baseline hsCRP was 1.8 (0.9–3.6) mg/L and levels were not altered by evolocumab (change at 48 weeks of –0.2 mg/dL [–1.0 to 0.4] in both treatment arms). In the placebo arm, patients in higher baseline hsCRP categories experienced significantly higher 3-year Kaplan-Meier rates of the primary and key secondary end points: 12.0%, 13.7%, and 18.1% for the primary end point (<i>P</i><sub>trend</sub><0.0001) and 7.4%, 9.1%, and 13.2% for the key secondary end point (<i>P</i><sub>trend</sub><0.0001) for categories of <1, 1 to 3, and >3 mg/dL, respectively. The relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> reductions for the primary end point and key secondary end point with evolocumab were consistent across hsCRP strata (<i>P</i>-interactions>0.15 for both). In contrast, the absolute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> reductions with evolocumab tended to be greater in patients with higher hsCRP: 1.6%, 1.8%, and 2.6% and 0.8%, 2.0%, and 3.0%, respectively, for the primary and key secondary end points across hsCRP strata. In adjusted analyses of the association between LDL-C and hsCRP levels and cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>, both LDL-C and hsCRP were independently associated with the primary outcome (<i>P</i><0.0001 for each).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>LDL-C reduction with evolocumab reduces cardiovascular events across hsCRP strata with greater absolute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> reductions in patients with higher-baseline hsCRP.

Derivation and Validation of a Novel Right-Sided Heart Failure Model After Implantation of Continuous Flow Left Ventricular Assist Devices
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The aim of the study was to derive and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valid</span></strong>ate a novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> score for early right-sided heart failure (RHF) after left ventricular assist device implantation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The EUROMACS (European Registry for Patients with Mechanical Circulatory Support) was used to identify adult patients undergoing continuous-flow left ventricular assist device implantation with mainstream devices. Eligible patients (n=2988) were randomly divided into derivation (n=2000) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valid</span></strong>ation (n=988) cohorts. The primary outcome was early (<30 days) severe postoperative RHF, defined as receiving short- or long-term right-sided circulatory support, continuous inotropic support for ≥14 days, or nitric oxide ventilation for ≥48 hours. The secondary outcome was all-cause mortality and length of stay in the intensive care unit. Covariates found to be associated with RHF (exploratory univariate <i>P</i><0.10) were entered into a multivariable logistic regression model. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> score was then generated using the relative magnitude of the exponential regression model coefficients of independent predictors at the last step after checking for collinearity, likelihood ratio <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>, c index, and clinical weight at each step.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A 9.5-point <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> score incorporating 5 variables (Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support class, use of multiple inotropes, severe right ventricular dysfunction on echocardiography, ratio of right atrial/pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, hemoglobin) was created. The mean scores in the derivation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valid</span></strong>ation cohorts were 2.7±1.9 and 2.6±2.0, respectively (<i>P</i>=0.32). RHF in the derivation cohort occurred in 433 patients (21.7%) after left ventricular assist device implantation and was associated with a lower 1-year (53% versus 71%; <i>P</i><0.001) and 2-year (45% versus 58%; <i>P</i><0.001) survival compared with patients without RHF.

We investigated the efficacy and safety of evolocumab in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) as well as the effect on major adverse limb events.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>FOURIER was a randomized trial of evolocumab versus placebo in 27 564 patients with atherosclerotic disease on statin therapy followed for a median of 2.2 years. Patients were identified as having PAD at baseline if they had intermittent claudication and an ankle brachial index of <0.85, or if they had a prior peripheral vascular procedure. The primary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospital admission for unstable angina, or coronary revascularization. The key secondary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. An additional outcome of interest was major adverse limb events defined as acute limb ischemia, major amputation, or urgent peripheral revascularization for ischemia.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Three thousand six hundred forty-two patients (13.2%) had PAD (1505 with no prior myocardial infarction or stroke). Evolocumab significantly reduced the primary end point consistently in patients with PAD (hazard ratio [HR] 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66–0.94; <i>P</i>=0.0098) and without PAD (HR 0.86; 95% CI, 0.80–0.93; <i>P</i>=0.0003; <i>P</i><sub>interaction</sub>=0.40).

Phenotypic Consequences of a Genetic Predisposition to Enhanced Nitric Oxide Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Nitric oxide signaling plays a key role in the regulation of vascular tone and platelet activation. Here, we seek to understand the impact of a genetic predisposition to enhanced nitric oxide signaling on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> for cardiovascular diseases, thus informing the potential utility of pharmacological stimulation of the nitric oxide pathway as a therapeutic strategy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We analyzed the association of common and rare genetic variants in 2 genes that mediate nitric oxide signaling (Nitric Oxide Synthase 3 [<i>NOS3</i>] and Guanylate Cyclase 1, Soluble, Alpha 3 [<i>GUCY1A3</i>]) with a range of human phenotypes. We selected 2 common variants (rs3918226 in <i>NOS3</i> and rs7692387 in <i>GUCY1A3</i>) known to associate with increased <i>NOS3</i> and <i>GUCY1A3</i> expression and reduced mean arterial pressure, combined them into a genetic score, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>ized this exposure to a 5 mm Hg reduction in mean arterial pressure.

Dynamic Edematous Response of the Human Heart to Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Clinical protocols aimed to characterize the post–myocardial infarction (MI) heart by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) need to be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>ized to take account of dynamic biological phenomena evolving early after the index ischemic event. Here, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated the time course of edema reaction in patients with ST-segment–elevation MI by CMR and assessed its implications for myocardium-at-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> (MaR) quantification both in patients and in a large-animal model.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A total of 16 patients with anterior ST-segment–elevation MI successfully treated by primary angioplasty and 16 matched controls were prospectively recruited. In total, 94 clinical CMR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">examin</span></strong>ations were performed: patients with ST-segment–elevation MI were serially scanned (within the first 3 hours after reperfusion and at 1, 4, 7, and 40 days), and controls were scanned only once. T2 relaxation time in the myocardium (T2 mapping) and the extent of edema on T2-weighted short-tau triple inversion-recovery (ie, CMR-MaR) were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated at all time points. In the experimental study, 20 pigs underwent 40-minute ischemia/reperfusion followed by serial CMR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">examin</span></strong>ations at 120 minutes and 1, 4, and 7 days after reperfusion. Reference MaR was assessed by contrast-multidetector computed tomography during the index coronary occlusion. Generalized linear mixed models were used to take account of repeated measurements.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In humans, T2 relaxation time in the ischemic myocardium declines significantly from early after reperfusion to 24 hours, and then increases up to day 4, reaching a plateau from which it decreases from day 7. Consequently, edema extent measured by T2-weighted short-tau triple inversion-recovery (CMR-MaR) varied with the timing of the CMR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">examin</span></strong>ation. These findings were confirmed in the experimental model by showing that only CMR-MaR values for day 4 and day 7 postreperfusion, coinciding with the deferred edema wave, were similar to values measured by reference contrast-multidetector computed tomography.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Post-MI edema in patients follows a bimodal pattern that affects CMR estimates of MaR. Dynamic changes in post–ST-segment–elevation MI edema highlight the need for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>ization of CMR timing to retrospectively delineate MaR and quantify myocardial salvage. According to the present clinical and experimental data, a time window between days 4 and 7 post-MI seems a good compromise solution for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>ization. Further studies are needed to study the effect of other factors on these variables.</p></sec>

The China-PAR project (Prediction for ASCVD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> in China) is aimed at developing and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valid</span></strong>ating 10-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> prediction equations for ASCVD from 4 contemporary Chinese cohorts.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Two prospective studies followed up together with a unified protocol were used as the derivation cohort to develop 10-year ASCVD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> equations in 21 320 Chinese participants. The external <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valid</span></strong>ation was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated in 2 independent Chinese cohorts with 14 123 and 70 838 participants.

Sex-specific equations had C statistics of 0.794 (95% confidence interval, 0.775–0.814) for men and 0.811 (95% confidence interval, 0.787–0.835) for women. The predicted rates were similar to the observed rates, as indicated by a calibration χ<sup>2</sup> of 13.1 for men (<i>P</i>=0.16) and 12.8 for women (<i>P</i>=0.17). Good internal and external <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valid</span></strong>ations of our equations were achieved in subsequent analyses.

Point-of-Care Hemostatic Testing in Cardiac Surgery
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac surgery is frequently complicated by coagulopathic bleeding that is difficult to optimally manage using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> hemostatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing. We hypothesized that point-of-care hemostatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing within the context of an integrated transfusion algorithm would im<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prove</span></strong> the management of coagulopathy in cardiac surgery and thereby reduce blood transfusions.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a pragmatic multicenter stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial of a point-of-care–based transfusion algorithm in consecutive patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass at 12 hospitals from October 6, 2014, to May 1, 2015. Following a 1-month data collection at all participating hospitals, a transfusion algorithm incorporating point-of-care hemostatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing was sequentially implemented at 2 hospitals at a time in 1-month intervals, with the implementation order randomly assigned. No other aspects of care were modified. The primary outcome was red blood cell transfusion from surgery to postoperative day 7. Other outcomes included transfusion of other blood products, major bleeding, and major complications. The analysis adjusted for secular time trends, within-hospital clustering, and patient-level <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors. All outcomes and analyses were prespecified before study initiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among the 7402 patients studied, 3555 underwent surgery during the control phase and 3847 during the intervention phase. Overall, 3329 (45.0%) received red blood cells, 1863 (25.2%) received platelets, 1645 (22.2%) received plasma, and 394 (5.3%) received cryoprecipitate. Major bleeding occurred in 1773 (24.1%) patients, and major complications occurred in 740 (10.2%) patients. The trial intervention reduced rates of red blood cell transfusion (adjusted relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.85–0.98; <i>P</i>=0.02; number needed to treat, 24.7), platelet transfusion (relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>, 0.77; 95% confidence interval, 0.68–0.87; <i>P</i><0.001; number needed to treat, 16.7), and major bleeding (relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.72–0.94; <i>P</i>=0.004; number needed to treat, 22.6), but had no effect on other blood product transfusions or major complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Implementation of point-of-care hemostatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing within the context of an integrated transfusion algorithm reduces red blood cell transfusions, platelet transfusions, and major bleeding following cardiac surgery.

Prevalence and Predictors of Cholesterol Screening, Awareness, and Statin Treatment Among US Adults With Familial Hypercholesterolemia or Other Forms of Severe Dyslipidemia (1999–2014)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and other extreme elevations in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol significantly increase the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; however, recent data suggest that prescription rates for statins remain low in these patients. National rates of screening, awareness, and treatment with statins among individuals with FH or severe dyslipidemia are unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data from the 1999 to 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were used to estimate prevalence rates of self-reported screening, awareness, and statin therapy among US adults (n=42 471 weighted to represent 212 million US adults) with FH (defined using the Dutch Lipid Clinic criteria) and with severe dyslipidemia (defined as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels ≥190 mg/dL). Logistic regression was used to identify sociodemographic and clinical correlates of hypercholesterolemia awareness and statin therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The estimated US prevalence of definite/probable FH was 0.47% (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> error, 0.03%) and of severe dyslipidemia was 6.6% (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> error, 0.2%). The frequency of cholesterol screening and awareness was high (>80%) among adults with definite/probable FH or severe dyslipidemia; however, statin use was uniformly low (52.3% [<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> error, 8.2%] of adults with definite/probable FH and 37.6% [<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> error, 1.2%] of adults with severe dyslipidemia). Only 30.3% of patients with definite/probable FH on statins were taking a high-intensity statin. The prevalence of statin use in adults with severe dyslipidemia increased over time (from 29.4% to 47.7%) but not faster than trends in the general population (from 5.7% to 17.6%). Older age, health insurance status, having a usual source of care, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and having a personal history of early atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease were associated with higher statin use.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Despite the high prevalence of cholesterol screening and awareness, only ≈50% of adults with FH are on statin therapy, with even fewer prescribed a high-intensity statin; young and uninsured patients are at the highest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> for lack of screening and for undertreatment. This study highlights an imperative to im<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prove</span></strong> the frequency of cholesterol screening and statin prescription rates to better identify and treat this high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> population. Additional studies are needed to better understand how to close these gaps in screening and treatment.</p></sec>

Cardiovascular Outcomes and Risks After Initiation of a Sodium Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitor
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Clinical trials have shown cardiovascular benefits and potential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s from sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i). Trials may have limited ability to address individual end points or safety concerns.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed a population-based cohort study among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with established cardiovascular disease newly initiated on antihyperglycemic agents within the US Department of Defense Military Health System between April 1, 2013, and December 31, 2016. Incidence rates, hazard ratios (HRs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for time to first composite end point of all-cause mortality and hospitalization for heart failure event, major adverse cardiovascular events (defined as all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke), and individual end points were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated using conditional Cox models comparing new SGLT2i users with other antihyperglycemic agents. The exploratory safety end point was below-knee lower extremity amputation. Intent-to-treat and on-treatment analyses were performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>After propensity matching, 25 258 patients were followed for a median of 1.6 years. Compared with non-SGLT2i, initiation of SGLT2i was associated with a lower rate of all-cause mortality and hospitalization for heart failure (1.73 versus 3.01 events per 100 person-years; HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.50–0.65) and major adverse cardiovascular events (2.31 versus 3.45 events per 100 person-years; HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.60–0.75). SGLT2i initiation was also associated with an ≈2-fold higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of below-knee lower extremity amputation (0.17 versus 0.09 events per 100 person-years; HR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.12–3.51). Because of the disproportionate canagliflozin exposure in the database, the majority of amputations were observed on canagliflozin. Results were consistent in the on-treatment analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In this high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> cohort, initiation of SGLT2i was associated with lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of all-cause mortality, hospitalization for heart failure, and major adverse cardiovascular events and higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of below-knee lower extremity amputation. Findings underscore the potential benefit and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s to be aware of when initiating SGLT2i. It remains unclear whether the below-knee lower extremity amputation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> extends across the class of medication, because the study was not powered to make comparisons among individual treatments.</p></sec>

Application of Large-Scale Aptamer-Based Proteomic Profiling to Planned Myocardial Infarctions
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Emerging proteomic technologies using novel affinity-based reagents allow for efficient multiplexing with high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e throughput. To identify early biomarkers of myocardial injury, we recently applied an aptamer-based proteomic profiling platform that measures 1129 proteins to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es from patients undergoing septal alcohol ablation for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a human model of planned myocardial injury. Here, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">examin</span></strong>ed the scalability of this approach using a markedly expanded platform to study a far broader range of human proteins in the context of myocardial injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We applied a highly multiplexed, expanded proteomic technique that uses single-stranded DNA aptamers to assay 4783 human proteins (4137 distinct human gene targets) to derivation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valid</span></strong>ation cohorts of planned myocardial injury, individuals with spontaneous myocardial infarction, and at-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> controls.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We found 376 target proteins that significantly changed in the blood after planned myocardial injury in a derivation cohort (n=20; <i>P</i><1.05E-05, 1-way repeated measures analysis of variance, Bonferroni threshold). Two hundred forty-seven of these proteins were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valid</span></strong>ated in an independent planned myocardial injury cohort (n=15; <i>P</i><1.33E-04, 1-way repeated measures analysis of variance); >90% were directionally consistent and reached nominal significance in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valid</span></strong>ation cohort. Among the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valid</span></strong>ated proteins that were increased within 1 hour after planned myocardial injury, 29 were also elevated in patients with spontaneous myocardial infarction (n=63; <i>P</i><6.17E-04). Many of the novel markers identified in our study are intracellular proteins not previously identified in the peripheral circulation or have functional roles relevant to myocardial injury. For example, the cardiac LIM protein, cysteine- and glycine-rich protein 3, is thought to mediate cardiac mechanotransduction and stress responses, whereas the mitochondrial ATP synthase F<sub>0</sub> subunit component is a vasoactive peptide on its release from cells. Last, we performed aptamer-affinity enrichment coupled with mass spectrometry to technically verify aptamer specificity for a subset of the new biomarkers.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our results demonstrate the feasibility of large-scale aptamer multiplexing at a level that has not previously been reported and with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e throughput that greatly exceeds other existing proteomic methods. The expanded aptamer-based proteomic platform provides a unique opportunity for biomarker and pathway discovery after myocardial injury.</p></sec>

Genetic and Functional Profiling of CD16-Dependent Natural Killer Activation Identifies Patients at Higher Risk of Cardiac Allograft Vasculopathy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac transplantation is an effective therapy for end-stage heart failure. Because cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the major cause of late mortality after heart transplant (HT), there is a need to identify markers that reflect inflammatory or cytotoxic immune mechanisms contributing to its onset. Noninvasive and early stratification of patients at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> remains a challenge for adapting individualized therapy. The CD16 (Fc-gamma receptor 3A [FCGR3A]) receptor was recently identified as a major determinant of antibody-mediated natural killer (NK) cell activation in HT biopsies; however, little is known about the role of CD16 in promoting allograft vasculopathy. This study aimed to investigate whether markers that reflect CD16-dependent circulating NK cell activation may identify patients at higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of developing CAV after HT.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es were collected from 103 patients undergoing routine coronarography angiography for CAV diagnosis (median 5 years since HT). Genomic and phenotypic analyses of FCGR3A/CD16 Fc-receptor profiles were compared in CAV-positive (n=52) and CAV-free patients (n=51). The levels of CD16 expression and rituximab-dependent cell cytotoxic activity of peripheral NK cells in HT recipients were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated using a noninvasive NK-cellular humoral activation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Enhanced levels of CD16 expression and antibody-dependent NK cell cytotoxic function of HT recipients were associated with the FCGR3A-VV genotype. The frequency of the FCGR3A-VV genotype was significantly higher in the CAV<sup>+</sup> group (odds ratio, 3.9; <i>P</i>=0.0317) than in the CAV<sup>-</sup> group. The FCGR3A-VV genotype was identified as an independent marker correlated with the presence of CAV at the time of coronary angiography by using multivariate logistic regression models. The FCGR3A-VV genotype was also identified as a baseline-independent predictor of CAV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> (odds ratio, 4.7; <i>P</i>=0.023).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This study unravels a prominent role for the CD16-dependent NK cell activation pathway in the complex array of factors that favor the progression of transplant arteriosclerosis. It highlights the clinical potential of a noninvasive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ation of FCGR3A/CD16 in the early stratification of CAV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>. The recognition of CD16 as a major checkpoint that controls immune surveillance may promote the design of individualized NK cell–targeted therapies to limit vascular damage in highly responsive sensitized patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Effect of Obesity and Underweight Status on Perioperative Outcomes of Congenital Heart Operations in Children, Adolescents, and Young Adults
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Extreme body mass index (BMI; either very high or very low) has been associated with increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of adverse perioperative outcome in adults undergoing cardiac surgery. The effect of BMI on perioperative outcomes in congenital heart disease patients has not been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A multicenter retrospective cohort study was performed studying patients 10 to 35 years of age undergoing a congenital heart disease operation in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery Database between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2015. The primary outcomes were operative mortality and a composite outcome (1 or more of operative mortality, major adverse event, prolonged hospital length of stay, and wound infection/dehiscence). The associations between age- and sex-adjusted BMI percentiles and these outcomes were assessed, with adjustment for patient-level <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors, with multivariate logistic regression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 18 337 patients (118 centers), 16% were obese, 15% were overweight, 53% were normal weight, 7% were underweight, and 9% were severely underweight. Observed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s of operative mortality (<i>P</i>=0.04) and composite outcome (<i>P</i><0.0001) were higher in severely underweight and obese subjects. Severely underweight BMI was associated with increased unplanned cardiac operation and reoperation for bleeding. Obesity was associated with increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of wound infection. In multivariable analysis, the association between BMI and operative mortality was no longer significant. Obese (odds ratio, 1.28; <i>P</i>=0.008), severely underweight (odds ratio, 1.29; <i>P</i><0.0001), and underweight (odds ratio, 1.39; <i>P</i>=0.002) subjects were associated with increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of composite outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Obesity and underweight BMI were associated with increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of composite adverse outcome independently of other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors.

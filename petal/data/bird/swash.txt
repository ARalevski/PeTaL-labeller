Is genome-guided cancer treatment hyped?
<p>For people with advanced cancer who are running out of options, many cancer centers now offer this hope: Have your tumor's genome sequenced, and doctors will match you with a drug that targets its weak spot. But this booming area of cancer treatment has critics, who say its promise has been oversold. Last week, two prominent voices in the field faced off in a sometimes-tense debate on what's often called precision oncology at the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research in Chicago, Illinois. Their dispute threw a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">splash</span></strong> of cold water on a meeting packed with sessions on genome-based cancer treatments.</p>

Wrapping with a splash: High-speed encapsulation with ultrathin sheets
<p>Many complex fluids rely on surfactants to contain, protect, or isolate liquid drops in an immiscible continuous phase. Thin elastic sheets can wrap liquid drops in a spontaneous process driven by capillary forces. For encapsulation by sheets to be practically viable, a rapid, continuous, and scalable process is essential. We exploit the fast dynamics of droplet impact to achieve wrapping of oil droplets by ultrathin polymer films in a water phase. Despite the violence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">splash</span></strong>ing events, the process robustly yields wrappings that are optimally shaped to maximize the enclosed fluid volume and have near-perfect seams. We achieve wrappings of targeted three-dimensional (3D) shapes by tailoring the 2D boundary of the films and show the generality of the technique by producing both oil-in-water and water-in-oil wrappings.</p>

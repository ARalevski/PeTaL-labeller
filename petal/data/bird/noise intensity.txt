Association of Statin Dose With Amputation and Survival in Patients With Peripheral Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Statin dose guidelines for patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) are largely based on coronary artery disease and stroke data. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of statin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ity on PAD outcomes of amputation and mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using an observational cohort study design and a validated algorithm, we identified patients with incident PAD (2003–2014) in the national Veterans Affairs data. Highest statin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ity exposure (high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ity versus low-to-moderate–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ity versus antiplatelet therapy but no statin use) was determined within 1 year of diagnosis of PAD. Outcomes of interest were lower extremity amputations and death. The association of statin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ity with incident amputation and mortality was assessed with Kaplan-Meier plots, Cox proportional hazards modeling, propensity score–matched analysis, and sensitivity and subgroup analyses, as well, to reduce confounding.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In 155 647 patients with incident PAD, more than a quarter (28%) were not on statins. Use of high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ity statins was lowest in patients with PAD only (6.4%) in comparison with comorbid coronary/carotid disease (18.4%). Incident amputation and mortality risk declined significantly with any statin use in comparison with the antiplatelet therapy–only group. In adjusted Cox models, the high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ity statin users were associated with lower amputation risk and mortality in comparison with antiplatelet therapy–only users (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.61–0.74 and hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.70–0.77, respectively). Low-to-moderate–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ity statins also had significant reductions in the risk of amputation and mortality (hazard ratio amputation, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.75– 0.86; hazard ratio death, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.81–0.86) in comparison with no statins (antiplatelet therapy only), but effect size was significantly weaker than the high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ity statins (<i>P</i><0.001). The association of high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ity statins with lower amputation and death risk remained significant and robust in propensity score–matched, sensitivity, and subgroup analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Statins, especially high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ity formulations, are underused in patients with PAD. This is the first population-based study to show that high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ity statin use at the time of PAD diagnosis is associated with a significant reduction in limb loss and mortality in comparison with low-to-moderate–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ity statin users, and patients treated only with antiplatelet medications but not with statins, as well.</p></sec>

Olfactory memories are intensity specific in larval <i>Drosophila</i>
<p>Learning can rely on stimulus quality, stimulus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ity, or a combination of these. Regarding olfaction, the coding of odour quality is often proposed to be combinatorial along the olfactory pathway, and working hypotheses are available concerning short-term associative memory trace formation of odour quality. However, it is less clear how odour <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ity is coded, and whether olfactory memory traces include information about the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ity of the learnt odour. Using odour–sugar associative conditioning in larval <i>Drosophila</i>, we first describe the dose–effect curves of learnability across odour <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ities for four different odours (<i>n</i>-amyl acetate, 3-octanol, 1-octen-3-ol and benzaldehyde). We then chose odour <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ities such that larvae were trained at an intermediate odour <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ity, but were tested for retention with either that trained intermediate odour <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ity, or with respectively higher or lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ities. We observed a specificity of retention for the trained <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ity for all four odours used. This adds to the appreciation of the richness in ‘content’ of olfactory short-term memory traces, even in a system as simple as larval <i>Drosophila</i>, and to define the demands on computational models of associative olfactory memory trace formation. We suggest two kinds of circuit architecture that have the potential to accommodate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ity learning, and discuss how they may be implemented in the insect brain.</p>

Effect of Intensive Blood Pressure Lowering on Left Ventricular Hypertrophy in Patients With Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>It is currently unknown whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ive blood pressure (BP) lowering beyond that recommended would lead to more lowering of the risk of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in patients with hypertension and whether reducing the risk of LVH explains the reported cardiovascular disease (CVD) benefits of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ive BP lowering in this population.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This analysis included 8164 participants (mean age, 67.9 years; 35.3% women; 31.2% blacks) with hypertension but no diabetes mellitus from the SPRINT trial (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial): 4086 randomly assigned to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ive BP lowering (target SBP <120 mm Hg) and 4078 assigned to standard BP lowering (target SBP <140 mm Hg). Progression and regression of LVH as defined by Cornell voltage criteria derived from standard 12-lead ECGs recorded at baseline and biannually were compared between treatment arms during a median follow-up of 3.81 years. The effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ive (versus standard) BP lowering on the SPRINT primary CVD outcome (a composite of myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, stroke, heart failure, and CVD death) was compared before and after adjustment for LVH as a time-varying covariate.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among SPRINT participants without baseline LVH (n=7559), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ive (versus standard) BP lowering was associated with a 46% lower risk of developing LVH (hazard ratio=0.54; 95% confidence interval, 0.43–0.68). Similarly, among SPRINT participants with baseline LVH (n=605, 7.4%), those assigned to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ive (versus standard) BP lowering were 66% more likely to regress/improve their LVH (hazard ratio=1.66; 95% confidence interval, 1.31–2.11).

The role of light in mediating the effects of ocean acidification on coral calcification
<p>We tested the effect of light and <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> on the calcification and survival of <i>Pocillopora damicornis</i> recruits settled from larvae released in southern Taiwan. In March 2011, recruits were incubated at 31, 41, 70, 122 and 226 μmol photons m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> under ambient (493 μatm) and high <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> (878 μatm). After 5 days, calcification was measured gravimetrically and survivorship estimated as the number of living recruits. Calcification was affected by the interaction of <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> with light, and at 493 μatm <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> the response to light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ity resembled a positive parabola. At 878 μatm <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub>, the effect of light on calcification differed from that observed at 493 μatm <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub>, with the result that there were large differences in calcification between 493 μatm and 878 μatm <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> at intermediate light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ities (<i>ca</i>. 70 μmol photons m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>), but similar rates of calcification at the highest and lowest light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ities. Survivorship was affected by light and <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub>, and was highest at 122 μmol photons m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> in both <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> treatments, but was unrelated to calcification. In June 2012 the experiment was repeated, and again the results suggested that exposure to high <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> decreased calcification of <i>P. damicornis</i> recruits at intermediate light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ities, but not at lower or higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ities. Together, our findings demonstrate that the effect of <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> on coral recruits can be light dependent, with inhibitory effects of high <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> on calcification at intermediate light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ities that disappear at both higher and lower light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ities.</p>

Potential Deaths Averted and Serious Adverse Events Incurred From Adoption of the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) Intensive Blood Pressure Regimen in the United States
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) demonstrated a 27% reduction in all-cause mortality with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) goal of <120 versus <140 mm Hg among US adults at high cardiovascular disease risk but without diabetes mellitus, stroke, or heart failure. To quantify the potential benefits and risks of SPRINT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ive goal implementation, we estimated the deaths prevented and excess serious adverse events incurred if the SPRINT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ive SBP treatment goal were implemented in all eligible US adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>SPRINT eligibility criteria were applied to the 1999 to 2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and linked with the National Death Index through December 2011. SPRINT eligibility included age ≥50 years, SBP of 130 to 180 mm Hg (depending on the number of antihypertensive medications being taken), and high cardiovascular disease risk. Exclusion criteria were diabetes mellitus, history of stroke, >1 g proteinuria, heart failure, estimated glomerular filtration rate <20 mL·min<sup>−1</sup>·1.73 m<sup>−2</sup>, or dialysis. Annual mortality rates were calculated by dividing the Kaplan-Meier 5-year mortality by 5. Hazard ratios for all-cause mortality and heart failure and absolute risks for serious adverse events in SPRINT were used to estimate the number of potential deaths and heart failure cases prevented and serious adverse events incurred with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ive SBP treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean age was 68.6 years, and 83.2% and 7.4% were non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black, respectively. The annual mortality rate was 2.20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.91–2.48), and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ive SBP treatment was projected to prevent ≈107 500 deaths per year (95% CI, 93 300–121 200) and give rise to 56 100 (95% CI, 50 800–61 400) episodes of hypotension, 34 400 (95% CI, 31 200–37 600) episodes of syncope, 43 400 (95% CI, 39 400–47 500) serious electrolyte disorders, and 88 700 (95% CI, 80 400–97 000) cases of acute kidney injury per year. The analysis-of-extremes approach indicated that the range of estimated lower- and upper-bound number of deaths prevented per year with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ive SBP control was 34 600 to 179 600. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ive SBP control was projected to prevent 46 100 (95% CI, 41 800–50 400) cases of heart failure annually.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>If fully implemented in eligible US adults, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ive SBP treatment could prevent ≈107 500 deaths per year.

In Silico Analysis of the Regulation of the Photosynthetic Electron Transport Chain in C3 Plants<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>We present a new simulation model of the reactions in the photosynthetic electron transport chain of C3 species. We show that including recent insights about the regulation of the thylakoid proton motive force, ATP/NADPH balancing mechanisms (cyclic and noncyclic alternative electron transport), and regulation of Rubisco activity leads to emergent behaviors that may affect the operation and regulation of photosynthesis under different dynamic environmental conditions. The model was parameterized with experimental results in the literature, with a focus on Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). A dataset was constructed from multiple sources, including measurements of steady-state and dynamic gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, and absorbance spectroscopy under different light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ities and CO<sub>2</sub>, to test predictions of the model under different experimental conditions. Simulations suggested that there are strong interactions between cyclic and noncyclic alternative electron transport and that an excess capacity for alternative electron transport is required to ensure adequate redox state and lumen pH. Furthermore, the model predicted that, under specific conditions, reduction of ferredoxin by plastoquinol is possible after a rapid increase in light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ity. Further analysis also revealed that the relationship between ATP synthesis and proton motive force was highly regulated by the concentrations of ATP, ADP, and inorganic phosphate, and this facilitated an increase in nonphotochemical quenching and proton motive force under conditions where metabolism was limiting, such as low CO<sub>2</sub>, high light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ity, or combined high CO<sub>2</sub> and high light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ity. The model may be used as an in silico platform for future research on the regulation of photosynthetic electron transport.</p>

Chloroplast Accumulation Response Enhances Leaf Photosynthesis and Plant Biomass Production
<p>Under high light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ity, chloroplasts avoid absorbing excess light by moving to anticlinal cell walls (avoidance response), but under low light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ity, chloroplasts accumulate along periclinal cell walls (accumulation response). In most plant species, these responses are induced by blue light and are mediated by the blue light photoreceptor, phototropin, which also regulates phototropism, leaf flattening, and stomatal opening. These phototropin-mediated responses could enhance photosynthesis and biomass production. Here, using various Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants deficient in chloroplast movement, we demonstrated that the accumulation response enhances leaf photosynthesis and plant biomass production. Conspicuously, <i>phototropin2</i> mutant plants specifically defective in the avoidance response but not in other phototropin-mediated responses displayed a constitutive accumulation response irrespective of light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ities, enhanced leaf photosynthesis, and increased plant biomass production. Therefore, our findings provide clear experimental evidence of the importance of the chloroplast accumulation response in leaf photosynthesis and biomass production.</p>

Acclimation to Fluctuating Light Impacts the Rapidity of Response and Diurnal Rhythm of Stomatal Conductance<sup><xref>1</xref></sup>
<p>Plant acclimation to growth light environment has been studied extensively; however, the majority of these studies have focused on light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ity and photo-acclimation, with few studies exploring the impact of dynamic growth light on stomatal acclimation and behavior. To assess the impact of growth light regime on stomatal acclimation, we grew Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants in three different lighting regimes (with the same average daily <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ity), fluctuating with a fixed pattern of light, fluctuating with a randomized pattern of light (sinusoidal), and nonfluctuating (square wave), to assess the effect of light regime dynamics on gas exchange. We demonstrated that <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> (stomatal conductance to water vapor) acclimation is influenced by both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ity and light pattern, modifying the stomatal kinetics at different times of the day and resulting in differences in the rapidity and magnitude of the <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> response. We also describe and quantify the response to an internal signal that uncouples variation in <i>A</i> and <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> over the majority of the diurnal period and represents 25% of the total diurnal <i>g<sub>s</sub></i>. This <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> response can be characterized by a Gaussian element and when incorporated into the widely used Ball-Berry model greatly improved the prediction of <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> in a dynamic environment. From these findings, we conclude that acclimation of <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> to growth light could be an important strategy for maintaining carbon fixation and overall plant water status and should be considered when inferring responses in the field from laboratory-based experiments.</p>

Of 68   local recurrences, 60 (88%) were identified by the patients themselves.   The six-monthly regime (overall survival (OS) 54%, recurrence-free   survival (RFS) 46%) did not lead to a worse survival and was not   inferior to the three-monthly regime (OS 55%, RFS 47%) in terms   of detecting recurrence.

Frequency, Predictors, and Impact of Combined Antiplatelet Therapy on Venous Thromboembolism in Patients With Symptomatic Atherosclerosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Observational studies suggest that symptomatic atherosclerosis may be associated with risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Prior randomized studies have demonstrated a significant reduction in recurrent VTE with aspirin monotherapy. Whether VTE risk is associated with more severe symptomatic atherosclerosis and more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ive antiplatelet therapy reduces VTE risk beyond aspirin monotherapy is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>TRA2P-TIMI 50 (Thrombin Receptor Antagonist in Secondary Prevention of Atherothrombotic Ischemic Events–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) (vorapaxar) and PEGASUS-TIMI 54 (Prevention of Cardiovascular Events in Patients With Prior Heart Attack Using Ticagrelor Compared to Placebo on a Background of Aspirin–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 54) (ticagrelor) were blinded, randomized placebo-controlled trials of antiplatelet therapy for the prevention of ischemic events in stable patients with symptomatic atherosclerosis.

The risk of VTE was independently associated with age, body mass index, polyvascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and malignancy. The burden of atherosclerosis manifested as an increasing number of symptomatic vascular territories was associated with a graded increase in the 3-year rates of VTE (0.76% for 1, 1.53% for 2, and 2.45% for 3 territories). More <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ive antiplatelet therapy (vorapaxar and ticagrelor pooled) significantly reduced the risk of VTE by 29% compared with background antiplatelet therapy, from 0.93% to 0.64% at 3 years (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% confidence interval, 0.56–0.89; <i>P</i>=0.003).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The rate of VTE in patients with atherosclerosis is ≈0.3% per year while on treatment with ≥1 antiplatelet agent, with increased risk independently associated with the number of symptomatic vascular territories.

However, few participants with ASCVD risk <5% had elevated CAC.

Weight Loss and Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Associations of obesity with incidence of heart failure have been observed, but the causality is uncertain. We hypothesized that gastric bypass surgery leads to a lower incidence of heart failure compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ive lifestyle modification in obese people.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We included obese people without previous heart failure from a Swedish nationwide registry of people treated with a structured <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ive lifestyle program and the Scandinavian Obesity Surgery Registry. All analyses used inverse probability weights based on baseline body mass index and a propensity score estimated from baseline variables. Treatment groups were well balanced in terms of weight, body mass index, and most potential confounders. Associations of treatment with heart failure incidence, as defined in the National Patient Register, were analyzed with Cox regression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The 25 804 gastric bypass surgery patients had on average lost 18.8 kg more weight after 1 year and 22.6 kg more after 2 years than the 13 701 lifestyle modification patients. During a median of 4.1 years, surgery patients had lower heart failure incidence than lifestyle modification patients (hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% confidence interval, 0.36–0.82). A 10-kg achieved weight loss after 1 year was related to a hazard ratio for heart failure of 0.77 (95% confidence interval, 0.60–0.97) in both treatment groups combined. Results were robust in sensitivity analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Gastric bypass surgery was associated with approximately one half the incidence of heart failure compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ive lifestyle modification in this study of 2 large nationwide registries.

Differential radial growth patterns between beech (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i> L.) and oak (<i>Quercus robur</i> L.) on periodically waterlogged soils
<p>Climate scenarios for northern Central Europe project rising temperatures and increasing frequency and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ity of droughts but also a shift in precipitation pattern with more humid winters. This in turn may result in soil waterlogging during the following spring, leading to increasing stress for trees growing on hydric sites. The influence of waterlogging on growth of common beech and pedunculate oak has been studied <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ively on seedlings under experimental conditions. However, the question remains whether results of these studies can be transferred to mature trees growing under natural conditions. To test this, we investigated general growth patterns and climate–growth relationships in four mature stands of beech and oak growing on hydromorphic soils (Stagnosols) in northeast Germany using dendrochronological methods. Our results confirmed the expected tolerance of oak to strong water-level fluctuations. Neither extremely wet conditions during spring nor summer droughts significantly affected its radial growth. Oak growth responded positively to warmer temperatures during previous year October and March of the current year of ring formation. Contrary to our expectations, also beech showed relatively low sensitivity to periods of high soil water saturation. Instead, summer drought turned out to be the main climatic factor influencing ring width of beech even under the specific periodically wet soil conditions of our study. This became evident from general climate–growth correlations over the last century as well as from discontinuous (pointer year) analysis with summer drought being significantly correlated to the occurrence of growth depressions. As ring width of the two species is affected by differing climate parameters, species-specific chronologies show no coherence in high-frequency variations even for trees growing in close proximity. We assume differences in rooting depth as the main reason for the differing growth patterns and climate correlations of the two species under study. Our results indicate that under the projected future climate scenarios, beech may suffer from increasing drought stress even on hydromorphic soils. Oak might be able to maintain a sufficient hydraulic status during summer droughts by reaching water in deeper soil strata with its root system. Wet phases with waterlogged soil conditions during spring or summer appear to have only a little direct influence on radial growth of both species.</p>

Coordinating the overall stomatal response of plants: Rapid leaf-to-leaf communication during light stress
<p>The plant canopy functions as an aerial array of light-harvesting antennas. To achieve maximal yield, each leaf within this array and the array as a whole need to rapidly adjust to naturally occurring fluctuations in light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ity and quality. Excessive light stress triggers the closing of pores in leaves called stomata to minimize moisture loss. We found that different leaves within the canopy of an <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> plant, including leaves not directly exposed to light, coordinated stomatal closure in response to light stress by sending and receiving rapid systemic signals. This response required the plant hormones abscisic acid and jasmonic acid and was mediated by a rapid autopropagating wave of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Furthermore, this response depended on the function of genes encoding the ROS-generating NADPH oxidase RBOHD and various stomatal regulators, such as the anion channel SLAC1, GHR1 (guard cell hydrogen peroxide resistant 1), and lipoxygenase 1 (LOX1). Our findings reveal that plants function as highly dynamic and coordinated organisms, optimizing the overall response of their canopies to fluctuating light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ities.</p>

Rovibrational quantum state resolution of the C<sub>60</sub> fullerene
<p>The unique physical properties of buckminsterfullerene, C<sub>60</sub>, have attracted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>e research activity since its original discovery. Total quantum state–resolved spectroscopy of isolated C<sub>60</sub> molecules has been of particularly long-standing interest. Such observations have, to date, been unsuccessful owing to the difficulty in preparing cold, gas-phase C<sub>60</sub> in sufficiently high densities. Here we report high-resolution infrared absorption spectroscopy of C<sub>60</sub> in the 8.5-micron spectral region (1180 to 1190 wave number). A combination of cryogenic buffer-gas cooling and cavity-enhanced direct frequency comb spectroscopy has enabled the observation of quantum state–resolved rovibrational transitions. Characteristic nuclear spin statistical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ity patterns confirm the indistinguishability of the 60 carbon-12 atoms, while rovibrational fine structure encodes further details of the molecule’s rare icosahedral symmetry.</p>

A continental system for forecasting bird migration
<p>Billions of animals cross the globe each year during seasonal migrations, but efforts to monitor them are hampered by the unpredictability of their movements. We developed a bird migration forecast system at a continental scale by leveraging 23 years of spring observations to identify associations between atmospheric conditions and bird migration <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ity. Our models explained up to 81% of variation in migration <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ity across the United States at altitudes of 0 to 3000 meters, and performance remained high in forecasting events 1 to 7 days in advance (62 to 76% of variation was explained). Avian migratory movements across the United States likely exceed 500 million individuals per night during peak passage. Bird migration forecasts will reduce collisions with buildings, airplanes, and wind turbines; inform a variety of monitoring efforts; and engage the public.</p>

Jupiter’s magnetosphere and aurorae observed by the Juno spacecraft during its first polar orbits
<p>The Juno spacecraft acquired direct observations of the jovian magnetosphere and auroral emissions from a vantage point above the poles. Juno’s capture orbit spanned the jovian magnetosphere from bow shock to the planet, providing magnetic field, charged particle, and wave phenomena context for Juno’s passage over the poles and traverse of Jupiter’s hazardous inner radiation belts. Juno’s energetic particle and plasma detectors measured electrons precipitating in the polar regions, exciting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>e aurorae, observed simultaneously by the ultraviolet and infrared imaging spectrographs. Juno transited beneath the most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>e parts of the radiation belts, passed about 4000 kilometers above the cloud tops at closest approach, well inside the jovian rings, and recorded the electrical signatures of high-velocity impacts with small particles as it traversed the equator.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
The Impacts of Fluctuating Light on Crop Performance
<p>Rapidly changing light conditions can reduce carbon gain and productivity in field crops because photosynthetic responses to light fluctuations are not instantaneous. Plant responses to fluctuating light occur across levels of organizational complexity from entire canopies to the biochemistry of a single reaction and across orders of magnitude of time. Although light availability and variation at the top of the canopy are largely dependent on the solar angle and degree of cloudiness, lower crop canopies rely more heavily on light in the form of sunflecks, the quantity of which depends mostly on canopy structure but also may be affected by wind. The ability of leaf photosynthesis to respond rapidly to these variations in light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ity is restricted by the relatively slow opening/closing of stomata, activation/deactivation of C<sub>3</sub> cycle enzymes, and up-regulation/down-regulation of photoprotective processes. The metabolic complexity of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis creates the apparently contradictory possibilities that C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis may be both more and less resilient than C<sub>3</sub> to dynamic light regimes, depending on the frequency at which these light fluctuations occur. We review the current understanding of the underlying mechanisms of these limitations to photosynthesis in fluctuating light that have shown promise in improving the response times of photosynthesis-related processes to changes in light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ity.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
A Novel Mechanism, Linked to Cell Density, Largely Controls Cell Division in <i>Synechocystis</i>
<p>Many studies have investigated the various genetic and environmental factors regulating cyanobacterial growth. Here, we investigated the growth and metabolism of <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 under different nitrogen sources, light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ities, and CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. Cells grown on urea showed the highest growth rates. However, for all conditions tested, the daily growth rates in batch cultures decreased steadily over time, and stationary phase was obtained with similar cell densities. Unexpectedly, metabolic and physiological analyses showed that growth rates during log phase were not controlled primarily by the availability of photoassimilates. Further physiological investigations indicated that nutrient limitation, quorum sensing, light quality, and light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ity (self-shading) were not the main factors responsible for the decrease in the growth rate and the onset of the stationary phase. Moreover, cell division rates in fed-batch cultures were positively correlated with the dilution rates. Hence, not only light, CO<sub>2</sub>, and nutrients can affect growth but also a cell-cell interaction. Accordingly, we propose that cell-cell interaction may be a factor responsible for the gradual decrease of growth rates in batch cultures during log phase, culminating with the onset of stationary phase.</p>

Leaf Starch Turnover Occurs in Long Days and in Falling Light at the End of the Day
<p>We investigated whether starch degradation occurs at the same time as starch synthesis in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves in the light. Starch accumulated in a linear fashion for about 12 h after dawn, then accumulation slowed and content plateaued. Following decreases in light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ity, the rate of accumulation of starch declined in proportion to the decline in photosynthesis if the decrease occurred <10 h after dawn, but accumulation ceased or loss of starch occurred if the same decrease in light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ity was imposed more than 10 h after dawn. These changes in starch accumulation patterns after prolonged periods in the light occurred at both high and low starch contents and were not related to time-dependent changes in either the rate of photosynthesis or the partitioning of assimilate between starch and Suc, as assessed from metabolite measurements and <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> pulse experiments. Instead, measurements of incorporation of <sup>13</sup>C from <sup>13</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> into starch and of levels of the starch degradation product maltose showed that substantial starch degradation occurred simultaneously with synthesis at time points >14 h after dawn and in response to decreases in light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ity that occurred >10 h after dawn. Starch measurements in circadian clock mutants suggested that the clock influences the timing of onset of degradation. We conclude that the propensity for leaf starch to be degraded increases with time after dawn. The importance of this phenomenon for efficient use of carbon for growth in long days and for prevention of starvation during twilight is discussed.</p>

Genome-Wide Analysis of Selection on the Malaria Parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> in West African Populations of Differing Infection Endemicity
<p>Locally varying selection on pathogens may be due to differences in drug pressure, host immunity, transmission opportunities between hosts, or the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ity of between-genotype competition within hosts. Highly recombining populations of the human malaria parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> throughout West Africa are closely related, as gene flow is relatively unrestricted in this endemic region, but markedly varying ecology and transmission <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ity should cause distinct local selective pressures. Genome-wide analysis of sequence variation was undertaken on a sample of 100 <i>P. falciparum</i> clinical isolates from a highly endemic region of the Republic of Guinea where transmission occurs for most of each year and compared with data from 52 clinical isolates from a previously sampled population from The Gambia, where there is relatively limited seasonal malaria transmission. Paired-end short-read sequences were mapped against the 3D7 <i>P. falciparum</i> reference genome sequence, and data on 136,144 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were obtained. Within-population analyses identifying loci showing evidence of recent positive directional selection and balancing selection confirm that antimalarial drugs and host immunity have been major selective agents. Many of the signatures of recent directional selection reflected by standardized integrated haplotype scores were population specific, including differences at drug resistance loci due to historically different antimalarial use between the countries. In contrast, both populations showed a similar set of loci likely to be under balancing selection as indicated by very high Tajima’s <i>D</i> values, including a significant overrepresentation of genes expressed at the merozoite stage that invades erythrocytes and several previously validated targets of acquired immunity. Between-population <i>F</i><sub>ST</sub> analysis identified exceptional differentiation of allele frequencies at a small number of loci, most markedly for five SNPs covering a 15-kb region within and flanking the <i>gdv1</i> gene that regulates the early stages of gametocyte development, which is likely related to the extreme differences in mosquito vector abundance and seasonality that determine the transmission opportunities for the sexual stage of the parasite.</p>

Prevalence and Predictors of Cholesterol Screening, Awareness, and Statin Treatment Among US Adults With Familial Hypercholesterolemia or Other Forms of Severe Dyslipidemia (1999–2014)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and other extreme elevations in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol significantly increase the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; however, recent data suggest that prescription rates for statins remain low in these patients. National rates of screening, awareness, and treatment with statins among individuals with FH or severe dyslipidemia are unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data from the 1999 to 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were used to estimate prevalence rates of self-reported screening, awareness, and statin therapy among US adults (n=42 471 weighted to represent 212 million US adults) with FH (defined using the Dutch Lipid Clinic criteria) and with severe dyslipidemia (defined as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels ≥190 mg/dL). Logistic regression was used to identify sociodemographic and clinical correlates of hypercholesterolemia awareness and statin therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The estimated US prevalence of definite/probable FH was 0.47% (standard error, 0.03%) and of severe dyslipidemia was 6.6% (standard error, 0.2%).

Only 30.3% of patients with definite/probable FH on statins were taking a high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ity statin. The prevalence of statin use in adults with severe dyslipidemia increased over time (from 29.4% to 47.7%) but not faster than trends in the general population (from 5.7% to 17.6%). Older age, health insurance status, having a usual source of care, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and having a personal history of early atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease were associated with higher statin use.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Despite the high prevalence of cholesterol screening and awareness, only ≈50% of adults with FH are on statin therapy, with even fewer prescribed a high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ity statin; young and uninsured patients are at the highest risk for lack of screening and for undertreatment. This study highlights an imperative to improve the frequency of cholesterol screening and statin prescription rates to better identify and treat this high-risk population.

Neuroprotective Effects of the Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Analog Exenatide After Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In-hospital mortality in comatose patients resuscitated from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is ≈50%. In OHCA patients, the leading cause of death is neurological injury secondary to ischemia and reperfusion. Glucagon-like peptide-1 analogs are approved for type 2 diabetes mellitus; preclinical and clinical data have suggested their organ-protective effects in patients with ischemia and reperfusion injury. The aim of this trial was to investigate the neuroprotective effects of the glucagon-like peptide-1 analog exenatide in resuscitated OHCA patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We randomly assigned 120 consecutive comatose patients resuscitated from OHCA in a double-blind, 2-center trial.

Impact of Combat Deployment and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder on Newly Reported Coronary Heart Disease Among US Active Duty and Reserve Forces
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>The recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have exposed thousands of service members to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>e stress, and as a result, many have developed posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The role of military deployment experiences and PTSD in coronary heart disease (CHD) is not well defined, especially in young US service members with recent combat exposure.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We conducted a prospective cohort study to investigate the relationships between wartime experiences, PTSD, and CHD. Current and former US military personnel from all service branches participating in the Millennium Cohort Study during 2001 to 2008 (n=60 025) were evaluated for newly self-reported CHD. Electronic medical record review for <i>International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification</i> codes for CHD was conducted among a subpopulation of active duty members (n=23 794). Logistic regression models examined the associations between combat experiences and PTSD with CHD with adjustment for established CHD risk factors. A total of 627 participants (1.0%) newly reported CHD over an average of 5.6 years of follow-up. Deployers with combat experiences had an increased odds of newly reporting CHD (odds ratio, 1.63; 95% confidence interval, 1.11–2.40) and having a diagnosis code for new-onset CHD (odds ratio, 1.93; 95% confidence interval, 1.31–2.84) compared with noncombat deployers. Screening positive for PTSD symptoms was associated with self-reported CHD before but not after adjustment for depression and anxiety and was not associated with a new diagnosis code for CHD.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Combat deployments are associated with new-onset CHD among young US service members and veterans. Experiences of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>e stress may increase the risk for CHD over a relatively short period among young adults.</p></sec>

Activation of the cnidarian oxidative stress response by ultraviolet radiation, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and crude oil
<p>Organisms are continuously exposed to reactive chemicals capable of causing oxidative stress and cellular damage. Antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutases (SODs) and catalases, are present in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes and provide an important means of neutralizing such oxidants. Studies in cnidarians have previously documented the occurrence of antioxidant enzymes (transcript expression, protein expression and/or enzymatic activity), but most of these studies have not been conducted in species with sequenced genomes or included phylogenetic analyses, making it difficult to compare results across species due to uncertainties in the relationships between genes. Through searches of the genome of the sea anemone <i>Nematostella vectensis</i> Stephenson, one catalase gene and six SOD family members were identified, including three copper/zinc-containing SODs (CuZnSODs), two manganese-containing SODs (MnSODs) and one copper chaperone of SOD (CCS). In 24 h acute toxicity tests, juvenile <i>N. vectensis</i> showed enhanced sensitivity to combinations of ultraviolet radiation (UV) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs, specifically pyrene, benzo[a]pyrene and fluoranthene) relative to either stressor alone. Adult <i>N. vectensis</i> exhibited little or no mortality following UV, benzo[a]pyrene or crude oil exposure but exhibited changes in gene expression. Antioxidant enzyme transcripts were both upregulated and downregulated following UV and/or chemical exposure. Expression patterns were most strongly affected by UV exposure but varied between experiments, suggesting that responses vary according to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ity and duration of exposure. These experiments provide a basis for comparison with other cnidarian taxa and for further studies of the oxidative stress response in <i>N. vectensis.</i></p>

Skeletal muscle fuel selection occurs at the mitochondrial level
<p>Mammals exponentially increase the rate of carbohydrate oxidation as exercise <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ity rises, while birds combust lipid almost exclusively while flying at high percentages of aerobic capacity. The fuel oxidized by contracting muscle depends on many factors: whole-body fuel storage mass, mobilization, blood transport, cellular uptake, and substrate selection at the level of the mitochondrion. We examined the fuel preferences of mitochondria isolated from mammalian and avian locomotory muscles using two approaches. First, the influence of substrates on the kinetics of respiration (<i>K</i><sub>m,ADP</sub> and <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>) was evaluated. For all substrates and combinations, <i>K</i><sub>m,ADP</sub> was generally twofold higher in avian mitochondria. Second, fuel competition between pyruvate, glutamate and/or palmitoyl-<sc>l</sc>-carnitine at three levels of ATP free energy was determined using the principle of mass balance and the measured rates of O<sub>2</sub> consumption and metabolite accumulation/utilization. Avian mitochondria strongly spared pyruvate from oxidation when another substrate was available and fatty acid was the dominant substrate, regardless of energy state. Mammalian mitochondria exhibited some preference for fatty acid over pyruvate at lower flux (higher energy state), but exhibited a much greater tendency to select pyruvate and glutamate when available. Studies in sonicated mitochondria revealed twofold higher electron transport chain electron conductance in avian mitochondria. We conclude that substantial fuel selection occurs at the level of the mitochondrial matrix and that avian flight muscle mitochondria are particularly biased toward the selection of fatty acid, possibly by facilitating high β-oxidation flux by maintaining a more oxidized matrix.</p>

Correlation between genome reduction and bacterial growth
<p>Genome reduction by removing dispensable genomic sequences in bacteria is commonly used in both fundamental and applied studies to determine the minimal genetic requirements for a living system or to develop highly efficient bioreactors. Nevertheless, whether and how the accumulative loss of dispensable genomic sequences disturbs bacterial growth remains unclear. To investigate the relationship between genome reduction and growth, a series of <i>Escherichia coli</i> strains carrying genomes reduced in a stepwise manner were used. Intensive growth analyses revealed that the accumulation of multiple genomic deletions caused decreases in the exponential growth rate and the saturated cell density in a deletion-length-dependent manner as well as gradual changes in the patterns of growth dynamics, regardless of the growth media. Accordingly, a perspective growth model linking genome evolution to genome engineering was proposed. This study provides the first demonstration of a quantitative connection between genomic sequence and bacterial growth, indicating that growth rate is potentially associated with dispensable genomic sequences.</p>

Sepsis otopathy: experimental sepsis leads to significant hearing impairment due to apoptosis and glutamate excitotoxicity in murine cochlea
<p>Hearing loss is frequent in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ive care patients and can be due to several causes. However, sepsis has not been examined as a possible cause. The aim of this study is to assess the influence of experimental sepsis on hearing thresholds and to evaluate pathological changes in the cochlea. The cecal ligation puncture technique was used to induce sepsis in 18 mice. Results were compared with those from 13 sham-operated and 13 untreated control mice. The hearing thresholds of the animals were evaluated with auditory evoked brainstem responses prior to the induction of sepsis and again at the peak of the disease. Immediately after the second measurement, the mice were sacrificed and the inner ears harvested and prepared for further evaluation. The cochleae were examined with light microscopy, electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry for Bax, cleaved caspase-3 and Bcl-2. The mice with sepsis showed a significant hearing loss but not the control groups. Induction of apoptosis could be shown in the supporting cells of the organ of Corti. Furthermore, excitotoxicity could be shown at the basal pole of the inner hair cells. In this murine model, sepsis leads to significant hearing impairment. The physiological alteration could be linked to apoptosis in the supporting cells of the organ of Corti and to a disturbance of the synapses of the inner hair cells.</p>

Impact of Regionalization of ST-Segment–Elevation Myocardial Infarction Care on Treatment Times and Outcomes for Emergency Medical Services–Transported Patients Presenting to Hospitals With Percutaneous Coronary Intervention
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Regional variations in reperfusion times and mortality in patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction are influenced by differences in coordinating care between emergency medical services (EMS) and hospitals. Building on the Accelerator-1 Project, we hypothesized that time to reperfusion could be further reduced with enhanced regional efforts.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Between April 2015 and March 2017, we worked with 12 metropolitan regions across the United States with 132 percutaneous coronary intervention–capable hospitals and 946 EMS agencies. Data were collected in the ACTION (Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network)-Get With The Guidelines Registry for quarterly Mission: Lifeline reports. The primary end point was the change in the proportion of EMS-transported patients with first medical contact to device time ≤90 minutes from baseline to final quarter. We also compared treatment times and mortality with patients treated in hospitals not participating in the project during the corresponding time period.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>During the study period, 10 730 patients were transported to percutaneous coronary intervention–capable hospitals, including 974 in the baseline quarter and 972 in the final quarter who met inclusion criteria. Median age was 61 years; 27% were women, 6% had cardiac arrest, and 6% had shock on admission; 10% were black, 12% were Latino, and 10% were uninsured. By the end of the intervention, all process measures reflecting coordination between EMS and hospitals had improved, including the proportion of patients with a first medical contact to device time of ≤90 minutes (67%–74%; <i>P</i><0.002), a first medical contact to device time to catheterization laboratory activation of ≤20 minutes (38%–56%; <i>P</i><0.0001), and emergency department dwell time of ≤20 minutes (33%–43%; <i>P</i><0.0001). Of the 12 regions, 9 regions reduced first medical contact to device time, and 8 met or exceeded the national goal of 75% of patients treated in ≤90 minutes. Improvements in treatment times corresponded with a significant reduction in mortality (in-hospital death, 4.4%–2.3%; <i>P</i>=0.001) that was not apparent in hospitals not participating in the project during the same time period.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Organization of care among EMS and hospitals in 12 regions was associated with significant reductions in time to reperfusion in patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction as well as in in-hospital mortality.

Targeting Chondroitin Sulfate Glycosaminoglycans to Treat Cardiac Fibrosis in Pathological Remodeling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Heart failure is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity, and the search for novel therapeutic approaches continues. In the monogenic disease mucopolysaccharidosis VI, loss-of-function mutations in arylsulfatase B lead to myocardial accumulation of chondroitin sulfate (CS) glycosaminoglycans, manifesting as myriad cardiac symptoms. Here, we studied changes in myocardial CS in nonmucopolysaccharidosis failing hearts and assessed its generic role in pathological cardiac remodeling.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Healthy and diseased human and rat left ventricles were subjected to histological and immunostaining methods to analyze glycosaminoglycan distribution. Glycosaminoglycans were extracted and analyzed for quantitative and compositional changes with Alcian blue assay and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry. Expression changes in 20 CS-related genes were studied in 3 primary human cardiac cell types and THP-1–derived macrophages under each of 9 in vitro stimulatory conditions. In 2 rat models of pathological remodeling induced by transverse aortic constriction or isoprenaline infusion, recombinant human arylsulfatase B (rhASB), clinically used as enzyme replacement therapy in mucopolysaccharidosis VI, was administered intravenously for 7 or 5 weeks, respectively. Cardiac function, myocardial fibrosis, and inflammation were assessed by echocardiography and histology. CS-interacting molecules were assessed with surface plasmon resonance, and a mechanism of action was verified in vitro.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Failing human hearts displayed significant perivascular and interstitial CS accumulation, particularly in regions of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>e fibrosis. Relative composition of CS disaccharides remained unchanged. Transforming growth factor–β induced CS upregulation in cardiac fibroblasts. CS accumulation was also observed in both the pressure-overload and the isoprenaline models of pathological remodeling in rats. Early treatment with rhASB in the transverse aortic constriction model and delayed treatment in the isoprenaline model proved rhASB to be effective at preventing cardiac deterioration and augmenting functional recovery. Functional improvement was accompanied by reduced myocardial inflammation and overall fibrosis. Tumor necrosis factor–α was identified as a direct binding partner of CS glycosaminoglycan chains, and rhASB reduced tumor necrosis factor–α—induced inflammatory gene activation in vitro in endothelial cells and macrophages.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>CS glycosaminoglycans accumulate during cardiac pathological remodeling and mediate myocardial inflammation and fibrosis. rhASB targets CS effectively as a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of heart failure.</p></sec>

High-Dose Versus Low-Dose Pitavastatin in Japanese Patients With Stable Coronary Artery Disease (REAL-CAD)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Current guidelines call for high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ity statin therapy in patients with cardiovascular disease on the basis of several previous “more versus less statins” trials. However, no clear evidence for more versus less statins has been established in an Asian population.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In this prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label, blinded end point study, 13 054 Japanese patients with stable coronary artery disease who achieved low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) <120 mg/dL during a run-in period (pitavastatin 1 mg/d) were randomized in a 1-to-1 fashion to high-dose (pitavastatin 4 mg/d; n=6526) or low-dose (pitavastatin 1 mg/d; n=6528) statin therapy. The primary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal ischemic stroke, or unstable angina requiring emergency hospitalization. The secondary composite end point was a composite of the primary end point and clinically indicated coronary revascularization excluding target-lesion revascularization at sites of prior percutaneous coronary intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean age of the study population was 68 years, and 83% were male.

During the entire course of follow-up, LDL-C in the high-dose group was lower by 14.7 mg/dL than in the low-dose group (<i>P</i><0.001). With a median follow-up of 3.9 years, high-dose as compared with low-dose pitavastatin significantly reduced the risk of the primary end point (266 patients [4.3%] and 334 patients [5.4%]; hazard ratio, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.69–0.95; <i>P</i>=0.01) and the risk of the secondary composite end point (489 patients [7.9%] and 600 patients [9.7%]; hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.73–0.93; <i>P</i>=0.002). High-dose pitavastatin also significantly reduced the risks of several other secondary end points such as all-cause death, myocardial infarction, and clinically indicated coronary revascularization.

Vo<sub>2</sub>max increased by 18% (exercise training: pre 29.0±4.8 to post 34.4±6.4; control: pre 29.5±5.3 to post 28.7±5.4, group×time <i>P</i><0.001) and LV stiffness was reduced (right/downward shift in the end-diastolic pressure-volume relationships; preexercise training stiffness constant 0.072±0.037 to postexercise training 0.051±0.0268, <i>P</i>=0.0018), whereas there was no change in controls (group×time <i>P</i><0.001; pre stiffness constant 0.0635±0.026 to post 0.062±0.031, <i>P</i>=0.83). Exercise increased LV end-diastolic volume (group×time <i>P</i><0.001), whereas pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was unchanged, providing greater stroke volume for any given filling pressure (loading×group×time <i>P</i>=0.007).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In previously sedentary healthy middle-aged adults, 2 years of exercise training improved maximal oxygen uptake and decreased cardiac stiffness. Regular exercise training may provide protection against the future risk of heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction by preventing the increase in cardiac stiffness attributable to sedentary aging.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Persistent Long-Term Structural, Functional, and Metabolic Changes After Stress-Induced (Takotsubo) Cardiomyopathy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is an increasingly recognized acute heart failure syndrome precipitated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>e emotional stress. Although there is an apparent rapid and spontaneous recovery of left ventricular ejection fraction, the long-term clinical and functional consequences of takotsubo cardiomyopathy are ill-defined.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In an observational case-control study, we recruited 37 patients with prior (>12-month) takotsubo cardiomyopathy, and 37 age-, sex-, and comorbidity-matched control subjects. Patients completed the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire. All participants underwent detailed clinical phenotypic characterization, including serum biomarker analysis, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, echocardiography, and cardiac magnetic resonance including cardiac <sup>31</sup>P-spectroscopy.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Participants were predominantly middle-age (64±11 years) women (97%). Although takotsubo cardiomyopathy occurred 20 (range 13–39) months before the study, the majority (88%) of patients had persisting symptoms compatible with heart failure (median of 13 [range 0–76] in the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire) and cardiac limitation on exercise testing (reduced peak oxygen consumption, 24±1.3 versus 31±1.3 mL/kg/min, <i>P</i><0.001; increased VE/V<sc>co</sc><sub>2</sub> slope, 31±1 versus 26±1, <i>P</i>=0.002). Despite normal left ventricular ejection fraction and serum biomarkers, patients with prior takotsubo cardiomyopathy had impaired cardiac deformation indices (reduced apical circumferential strain, −16±1.0 versus −23±1.5%, <i>P</i><0.001; global longitudinal strain, −17±1 versus −20±1%, <i>P</i>=0.006), increased native T1 mapping values (1264±10 versus 1184±10 ms, <i>P</i><0.001), and impaired cardiac energetic status (phosphocreatine/γ-adenosine triphosphate ratio, 1.3±0.1 versus 1.9±0.1, <i>P</i><0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In contrast to previous perceptions, takotsubo cardiomyopathy has long-lasting clinical consequences, including demonstrable symptomatic and functional impairment associated with persistent subclinical cardiac dysfunction. Taken together our findings demonstrate that after takotsubo cardiomyopathy, patients develop a persistent, long-term heart failure phenotype.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Conscious Sedation Versus General Anesthesia for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Conscious sedation is used during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with limited evidence as to the safety and efficacy of this practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The National Cardiovascular Data Registry Society of Thoracic Surgeons/American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry was used to characterize the anesthesia choice and clinical outcomes of all US patients undergoing elective percutaneous transfemoral TAVR between April 1, 2014, and June 30, 2015. Raw and inverse probability of treatment-weighted analyses were performed to compare patients undergoing TAVR with general anesthesia with patients undergoing TAVR with conscious sedation on an intention-to-treat basis for the primary outcome of in-hospital mortality, and secondary outcomes including 30-day mortality, in-hospital and 30-day death/stroke, procedural success, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ive care unit and hospital length-of-stay, and rates of discharge to home. Post hoc falsification end point analyses were performed to evaluate for residual confounding.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Conscious sedation was used in 1737/10 997 (15.8%) cases with a significant trend of increasing usage over the time period studied (<i>P</i> for trend<0.001). In raw analyses, intraprocedural success with conscious sedation and general anesthesia was similar (98.2% versus 98.5%, <i>P</i>=0.31). The conscious sedation group was less likely to experience in-hospital (1.6% versus 2.5%, <i>P</i>=0.03) and 30-day death (2.9% versus 4.1%, <i>P</i>=0.03). Conversion from conscious sedation to general anesthesia was noted in 102 of 1737 (5.9%) of conscious sedation cases. After inverse probability of treatment-weighted adjustment for 51 covariates, conscious sedation was associated with lower procedural success (97.9% versus 98.6%, <i>P</i><0.001) and a reduced rate of mortality at the in-hospital (1.5% versus 2.4%, <i>P</i><0.001) and 30-day (2.3% versus 4.0%, <i>P</i><0.001) time points. Conscious sedation was associated with reductions in procedural inotrope requirement, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ive care unit and hospital length of stay (6.0 versus 6.5 days, <i>P</i><0.001), and combined 30-day death/stroke rates (4.8% versus 6.4%, <i>P</i><0.001). Falsification end point analyses of vascular complications, bleeding, and new pacemaker/defibrillator implantation demonstrated no significant differences between groups after adjustment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In US practice, conscious sedation is associated with briefer length of stay and lower in-hospital and 30-day mortality in comparison with TAVR with general anesthesia in both unadjusted and adjusted analyses. These results suggest the safety of conscious sedation in this population, although comparative effectiveness analyses using observational data cannot definitively establish the superiority of one technique over another.</p></sec>

Acute Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non–ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) management has evolved considerably over the past 2 decades. Little information on mortality trends in the most recent years is available. We assessed trends in characteristics, treatments, and outcomes for acute myocardial infarction in France between 1995 and 2015.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used data from 5 one-month registries, conducted 5 years apart, from 1995 to 2015, including 14 423 patients with acute myocardial infarction (59% STEMI) admitted to cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intens</span></strong>ive care units in metropolitan France.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>From 1995 to 2015, mean age decreased from 66±14 to 63±14 years in patients with STEMI; it remained stable (68±14 years) in patients with NSTEMI, whereas diabetes mellitus, obesity, and hypertension increased. At the acute stage, intended primary percutaneous coronary intervention increased from 12% (1995) to 76% (2015) in patients with STEMI. In patients with NSTEMI, percutaneous coronary intervention ≤72 hours from admission increased from 9% (1995) to 60% (2015). Six-month mortality consistently decreased in patients with STEMI from 17.2% in 1995 to 6.9% in 2010 and 5.3% in 2015; it decreased from 17.2% to 6.9% in 2010 and 6.3% in 2015 in patients with NSTEMI. Mortality still decreased after 2010 in patients with STEMI without reperfusion therapy, whereas no further mortality gain was found in patients with STEMI with reperfusion therapy or in patients with NSTEMI, whether or not they were treated with percutaneous coronary intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Over the past 20 years, 6-month mortality after acute myocardial infarction has decreased considerably for patients with STEMI and NSTEMI. Mortality figures continued to decline in patients with STEMI until 2015, whereas mortality in patients with NSTEMI appears stable since 2010.</p></sec>

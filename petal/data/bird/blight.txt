Is Permanent Parasitism Reversible?—Critical Evidence from Early Evolution of House Dust Mites
<p>Long-term specialization may limit the ability of a species to respond to new environmental conditions and lead to a higher likelihood of extinction. For permanent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parasit</span></strong>es and other symbionts, the most intriguing question is whether these organisms can return to a free-living lifestyle and, thus, escape an evolutionary “dead end.” This question is directly related to Dollo's law, which stipulates that a complex trait (such as being free living vs. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parasit</span></strong>ic) cannot re-evolve again in the same form. Here, we present conclusive evidence that house dust mites, a group of medically important free-living organisms, evolved from permanent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parasit</span></strong>es of warm-blooded vertebrates. A robust, multigene topology (315 taxa, 8942 nt), ancestral character state reconstruction, and a test for irreversible evolution (Dollo's law) demonstrate that house dust mites have abandoned a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parasit</span></strong>ic lifestyle, secondarily becoming free living, and then speciated in several habitats. Hence, as exemplified by this model system, highly specialized permanent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parasit</span></strong>es may drastically de-specialize to the extent of becoming free living and, thus escape from dead-end evolution. Our phylogenetic and historical ecological framework explains the limited cross-reactivity between allergens from the house dust mites and “storage” mites and the ability of the dust mites to inhibit host immune responses. It also provides insights into how ancestral features related to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parasit</span></strong>ism (frequent ancestral shifts to unrelated hosts, tolerance to lower humidity, and pre-existing enzymes targeting skin and keratinous materials) played a major role in reversal to the free-living state. We propose that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parasit</span></strong>ic ancestors of pyroglyphids shifted to nests of vertebrates. Later the nest-inhabiting pyroglyphids expanded into human dwellings to become a major source of allergens.

Lectins modulate the microbiota of social amoebae
<p>The social amoeba <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> maintains a microbiome during multicellular development; <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> are carried in migrating slugs and as endosymbionts within amoebae and spores. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>l carriage and endosymbiosis are induced by the secreted lectin discoidin I that binds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>, protects them from extracellular killing, and alters their retention within amoebae. This altered handling of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> also occurs with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> coated by plant lectins and leads to DNA transfer from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> to amoebae. Thus, lectins alter the cellular response of <i>D. discoideum</i> to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> to establish the amoebae’s microbiome. Mammalian cells can also maintain intracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> when presented with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> coated with lectins, so heterologous lectins may induce endosymbiosis in animals. Our results suggest that endogenous or environmental lectins may influence microbiome homeostasis across eukaryotic phylogeny.</p>

High parasite diversity accelerates host adaptation and diversification
<p>Host-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parasit</span></strong>e species pairs are known to coevolve, but how multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parasit</span></strong>es coevolve with their host is unclear. By using experimental coevolution of a host bacterium and its viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parasit</span></strong>es, we revealed that diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parasit</span></strong>e communities accelerated host evolution and altered coevolutionary dynamics to enhance host resistance and decrease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parasit</span></strong>e infectivity. Increases in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parasit</span></strong>e diversity drove shifts in the mode of selection from fluctuating (Red Queen) dynamics to predominately directional (arms race) dynamics. Arms race dynamics were characterized by selective sweeps of generalist resistance mutations in the genes for the host bacterium’s cell surface lipopolysaccharide (a bacteriophage receptor), which caused faster molecular evolution within host populations and greater genetic divergence among populations. These results indicate that exposure to multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parasit</span></strong>es influences the rate and type of host-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parasit</span></strong>e coevolution.</p>

The Wheat <i>Lr67</i> Gene from the Sugar Transport Protein 13 Family Confers Multipathogen Resistance in Barley
<p>Fungal pathogens are a major constraint to global crop production; hence, plant genes encoding pathogen resistance are important tools for combating disease. A few resistance genes identified to date provide partial, durable resistance to multiple pathogens and the wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) Lr67 hexose transporter variant (Lr67res) fits into this category. Two amino acids differ between the wild-type and resistant alleles – G144R and V387L. Exome sequence data from 267 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) landraces and wild accessions was screened and neither of the Lr67res mutations was detected. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> ortholog of Lr67, HvSTP13, was functionally characterized in yeast as a high affinity hexose transporter. The G144R mutation was introduced into HvSTP13 and abolished Glc uptake, whereas the V387L mutation reduced Glc uptake by ∼ 50%. Glc transport by HvSTP13 heterologously expressed in yeast was reduced when coexpressed with <i>Lr67res</i>. Stable transgenic <i>Lr67res</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> lines exhibited seedling resistance to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong>-specific pathogens <i>Puccinia hordei</i> and <i>Blumeria graminis</i> f. sp. <i>hordei</i>, which cause leaf rust and powdery mildew, respectively. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> plants expressing <i>Lr67res</i> exhibited early senescence and higher pathogenesis-related (<i>PR</i>) gene expression. Unlike previous observations implicating flavonoids in the resistance of transgenic sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>) expressing <i>Lr34res</i>, another wheat multipathogen resistance gene, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> flavonoids are unlikely to have a role in Lr67res-mediated resistance. Similar to observations made in yeast, Lr67res reduced Glc uptake <i>in planta</i>. These results confirm that the pathway by which <i>Lr67res</i> confers resistance to fungal pathogens is conserved between wheat and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong>.</p>

Control of potassium homeostasis is an essential function of the second messenger cyclic di-AMP in <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>
<p>The second messenger cyclic di–adenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP) is essential in the Gram-positive model organism <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> and in related pathogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>. It controls the activity of the conserved <i>ydaO</i> riboswitch and of several proteins involved in potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) uptake. We found that the YdaO protein was conserved among several different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> and provide evidence that YdaO functions as a K<sup>+</sup> transporter. Thus, we renamed the gene and protein KimA (K<sup>+</sup> importer A). Reporter activity assays indicated that expression beyond the c-di-AMP–responsive riboswitch of the <i>kimA</i> upstream regulatory region occurred only in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> grown in medium containing low K<sup>+</sup> concentrations. Furthermore, mass spectrometry analysis indicated that c-di-AMP accumulated in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> grown in the presence of high K<sup>+</sup> concentrations but not in low concentrations. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>l strain lacking all genes encoding c-di-AMP–synthesizing enzymes was viable when grown in medium containing low K<sup>+</sup> concentrations, but not at higher K<sup>+</sup> concentrations unless it acquired suppressor mutations in the gene encoding the cation exporter NhaK. Thus, our results indicated that the control of potassium homeostasis is an essential function of c-di-AMP.</p>

Hybridization may give some parasites a leg up
<p>Infecting an estimated 230 million people, schistosomiasis is the world's most widespread <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parasit</span></strong>ic disease after malaria. But temperate latitudes were thought to be spared, until researchers documented an outbreak on the French island of Corsica in 2014. Scientists found that a local freshwater snail was serving as the intermediate host that's essential to the flatworms' complicated life cycle. The river is still infested: At least 120 people have become infected. And the disease is turning up elsewhere on Corsica. The culprit is no ordinary schistosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parasit</span></strong>e, but a hybrid of two separate species that appears to be better than both parent species at infecting both the snails and its unfortunate mammalian hosts. Such hybrids, discovered in other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parasit</span></strong>ic species as well, could widen a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parasit</span></strong>e's range of host mammals, complicating efforts to control it.</p>

Gut microbiome–mediated bile acid metabolism regulates liver cancer via NKT cells
<p>Primary liver tumors and liver metastasis currently represent the leading cause of cancer-related death. Commensal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> are important regulators of antitumor immunity, and although the liver is exposed to gut <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>, their role in antitumor surveillance of liver tumors is poorly understood. We found that altering commensal gut <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> in mice induced a liver-selective antitumor effect, with an increase of hepatic CXCR6<sup>+</sup> natural killer T (NKT) cells and heightened interferon-γ production upon antigen stimulation. In vivo functional studies showed that NKT cells mediated liver-selective tumor inhibition. NKT cell accumulation was regulated by CXCL16 expression of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, which was controlled by gut microbiome-mediated primary-to-secondary bile acid conversion. Our study suggests a link between gut <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>–controlled bile acid metabolism and liver antitumor immunosurveillance.</p>

Vaginal bacteria modify HIV tenofovir microbicide efficacy in African women
<p>Antiretroviral-based strategies for HIV prevention have shown inconsistent results in women. We investigated whether vaginal microbiota modulated tenofovir gel microbicide efficacy in the CAPRISA (Centre for the AIDS Program of Research in South Africa) 004 trial. Two major vaginal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>l community types—one dominated by <i>Lactobacillus</i> (59.2%) and the other where <i>Gardnerella vaginalis</i> predominated with other anaerobic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> (40.8%)—were identified in 688 women profiled. Tenofovir reduced HIV incidence by 61% (<i>P</i> = 0.013) in <i>Lactobacillus-</i>dominant women but only 18% (<i>P</i> = 0.644) in women with non-<i>Lactobacillus</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>, a threefold difference in efficacy. Detectible mucosal tenofovir was lower in non-<i>Lactobacillus</i> women, negatively correlating with <i>G. vaginalis</i> and other anaerobic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>, which depleted tenofovir by metabolism more rapidly than target cells convert to pharmacologically active drug.

A bacterial global regulator forms a prion
<p>Prions are self-propagating protein aggregates that act as protein-based elements of inheritance in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fungi</span></strong>. Although prevalent in eukaryotes, prions have not been identified in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>. Here we found that a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>l protein, transcription terminator Rho of <i>Clostridium botulinum</i> (<i>Cb</i>-Rho), could form a prion. We identified a candidate prion-forming domain (cPrD) in <i>Cb</i>-Rho and showed that it conferred amyloidogenicity on <i>Cb</i>-Rho and could functionally replace the PrD of a yeast prion-forming protein. Furthermore, its cPrD enabled <i>Cb</i>-Rho to access alternative conformations in <i>Escherichia coli</i>—a soluble form that terminated transcription efficiently and an aggregated, self-propagating prion form that was functionally compromised. The prion form caused genome-wide changes in the transcriptome. Thus, <i>Cb</i>-Rho functions as a protein-based element of inheritance in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>, suggesting that the emergence of prions predates the evolutionary split between eukaryotes and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>.</p>

A selective insecticidal protein from <i>Pseudomonas</i> for controlling corn rootworms

Antibodies to PfSEA-1 block parasite egress from RBCs and protect against malaria infection

Retrotransposon Insertion and DNA Methylation Regulate Aluminum Tolerance in European Barley Accessions
<p>Aluminum (Al) toxicity is a major stress factor limiting crop productivity in acid soil. Although there is great genotypic variation in tolerance to Al toxicity, the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we report that, in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), the fourth largest cereal crop produced in the world, both retrotransposon insertion and DNA methylation are involved in regulating differential Al tolerance. <i>HvAACT1</i> is a major gene responsible for citrate secretion from the roots for external detoxification of Al. A multiretrotransposon-like (MRL) sequence insertion at least 15.3 kb in length was detected in the upstream genomic region of <i>HvAACT1</i> that displayed promoter activity and significantly enhanced <i>HvAACT1</i> expression, especially in the root tips of Al-tolerant accessions. Furthermore, in a number of accessions with low levels of <i>HvAACT1</i> expression, this MRL insertion was present but highly methylated. Geographical analysis showed that accessions with this MRL insertion are distributed mainly in European areas with acid soils. Two wild <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> accessions were found to possess this MRL insertion, but with a high degree of methylation. These results indicate that the MRL insertion and its degree of DNA methylation influence <i>HvAACT1</i> expression and that demethylation of this MRL insertion, which facilitates adaptation to acid soils, occurred following <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> domestication. Moreover, our results indicate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> accessions in East Asia and Europe have developed independent but equivalent strategies to withstand Al toxicity in acid soils.</p>

Cooperative Regulatory Functions of miR858 and MYB83 during Cyst Nematode Parasitism
<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) recently have been established as key regulators of transcriptome reprogramming that define cell function and identity. Nevertheless, the molecular functions of the greatest number of miRNA genes remain to be determined. Here, we report cooperative regulatory functions of miR858 and its MYB83 transcription factor target gene in transcriptome reprogramming during <i>Heterodera</i> cyst nematode <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parasit</span></strong>ism of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Gene expression analyses and promoter-GUS fusion assays documented a role of miR858 in posttranscriptional regulation of <i>MYB83</i> in the <i>Heterodera schachtii-</i>induced feeding sites, the syncytia. Constitutive overexpression of miR858 interfered with <i>H. schachtii</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parasit</span></strong>ism of Arabidopsis, leading to reduced susceptibility, while reduced miR858 abundance enhanced plant susceptibility. Similarly, <i>MYB83</i> expression increases were conducive to nematode infection because overexpression of a noncleavable coding sequence of <i>MYB83</i> significantly increased plant susceptibility, whereas a <i>myb83</i> mutation rendered the plants less susceptible. In addition, RNA-seq analysis revealed that genes involved in hormone signaling pathways, defense response, glucosinolate biosynthesis, cell wall modification, sugar transport, and transcriptional control are the key etiological factors by which MYB83 facilitates nematode <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parasit</span></strong>ism of Arabidopsis. Furthermore, we discovered that miR858-mediated silencing of <i>MYB83</i> is tightly regulated through a feedback loop that might contribute to fine-tuning the expression of more than a thousand of MYB83-regulated genes in the <i>H. schachtii</i>-induced syncytium. Together, our results suggest a role of the miR858-MYB83 regulatory system in finely balancing gene expression patterns during <i>H. schachtii</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parasit</span></strong>ism of Arabidopsis to ensure optimal cellular function.</p>

Regulation of Strigolactone Biosynthesis by Gibberellin Signaling
<p>Strigolactones (SLs) are a class of plant hormones that regulate diverse physiological processes, including shoot branching and root development. They also act as rhizosphere signaling molecules to stimulate the germination of root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parasit</span></strong>ic weeds and the branching of arbuscular mycorrhizal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fungi</span></strong>. Although various types of cross talk between SLs and other hormones have been reported in physiological analyses, the cross talk between gibberellin (GA) and SLs is poorly understood. We screened for chemicals that regulate the level of SLs in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and identified GA as, to our knowledge, a novel SL-regulating molecule. The regulation of SL biosynthesis by GA is dependent on the GA receptor GID1 and F-box protein GID2. GA treatment also reduced the infection of rice plants by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parasit</span></strong>ic plant witchers weed (<i>Striga hermonthica</i>). These data not only demonstrate, to our knowledge, the novel plant hormone cross talk between SL and GA, but also suggest that GA can be used to control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parasit</span></strong>ic weed infections.</p>

The Genetic Control of Reproductive Development under High Ambient Temperature<xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>Ambient temperature has a large impact on reproductive development and grain yield in temperate cereals. However, little is known about the genetic control of development under different ambient temperatures. Here, we demonstrate that in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), high ambient temperatures accelerate or delay reproductive development depending on the photoperiod response gene <i>PHOTOPERIOD1</i> (<i>Ppd-H1</i>) and its upstream regulator <i>EARLY FLOWERING3</i> (<i>HvELF3</i>). A natural mutation in <i>Ppd-H1</i> prevalent in spring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> delayed floral development and reduced the number of florets and seeds per spike, while the wild-type <i>Ppd-H1</i> or a mutant <i>Hvelf3</i> allele accelerated floral development and maintained the seed number under high ambient temperatures. High ambient temperature delayed the expression phase and reduced the amplitude of clock genes and repressed the floral integrator gene <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T1</i> independently of the genotype. <i>Ppd-H1</i>-dependent variation in flowering time under different ambient temperatures correlated with relative expression levels of the <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> MADS</i>-box genes <i>VERNALIZATION1</i> (<i>HvVRN1</i>), <i>HvBM3</i>, and <i>HvBM8</i> in the leaf. Finally, we show that <i>Ppd-H1</i> interacts with regulatory variation at <i>HvVRN1. Ppd-H1</i> only accelerated floral development in the background of a spring <i>HvVRN1</i> allele with a deletion in the regulatory intron. The full-length winter <i>Hvvrn1</i> allele was strongly down-regulated, and flowering was delayed by high temperatures irrespective of <i>Ppd-H1</i>. Our findings demonstrate that the photoperiodic and vernalization pathways interact to control flowering time and floret fertility in response to ambient temperature in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong>.</p>

The HvNramp5 Transporter Mediates Uptake of Cadmium and Manganese, But Not Iron

Here, we functionally characterized a member of Nramp family in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), HvNramp5. This member showed different expression patterns, transport substrate specificity, and cellular localization from its close homolog in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), OsNramp5, although HvNramp5 was also localized to the plasma membrane. <i>HvNramp5</i> was mainly expressed in the roots and its expression was not affected by Cd and deficiency of Zn, Cu, and Mn, but slightly up-regulated by Fe deficiency. Spatial expression analysis showed that the expression of <i>HvNramp5</i> was higher in the root tips than that in the basal root regions. Furthermore, analysis with laser microdissection revealed higher expression of <i>HvNramp5</i> in the outer root cell layers. HvNramp5 showed transport activity for both Mn<sup>2+</sup> and Cd<sup>2+</sup>, but not for Fe<sup>2+</sup> when expressed in yeast. Immunostaining with a HvNramp5 antibody showed that this protein was localized in the root epidermal cells without polarity. Knockdown of <i>HvNramp5</i> in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> resulted in a significant reduction in the seedling growth at low Mn supply, but this reduction was rescued at high Mn supply. The concentration of Mn and Cd, but not other metals including Cu, Zn, and Fe, was decreased in both the roots and shoots of knockdown lines compared with the wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong>. These results indicate that HvNramp5 is a transporter required for uptake of Mn and Cd, but not for Fe, and that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> has a distinct uptake system from rice.</p>

An intramembrane sensory circuit monitors sortase A–mediated processing of streptococcal adhesins
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>l adhesins mediate adhesion to substrates and biofilm formation. Adhesins of the LPXTG family are posttranslationally processed by the cell membrane–localized peptidase sortase A, which cleaves the LPXTG motif. This generates a short C-terminal peptide (C-pep) that remains in the cell membrane, whereas the mature adhesin is incorporated into the cell wall. Genes encoding adhesins of the oral bacterium <i>Streptococcus gordonii</i> were differentially expressed depending on whether the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> were isolated from saliva or dental plaque and appeared to be coordinately regulated. Deletion of <i>sspA</i> and <i>sspB (sspAB)</i>, both of which encode LPXTG-containing adhesins, unexpectedly enhanced adhesion and biofilm formation. C-peps produced from a model LPXTG-containing adhesin localized to the cell membrane and bound to and inhibited the intramembrane sensor histidine kinase SGO_1180, thus preventing activation of the cognate response regulator SGO_1181. The absence of SspAB C-peps induced the expression of the <i>scaCBA</i> operon encoding the lipoprotein adhesin ScaA, which was sufficient to preserve and even enhance biofilm formation. This C-pep–driven regulatory circuit also exists in pathogenic streptococci and is likely conserved among Gram-positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>. This quality control mechanism ensures that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> can form biofilms under diverse environmental conditions and may play a role in optimizing adhesion and biofilm formation.</p>

Endocytosis of commensal antigens by intestinal epithelial cells regulates mucosal T cell homeostasis
<p>Commensal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> influence host physiology, without invading host tissues. We show that proteins from segmented filamentous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> (SFB) are transferred into intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) through adhesion-directed endocytosis that is distinct from the clathrin-dependent endocytosis of invasive pathogens. This process transfers microbial cell wall–associated proteins, including an antigen that stimulates mucosal T helper 17 (T<sub>H</sub>17) cell differentiation, into the cytosol of IECs in a cell division control protein 42 homolog (CDC42)–dependent manner. Removal of CDC42 activity in vivo led to disruption of endocytosis induced by SFB and decreased epithelial antigen acquisition, with consequent loss of mucosal T<sub>H</sub>17 cells. Our findings demonstrate direct communication between a resident gut microbe and the host and show that under physiological conditions, IECs acquire antigens from commensal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> for generation of T cell responses to the resident microbiota.</p>

Toward a chemical vaccine for malaria
<p>Despite considerable progress in combating malaria, it remains one of the world's most important infectious diseases, with 50% of the world population at risk of developing the disease and a mortality rate of ∼0.5 million annually (<i>1</i>). The lack of an effective vaccine and the relentless ability of the <i>Plasmodium</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parasit</span></strong>e responsible for malaria to develop drug resistance has contributed to the continuing disease burden (<i>2</i>–<i>4</i>). Artemisinin-combination therapies (ACTs) are the mainstay of current treatment regimens, but decreased effectiveness, particularly in Southeast Asia, threatens our ability to control this disease. A global effort to develop new drugs for the treatment and prevention of malaria is under way but not guaranteed to succeed (<i>3</i>, <i>5</i>, <i>6</i>). These efforts include a systematic attempt to target all life-cycle stages of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parasit</span></strong>e to allow combination therapies to be developed, which are also likely to reduce the development of resistance. High-throughput screens (HTSs) designed to identify small drug-like molecules that prevent growth of blood-stage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parasit</span></strong>es (<i>7</i>, <i>8</i>) and target-based approaches have identified new compounds that are currently in preclinical development and/or various stages of human clinical trials for treatment of malaria (<i>3</i>). Missing from these efforts has been a high-throughput technology to find liver stage–specific chemotypes. On page 1129 of this issue, Antonova-Koch <i>et al.</i> (<i>9</i>) report an HTS effort that has filled this gap. They identify a substantial number of new chemical starting points with potent liver-stage antimalarial activity, promising a new capacity to feed compounds through the drug development pipeline for chemoprotection.</p>

GDV1 induces sexual commitment of malaria parasites by antagonizing HP1-dependent gene silencing
<p>Malaria is caused by <i>Plasmodium</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parasit</span></strong>es that proliferate in the bloodstream. During each replication cycle, some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parasit</span></strong>es differentiate into gametocytes, the only forms able to infect the mosquito vector and transmit malaria. Sexual commitment is triggered by activation of AP2-G, the master transcriptional regulator of gametocytogenesis. Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1)–dependent silencing of <i>ap2-g</i> prevents sexual conversion in proliferating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parasit</span></strong>es. In this study, we identified <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> gametocyte development 1 (GDV1) as an upstream activator of sexual commitment. We found that GDV1 targeted heterochromatin and triggered HP1 eviction, thus derepressing <i>ap2-g</i>. Expression of GDV1 was responsive to environmental triggers of sexual conversion and controlled via a <i>gdv1</i> antisense RNA. Hence, GDV1 appears to act as an effector protein that induces sexual differentiation by antagonizing HP1-dependent gene silencing.</p>

Systematic discovery of antiphage defense systems in the microbial pangenome

Potential role of intratumor bacteria in mediating tumor resistance to the chemotherapeutic drug gemcitabine

Metabolism was dependent on the expression of a long isoform of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>l enzyme cytidine deaminase (CDD<sub>L</sub>), seen primarily in Gammaproteo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>.

Chronic exposure to neonicotinoids reduces honey bee health near corn crops

Colonies near <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">corn</span></strong> were naturally exposed to neonicotinoids for up to 4 months—the majority of the honey bee’s active season. Realistic experiments showed that neonicotinoids increased worker mortality and were associated with declines in social immunity and increased queenlessness over time.

Fatty acids in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are synthesized by the host plant

Lipids are transferred from the plant to mycorrhizal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fungi</span></strong>, which are fatty acid auxotrophs, and this lipid export requires the glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase RAM2, a direct target of RAM1.

Transient compartmentalization of RNA replicators prevents extinction due to parasites
<p>The appearance of molecular replicators (molecules that can be copied) was probably a critical step in the origin of life. However, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parasit</span></strong>ic replicators would take over and would have prevented life from taking off unless the replicators were compartmentalized in reproducing protocells. Paradoxically, control of protocell reproduction would seem to require evolved replicators. We show here that a simpler population structure, based on cycles of transient compartmentalization (TC) and mixing of RNA replicators, is sufficient to prevent takeover by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parasit</span></strong>ic mutants. TC tends to select for ensembles of replicators that replicate at a similar rate, including a diversity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parasit</span></strong>es that could serve as a source of opportunistic functionality. Thus, TC in natural, abiological compartments could have allowed life to take hold.</p>

The Coiled-Coil NLR <i>Rph1</i>, Confers Leaf Rust Resistance in Barley Cultivar Sudan
<p>Unraveling and exploiting mechanisms of disease resistance in cereal crops is currently limited by their large repeat-rich genomes and the lack of genetic recombination or cultivar (cv)-specific sequence information. We cloned the first leaf rust resistance gene <i>Rph1</i> (<i>Rph1</i>.<i>a</i>) from cultivated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) using “MutChromSeq,” a recently developed molecular genomics tool for the rapid cloning of genes in plants. Marker-trait association in the CI 9214/Stirling doubled haploid population mapped <i>Rph1</i> to the short arm of chromosome 2H in a physical region of 1.3 megabases relative to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> cv Morex reference assembly. A sodium azide mutant population in cv Sudan was generated and 10 mutants were confirmed by progeny-testing. Flow-sorted 2H chromosomes from Sudan (wild type) and six of the mutants were sequenced and compared to identify candidate genes for the <i>Rph1</i> locus. MutChromSeq identified a single gene candidate encoding a coiled-coil nucleotide binding site Leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptor protein that was altered in three different mutants. Further Sanger sequencing confirmed all three mutations and identified an additional two independent mutations within the same candidate gene. Phylogenetic analysis determined that <i>Rph1</i> clustered separately from all previously cloned NLRs from the Triticeae and displayed highest sequence similarity (89%) with a homolog of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) disease resistance protein 1 protein in <i>Triticum urartu</i>. In this study we determined the molecular basis for <i>Rph1</i>-mediated resistance in cultivated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> enabling varietal improvement through diagnostic marker design, gene editing, and gene stacking technologies.</p>

Development of Decreased-Gluten Wheat Enabled by Determination of the Genetic Basis of <i>lys3a</i> Barley
<p>Celiac disease is the most common food-induced enteropathy in humans, with a prevalence of approximately 1% worldwide. It is induced by digestion-resistant, proline- and glutamine-rich seed storage proteins, collectively referred to as gluten, found in wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>). Related prolamins are present in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) and rye (<i>Secale cereale</i>). The incidence of both celiac disease and a related condition called nonceliac gluten sensitivity is increasing. This has prompted efforts to identify methods of lowering gluten in wheat, one of the most important cereal crops. Here, we used bulked segregant RNA sequencing and map-based cloning to identify the genetic lesion underlying a recessive, low-prolamin mutation (<i>lys3a</i>) in diploid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong>. We confirmed the mutant identity by complementing the <i>lys3a</i> mutant with a transgenic copy of the wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> gene and then used targeting-induced local lesions in genomes to identify induced single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the three homeologs of the corresponding wheat gene. Combining inactivating mutations in the three subgenomes of hexaploid bread wheat in a single wheat line lowered gliadin and low-molecular-weight glutenin accumulation by 50% to 60% and increased free and protein-bound lysine by 33%.</p>

An Ancestral Allele of <i>Pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase1</i> Promotes Proline Accumulation and Drought Adaptation in Cultivated Barley
<p>Water scarcity is a critical threat to global crop production. Here, we used the natural diversity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) to dissect the genetic control of proline (Pro) mediated drought stress adaptation. Genetic mapping and positional cloning of a major drought-inducible quantitative trait locus (<i>QPro.S42-1H</i>) revealed unique allelic variation in <i>pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase</i> (<i>P5cs1</i>) between the cultivated cultivar Scarlett (ssp. <i>vulgare</i>) and the wild <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> accession ISR42-8 (ssp. <i>spontaneum</i>). The putative causative mutations were located in the promoter of <i>P5cs1</i> across the DNA binding motifs for abscisic acid-responsive element binding transcription factors. Introgression line (IL) S42IL-143 carrying the wild allele of <i>P5cs1</i> showed significant up-regulation of <i>P5cs1</i> expression compared to Scarlett, which was consistent with variation in Pro accumulation under drought. Next, we transiently expressed promoter::reporter constructs of ISR42-8 and Scarlett alleles in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mesophyll protoplasts. GUS expression analysis showed a significantly higher activation of the ISR42-8 promoter compared to Scarlett upon abscisic acid treatment. Notably, the ISR42-8 promoter activity was impaired in protoplasts isolated from the loss-of-function <i>abf1abf2abf3abf4</i> quadruple mutant. A series of phenotypic evaluations demonstrated that S42IL-143 maintained leaf water content and photosynthetic activity longer than Scarlett under drought. These findings suggest that the ancestral variant of <i>P5cs1</i> has the potential for drought tolerance and understanding drought physiology of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> and related crops.</p>

Extreme Suppression of Lateral Floret Development by a Single Amino Acid Change in the VRS1 Transcription Factor
<p>Increasing grain yield is an endless challenge for cereal crop breeding. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), grain number is controlled mainly by <i>Six-rowed spike 1</i> (<i>Vrs1</i>), which encodes a homeodomain leucine zipper class I transcription factor. However, little is known about the genetic basis of grain size. Here, we show that extreme suppression of lateral florets contributes to enlarged grains in <i>deficiens</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong>. Through a combination of fine-mapping and resequencing of <i>deficiens</i> mutants, we have identified that a single amino acid substitution at a putative phosphorylation site in VRS1 is responsible for the <i>deficiens</i> phenotype. <i>deficiens</i> mutant alleles confer an increase in grain size, a reduction in plant height, and a significant increase in thousand grain weight in contemporary cultivated germplasm. Haplotype analysis revealed that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> carrying the <i>deficiens</i> allele (<i>Vrs1.t1</i>) originated from two-rowed types carrying the <i>Vrs1.b2</i> allele, predominantly found in germplasm from northern Africa. In situ hybridization of <i>histone H4</i>, a marker for cell cycle or proliferation, showed weaker expression in the lateral spikelets compared with central spikelets in <i>deficiens</i>. Transcriptome analysis revealed that a number of <i>histone</i> superfamily genes were up-regulated in the <i>deficiens</i> mutant, suggesting that enhanced cell proliferation in the central spikelet may contribute to larger grains. Our data suggest that grain yield can be improved by suppressing the development of specific organs that are not positively involved in sink/source relationships.</p>

Correlations between Circadian Rhythms and Growth in Challenging Environments
<p>In plants, the circadian system controls a plethora of processes, many with agronomic importance, such as photosynthesis, photoprotection, stomatal opening, and photoperiodic development, as well as molecular processes, such as gene expression. It has been suggested that modifying circadian rhythms may be a means to manipulate crops to develop improved plants for agriculture. However, there is very little information on how the clock influences the performance of crop plants. We used a noninvasive, high-throughput technique, based on prompt chlorophyll fluorescence, to measure circadian rhythms and demonstrated that the technique works in a range of plants. Using fluorescence, we analyzed circadian rhythms in populations of wild <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i> ssp. <i>spontaneum</i>) from widely different ecogeographical locations in the Southern Levant part of the Fertile Crescent, an area with a high proportion of the total genetic variation of wild <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong>. Our results show that there is variability for circadian traits in the wild <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> lines. We observed that circadian period lengths were correlated with temperature and aspect at the sites of origin of the plants, while the amplitudes of the rhythms were correlated with soil composition. Thus, different environmental parameters may exert selection on circadian rhythms.</p>

An E3 Ligase Affects the NLR Receptor Stability and Immunity to Powdery Mildew
<p>Following the detection of pathogen cognate effectors, plant Nod-like receptors (NLRs) trigger isolate-specific immunity that is generally associated with cell death. The regulation of NLR stability is important to ensure effective immunity. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), the allelic Mildew locus A (MLA) receptors mediate isolate-specific disease resistance against powdery mildew fungus (<i>Blumeria graminis</i> f. sp. <i>hordei</i>). Currently, how MLA stability is controlled remains unknown. Here, we identified an MLA-interacting RING-type E3 ligase, MIR1, that interacts with several MLAs. We showed that the carboxyl-terminal TPR domain of MIR1 mediates the interaction with the coiled-coil domain-containing region of functional MLAs, such as MLA1, MLA6, and MLA10, but not with that of the nonfunctional MLA18-1. MIR1 can ubiquitinate the amino-terminal region of MLAs in vitro and promotes the proteasomal degradation of MLAs in vitro and in planta. Both proteasome inhibitor treatment and virus-induced gene silencing-mediated <i>MIR1</i> silencing significantly increased MLA abundance in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> transgenic lines. Furthermore, overexpression of MIR1 specifically compromised MLA-mediated disease resistance in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong>, while coexpression of MIR1 and MLA10 attenuated MLA10-induced cell death signaling in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. Together, our data reveal a mechanism for the control of the stability of MLA immune receptors and for the attenuation of MLA-triggered defense signaling by a RING-type E3 ligase via the ubiquitin proteasome system.</p>

Comparative Genomics of the Pine Pathogens and Beetle Symbionts in the Genus <i>Grosmannia</i>
<p>Studies on beetle/tree fungal symbionts typically characterize the ecological and geographic distributions of the fungal populations. There is limited understanding of the genome-wide evolutionary processes that act within and between species as such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fungi</span></strong> adapt to different environments, leading to physiological differences and reproductive isolation. Here, we assess genomic evidence for such evolutionary processes by extending our recent work on <i>Grosmannia clavigera</i>, which is vectored by the mountain pine beetle and jeffrey pine beetle. We report the genome sequences of an additional 11 <i>G. clavigera</i> (Gc) sensu lato strains from the two known sibling species, <i>Grosmannia</i> sp. (Gs) and Gc. The 12 fungal genomes are structurally similar, showing large-scale synteny within and between species. We identified 103,430 single-nucleotide variations that separated the <i>Grosmannia</i> strains into divergent Gs and Gc clades, and further divided each of these clades into two subclades, one of which may represent an additional species. Comparing variable genes between these lineages, we identified truncated genes and potential pseudogenes, as well as seven genes that show evidence of positive selection. As these variable genes are involved in secondary metabolism and in detoxifying or utilizing host-tree defense chemicals (e.g., polyketide synthases, oxidoreductases, and mono-oxygenases), their variants may reflect adaptation to the specific chemistries of the host trees <i>Pinus contorta</i>, <i>P. ponderosa</i>, and <i>P. jeffreyi</i>.

Interestingly, <i>Cryptosporidium parvum</i> has been related to digestive carcinogenesis in humans. Consistent with a potential tumorigenic role of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parasit</span></strong>e, in an original reproducible animal model of chronic cryptosporidiosis based on dexamethasone-treated or untreated adult SCID mice, we formerly reported that <i>C. parvum</i> (strains of animal and human origin) is able to induce digestive adenocarcinoma even in infections induced with very low inoculum. The aim of this study was to further characterize this animal model and to explore metabolic pathways potentially involved in the development of <i>C. parvum</i>-induced ileo-caecal oncogenesis. We searched for alterations in genes or proteins commonly involved in cell cycle, differentiation or cell migration, such as β-catenin, <i>Apc</i>, E-cadherin, <i>Kras</i> and <i>p53</i>. After infection of animals with <i>C. parvum</i> we demonstrated immunohistochemical abnormal localization of Wnt signaling pathway components and p53. Mutations in the selected loci of studied genes were not found after high-throughput sequencing. Furthermore, alterations in the ultrastructure of adherens junctions of the ileo-caecal neoplastic epithelia of <i>C. parvum</i>-infected mice were recorded using transmission electron microscopy. In conclusion, we found for the first time that the Wnt signaling pathway, and particularly the cytoskeleton network, seems to be pivotal for the development of the <i>C. parvum</i>-induced neoplastic process and cell migration of transformed cells. Furthermore, this model is a valuable tool in understanding the host-pathogen interactions associated with the intricate infection process of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parasit</span></strong>e, which is able to modulate host cytoskeleton activities and several host-cell biological processes and remains a significant cause of infection worldwide.</p>

Resistance to malaria through structural variation of red blood cell invasion receptors
<p>The malaria <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parasit</span></strong>e <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> invades human red blood cells by a series of interactions between host and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parasit</span></strong>e surface proteins. By analyzing genome sequence data from human populations, including 1269 individuals from sub-Saharan Africa, we identify a diverse array of large copy-number variants affecting the host invasion receptor genes <i>GYPA</i> and <i>GYPB</i>. We find that a nearby association with severe malaria is explained by a complex structural rearrangement involving the loss of <i>GYPB</i> and gain of two <i>GYPB-A</i> hybrid genes, which encode a serologically distinct blood group antigen known as Dantu. This variant reduces the risk of severe malaria by 40% and has recently increased in frequency in parts of Kenya, yet it appears to be absent from west Africa. These findings link structural variation of red blood cell invasion receptors with natural resistance to severe malaria.</p>

Plants transfer lipids to sustain colonization by mutualistic mycorrhizal and parasitic fungi
<p>Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fungi</span></strong> facilitate plant uptake of mineral nutrients and draw organic nutrients from the plant. Organic nutrients are thought to be supplied primarily in the form of sugars. Here we show that the AM fungus <i>Rhizophagus irregularis</i> is a fatty acid auxotroph and that fatty acids synthesized in the host plants are transferred to the fungus to sustain mycorrhizal colonization. The transfer is dependent on RAM2 (REQUIRED FOR ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZATION 2) and the ATP binding cassette transporter–mediated plant lipid export pathway. We further show that plant fatty acids can be transferred to the pathogenic fungus <i>Golovinomyces cichoracerum</i> and are required for colonization by pathogens. We suggest that the mutualistic mycorrhizal and pathogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fungi</span></strong> similarly recruit the fatty acid biosynthesis program to facilitate host invasion.</p>

Inhibitors of PEX14 disrupt protein import into glycosomes and kill <i>Trypanosoma</i> parasites
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parasit</span></strong>ic protists of the <i>Trypanosoma</i> genus infect humans and domestic mammals, causing severe mortality and huge economic losses. The most threatening trypanosomiasis is Chagas disease, affecting up to 12 million people in the Americas. We report a way to selectively kill <i>Trypanosoma</i> by blocking glycosomal/peroxisomal import that depends on the PEX14-PEX5 protein-protein interaction. We developed small molecules that efficiently disrupt the PEX14-PEX5 interaction. This results in mislocalization of glycosomal enzymes, causing metabolic catastrophe, and it kills the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parasit</span></strong>e. High-resolution x-ray structures and nuclear magnetic resonance data enabled the efficient design of inhibitors with trypanocidal activities comparable to approved medications. These results identify PEX14 as an “Achilles’ heel” of the <i>Trypanosoma</i> suitable for the development of new therapies against trypanosomiases and provide the structural basis for their development.</p>

Regulation of sugar transporter activity for antibacterial defense in <i>Arabidopsis</i>
<p>Microbial pathogens strategically acquire metabolites from their hosts during infection. Here we show that the host can intervene to prevent such metabolite loss to pathogens. Phosphorylation-dependent regulation of sugar transport protein 13 (STP13) is required for anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>l defense in the plant <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. STP13 physically associates with the flagellin receptor flagellin-sensitive 2 (FLS2) and its co-receptor BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1–associated receptor kinase 1 (BAK1). BAK1 phosphorylates STP13 at threonine 485, which enhances its monosaccharide uptake activity to compete with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> for extracellular sugars. Limiting the availability of extracellular sugar deprives <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> of an energy source and restricts virulence factor delivery. Our results reveal that control of sugar uptake, managed by regulation of a host sugar transporter, is a defense strategy deployed against microbial infection. Competition for sugar thus shapes host-pathogen interactions.</p>

Betaine Lipid Is Crucial for Adapting to Low Temperature and Phosphate Deficiency in <i>Nannochloropsis</i>
<p>Diacylglyceryl-<i>N,N,N</i>-trimethylhomo-Ser (DGTS) is a nonphosphorous, polar glycerolipid that is regarded as analogous to the phosphatidylcholine in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fungi</span></strong>, algae, and basal land plants. In some species of algae, including the stramenopile microalga <i>Nannochloropsis oceanica</i>, DGTS contains an abundance of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which is relatively scarce in phosphatidylcholine, implying that DGTS has a unique physiological role. In this study, we addressed the role of DGTS in <i>N. oceanica</i>. We identified two DGTS biosynthetic enzymes that have distinct domain configurations compared to previously identified DGTS synthases. Mutants lacking DGTS showed growth retardation under phosphate starvation, demonstrating a pivotal role for DGTS in the adaptation to this condition. Under normal conditions, DGTS deficiency led to an increase in the relative amount of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol, a major plastid membrane lipid with high EPA content, whereas excessive production of DGTS induced by gene overexpression led to a decrease in monogalactosyldiacylglycerol. Meanwhile, lipid analysis of partial phospholipid-deficient mutants revealed a role for phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine in EPA biosynthesis. These results suggest that DGTS and monogalactosyldiacylglycerol may constitute the two major pools of EPA in extraplastidic and plastidic membranes, partially competing to acquire EPA or its precursors derived from phospholipids. The mutant lacking DGTS also displayed impaired growth and a lower proportion of EPA in extraplastidic compartments at low temperatures. Our results indicate that DGTS is involved in the adaptation to low temperatures through a mechanism that is distinct from the DGTS-dependent adaptation to phosphate starvation in <i>N. oceanica</i>.</p>

Mycorrhiza-Triggered Transcriptomic and Metabolomic Networks Impinge on Herbivore Fitness
<p>Symbioses between plants and mycorrhizal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fungi</span></strong> are ubiquitous in ecosystems and strengthen the plants’ defense against aboveground herbivores. Here, we studied the underlying regulatory networks and biochemical mechanisms in leaves induced by ectomycorrhizae that modify herbivore interactions. Feeding damage and oviposition by the widespread poplar leaf beetle <i>Chrysomela populi</i> were reduced on the ectomycorrhizal hybrid poplar <i>Populus</i> × <i>canescens</i>. Integration of transcriptomics, metabolomics, and volatile emission patterns via mass difference networks demonstrated changes in nitrogen allocation in the leaves of mycorrhizal poplars, down-regulation of phenolic pathways, and up-regulation of defensive systems, including protease inhibitors, chitinases, and aldoxime biosynthesis. Ectomycorrhizae had a systemic influence on jasmonate-related signaling transcripts. Our results suggest that ectomycorrhizae prime wounding responses and shift resources from constitutive phenol-based to specialized protective compounds. Consequently, symbiosis with ectomycorrhizal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fungi</span></strong> enabled poplars to respond to leaf beetle feeding with a more effective arsenal of defense mechanisms compared with nonmycorrhizal poplars, thus demonstrating the importance of belowground plant-microbe associations in mitigating aboveground biotic stress.</p>

A New Barley Stripe Mosaic Virus Allows Large Protein Overexpression for Rapid Function Analysis
<p>Understanding the genetic and molecular bases of gene function is of increasing importance to harness their potential to produce plants with novel traits. One important objective is the improvement of plant productivity to meet future demands in food crop production. Gene function is mostly characterized through overexpression or silencing in transgenic plants. This approach is a lengthy procedure, especially in cereals. Plant viral expression systems can be used for rapid expression of proteins. However, current systems have a small cargo capacity and have mostly been used for gene silencing. Here, a four-component <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> stripe mosaic virus-based system with high cargo capacity was constructed for the rapid and stable expression of recombinant proteins in different plant species, allowing function analyses at different stages of development. Fluorescent marker proteins are expressed at high levels within 1 week, and a proof of efficient function analysis is shown using the aluminum malate transporter1 gene. In addition to the ability of gene cotransformation, this work demonstrates that the four-component <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> stripe mosaic virus-based system allows the overexpression of cDNAs of up to 2,100 nucleotides (encoding a protein of ∼78 kD), thereby providing an invaluable tool to accelerate functional genomics and proteomic research in monocot and dicot species.</p>

Phosphorylation of Arabidopsis MAP Kinase Phosphatase 1 (MKP1) Is Required for PAMP Responses and Resistance against Bacteria
<p>Plants perceive potential pathogens via the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by surface-localized pattern recognition receptors, which initiates a series of intracellular responses that ultimately limit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>l growth. PAMP responses include changes in intracellular protein phosphorylation, including the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades. MAP kinase phosphatases (MKPs), such as Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) MKP1, are important negative regulators of MAPKs and play a crucial role in controlling the intensity and duration of MAPK activation during innate immune signaling. As such, the <i>mkp1</i> mutant lacking MKP1 displays enhanced PAMP responses and resistance against the virulent bacterium <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> DC3000. Previous in vitro studies showed that MKP1 can be phosphorylated and activated by MPK6, suggesting that phosphorylation may be an important mechanism for regulating MKP1. We found that MKP1 was phosphorylated during PAMP elicitation and that phosphorylation stabilized the protein, resulting in protein accumulation after elicitation. MKP1 also can be stabilized by the proteasome inhibitor MG132, suggesting that MKP1 is constitutively degraded through the proteasome in the resting state. In addition, we investigated the role of MKP1 posttranslational regulation in plant defense by testing whether phenotypes of the <i>mkp1</i> Arabidopsis mutant could be complemented by expressing phosphorylation site mutations of MKP1. The phosphorylation of MKP1 was found to be required for some, but not all, of MKP1’s functions in PAMP responses and defense against <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>. Together, our results provide insight into the roles of phosphorylation in the regulation of MKP1 during PAMP signaling and resistance to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong>.</p>

3-Hydroxyisobutyrate Dehydrogenase Is Involved in Both, Valine and Isoleucine Degradation in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>In plants, amino acid catabolism is especially relevant in metabolic stress situations (e.g. limited carbohydrate availability during extended darkness). Under these conditions, amino acids are used as alternative substrates for respiration. Complete oxidation of the branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) leucine, isoleucine (Ile), and valine (Val) in the mitochondria efficiently allows the formation of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. However, the metabolic pathways for BCAA breakdown are largely unknown so far in plants. A systematic search for Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) genes encoding proteins resembling enzymes involved in BCAA catabolism in animals, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fungi</span></strong>, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bacteria</span></strong> as well as proteomic analyses of mitochondrial fractions from Arabidopsis allowed the identification of a putative 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase, AtHDH1 (At4g20930), involved in Val degradation. Systematic substrate screening analyses revealed that the protein uses 3-hydroxyisobutyrate but additionally 3-hydroxypropionate as substrates. This points to a role of the enzyme not only in Val but possibly also in Ile metabolism. At4g20930 knockdown plants were characterized to test this conclusion. Root toxicity assays revealed increased root growth inhibition of the mutants if cultivated in the presence of Val or Ile but not in the presence of leucine. We conclude that AtHDH1 has a dual role in BCAA metabolism in plants.</p>

Root Cortical Senescence Improves Growth under Suboptimal Availability of N, P, and K
<p>Root cortical senescence (RCS) in Triticeae reduces nutrient uptake, nutrient content, respiration, and radial hydraulic conductance of root tissue. We used the functional-structural model <i>SimRoot</i> to evaluate the functional implications of RCS in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) under suboptimal nitrate, phosphorus, and potassium availability. The utility of RCS was evaluated using sensitivity analyses in contrasting nutrient regimes. At flowering (80 d), RCS increased simulated plant growth by up to 52%, 73%, and 41% in nitrate-, phosphorus-, and potassium-limiting conditions, respectively. Plants with RCS had reduced nutrient requirement of root tissue for optimal plant growth, reduced total cumulative cortical respiration, and increased total carbon reserves. Nutrient reallocation during RCS had a greater effect on simulated plant growth than reduced respiration or nutrient uptake. Under low nutrient availability, RCS had greater benefit in plants with fewer tillers. RCS had greater benefit in phenotypes with fewer lateral roots at low nitrate availability, but the opposite was true in low phosphorus or potassium availability. Additionally, RCS was quantified in field-grown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> in different nitrogen regimes. Field and virtual soil coring simulation results demonstrated that living cortical volume per root length (an indicator of RCS) decreased with depth in younger plants, while roots of older plants had very little living cortical volume per root length. RCS may be an adaptive trait for nutrient acquisition by reallocating nutrients from senescing tissue and secondarily by reducing root respiration. These simulated results suggest that RCS merits investigation as a breeding target for enhanced soil resource acquisition and edaphic stress tolerance.</p>

Six-Rowed Spike3 (VRS3) Is a Histone Demethylase That Controls Lateral Spikelet Development in Barley
<p>The complex nature of crop genomes has long prohibited the efficient isolation of agronomically relevant genes. However, recent advances in next-generation sequencing technologies provide new ways to accelerate fine-mapping and gene isolation in crops. We used RNA sequencing of allelic <i>six-rowed spike3</i> (<i>vrs3</i>) mutants with altered spikelet development for gene identification and functional analysis in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>). Variant calling in two allelic <i>vrs3</i> mutants revealed that <i>VRS3</i> encodes a putative histone Lys demethylase with a conserved zinc finger and Jumonji C and N domain. Sanger sequencing of this candidate gene in independent allelic <i>vrs3</i> mutants revealed a series of mutations in conserved domains, thus confirming our candidate as the <i>VRS3</i> gene and suggesting that the row type in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> is determined epigenetically. Global transcriptional profiling in developing shoot apical meristems of <i>vrs3</i> suggested that VRS3 acts as a transcriptional activator of the row-type genes <i>VRS1</i> (<i>Hv.HOMEOBOX1</i>) and <i>INTERMEDIUM-C</i> (<i>INT-C</i>; <i>Hv.TEOSINTE BRANCHED1</i>). Comparative transcriptome analysis of the row-type mutants <i>vrs3</i>, <i>vrs4</i> (<i>Hv.RAMOSA2</i>), and <i>int-c</i> confirmed that all three genes act as transcriptional activators of <i>VRS1</i> and quantitative variation in the expression levels of <i>VRS1</i> in these mutants correlated with differences in the number of developed lateral spikelets. The identification of genes and pathways affecting seed number in small grain cereals will enable to further unravel the transcriptional networks controlling this important yield component.</p>

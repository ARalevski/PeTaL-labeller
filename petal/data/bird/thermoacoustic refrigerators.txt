Redefining near-unity luminescence in quantum dots with photothermal threshold quantum yield
<p>A variety of optical applications rely on the absorption and reemission of light. The quantum yield of this process often plays an essential role. When the quantum yield deviates from unity by significantly less than 1%, applications such as luminescent concentrators and optical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">refriger</span></strong></span></strong>ators become possible. To evaluate such high performance, we develop a measurement technique for luminescence efficiency with sufficient accuracy below one part per thousand. Photothermal threshold quantum yield is based on the quantization of light to minimize overall measurement uncertainty. This technique is used to guide a procedure capable of making ensembles of near-unity emitting cadmium selenide/cadmium sulfide (CdSe/CdS) core-shell quantum dots. We obtain a photothermal threshold quantum yield luminescence efficiency of 99.6 Â± 0.2%, indicating nearly complete suppression of nonradiative decay channels.</p>

Highly efficient electrocaloric cooling with electrostatic actuation
<p>Solid-state <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">refriger</span></strong></span></strong>ation offers potential advantages over traditional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cooling system</span></strong>s, but few devices offer high specific cooling power with a high coefficient of performance (COP) and the ability to be applied directly to surfaces. We developed a cooling device with a high intrinsic thermodynamic efficiency using a flexible electrocaloric (EC) polymer film and an electrostatic actuation mechanism. Reversible electrostatic forces reduce parasitic power consumption and allow efficient heat transfer through good thermal contacts with the heat source or heat sink. The EC device produced a specific cooling power of 2.8 watts per gram and a COP of 13. The new cooling device is more efficient and compact than existing surface-conformable solid-state cooling technologies, opening a path to using the technology for a variety of practical applications.</p>

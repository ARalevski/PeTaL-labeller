Temperature mediates the effect of humidity on the viscoelasticity of glycoprotein glue within the droplets of an orb-weaving spider's prey capture threads
<p>Sticky viscous prey capture <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thread</span></strong>s retain insects that strike araneoid orb-webs. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thread</span></strong>s' two axial fibers support a series of glue droplets, each featuring a core of adhesive viscoelastic glycoprotein covered by an aqueous solution. After sticking, the glue extends, summing the adhesion of multiple droplets, and dissipates some of the energy of a struggling prey. As a day progresses, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thread</span></strong>s experience a drop in humidity and an increase in temperature, environmental variables that have the potential to alter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thread</span></strong> and web function. We hypothesize that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thread</span></strong> droplets respond to these opposing environmental changes in a manner that stabilizes their performance, and test this by examining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thread</span></strong>s spun by <i>Argiope aurantia</i>, a species that occupies exposed, weedy habitats. We confirmed that decreased humidity increases glycoprotein viscosity and found that increased temperature had the opposite effect. To evaluate the combined effect of temperature and humidity on a droplet's ability to transfer adhesive force and dissipate energy, we extended a droplet and measured both the deflection of the axial line supporting the droplet and the duration of its tensive load. The cumulative product of these two indices, which reflects the energy required to extend a droplet, was greatest under afternoon (hot and dry) conditions, less under morning (cool and humid) conditions, and least under hot and humid afternoon conditions. Although the opposing effects of temperature and humidity tend to stabilize glycoprotein performance, <i>A. aurantia</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thread</span></strong> droplets appear to function optimally during the afternoon, equipping this species to capture large orthopterans, which are most active at this time.</p>

Posterior spinal fusion for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis using a convex pedicle screw technique
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We present the results of correcting a double or triple curve   adolescent idiopathic scoliosis using a convex segmental pedicle   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screw</span></strong> technique.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We reviewed 191 patients with a mean age at surgery of 15 years   (11 to 23.3). Pedicle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screw</span></strong>s were placed at the convexity of each   curve. Concave <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screw</span></strong>s were inserted at one or two cephalad levels   and two caudal levels. The mean operating time was 183 minutes (132   to 276) and the mean blood loss 0.22% of the total blood volume   (0.08% to 0.4%). Multimodal monitoring remained stable throughout   the operation.

Determining the Site of Action of Strigolactones during Nodulation
<p>Strigolactones (SLs) influence the ability of legumes to associate with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. In this study, we determine the precise stage at which SLs influence nodulation. We show that SLs promote infection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thread</span></strong> formation, as a null SL-deficient pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) mutant forms significantly fewer infection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thread</span></strong>s than wild-type plants, and this reduction can be overcome by the application of the synthetic SL GR24. We found no evidence that SLs influence physical events in the plant before or after infection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thread</span></strong> formation, since SL-deficient plants displayed a similar ability to induce root hair curling in response to rhizobia or Nod lipochitooligosaccharides (LCOs) and SL-deficient nodules appear to fix nitrogen at a similar rate to those of wild-type plants. In contrast, an SL receptor mutant displayed no decrease in infection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thread</span></strong> formation or nodule number, suggesting that SL deficiency may influence the bacterial partner. We found that this influence of SL deficiency was not due to altered flavonoid exudation or the ability of root exudates to stimulate bacterial growth. The influence of SL deficiency on infection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thread</span></strong> formation was accompanied by reduced expression of some early nodulation genes. Importantly, SL synthesis is down-regulated by mutations in genes of the Nod LCO signaling pathway, and this requires the downstream transcription factor <i>NSP2</i> but not <i>NIN</i>. This, together with the fact that the expression of certain SL biosynthesis genes can be elevated in response to rhizobia/Nod LCOs, suggests that Nod LCOs may induce SL biosynthesis. SLs appear to influence nodulation independently of ethylene action, as SL-deficient and ethylene-insensitive double mutant plants display essentially additive phenotypes, and we found no evidence that SLs influence ethylene synthesis or vice versa.</p>

A Legume TOR Protein Kinase Regulates <i>Rhizobium</i> Symbiosis and Is Essential for Infection and Nodule Development
<p>The target of rapamycin (<i>TOR</i>) protein kinase regulates metabolism, growth, and life span in yeast, animals, and plants in coordination with nutrient status and environmental conditions. The nutrient-dependent nature of <i>TOR</i> functionality makes this kinase a putative regulator of symbiotic associations involving nutrient acquisition. However, <i>TOR</i>’s role in these processes remains to be understood. Here, we uncovered the role of <i>TOR</i> during the bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>)-<i>Rhizobium tropici</i> (<i>Rhizobium</i>) symbiotic interaction. <i>TOR</i> was expressed in all tested bean tissues, with higher transcript levels in the root meristems and senesced nodules. We showed <i>TOR</i> promoter expression along the progressing infection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thread</span></strong> and in the infected cells of mature nodules. Posttranscriptional gene silencing of <i>TOR</i> using RNA interference (RNAi) showed that this gene is involved in lateral root elongation and root cell organization and also alters the density, size, and number of root hairs. The suppression of <i>TOR</i> transcripts also affected infection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thread</span></strong> progression and associated cortical cell divisions, resulting in a drastic reduction of nodule numbers. <i>TOR</i>-RNAi resulted in reduced reactive oxygen species accumulation and altered <i>CyclinD1</i> and <i>CyclinD3</i> expression, which are crucial factors for infection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thread</span></strong> progression and nodule organogenesis. Enhanced expression of <i>TOR</i>-regulated <i>ATG</i> genes in <i>TOR</i>-RNAi roots suggested that <i>TOR</i> plays a role in the recognition of <i>Rhizobium</i> as a symbiont. Together, these data suggest that <i>TOR</i> plays a vital role in the establishment of root nodule symbiosis in the common bean.</p>

Regular Motifs in Xylan Modulate Molecular Flexibility and Interactions with Cellulose Surfaces
<p>Xylan is tightly associated with cellulose and lignin in secondary plant cell walls, contributing to its rigidity and structural integrity in vascular plants. However, the molecular features and the nanoscale forces that control the interactions among cellulose microfibrils, hemicelluloses, and lignin are still not well understood. Here, we combine comprehensive mass spectrometric glycan sequencing and molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the substitution pattern in softwood xylans and to investigate the effect of distinct intramolecular motifs on xylan conformation and on the interaction with cellulose surfaces in Norway spruce (<i>Picea abies</i>). We confirm the presence of motifs with evenly spaced glycosyl decorations on the xylan backbone, together with minor motifs with consecutive glucuronation. These domains are differently enriched in xylan fractions extracted by alkali and subcritical water, which indicates their preferential positioning in the secondary plant cell wall ultrastructure. The flexibility of the 3-fold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screw</span></strong> conformation of xylan in solution is enhanced by the presence of arabinofuranosyl decorations. Additionally, molecular dynamic simulations suggest that the glycosyl substitutions in xylan are not only sterically tolerated by the cellulose surfaces but that they increase the affinity for cellulose and favor the stabilization of the 2-fold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screw</span></strong> conformation. This effect is more significant for the hydrophobic surface compared with the hydrophilic ones, which demonstrates the importance of nonpolar driving forces on the structural integrity of secondary plant cell walls. These novel molecular insights contribute to an improved understanding of the supramolecular architecture of plant secondary cell walls and have fundamental implications for overcoming lignocellulose recalcitrance and for the design of advanced wood-based materials.</p>

Structure basis for RNA-guided DNA degradation by Cascade and Cas3
<p>Type I CRISPR-Cas system features a sequential target-searching and degradation process on double-stranded DNA by the RNA-guided Cascade (CRISPR associated complex for antiviral defense) complex and the nuclease-helicase fusion enzyme Cas3, respectively. Here, we present a 3.7-angstrom-resolution cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the Type I-E Cascade/R-loop/Cas3 complex, poised to initiate DNA degradation. Cas3 distinguishes Cascade conformations and only captures the R-loop–forming Cascade, to avoid cleaving partially complementary targets. Its nuclease domain recruits the nontarget strand (NTS) DNA at a bulged region for the nicking of single-stranded DNA. An additional 4.7-angstrom-resolution cryo-EM structure captures the postnicking state, in which the severed NTS retracts to the helicase entrance, to be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thread</span></strong>ed for adenosine 5′-triphosphate–dependent processive degradation. These snapshots form the basis for understanding RNA-guided DNA degradation in Type I-E CRISPR-Cas systems.</p>

Polio outbreaks in the DRC threaten eradication effort
<p>There's an alarming polio outbreak in the Democratic of the Congo (DRC) that you have probably never heard of. Part of the reason is that it is overshadowed by Ebola. But part is because it is caused not by the wild virus that is hanging on by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thread</span></strong> in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and perhaps Nigeria, but by a rare mutant derived from the weakened live virus in the oral polio vaccine, which has regained its neurovirulence and ability to spread. Public health experts have worked for months to stamp out the virus, but it keeps spreading. It has already paralyzed 29 children, and on 21 June a case was reported on the border with Uganda, far outside the known outbreak zone, heightening fears that the virus will sweep across Africa. The DRC is "absolutely" the most worrisome polio outbreak today, says Michel Zaffran, who heads the Global Polio Eradication Initiative in Geneva at the World Health Organization.</p>

Atomic structures of low-complexity protein segments reveal kinked β sheets that assemble networks
<p>Subcellular membraneless assemblies are a reinvigorated area of study in biology, with spirited scientific discussions on the forces between the low-complexity protein domains within these assemblies. To illuminate these forces, we determined the atomic structures of five segments from protein low-complexity domains associated with membraneless assemblies. Their common structural feature is the stacking of segments into kinked β sheets that pair into protofilaments. Unlike steric zippers of amyloid fibrils, the kinked sheets interact weakly through polar atoms and aromatic side chains. By computationally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thread</span></strong>ing the human proteome on our kinked structures, we identified hundreds of low-complexity segments potentially capable of forming such interactions. These segments are found in proteins as diverse as RNA binders, nuclear pore proteins, and keratins, which are known to form networks and localize to membraneless assemblies.</p>

Membrane protein insertion through a mitochondrial β-barrel gate
<p>The biogenesis of mitochondria, chloroplasts, and Gram-negative bacteria requires the insertion of β-barrel proteins into the outer membranes. Homologous Omp85 proteins are essential for membrane insertion of β-barrel precursors. It is unknown if precursors are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thread</span></strong>ed through the Omp85-channel interior and exit laterally or if they are translocated into the membrane at the Omp85-lipid interface. We have mapped the interaction of a precursor in transit with the mitochondrial Omp85-channel Sam50 in the native membrane environment. The precursor is translocated into the channel interior, interacts with an internal loop, and inserts into the lateral gate by β-signal exchange. Transport through the Omp85-channel interior followed by release through the lateral gate into the lipid phase may represent a basic mechanism for membrane insertion of β-barrel proteins.</p>

Dicer uses distinct modules for recognizing dsRNA termini
<p>Invertebrates rely on Dicer to cleave viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), and <i>Drosophila</i> Dicer-2 distinguishes dsRNA substrates by their termini. Blunt termini promote processive cleavage, while 3′ overhanging termini are cleaved distributively. To understand this discrimination, we used cryo–electron microscopy to solve structures of <i>Drosophila</i> Dicer-2 alone and in complex with blunt dsRNA. Whereas the Platform-PAZ domains have been considered the only Dicer domains that bind dsRNA termini, unexpectedly, we found that the helicase domain is required for binding blunt, but not 3′ overhanging, termini. We further showed that blunt dsRNA is locally unwound and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thread</span></strong>ed through the helicase domain in an adenosine triphosphate–dependent manner. Our studies reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism for optimizing antiviral defense and set the stage for the discovery of helicase-dependent functions in other Dicers.</p>

Preventing mussel adhesion using lubricant-infused materials
<p>Mussels are opportunistic macrofouling organisms that can attach to most immersed solid surfaces, leading to serious economic and ecological consequences for the maritime and aquaculture industries. We demonstrate that lubricant-infused coatings exhibit very low preferential mussel attachment and ultralow adhesive strengths under both controlled laboratory conditions and in marine field studies. Detailed investigations across multiple length scales—from the molecular-scale characterization of deposited adhesive proteins to nanoscale contact mechanics to macroscale live observations—suggest that lubricant infusion considerably reduces fouling by deceiving the mechanosensing ability of mussels, deterring secretion of adhesive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thread</span></strong>s, and decreasing the molecular work of adhesion. Our study demonstrates that lubricant infusion represents an effective strategy to mitigate marine biofouling and provides insights into the physical mechanisms underlying adhesion prevention.</p>

Atomic structure of the human cytomegalovirus capsid with its securing tegument layer of pp150
<p>Herpesviruses possess a genome-pressurized capsid. The 235-kilobase genome of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is by far the largest of any herpesvirus, yet it has been unclear how its capsid, which is similar in size to those of other herpesviruses, is stabilized. Here we report a HCMV atomic structure consisting of the herpesvirus-conserved capsid proteins MCP, Tri1, Tri2, and SCP and the HCMV-specific tegument protein pp150—totaling ~4000 molecules and 62 different conformers. MCPs manifest as a complex of insertions around a bacteriophage HK97 gp5–like domain, which gives rise to three classes of capsid floor–defining interactions; triplexes, composed of two “embracing” Tri2 conformers and a “third-wheeling” Tri1, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fasten</span></strong> the capsid floor. HCMV-specific strategies include using hexon channels to accommodate the genome and pp150 helix bundles to secure the capsid via cysteine tetrad–to-SCP interactions. Our structure should inform rational design of countermeasures against HCMV, other herpesviruses, and even HIV/AIDS.</p>

The cryo-EM structure of a ribosome–Ski2-Ski3-Ski8 helicase complex
<p>Ski2-Ski3-Ski8 (Ski) is a helicase complex functioning with the RNA-degrading exosome to mediate the 3′-5′ messenger RNA (mRNA) decay in turnover and quality-control pathways. We report that the Ski complex directly associates with 80<i>S</i> ribosomes presenting a short mRNA 3′ overhang. We determined the structure of an endogenous ribosome-Ski complex using cryo–electron microscopy (EM) with a local resolution of the Ski complex ranging from 4 angstroms (Å) in the core to about 10 Å for intrinsically flexible regions. Ribosome binding displaces the autoinhibitory domain of the Ski2 helicase, positioning it in an open conformation near the ribosomal mRNA entry tunnel. We observe that the mRNA 3′ overhang is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thread</span></strong>ed directly from the small ribosomal subunit to the helicase channel of Ski2, primed for ongoing exosome-mediated 3′-5′ degradation.</p>

NIN Acts as a Network Hub Controlling a Growth Module Required for Rhizobial Infection
<p>The symbiotic infection of root cells by nitrogen-fixing rhizobia during nodulation requires the transcription factor Nodule Inception (NIN). Our root hair transcriptomic study extends NIN’s regulon to include <i>Rhizobium Polar Growth</i> and genes involved in cell wall modification, gibberellin biosynthesis, and a comprehensive group of nutrient (N, P, and S) uptake and assimilation genes, suggesting that NIN’s recruitment to nodulation was based on its role as a growth module, a role shared with other NIN-Like Proteins. The expression of jasmonic acid genes in <i>nin</i> suggests the involvement of NIN in the resolution of growth versus defense outcomes. We find that the regulation of the growth module component Nodulation Pectate Lyase by NIN, and its function in rhizobial infection, are conserved in hologalegina legumes, highlighting its recruitment as a major event in the evolution of nodulation. We find that Nodulation Pectate Lyase is secreted to the infection chamber and the lumen of the infection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thread</span></strong>. Gene network analysis using the transcription factor mutants for <i>ERF Required for Nodulation1</i> and <i>Nuclear Factor-Y Subunit A1</i> confirms hierarchical control of NIN over <i>Nuclear Factor-Y Subunit A1</i> and shows that ERF Required for Nodulation1 acts independently to control infection. We conclude that while NIN shares functions with other NIN-Like Proteins, the conscription of key infection genes to NIN’s control has made it a central regulatory hub for rhizobial infection.</p>

Medicago LINC Complexes Function in Nuclear Morphology, Nuclear Movement, and Root Nodule Symbiosis
<p>Nuclear movement is involved in cellular and developmental processes across eukaryotic life, often driven by Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton (LINC) complexes, which bridge the nuclear envelope (NE) via the interaction of Klarsicht/ANC-1/Syne-1 Homology (KASH) and Sad1/UNC-84 (SUN) proteins. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) LINC complexes are involved in nuclear movement and positioning in several cell types. Observations since the 1950s have described targeted nuclear movement and positioning during symbiosis initiation between legumes and rhizobia, but it has not been established whether these movements are functional or incidental. Here, we identify and characterize LINC complexes in the model legume <i>Medicago truncatula</i>. We show that LINC complex characteristics such as NE localization, dependence of KASH proteins on SUN protein binding for NE enrichment, and direct SUN-KASH binding are conserved between plant species. Using a SUN dominant-negative strategy, we demonstrate that LINC complexes are necessary for proper nuclear shaping and movement in <i>Medicago</i> root hairs, and are important for infection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thread</span></strong> initiation and nodulation.</p>

Local and Systemic Metabolic Responses during Light-Induced Rapid Systemic Signaling
<p>Plants evolved multiple signaling pathways that transduce light-related signals between leaves. These are thought to improve light stress acclimation in a process termed systemic acquired acclimation. Although responses to light stress have been studied extensively in local leaves, and to a lesser degree in systemic leaves, little is known about the responses that occur in the different tissues that connect the local to the systemic leaves. These could be important in defining the specificity of the systemic response as well as in supporting the generation of different systemic signals. Here, we report that local application of light stress to one rosette leaf of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bolt</span></strong>ing Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants resulted in a metabolic response that encompassed local, systemic and transport tissues (stem tissues that connect the local to the systemic tissues), demonstrating a high degree of physical and metabolic continuity between different tissues throughout the plant. Our results further indicate that the response of many of the systemically altered metabolites is associated with the function of the reactive oxygen species wave and that the levels of eight different metabolites are altered in a similar manner in all tissues tested (local, systemic, and transport). These compounds could define a core metabolic signature for light stress that propagates from the local to the systemic leaves. Our findings suggest that metabolic changes occurring in cells that connect the local and systemic tissues play an important role in systemic acquired acclimation and could convey specificity to the rapid systemic response of plants to light stress.</p>

The MtDMI2-MtPUB2 Negative Feedback Loop Plays a Role in Nodulation Homeostasis
<p>DOES NOT MAKE INFECTION 2 (MtDMI2) is a Leu rich repeat-type receptor kinase required for signal transduction in the <i>Medicago truncatula/Sinorhizobium meliloti</i> symbiosis pathway. However, the mechanisms through which MtDMI2 participates in nodulation homeostasis are poorly understood. In this study, we identified MtPUB2—a novel plant U-box (PUB)–type E3 ligase—and showed that it interacts with MtDMI2. MtDMI2 and MtPUB2 accumulation were shown to be similar in various tissues. Roots of plants in which <i>MtPUB2</i> was silenced by RNAi (<i>MtPUB2-</i>RNAi plants) exhibited impaired infection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thread</span></strong>s, fewer nodules, and shorter primary root lengths compared to those of control plants transformed with empty vector. Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, we showed that MtDMI2 phosphorylates MtPUB2 at Ser-316, Ser-421, and Thr-488 residues. When <i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi plants were transformed with <i>MtPUB2<sup>S421D</sup></i>, which mimics the phosphorylated state, MtDMI2 was persistently ubiquitinated and degraded by MtPUB2<sup>S421D</sup>, resulting in fewer nodules than observed in <i>MtPUB2</i>/<i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi-complemented plants. However, <i>MtPUB2<sup>S421A</sup></i>/<i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi-complemented plants showed no MtPUB2 ubiquitination activity, and their nodulation phenotype was similar to that of <i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi plants transformed with empty vector. Further studies demonstrated that these proteins form a negative feedback loop of the prey (MtDMI2)-predator (MtPUB2) type. Our results suggest that the MtDMI2-MtPUB2 negative feedback loop, which displays crosstalk with the long-distance autoregulation of nodulation via MtNIN, plays an important role in nodulation homeostasis.</p>

The use of an anterior pelvic internal fixator to treat disruptions of the anterior pelvic ring
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The anterior pelvic internal fixator is increasingly used for   the treatment of unstable, or displaced, injuries of the anterior   pelvic ring. The evidence for its use, however, is limited. The   aim of this paper is to describe the indications for its use, how   it is applied and its complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We reviewed the case notes and radiographs of 50 patients treated   with an anterior pelvic internal fixator between April 2010 and   December 2015 at a major trauma centre in the United Kingdom. The   median follow-up time was 38 months (interquartile range 24 to 51).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Three patients were excluded from the analysis leaving 47 patients   with complete follow-up data. Of the 47 patients, 46 achieved radiological   union and one progressed to an asymptomatic nonunion. Of the remaining patients,   45 required supplementary posterior fixation with percutaneous iliosacral   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screw</span></strong>s, 2 of which required sacral plating. The incidence of injury   to the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN) was 34%. The rate   of infection was 2%. There were no other significant complications.   Without this treatment, 44 patients (94%) would have needed unilateral   or bilateral open reduction and plate fixation extending laterally   to the hip joint.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The anterior pelvic internal fixator reduces the need for extensive   open surgery and is a useful addition to the armamentarium for the   treatment of anterior pelvic injuries. It is associated with injury   to the LFCN in a third of patients.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B.1232–6.</p></sec>

Sliding hip screw <i>versus</i> the Targon PFT nail for trochanteric hip fractures
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To compare the outcomes for trochanteric fractures treated with   a sliding hip <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screw</span></strong> (SHS) or a cephalomedullary nail.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 400 patients with a trochanteric hip fracture were   randomised to receive a SHS or a cephalomedullary nail (Targon PFT).   All surviving patients were followed up to one year from injury.   Functional outcome was assessed by a research nurse blinded to the   implant used.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Recovery of mobility, as assessed by a mobility scale, was superior   for those treated with the intramedullary nail compared with the   SHS at eight weeks, three and nine months    (p-values between 0.01 and 0.04), the difference at six and 12 months   was not statistically significant (p = 0.15 and p = 0.18 respectively).   The mean difference was around 0.4 points (0.3 to 0.5) on a nine   point scale. Surgical time for the nail was four minutes less than   that for the SHS (p < 0.001). Fracture healing complications   were similar for the two groups. There were no statistically significant   differences between implants for any other recorded outcomes including   the need for post-operative blood transfusion, wound healing complications,   general medical complications, hospital stay or mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study confirms the findings of a previous study that both   methods of treatment produce similar results, although intramedullary   fixation does result in marginally improved regain of mobility in   comparison with the SHS.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1210–15.</p></sec>

Radiation reduction of minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion with localisation system in overweight patients
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (MITLIF)   has been well validated in overweight and obese patients who are   consequently subject to a higher radiation exposure. This prospective   multicentre study aimed to investigate the efficacy of a novel lumbar   localisation system for MITLIF in overweight patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The initial study group consisted of 175 patients. After excluding   49 patients for various reasons, 126 patients were divided into   two groups. Those in Group A were treated using the localisation   system while those in Group B were treated by conventional means.   The primary outcomes were the effective radiation dosage to the   surgeon and the exposure time.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were 62 patients in Group A and 64 in Group B. The mean   effective dosage was 0.0217 mSv (standard deviation (<sc>sd</sc>) 0.0079)   in Group A and 0.0383 mSv (<sc>sd</sc> 0.0104) in Group B (p < 0.001).   The mean fluoroscopy exposure time was 26.42 seconds (<sc>sd</sc> 5.91)   in Group A and 40.67 seconds (<sc>sd</sc> 8.18) in Group B (p <   0.001). The operating time was 175.56 minutes (<sc>sd</sc> 32.23)   and 206.08 minutes (<sc>sd</sc> 30.15) (p < 0.001), respectively.   The mean pre-operative localisation time was 4.73 minutes (<sc>sd</sc> 0.84)   in Group A and 7.03 minutes (<sc>sd</sc> 1.51) in Group B (p <   0.001). The mean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screw</span></strong> placement time was 47.37 minutes (<sc>sd</sc> 10.43)   in Group A and 67.86 minutes (<sc>sd</sc> 14.15) in Group B (p <   0.001).

The challenge of Monteggia-like lesions of the elbow
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this retrospective multicentre study was to evaluate   mid-term results of the operative treatment of Monteggia-like lesions   and to determine the prognostic factors that influence the clinical   and radiological outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 46 patients (27 women and 19 men), with a mean age   of 57.7 years (18 to 84) who had sustained a Monteggia-like lesion   were followed up clinically and radiologically after surgical treatment.   The Mayo Modified Wrist Score (MMWS), Mayo Elbow Performance Score   (MEPS), Broberg and Morrey Score, and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder   and Hand (DASH) score were used for evaluation at a mean of 65 months   (27 to 111) postoperatively. All ulnar fractures were stabilized   using a proximally contoured or precontoured locking compression   plate. Mason type I fractures of the radial head were treated conservatively, type   II fractures were treated with reconstruction, and type III fractures   with arthroplasty. All Morrey type II and III fractures of the coronoid   process was stabilized using lag <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screw</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Good results were found for the MMWS, with a mean of 88.4 (40 to   100).

A synthetic polymer system with repeatable chemical recyclability
<p>The development of chemically recyclable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er</span></strong>s offers a solution to the end-of-use issue of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er</span></strong>ic materials and provides a closed-loop approach toward a circular materials economy. However, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er</span></strong>s that can be easily and selectively de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er</span></strong>ized back to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>ers typically require low-temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er</span></strong>ization methods and also lack physical properties and mechanical strengths required for practical uses. We introduce a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er</span></strong> system based on γ-butyrolactone (GBL) with a trans-ring fusion at the α and β positions. Such trans-ring fusion renders the commonly considered as non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er</span></strong>izable GBL ring readily <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er</span></strong>izable at room temperature under solvent-free conditions to yield a high–molecular weight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er</span></strong>. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er</span></strong> has enhanced thermostability and can be repeatedly and quantitatively recycled back to its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>er by thermolysis or chemolysis. Mixing of the two enantiomers of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er</span></strong> generates a highly crystalline supramolecular stereocomplex.</p>

Dimerization quality control via ubiquitylation
<p>Expanding the functional and structural repertoire of the proteome through protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong>ization is a fundamental concept in biology. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong>ization can occur in a homo- or heterotypic fashion with recurrent modular domains, such as BTB (BR-C, ttk, and bab) domains, leucine zippers, or coiled coils. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong>ization is a key factor in the regulation of enzymes, ion channels, receptors, and transcription factors. Indeed, proteomic studies indicate that a large fraction of mammalian proteins function only as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong>s or multimers in cells (<i>1</i>). Thus, correct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong> formation is of fundamental importance for a healthy proteome and consequently for a healthy organism. However, whereas quality control systems for RNA, DNA, and the folding of nascent proteins are well-studied, whether and how correct composition of protein complexes is surveyed by cells has been unknown. On page 198 of this issue, Mena <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) describe a quality control pathway that detects and eliminates nonfunctional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong> complexes. A failing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong>ization quality control (DQC) pathway leads to the accumulation of aberrant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong>s, which could contribute to the pathology of various diseases.</p>

Single polymer growth dynamics
<p>In chain-growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er</span></strong>ization, a chain grows continually to reach thousands of subunits. However, the real-time dynamics of chain growth remains unknown. Using magnetic tweezers, we visualized real-time <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er</span></strong> growth at the single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er</span></strong> level. Focusing on ring-opening metathesis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er</span></strong>ization, we found that the extension of a growing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er</span></strong> under a pulling force does not increase continuously but exhibits wait-and-jump steps. These steps are attributable to the formation and unraveling of conformational entanglements from newly incorporated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>ers, whose key features can be recapitulated with molecular dynamics simulations. The configurations of these entanglements appear to play a key role in determining the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er</span></strong>ization rates and the dispersion among individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er</span></strong>s.</p>

Hydroxystilbenes Are Monomers in Palm Fruit Endocarp Lignins
<p>Lignin, the plant cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er</span></strong> that binds fibers together but makes processing difficult, is traditionally formed from three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>ers, the so-called monolignols (<i>p</i>-coumaryl, coniferyl, and sinapyl alcohols). Recently, we discovered, in grass lignins, a phenolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>er that falls outside the canonical lignin biosynthetic pathway, the flavone tricin. As we show here, palm fruit (macaéíéííéíúba [<i>Acrocomia aculeata</i>], carnauba [<i>Copernicia prunifera</i>], and coconut [<i>Cocos nucifera</i>]) endocarps contain lignin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er</span></strong>s derived in part from a previously unconsidered class of lignin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>ers, the hydroxystilbenes, including the valuable compounds piceatannol and resveratrol. Piceatannol could be released from these lignins upon derivatization followed by reductive cleavage, a degradative method that cleaves β-ether bonds, indicating that at least a fraction is incorporated through labile ether bonds. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of products from the co<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er</span></strong>ization of piceatannol and monolignols confirms the structures in the natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er</span></strong> and demonstrates that piceatannol acts as an authentic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>er participating in coupling and cross-coupling reactions during lignification. Therefore, palm fruit endocarps contain a new class of stilbenolignin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er</span></strong>s, further expanding the definition of lignin and implying that compounds such as piceatannol and resveratrol are potentially available in what is now essentially a waste product.</p>

Chloroplast Preproteins Bind to the Dimer Interface of the Toc159 Receptor during Import
<p>Most chloroplast proteins are synthesized in the cytosol as higher molecular weight preproteins and imported via the translocons in the outer (TOC) and inner (TIC) envelope membranes of chloroplasts. Toc159 functions as a primary receptor and directly binds preproteins through its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong>ic GTPase domain. As a first step toward a molecular understanding of how Toc159 mediates preprotein import, we mapped the preprotein-binding regions on the Toc159 GTPase domain (Toc159G) of pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) using cleavage by bound preproteins conjugated with the artificial protease FeBABE and cysteine-cysteine cross-linking. Our results show that residues at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong> interface and the switch II region of Toc159G are in close proximity to preproteins. The mature portion of preproteins was observed preferentially at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong> interface, whereas the transit peptide was found at both regions equally. Chloroplasts from transgenic plants expressing engineered Toc159 with a cysteine placed at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong> interface showed increased cross-linking to bound preproteins. Our data suggest that, during preprotein import, the Toc159G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong> disengages and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong> interface contacts translocating preproteins, which is consistent with a model in which conformational changes induced by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>er conversion in Toc159 play a direct role in facilitating preprotein import.</p>

Quantitative single-molecule imaging of TLR4 reveals ligand-specific receptor dimerization
<p>In humans, invading pathogens are recognized by Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Upon recognition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) derived from the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria, TLR4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong>izes and can stimulate two different signaling pathways, the proinflammatory, MyD88-dependent pathway and the antiviral, MyD88-independent pathway. The balance between these two pathways is ligand-dependent, and ligand composition determines whether the invading pathogen activates or evades the host immune response. We investigated the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong>ization behavior of TLR4 in intact cells in response to different LPS chemotypes through quantitative single-molecule localization microscopy. Quantitative superresolved data showed that TLR4 was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>eric in the absence of its co-receptors MD2 and CD14 in transfected HEK 293 cells. When TLR4 was present together with MD2 and CD14 but in the absence of LPS, 52% of the receptors were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>eric and 48% were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong>ic. LPS from <i>Escherichia coli</i> or <i>Salmonella minnesota</i> caused the formation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong>ic TLR4 complexes, whereas the antagonistic LPS chemotype from <i>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</i> maintained TLR4 in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>eric form at the cell surface. Furthermore, we showed that LPS-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong>ization was required for the activation of NF-κB signaling. Together, these data demonstrate ligand-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong>ization of TLR4 in the cellular environment, which could pave the way for a molecular understanding of biased signaling downstream of the receptor.</p>

Catalyst-controlled stereoselective cationic polymerization of vinyl ethers
<p>The tacticity of vinyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er</span></strong>s has a profound effect on their physical properties. Despite the well-developed stereoselective methods for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er</span></strong>ization of propylene and other nonpolar α-olefins, stereoselective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er</span></strong>ization of polar vinyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>ers has proven more challenging. We have designed chiral counterions that systematically bias the reactivity and chain-end stereochemical environment during cationic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er</span></strong>ization. This approach overrides conventional chain-end stereochemical bias to achieve catalyst-controlled stereoselective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er</span></strong>ization. We demonstrate that this method is general to vinyl ether substrates, providing access to a range of isotactic poly(vinyl ether)s with high degrees of isotacticity. The obtained materials display the tensile properties of commercial polyolefins but adhere more strongly to polar substrates by an order of magnitude, indicating their promise for next-generation engineering applications.</p>

CCR5 adopts three homodimeric conformations that control cell surface delivery

Templated nanofiber synthesis via chemical vapor polymerization into liquid crystalline films
<p>Extrusion, electrospinning, and microdrawing are widely used to create fibrous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er</span></strong> mats, but these approaches offer limited access to oriented arrays of nanometer-scale fibers with controlled size, shape, and lateral organization.

Two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) offer broad <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>er scope but are generally isolated as powders comprising aggregated nanometer-scale crystallites. We found that 2D COF formation could be controlled using a two-step procedure in which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>ers are added slowly to preformed nanoparticle seeds. The resulting 2D COFs are isolated as single-crystalline, micrometer-sized particles.

Dimerization in LBD16 and LBD18 Transcription Factors Is Critical for Lateral Root Formation
<p>LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES DOMAIN/ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2-LIKEs (hereafter referred to as LBD) are plant-specific transcription factors that play important roles in a plethora of plant growth and development. The leucine (Leu) zipper-like coiled-coil motif in the lateral organ boundaries domain of the class I LBD proteins has been proposed to mediate protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong>ization, but it has not been experimentally assessed yet. LBD16 and LBD18 have been well characterized to play important roles in lateral root development in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Here, we investigated the role of the coiled-coil motif in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong>ization of LBD16 and LBD18 and in transcriptional regulation and biological function. We built the molecular models of the coiled coil of LBD16 and LBD18, providing the probable Leu zipper models of the helix <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong>. Using a variety of molecular techniques, such as bimolecular fluorescence complementation, luciferase complementation imaging, GST pull down, and coimmunoprecipitation assays, we showed that the conserved Leu or valine residues in the coiled-coil motif are critical for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong>ization of LBD16 or LBD18. Using transgenic Arabidopsis plants that overexpress HA:LBD16 or HA:LBD16<sup>Q</sup> in <i>lbd16</i> or HA:LBD18 or HA:LBD18<sup>Q</sup> in <i>lbd18</i>, we demonstrated that the homo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong>ization of LBD18 mediated by the coiled-coil motif is crucial for transcriptional regulation via promoter binding and for lateral root formation. In addition, we found that the carboxyl-terminal region beyond the coiled-coil motif in LBD18 acts as an additional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong>ization domain. These results provide a molecular basis for homo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong>ization and hetero<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong>ization among the 42 Arabidopsis LBD family members for displaying their biological functions.</p>

Kinase domain dimerization drives RIPK3-dependent necroptosis
<p>Necroptosis, an inflammatory form of cell death, is initiated by the activation of receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3), which depends on its interaction with RIPK1. Although catalytically inactive, the RIPK3 mutant D161N still stimulates RIPK1-dependent apoptosis and embryonic lethality in RIPK3 D161N homozygous mice. Whereas the absence of RIPK1 rescues RIPK3 D161N homozygous mice, we report that the absence of RIPK1 leads to embryonic lethality in RIPK3 D161N heterozygous mice. This suggested that the kinase domain of RIPK3 had a noncatalytic function that was enhanced by a conformation induced by the D161N mutation. We found that the RIPK3 kinase domain homo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong>ized through a surface that is structurally similar to that of the RAF family members. Mutation of residues at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong> interface impaired <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong>ization and necroptosis. Kinase domain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong>ization stimulated the activation of RIPK3 through cis-autophosphorylation. This noncatalytic, allosteric activity was enhanced by certain kinase-deficient mutants of RIPK3, including D161N. Furthermore, apoptosis induced by certain RIPK3 inhibitors was also dependent on the kinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong>ization interface. Our studies reveal that the RIPK3 kinase domain exhibits catalytically independent function that is important for both RIPK3-dependent necroptosis and apoptosis.</p>

Mitochondrial redox sensing by the kinase ATM maintains cellular antioxidant capacity
<p>Mitochondria are integral to cellular energy metabolism and ATP production and are involved in regulating many cellular processes. Mitochondria produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), which not only can damage cellular components but also participate in signal transduction. The kinase ATM, which is mutated in the neurodegenerative, autosomal recessive disease ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), is a key player in the nuclear DNA damage response. However, ATM also performs a redox-sensing function mediated through formation of ROS-dependent disulfide-linked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong>s. We found that mitochondria-derived hydrogen peroxide promoted ATM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong>ization. In HeLa cells, ATM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong>s were localized to the nucleus and inhibited by the redox regulatory protein thioredoxin 1 (TRX1), suggesting the existence of a ROS-mediated, stress-signaling relay from mitochondria to the nucleus. ATM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong> formation did not affect its association with chromatin in the absence or presence of nuclear DNA damage, consistent with the separation of its redox and DNA damage signaling functions. Comparative analysis of U2OS cells expressing either wild-type ATM or the redox sensing–deficient C2991L mutant revealed that one function of ATM redox sensing is to promote glucose flux through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) by increasing the abundance and activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), thereby increasing cellular antioxidant capacity. The PPP produces the coenzyme NADPH needed for a robust antioxidant response, including the regeneration of TRX1, indicating the existence of a regulatory feedback loop involving ATM and TRX1. We propose that loss of the mitochondrial ROS-sensing function of ATM may cause cellular ROS accumulation and oxidative stress in A-T.</p>

Dimerization of the adaptor Gads facilitates antigen receptor signaling by promoting the cooperative binding of Gads to the adaptor LAT
<p>The accurate assembly of signalosomes centered on the adaptor protein LAT (linker of activated T cells) is required for antigen receptor signaling in T cells and mast cells. During signalosome assembly, members of the growth factor receptor–bound protein 2 (Grb2) family of cytosolic adaptor proteins bind cooperatively to LAT through interactions with its phosphorylated tyrosine (pTyr) residues. We demonstrated the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain–mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong>ization of the Grb2 family member, Grb2-related adaptor downstream of Shc (Gads). Gads <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong>ization was mediated by an SH2 domain interface, which is distinct from the pTyr binding pocket and which promoted cooperative, preferential binding of paired Gads to LAT. This SH2 domain–intrinsic mechanism of cooperativity, which we quantified by mathematical modeling, enabled Gads to discriminate between dually and singly phosphorylated LAT molecules. Mutational inactivation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong>ization interface reduced cooperativity and abrogated Gads signaling in T cells and mast cells. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong>ization-dependent, cooperative binding of Gads to LAT may increase antigen receptor sensitivity by reducing signalosome formation at incompletely phosphorylated LAT molecules, thereby prioritizing the formation of complete signalosomes.</p>

Genome-wide identification and characterization of Notch transcription complex–binding sequence-paired sites in leukemia cells

Dimerization quality control ensures neuronal development and survival
<p>Aberrant complex formation by recurrent interaction modules, such as BTB domains, leucine zippers, or coiled coils, can disrupt signal transduction, yet whether cells detect and eliminate complexes of irregular composition is unknown. By searching for regulators of the BTB family, we discovered a quality control pathway that ensures functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong>ization [<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong>ization quality control (DQC)]. Key to this network is the E3 ligase SCF<sup>FBXL17</sup>, which selectively binds and ubiquitylates BTB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong>s of aberrant composition to trigger their clearance by proteasomal degradation. Underscoring the physiological importance of DQC, SCF<sup>FBXL17</sup> is required for the differentiation, function, and survival of neural crest and neuronal cells. We conclude that metazoan organisms actively monitor BTB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong>ization, and we predict that distinct E3 ligases similarly control complex formation by other recurrent domains.</p>

Exploring cytoskeletal diversity in neurons
<p>Often in biology, form follows function. For example, the ability of neurons to receive, process, and transmit information depends on their polarized organization into axons and dendrites. The cytoskeleton and associated motor proteins shape cells and establish spatial organization. Microtubules (MTs) and actin are core components of the cytoskeleton and are assembled through head-to-tail <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er</span></strong>ization of α- and β-tubulin hetero<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong>s and actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>ers, respectively, resulting in asymmetric, polarized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er</span></strong>s with two different ends, called plus and minus ends. The spatially regulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er</span></strong>ization of MTs and actin can drive morphological transitions, such as local protrusion of the plasma membrane, to drive cell migration or the development of specialized extensions, such as axons or dendrites and their branches. In addition, the structural asymmetry of MTs and actin enables cytoskeletal motor proteins (myosin, kinesin, and dynein) to walk toward a specific end of the fibers. Given the extreme dimensions and functional compartmentalization of neurons, such active transport is critical to sort and distribute cellular cargoes. Recent studies have used advanced microscopy to reveal how the cytoskeleton takes many different forms to facilitate local functions in neurons (see the figure).</p>

Atomic model for the dimeric F<sub>O</sub> region of mitochondrial ATP synthase
<p>Mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase produces the majority of ATP in eukaryotic cells, and its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong>ization is necessary to create the inner membrane folds, or cristae, characteristic of mitochondria. Proton translocation through the membrane-embedded F<sub>O</sub> region turns the rotor that drives ATP synthesis in the soluble F<sub>1</sub> region. Although crystal structures of the F<sub>1</sub> region have illustrated how this rotation leads to ATP synthesis, understanding how proton translocation produces the rotation has been impeded by the lack of an experimental atomic model for the F<sub>O</sub> region. Using cryo–electron microscopy, we determined the structure of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong>ic F<sub>O</sub> complex from <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> at a resolution of 3.6 angstroms. The structure clarifies how the protons travel through the complex, how the complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong>izes, and how the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong>s bend the membrane to produce cristae.</p>

Mechanochemical unzipping of insulating polyladderene to semiconducting polyacetylene

Highly stretchable polymer semiconductor films through the nanoconfinement effect
<p>Soft and conformable wearable electronics require stretchable semiconductors, but existing ones typically sacrifice charge transport mobility to achieve stretchability. We explore a concept based on the nanoconfinement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er</span></strong>s to substantially improve the stretchability of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er</span></strong> semiconductors, without affecting charge transport mobility. The increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er</span></strong> chain dynamics under nanoconfinement significantly reduces the modulus of the conjugated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er</span></strong> and largely delays the onset of crack formation under strain. As a result, our fabricated semiconducting film can be stretched up to 100% strain without affecting mobility, retaining values comparable to that of amorphous silicon. The fully stretchable transistors exhibit high biaxial stretchability with minimal change in on current even when poked with a sharp object. We demonstrate a skinlike finger-wearable driver for a light-emitting diode.</p>

The Acyl Desaturase CER17 Is Involved in Producing Wax Unsaturated Primary Alcohols and Cutin Monomers
<p>We report <i>n</i>-6 monounsaturated primary alcohols (C<sub>26:1</sub>, C<sub>28:1</sub>, and C<sub>30:1</sub> homologs) in the cuticular waxes of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) inflorescence stem, a class of wax not previously reported in Arabidopsis. The Arabidopsis <i>cer17</i> mutant was completely deficient in these monounsaturated alcohols, and <i>CER17</i> was found to encode a predicted ACYL-COENZYME A DESATURASE LIKE4 (ADS4). Studies of the Arabidopsis <i>cer4</i> mutant and yeast variously expressing <i>CER4</i> (a predicted fatty acyl-CoA reductase) with <i>CER17/ADS4</i>, demonstrated <i>CER4</i>’s principal role in synthesis of these monounsaturated alcohols. Besides unsaturated alcohol deficiency, <i>cer17</i> mutants exhibited a thickened and irregular cuticle ultrastructure and increased amounts of cutin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>ers. Although unsaturated alcohols were absent throughout the <i>cer17</i> stem, the mutation’s effects on cutin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>ers and cuticle ultrastructure were much more severe in distal than basal stems, consistent with observations that the <i>CER17/ADS4</i> transcript was much more abundant in distal than basal stems. Furthermore, distal but not basal stems of a double mutant deficient for both CER17/ADS4 and LONG-CHAIN ACYL-COA SYNTHETASE1 produced even more cutin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>ers and a thicker and more disorganized cuticle ultrastructure and higher cuticle permeability than observed for wild type or either mutant parent, indicating a dramatic genetic interaction on conversion of very long chain acyl-CoA precursors. These results provide evidence that CER17/ADS4 performs <i>n</i>-6 desaturation of very long chain acyl-CoAs in both distal and basal stems and has a major function associated with governing cutin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>er amounts primarily in the distal segments of the inflorescence stem.</p>

The receptor tyrosine kinase TrkB signals without dimerization at the plasma membrane
<p>Tropomyosin-related tyrosine kinase B (TrkB) is the receptor for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and provides critical signaling that supports the development and function of the mammalian nervous system. Like other receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), TrkB is thought to signal as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong>. Using cell imaging and biochemical assays, we found that TrkB acted as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>eric receptor at the plasma membrane regardless of its binding to BDNF and initial activation. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong>ization occurred only after the internalization and accumulation of TrkB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>ers within BDNF-containing endosomes. We further showed that dynamin-mediated endocytosis of TrkB-BDNF was required for the effective activation of the kinase AKT but not of the kinase ERK1/2. Thus, we report a previously uncharacterized mode of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>eric signaling for an RTK and a specific role for the endosome in TrkB homo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong>ization.</p>

Near-atomic model of microtubule-tau interactions
<p>Tau is a developmentally regulated axonal protein that stabilizes and bundles microtubules (MTs). Its hyperphosphorylation is thought to cause detachment from MTs and subsequent aggregation into fibrils implicated in Alzheimer’s disease. It is unclear which tau residues are crucial for tau-MT interactions, where tau binds on MTs, and how it stabilizes them. We used cryo–electron microscopy to visualize different tau constructs on MTs and computational approaches to generate atomic models of tau-tubulin interactions. The conserved tubulin-binding repeats within tau adopt similar extended structures along the crest of the protofilament, stabilizing the interface between tubulin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong>s. Our structures explain the effect of phosphorylation on MT affinity and lead to a model of tau repeats binding in tandem along protofilaments, tethering together tubulin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong>s and stabilizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er</span></strong>ization interfaces.</p>

Paralogs of the C-Terminal Domain of the Cyanobacterial Orange Carotenoid Protein Are Carotenoid Donors to Helical Carotenoid Proteins
<p>The photoactive Orange Carotenoid Protein (OCP) photoprotects cyanobacteria cells by quenching singlet oxygen and excess excitation energy. Its N-terminal domain is the active part of the protein, and the C-terminal domain regulates the activity. Recently, the characteristics of a family of soluble carotenoid-binding proteins (Helical Carotenoid Proteins [HCPs]), paralogs of the N-terminal domain of OCP, were described. Bioinformatics studies also revealed the existence of genes coding for homologs of CTD. Here, we show that the latter genes encode carotenoid proteins (CTDHs). This family of proteins contains two subgroups with distinct characteristics. One CTDH of each clade was further characterized, and they proved to be very good singlet oxygen quenchers. When synthesized in <i>Escherichia coli</i> or <i>Synechocystis</i> PCC 6803, CTDHs formed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong>s that share a carotenoid molecule and are able to transfer their carotenoid to apo-HCPs and apo-OCP. The CTDHs from clade 2 have a cysteine in position 103. A disulfide bond is easily formed between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monom</span></strong>ers of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong> preventing carotenoid transfer. This suggests that the transfer of the carotenoid could be redox regulated in clade 2 CTDH. We also demonstrate here that apo-OCPs and apo-CTDHs are able to take the carotenoid directly from membranes, while HCPs are unable to do so. HCPs need the presence of CTDH to become holo-proteins. We propose that, in cyanobacteria, the CTDHs are carotenoid donors to HCPs.</p>

Phloem Loading through Plasmodesmata: A Biophysical Analysis
<p>In many species, Suc en route out of the leaf migrates from photosynthetically active mesophyll cells into the phloem down its concentration gradient via plasmodesmata, i.e. symplastically. In some of these plants, the process is entirely passive, but in others phloem Suc is actively converted into larger sugars, raffinose and stachyose, and segregated (trapped), thus raising total phloem sugar concentration to a level higher than in the mesophyll. Questions remain regarding the mechanisms and selective advantages conferred by both of these symplastic-loading processes. Here, we present an integrated model—including local and global transport and kinetics of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er</span></strong>ization—for passive and active symplastic loading. We also propose a physical model of transport through the plasmodesmata. With these models, we predict that (1) relative to passive loading, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er</span></strong>ization of Suc in the phloem, even in the absence of segregation, lowers the sugar content in the leaf required to achieve a given export rate and accelerates export for a given concentration of Suc in the mesophyll and (2) segregation of oligomers and the inverted gradient of total sugar content can be achieved for physiologically reasonable parameter values, but even higher export rates can be accessed in scenarios in which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er</span></strong>s are allowed to diffuse back into the mesophyll. We discuss these predictions in relation to further studies aimed at the clarification of loading mechanisms, fitness of active and passive symplastic loading, and potential targets for engineering improved rates of export.</p>

Synthesis and Self-Assembly of Cellulose Microfibrils from Reconstituted Cellulose Synthase
<p>Cellulose, the major component of plant cell walls, can be converted to bioethanol and is thus highly studied. In plants, cellulose is produced by cellulose synthase, a processive family-2 glycosyltransferase. In plant cell walls, individual β-1,4-glucan chains <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er</span></strong>ized by CesA are assembled into microfibrils that are frequently bundled into macrofibrils. An in vitro system in which cellulose is synthesized and assembled into fibrils would facilitate detailed study of this process. Here, we report the heterologous expression and partial purification of His-tagged CesA5 from <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. Immunoblot analysis and mass spectrometry confirmed enrichment of PpCesA5. The recombinant protein was functional when reconstituted into liposomes made from yeast total lipid extract. The functional studies included incorporation of radiolabeled Glc, linkage analysis, and imaging of cellulose microfibril formation using transmission electron microscopy. Several microfibrils were observed either inside or on the outer surface of proteoliposomes, and strikingly, several thinner fibrils formed ordered bundles that either covered the surfaces of proteoliposomes or were spawned from liposome surfaces. We also report this arrangement of fibrils made by proteoliposomes bearing CesA8 from hybrid aspen. These observations describe minimal systems of membrane-reconstituted CesAs that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er</span></strong>ize β-1,4-glucan chains that coalesce to form microfibrils and higher-ordered macrofibrils. How these micro- and macrofibrils relate to those found in primary and secondary plant cell walls is uncertain, but their presence enables further study of the mechanisms that govern the formation and assembly of fibrillar cellulosic structures and cell wall composites during or after the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er</span></strong>ization process controlled by CesA proteins.</p>

Silencing <i>CHALCONE SYNTHASE</i> in Maize Impedes the Incorporation of Tricin into Lignin and Increases Lignin Content
<p>Lignin is a phenolic hetero<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er</span></strong> that is deposited in secondary-thickened cell walls, where it provides mechanical strength. A recent structural characterization of cell walls from monocot species showed that the flavone tricin is part of the native lignin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er</span></strong>, where it is hypothesized to initiate lignin chains. In this study, we investigated the consequences of altered tricin levels on lignin structure and cell wall recalcitrance by phenolic profiling, nuclear magnetic resonance, and saccharification assays of the naturally silenced maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) <i>C2-Idf</i> (<i>inhibitor diffuse</i>) mutant, defective in the <i>CHALCONE SYNTHASE Colorless2</i> (<i>C2</i>) gene. We show that the <i>C2-Idf</i> mutant produces highly reduced levels of apigenin- and tricin-related flavonoids, resulting in a strongly reduced incorporation of tricin into the lignin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er</span></strong>. Moreover, the lignin was enriched in β-β and β-5 units, lending support to the contention that tricin acts to initiate lignin chains and that, in the absence of tricin, more monolignol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong>ization reactions occur. In addition, the <i>C2-Idf</i> mutation resulted in strikingly higher Klason lignin levels in the leaves. As a consequence, the leaves of <i>C2-Idf</i> mutants had significantly reduced saccharification efficiencies compared with those of control plants. These findings are instructive for lignin engineering strategies to improve biomass processing and biochemical production.</p>

A SAP domain-containing protein shuttles between the nucleus and cell membranes and plays a role in adhesion and migration in <i>D. discoideum</i>
<p>The AmpA protein reduces cell adhesion, thereby influencing cell migration in <i>Dictyostelium</i>. To understand how <i>ampA</i> influences cell migration, second site suppressors of an AmpA overexpressing cell line were created by REMI mutagenesis. Mutant candidates were identified by their ability to suppress the large plaques that the AmpA overexpressing cells form on bacterial lawns as a result of their increased rate of migration. One suppressor gene, <i>sma</i>, encodes an uncharacterized protein, which contains a SAP DNA-binding domain and a PTEN-like domain. Using <i>sma</i> gene knockouts and Sma-mRFP expressing cell lines, a role for <i>sma</i> in influencing cell migration was uncovered. Knockouts of the <i>sma</i> gene in a wild-type background enhanced chemotaxis. An additional role for Sma in influencing cell–cell adhesion was also demonstrated. Sma protein transitions between cytosolic and nuclear localizations as a function of cell density. In growing cells migrating to folic acid it is localized to regions of actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er</span></strong>ization and absent from the nucleus. A role for Sma in influencing <i>ampA</i> mRNA levels is also demonstrated. Sma additionally appears to be involved in <i>ampA</i> pathways regulating cell size, actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er</span></strong>ization, and cell substrate adhesion. We present insights to the SAP domain-containing group of proteins in <i>Dictyostelium</i> and provide evidence of a role for a SAP domain-containing protein shuttling from the nucleus to sites of actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er</span></strong>ization during chemotaxis to folic acid and influencing the efficiency of migration.</p>

Observation of three-photon bound states in a quantum nonlinear medium
<p>Bound states of massive particles, such as nuclei, atoms, or molecules, constitute the bulk of the visible world around us. By contrast, photons typically only interact weakly. We report the observation of traveling three-photon bound states in a quantum nonlinear medium where the interactions between photons are mediated by atomic Rydberg states. Photon correlation and conditional phase measurements reveal the distinct bunching and phase features associated with three-photon and two-photon bound states. Such photonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">trimer</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong>s possess shape-preserving wave functions that depend on the constituent photon number. The observed bunching and strongly nonlinear optical phase are described by an effective field theory of Rydberg-induced photon-photon interactions. These observations demonstrate the ability to realize and control strongly interacting quantum many-body states of light.</p>

Synthesis of partially and fully fused polyaromatics by annulative chlorophenylene dimerization
<p>Since the discovery by Ullmann and Bielecki in 1901, reductive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong>ization (or homocoupling) of aryl halides has been extensively exploited for the generation of a range of biaryl-based functional molecules. In contrast to the single-point connection in these products, edge-sharing fused aromatic systems have not generally been accessible from simple aryl halides via annulation cascades. Here we report a single-step synthesis of fused aromatics with a triphenylene core by the palladium-catalyzed annulative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong>ization of structurally and functionally diverse chlorophenylenes through double carbon-hydrogen bond activation. The partially fused polyaromatics can be transformed into fully fused, small graphene nanoribbons, which are otherwise difficult to synthesize. This simple, yet powerful, method allows access to functional π-systems of interest in optoelectronics research.</p>

A generic interface to reduce the efficiency-stability-cost gap of perovskite solar cells
<p>A major bottleneck delaying the further commercialization of thin-film solar cells based on hybrid organohalide lead perovskites is interface loss in state-of-the-art devices. We present a generic interface architecture that combines solution-processed, reliable, and cost-efficient hole-transporting materials without compromising efficiency, stability, or scalability of perovskite solar cells. Tantalum-doped tungsten oxide (Ta-WO<i><sub>x</sub></i>)/conjugated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er</span></strong> multilayers offer a surprisingly small interface barrier and form quasi-ohmic contacts universally with various scalable conjugated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er</span></strong>s. In a simple device with regular planar architecture and a self-assembled monolayer, Ta-WO<i><sub>x</sub></i>–doped interface–based perovskite solar cells achieve maximum efficiencies of 21.2% and offer more than 1000 hours of light stability. By eliminating additional ionic dopants, these findings open up the entire class of organics as scalable hole-transporting materials for perovskite solar cells.</p>

Structure of histone-based chromatin in Archaea

Palladium-catalyzed carbon-sulfur or carbon-phosphorus bond metathesis by reversible arylation

Synthesis of resveratrol tetramers via a stereoconvergent radical equilibrium
<p>Persistent free radicals have become indispensable in the synthesis of organic materials through living radical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er</span></strong>ization. However, examples of their use in the synthesis of small molecules are rare. Here, we report the application of persistent radical and quinone methide intermediates to the synthesis of the resveratrol tetramers nepalensinol B and vateriaphenol C. The spontaneous cleavage and reconstitution of exceptionally weak carbon-carbon bonds has enabled a stereoconvergent oxidative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimer</span></strong>ization of racemic materials in a transformation that likely coincides with the biogenesis of these natural products. The efficient synthesis of higher-order oligomers of resveratrol will facilitate the biological studies necessary to elucidate their mechanism(s) of action.</p>

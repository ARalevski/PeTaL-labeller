Retinol-Binding Protein-Dependent Cholesterol Uptake Regulates Macrophage Foam Cell Formation and Promotes Atherosclerosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) is an adipokine that plays decisive roles in glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Elevated circulating RBP4 levels were reported to be associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease, but the precise role of RBP4 in atherosclerotic diseases and its mechanisms of action remain elusive.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Serum RBP4 levels of 1683 participants from South China were evaluated and the occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events was followed up for 5 years. Apolipoprotein E-deficient mice infected with RBP4-overexpressing/silencing adenovirus, J774A.1 macrophages, and primary peritoneal macrophages from RBP4 transgenic mice were used for investigating the function of RBP4 in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">foam</span></strong> cell formation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Prospective cohort studies revealed that baseline serum RBP4 level was an independent predictor for incidence of adverse cardiovascular events after adjustment for traditional risk factors. Increased RBP4 expression was observed in atherosclerotic lesions of aortic specimens from both humans and apolipoprotein E-deficient mice, and RBP4 was localized to areas rich in macrophage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">foam</span></strong> cells. RBP4 inhibition attenuated whereas overexpression accelerated atherosclerosis progression in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice. Both treatment with exogenous recombinant RBP4 and overexpression of RBP4 gene promoted macrophage-derived <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">foam</span></strong> cell formation through the activation of scavenger-receptor CD36-mediated cholesterol uptake, and RBP4 transcriptionally upregulated CD36 expression in a manner dependent on jun N-terminal kinase and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1. The tyrosine kinase c-Src was identified as the upstream regulator of jun N-terminal kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription 1-mediated CD36-dependent cholesterol uptake, and RBP4 challenge was found to alter the membrane distribution of c-Src and cause c-Src to partition into lipid-raft membrane subdomains, where the kinase was activated. Lastly, Toll-like receptor 4, but not retinol or stimulated by retinoic acid 6, mediated the inductive effects of RBP4 in macrophages.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Inclusion of RBP4 levels in traditional models enhances the predictive ability for the incidence of atherosclerotic events. RBP4 promotes atherogenesis by inducing macrophage-derived <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">foam</span></strong> cell formation.</p></sec>

Melanocortin 1 Receptor Signaling Regulates Cholesterol Transport in Macrophages
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1-R) is expressed by monocytes and macrophages, where it exerts anti-inflammatory actions on stimulation with its natural ligand α-melanocyte–stimulating hormone. The present study was designed to investigate the specific role of MC1-R in the context of atherosclerosis and possible regulatory pathways of MC1-R beyond anti-inflammation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Human and mouse atherosclerotic samples and primary mouse macrophages were used to study the regulatory functions of MC1-R. The impact of pharmacological MC1-R activation on atherosclerosis was assessed in apolipoprotein E–deficient mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Characterization of human and mouse atherosclerotic plaques revealed that MC1-R expression localizes in lesional macrophages and is significantly associated with the ATP-binding cassette transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1, which are responsible for initiating reverse cholesterol transport. Using bone marrow–derived macrophages, we observed that α-melanocyte–stimulating hormone and selective MC1-R agonists similarly promoted cholesterol efflux, which is a counterregulatory mechanism against <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">foam</span></strong> cell formation. Mechanistically, MC1-R activation upregulated the levels of ABCA1 and ABCG1. These effects were accompanied by a reduction in cell surface CD36 expression and in cholesterol uptake, further protecting macrophages from excessive lipid accumulation. Conversely, macrophages deficient in functional MC1-R displayed a phenotype with impaired efflux and enhanced uptake of cholesterol. Pharmacological targeting of MC1-R in atherosclerotic apolipoprotein E–deficient mice reduced plasma cholesterol levels and aortic CD36 expression and increased plaque ABCG1 expression and signs of plaque stability.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings identify a novel role for MC1-R in macrophage cholesterol transport. Activation of MC1-R confers protection against macrophage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">foam</span></strong> cell formation through a dual mechanism: It prevents cholesterol uptake while concomitantly promoting ABCA1- and ABCG1-mediated reverse cholesterol transport.</p></sec>

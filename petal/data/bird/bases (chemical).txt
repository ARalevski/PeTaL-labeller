Global Pulmonary Vascular Remodeling in Pulmonary Hypertension Associated With Heart Failure and Preserved or Reduced Ejection Fraction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>We hypothesized that pulmonary venous hypertension in heart failure (HF) leads to predominate remodeling of pulmonary veins and that the severity of venous remodeling is associated with the severity of pulmonary hypertension (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>) in HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients with HF (n=108; 53 preserved and 55 reduced ejection fraction) with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> (HF-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>; pulmonary artery systolic pressure [PASP] ≥40 mm Hg) were compared to normal controls (n=12) and patients with primary pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD; n=17). In lung specimens from autopsy (control, HF-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>, and 7 PVOD) or surgery (10 PVOD), quantitative histomor<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ometry was performed in all analyzable arteries (n=4949), veins (n=7630), and small indeterminate vessels (IV; n=2168) to define percent medial thickness (arteries) and percent intimal thickness (%IT) (arteries, veins, and IV) relative to external diameter.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The average arterial percent medial thickness (control, 6.9; HF-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>, 11.0; PVOD, 15.0), arterial %IT (control, 4.9; HF-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>, 14.9; PVOD, 31.1), venous %IT (control, 14.0; HF-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>, 24.9; PVOD, 43.9), and IV %IT (control, 10.6; HF-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>, 25.8; PVOD, 50.0) in HF-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> were higher than controls (<i>P</i><0.0001 for all) but lower than PVOD (<i>P</i>≤0.005 for all). PASP (mm Hg) was lower in HF-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> (median, 59 [interquartile range, 50–70]) than in PVOD (median, 91 [interquartile range, 82–103]). PASP correlated with arterial percent medial thickness (<i>r</i>=0.41) and arterial %IT (<i>r</i>=0.35) but more strongly with venous %IT (<i>r</i>=0.49) and IV %IT (<i>r</i>=0.55) (<i>P</i><0.0001 for all). Associations between PASP and venous or IV %IT remained significant after adjusting for arterial percent medial thickness and %IT and did not vary by HF type. In patients with right heart catheterization (30 HF-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>, 14 PVOD), similar associations between the transpulmonary gradient and pulmonary vascular remodeling existed, with numerically stronger associations for venous and IV %IT. Although the PASP was slightly higher in patients with HF-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> with right ventricular dysfunction, pulmonary vascular remodeling was not more severe. Pulmonary vascular remodeling severity was associated with reductions in the diffusing capacity of the lungs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In HF, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> is associated with global pulmonary vascular remodeling, but the severity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> correlates most strongly with venous and small IV intimal thickening, similar to the pattern observed in PVOD. These findings expand our understanding of the pathobiology of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> in HF.</p></sec>

Metabolic and Proliferative State of Vascular Adventitial Fibroblasts in Pulmonary Hypertension Is Regulated Through a MicroRNA-124/PTBP1 (Polypyrimidine Tract Binding Protein 1)/Pyruvate Kinase Muscle Axis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>An emerging metabolic theory of pulmonary hypertension (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>) suggests that cellular and mitochondrial metabolic dysfunction underlies the pathology of this disease. We and others have previously demonstrated the existence of hyperproliferative, apoptosis-resistant, proinflammatory adventitial fibroblasts from human and bovine hypertensive pulmonary arterial walls (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>-Fibs) that exhibit constitutive reprogramming of glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolism, accompanied by an increased ratio of glucose catabolism through glycolysis versus the tricarboxylic acid cycle. However, the mechanisms responsible for these metabolic alterations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>-Fibs remain unknown. We hypothesized that in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>-Fibs microRNA-124 (miR-124) regulates PTBP1 (polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1) expression to control alternative splicing of pyruvate kinase muscle (PKM) isoforms 1 and 2, resulting in an increased PKM2/PKM1 ratio, which promotes glycolysis and proliferation even in aerobic environments.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Pulmonary adventitial fibroblasts were isolated from calves and humans with severe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>-Fibs) and from normal subjects. PTBP1 gene knockdown was achieved via PTBP1-siRNA; restoration of miR-124 was performed with miR-124 mimic. TEPP-46 and shikonin were used to manipulate PKM2 glycolytic function. Histone deacetylase inhibitors were used to treat cells. Metabolic products were determined by mass spectrometry–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d metabolomics analyses, and mitochondrial function was analyzed by confocal microscopy and spectrofluorometry.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We detected an increased PKM2/PKM1 ratio in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>-Fibs compared with normal subjects. PKM2 inhibition reversed the glycolytic status of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>-Fibs, decreased their cell proliferation, and attenuated macro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>age interleukin-1β expression. Furthermore, normalizing the PKM2/PKM1 ratio in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>-Fibs by miR-124 overexpression or PTBP1 knockdown reversed the glycolytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>enotype (decreased the production of glycolytic intermediates and byproducts, ie, lactate), rescued mitochondrial reprogramming, and decreased cell proliferation. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>armacological manipulation of PKM2 activity with TEPP-46 and shikonin or treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors produced similar results.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>, miR-124, through the alternative splicing factor PTBP1, regulates the PKM2/PKM1 ratio, the overall metabolic, proliferative, and inflammatory state of cells. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>enotype can be rescued with interventions at various levels of the metabolic cascade. These findings suggest a more integrated view of vascular cell metabolism, which may open unique therapeutic prospects in targeting the dynamic glycolytic and mitochondrial interactions and between mesenchymal inflammatory cells in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>.</p></sec>

Simultaneous high-resolution pH and spectrophotometric recordings of oxygen binding in blood microvolumes
<p>Oxygen equilibrium curves have been widely used to understand oxygen transport in numerous organisms. A major challenge has been to monitor oxygen binding characteristics and concomitant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> changes as they occur <i>in vivo</i>, in limited sample volumes. Here we report a technique allowing highly resolved and simultaneous monitoring of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> and blood pigment saturation in minute blood volumes. We equipped a gas diffusion chamber with a broad-range fibre-optic spectro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>otometer and a micro-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> optode and recorded changes of pigment oxygenation along oxygen partial pressure (<i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> gradients to test the setup. Oxygen binding parameters derived from measurements in only 15 μl of haemolym<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> from the ce<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>alopod <i>Octopus vulgaris</i> showed low instrumental error (0.93%) and good agreement with published data. Broad-range spectra, each resolving 2048 data points, provided detailed insight into the complex absorbance characteristics of diverse blood types. After consideration of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>otobleaching and intrinsic fluorescence, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> optodes yielded accurate recordings and resolved a sigmoidal shift of 0.03 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> units in response to changing <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> from 0 to 21 kPa. Highly resolved continuous recordings along <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> gradients conformed to stepwise measurements at low rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> changes. In this study we showed that a diffusion chamber upgraded with a broad-range spectro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>otometer and an optical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> sensor accurately characterizes oxygen binding with minimal sample consumption and manipulation. We conclude that the modified diffusion chamber is highly suitable for experimental biologists who demand high flexibility, detailed insight into oxygen binding as well as experimental and biological accuracy combined in a single setup.</p>

Intracellular pH and its response to CO<sub>2</sub>-driven seawater acidification in symbiotic <i>versus</i> non-symbiotic coral cells
<p>Regulating intracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong><sub>i</sub>) is critical for optimising the metabolic activity of corals, yet the mechanisms involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> regulation and the buffering capacity within coral cells are not well understood. Our study investigated how the presence of symbiotic dinoflagellates affects the response of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong><sub>i</sub> to <i>P</i><sub>CO2</sub>-driven seawater acidification in cells isolated from <i>Pocillopora damicornis</i>. Using the fluorescent dye BCECF-AM, in conjunction with confocal microscopy, we simultaneously characterised the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong><sub>i</sub> response in host coral cells and their dinoflagellate symbionts, in symbiotic and non-symbiotic states under saturating light, with and without the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>otosynthetic inhibitor DCMU. Each treatment was run under control (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> 7.8) and CO<sub>2</sub>-acidified seawater conditions (decreasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> from 7.8 to 6.8). After 105 min of CO<sub>2</sub> addition, by which time the external <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong><sub>e</sub>) had declined to 6.8, the dinoflagellate symbionts had increased their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong><sub>i</sub> by 0.5 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> units above control levels when in the absence of DCMU. In contrast, in both symbiotic and non-symbiotic host coral cells, 15 min of CO<sub>2</sub> addition (0.2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> unit drop in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong><sub>e</sub>) led to cytoplasmic acidosis equivalent to 0.3–0.4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> units irrespective of whether DCMU was present. Despite further seawater acidification over the duration of the experiment, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong><sub>i</sub> of non-symbiotic coral cells did not change, though in host cells containing a symbiont cell the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong><sub>i</sub> recovered to control levels when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>otsynthesis was not inhibited. This recovery was negated when cells were incubated with DCMU. Our results reveal that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>otosynthetic activity of the endosymbiont is tightly coupled with the ability of the host cell to recover from cellular acidosis after exposure to high CO<sub>2</sub>/low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>.</p>

Activation of Lung p53 by Nutlin-3a Prevents and Reverses Experimental Pulmonary Hypertension
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Induction of cellular senescence through activation of the p53 tumor suppressor protein is a new option for treating proliferative disorders. Nutlins prevent the ubiquitin ligase MDM2 (murine double minute 2), a negative p53 regulator, from interacting with p53. We hypothesized that cell senescence induced by Nutlin-3a exerted therapeutic effects in pulmonary hypertension (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>) by limiting the proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PA-SMCs).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Nutlin-3a treatment of cultured human PA-SMCs resulted in cell growth arrest with the induction of senescence but not apoptosis; increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>os<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>orylated p53 protein levels; and expression of p53 target genes including p21, Bax, BTG2, and MDM2. Daily intraperitoneal Nutlin-3a treatment for 3 weeks dose-dependently reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>, right ventricular hypertro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>y, and distal pulmonary artery muscularization in mice exposed to chronic hypoxia or SU5416/hypoxia. Nutlin-3a treatment also partially reversed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> in chronically hypoxic or transgenic mice overexpressing the serotonin-transporter in SMCs (SM22-5HTT+ mice). In these mouse models of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>, Nutlin-3a markedly increased senescent p21-stained PA-SMCs; lung p53, p21, and MDM2 protein levels; and p21, Bax, PUMA, BTG2, and MDM2 mRNA levels; but induced only minor changes in control mice without <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>. Marked MDM2 immunostaining was seen in both mouse and human remodeled pulmonary vessels, supporting the use of Nutlins as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>-targeted therapy. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> prevention or reversal by Nutlin-3a required lung p53 stabilization and increased p21 expression, as indicated by the absence of Nutlin-3a effects in hypoxia-exposed p53<sup>−/−</sup> and p21<sup>−/−</sup> mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Nutlin-3a may hold promise as a prosenescence treatment targeting PA-SMCs in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>.</p></sec>

Activation of master virulence regulator PhoP in acidic pH requires the <i>Salmonella</i>-specific protein UgtL
<p>Acidic conditions, such as those inside <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>agosomes, stimulate the intracellular pathogen <i>Salmonella enterica</i> to activate virulence genes. The sensor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oQ responds to a mildly acidic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>os<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>orylating, and thereby activating, the virulence regulator <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oP. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oP/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oQ two-component system is conserved in a subset of Gram-negative bacteria. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oQ is thought to be sufficient to activate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oP in mildly acidic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>. However, we found that the <i>Salmonella</i>-specific protein UgtL, which was horizontally acquired by <i>Salmonella</i> before the divergence of <i>S. enterica</i> and <i>Salmonella bongori</i>, was also necessary for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oQ to activate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oP under mildly acidic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> conditions but not for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oQ to activate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oP in response to low Mg<sup>2+</sup> or the antimicrobial peptide C18G. UgtL increased the abundance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>os<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>orylated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oP by stimulating auto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>os<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>orylation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oQ, thereby increasing the amount of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>os<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>odonor for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oP. Deletion of <i>ugtL</i> attenuated <i>Salmonella</i> virulence and further reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oP activation in a strain bearing a form of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oQ that is not responsive to acidic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>. These data suggest that when <i>Salmonella</i> experiences mildly acidic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oP activation requires <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oQ to detect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> and UgtL to amplify the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oQ response.

A High-Throughput, Field-Based Phenotyping Technology for Tall Biomass Crops
<p>Recent advances in omics technologies have not been accompanied by equally efficient, cost-effective, and accurate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>enotyping methods required to dissect the genetic architecture of complex traits. Even though high-throughput <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>enotyping platforms have been developed for controlled environments, field-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d aerial and ground technologies have only been designed and deployed for short-stature crops. Therefore, we developed and tested <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>enobot 1.0, an auto-steered and self-propelled field-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d high-throughput <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>enotyping platform for tall dense canopy crops, such as sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>enobot 1.0 was equipped with laterally positioned and vertically stacked stereo RGB cameras. Images collected from 307 diverse sorghum lines were reconstructed in 3D for feature extraction. User interfaces were developed, and multiple algorithms were evaluated for their accuracy in estimating plant height and stem diameter. Tested feature extraction methods included the following: (1) User-interactive Individual Plant Height Extraction (UsIn-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>e) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d on dense stereo three-dimensional reconstruction; (2) Automatic Hedge-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d Plant Height Extraction (Auto-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>e) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d on dense stereo 3D reconstruction; (3) User-interactive Dense Stereo Matching Stem Diameter Extraction; and (4) User-interactive Image Patch Stereo Matching Stem Diameter Extraction (IPaS-Di). Comparative genome-wide association analysis and ground-truth validation demonstrated that both UsIn-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>e and Auto-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>e were accurate methods to estimate plant height, while Auto-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>e had the additional advantage of being a completely automated process. For stem diameter, IPaS-Di generated the most accurate estimates of this biomass-related architectural trait. In summary, our technology was proven robust to obtain ground-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d high-throughput plant architecture parameters of sorghum, a tall and densely planted crop species.</p>

Contemporary Assessment of Left Ventricular Diastolic Function in Older Adults
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although age-associated changes in left ventricular diastolic function are well recognized, limited data exist characterizing measures of diastolic function in older adults, including both reference ranges reflecting the older adult population and prognostically relevant values for incident heart failure (HF), as well as their associations with circulating biomarkers of HF risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Among 5801 elderly participants in the ARIC study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities; age range, 67–90 years; mean age, 76±5 years; 42% male; 21% black), we determined the continuous association of diastolic measures (tissue Doppler imaging [TDI] e’, E/e’, and left atrial size) with concomitant N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide and subsequent HF hospitalization or death. We also determined sex-specific 10th and 90th percentile limits for these measures using quantile regression in 401 participants free of prevalent cardiovascular disease and risk factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Each measure of diastolic function was robustly associated with N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide and incident HF or death. ARIC-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d reference limits for TDI e’ (4.6 and 5.2 cm/s for septal and lateral TDI e’, respectively) were substantially lower than guideline cut points (7 and 10 cm/s, respectively), whereas E/e’ and left atrial size demonstrated good agreement with guideline cut points. TDI e’ was nonlinearly associated with incident HF or death, with inflection points for risk supportive of ARIC-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d limits.

With these limits, 46% had normal diastolic function and were at low risk of HF hospitalization or death (1%/y over a mean 1.7-year follow-up), 49% had 1 or 2 abnormal measures and were at intermediate risk (2.4%/y), and all 3 diastolic measures were abnormal in 5% who were at high risk (7.5%/y).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings suggest that left ventricular longitudinal relaxation velocity declines as a part of healthy aging and is largely prognostically benign.

Mammalian pigmentation is regulated by a distinct cAMP-dependent mechanism that controls melanosome pH
<p>The production of melanin increases skin pigmentation and reduces the risk of skin cancer. Melanin production depends on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> of melanosomes, which are more acidic in lighter-skinned than in darker-skinned people. We showed that inhibition of soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) controlled pigmentation by increasing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> of melanosomes both in cells and in vivo. Distinct from the canonical melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R)–dependent cAMP pathway that controls pigmentation by altering gene expression, we found that inhibition of sAC increased pigmentation by increasing the activity of tyrosinase, the rate-limiting enzyme in melanin synthesis, which is more active at basic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>. We demonstrated that the effect of sAC activity on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> and melanin production in human melanocytes depended on the skin color of the donor.

Plant Phenotyping: An Active Vision Cell for Three-Dimensional Plant Shoot Reconstruction

However, the construction of accurate 3D plant models is challenging, as plants are complex objects with an intricate leaf structure, often consisting of thin and highly reflective surfaces that vary in shape and size, forming dense, complex, crowded scenes. We address these issues within an image-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d method by taking an active vision approach, one that investigates the scene to intelligently capture images, to image acquisition. Rather than use the same camera positions for all plants, our technique is to acquire the images needed to reconstruct the target plant, tuning camera placement to match the plant’s individual structure. Our method also combines volumetric- and surface-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d reconstruction methods and determines the necessary images <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d on the analysis of voxel clusters. We describe a fully automatic plant modeling/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>enotyping cell (or module) comprising a six-axis robot and a high-precision turntable. By using a standard color camera, we overcome the difficulties associated with laser-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d plant reconstruction methods. The 3D models produced are compared with those obtained from fixed cameras and evaluated by comparison with data obtained by x-ray microcomputed tomogra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>y across different plant structures. Our results show that our method is successful in improving the accuracy and quality of data obtained from a variety of plant types.</p>

Boron Alleviates Aluminum Toxicity by Promoting Root Alkalization in Transition Zone via Polar Auxin Transport
<p>Boron (B) alleviates aluminum (Al) toxicity in higher plants; however, the underlying mechanisms behind this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>enomenon remain unknown. Here, we used bromocresol green <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> indicator, noninvasive microtest, and microelectrode ion flux estimation techniques to demonstrate that B promotes root surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> gradients in pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) roots, leading to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alkali</span></strong>zation in the root transition zone and acidification in the elongation zone, while Al inhibits these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> gradients. B significantly decreased Al accumulation in the transition zone (∼1.0–2.5 mm from the apex) of lateral roots, thereby alleviating Al-induced inhibition of root elongation. Net indole acetic acid (IAA) efflux detected by an IAA-sensitive platinum microelectrode showed that polar auxin transport, which peaked in the root transition zone, was inhibited by Al toxicity, while it was partially recovered by B. Electro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ysiological experiments using the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) auxin transporter mutants (<i>auxin resistant1-7</i>; <i>pin-formed2</i> [<i>pin2</i>]) and the specific polar auxin transporter inhibitor1-na<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>thyl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>thalamic acid showed that PIN2-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d polar auxin transport is involved in root surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alkali</span></strong>zation in the transition zone. Our results suggest that B promotes polar auxin transport driven by the auxin efflux transporter PIN2 and leads to the downstream regulation of the plasma membrane-H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, resulting in elevated root surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>, which is essential to decrease Al accumulation in this Al-targeted apical root zone. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the role of exogenous B in alleviation of Al accumulation and toxicity in plants.</p>

Scopoletin 8-Hydroxylase-Mediated Fraxetin Production Is Crucial for Iron Mobilization
<p>Iron (Fe) is an essential mineral nutrient and an important factor for the composition of natural plant communities. Low Fe availability in aerated soils with neutral or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alkali</span></strong>ne <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> has led to the evolution of elaborate mechanisms that extract Fe from the soil solution. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), Fe is acquired by an orchestrated strategy that comprises mobilization, chelation, and reduction of Fe<sup>3+</sup> prior to its uptake. Here, we show that At3g12900, previously annotated as scopoletin 8-hydroxylase (S8H), participates in Fe acquisition by mediating the biosynthesis of fraxetin (7,8-dihydroxy-6-methoxycoumarin), a coumarin derived from the scopoletin pathway. S8H is highly induced in roots of Fe-deficient plants both at the transcript and protein levels. Mutants defective in the expression of <i>S8H</i> showed increased sensitivity to growth on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> 7.0 media supplemented with an immobile source of Fe and reduced secretion of fraxetin. Transgenic lines overexpressing <i>S8H</i> exhibited an opposite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>enotype. Homozygous <i>s8h</i> mutants grown on media with immobilized Fe accumulated significantly more scopolin, the storage form of scopoletin, supporting the designated function of S8H in scopoletin hydroxylation. Fraxetin exhibited Fe-reducing properties in vitro with higher rates being observed at neutral relative to acidic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>. Supplementing the media containing immobile Fe with fraxetin partially rescued the <i>s8h</i> mutants. In natural Arabidopsis accessions differing in their performance on media containing immobilized Fe, the amount of secreted fraxetin was highly correlated with growth and Fe and chloro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>yll content, indicating that fraxetin secretion is a decisive factor for calcicole-calcifuge behavior (i.e. the ability/inability to thrive on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alkali</span></strong>ne soils) of plants.</p>

A Virus-Induced Assay for Functional Dissection and Analysis of Monocot and Dicot Flowering Time Genes
<p>Virus-induced flowering (VIF) uses virus vectors to express <i>Flowering Locus T</i> (<i>FT</i>) to induce flowering in plants. This approach has recently attracted wide interest for its practical applications in accelerating breeding in crops and woody fruit trees. However, the insight into VIF and its potential as a powerful tool for dissecting florigenic proteins remained to be elucidated. Here, we describe the mechanism and further applications of <i>Potato virus X</i> (PVX)-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d VIF in the short-day <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i> cultivar Maryland Mammoth. Ectopic delivery of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>AtFT</i> by PVX/AtFT did not induce the expression of the endogenous <i>FT</i> ortholog <i>NtFT4</i>; however, it was sufficient to trigger flowering in Maryland Mammoth plants grown under noninductive long-day conditions. Infected tobacco plants developed no systemic symptoms, and the PVX-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d VIF did not cause transgenerational flowering. We showed that the PVX-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d VIF is a much more rapid method to examine the impacts of single amino acid mutations on AtFT for floral induction than making individual transgenic Arabidopsis lines for each mutation. We also used the PVX-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d VIF to demonstrate that adding a His- or FLAG-tag to the N or C terminus of AtFT could affect its florigenic activity and that this system can be applied to assay the function of <i>FT</i> genes from heterologous species, including tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) <i>SFT</i> and rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) <i>Hd3a</i>. Thus, the PVX-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d VIF represents a simple and efficient system to identify individual amino acids that are essential for FT-mediated floral induction and to test the ability of mono- and dicotyledonous <i>FT</i> genes and FT fusion proteins to induce flowering.</p>

Monitoring of Freezing Dynamics in Trees: A Simple Phase Shift Causes Complexity
<p>During winter, trees have to cope with harsh conditions, including extreme freeze-thaw stress. This study focused on ice nucleation and propagation, related water shifts and xylem cavitation, as well as cell damage and was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d on in situ monitoring of xylem (thermocouples) and surface temperatures (infrared imaging), ultrasonic emissions, and dendrometer analysis. Field experiments during late winter on <i>Picea abies</i> growing at the alpine timberline revealed three distinct freezing patterns: (1) from the top of the tree toward the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>, (2) from thin branches toward the main stem’s top and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>, and (3) from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong> toward the top. Infrared imaging showed freezing within branches from their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong> toward distal parts. Such complex freezing causes dynamic and heterogenous patterns in water potential and probably in cavitation. This study highlights the interaction between environmental conditions upon freezing and thawing and demonstrates the enormous complexity of freezing processes in trees. Diameter shrinkage, which indicated water fluxes within the stem, and acoustic emission analysis, which indicated cavitation events near the ice front upon freezing, were both related to minimum temperature and, upon thawing, related to vapor pressure deficit and soil temperature. These complex patterns, em<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>asizing the common mechanisms between frost and drought stress, shed new light on winter tree <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ysiology.</p>

Artifactual mutations resulting from DNA lesions limit detection levels in ultrasensitive sequencing applications
<p>The need in cancer research or evolutionary biology to detect rare mutations or variants present at very low frequencies (<10<sup>−5</sup>) poses an increasing demand on lowering the detection limits of available methods. Here we demonstrated that amplifiable DNA lesions introduce important error sources in ultrasensitive technologies such as single molecule PCR (smPCR) applications (e.g. droplet-digital PCR), or next-generation sequencing (NGS) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d methods. Using templates with known amplifiable lesions (8-oxo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">guanin</span></strong>e, deaminated 5-methylcytosine, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">uracil</span></strong>, and DNA heteroduplexes), we assessed with smPCR and duplex sequencing that templates with these lesions were amplified very efficiently by proofreading polymerases (except <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">uracil</span></strong>), leading to G->T, and to a lesser extent, to unreported G->C substitutions at 8-oxo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">guanin</span></strong>e lesions, and C->T transitions in amplified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">uracil</span></strong> containing templates. Long heat incubations common in many DNA extraction protocols significantly increased the number of G->T substitutions. Moreover, in ∼50-80% smPCR reactions we observed the random amplification preference of only one of both DNA strands explaining the known ‘PCR jackpot effect’, with the result that a lesion became indistinguishable from a true mutation or variant. Finally, we showed that artifactual mutations derived from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">uracil</span></strong> and 8-oxo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">guanin</span></strong>e could be significantly reduced by DNA repair enzymes.</p>

Contribution of Impaired Parasympathetic Activity to Right Ventricular Dysfunction and Pulmonary Vascular Remodeling in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The beneficial effects of parasympathetic stimulation have been reported in left heart failure, but whether it would be beneficial for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) remains to be explored. Here, we investigated the relationship between parasympathetic activity and right ventricular (RV) function in patients with PAH, and the potential therapeutic effects of pyridostigmine (PYR), an oral drug stimulating the parasympathetic activity through acetylcholinesterase inhibition, in experimental pulmonary hypertension (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Heart rate recovery after a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test was used as a surrogate for parasympathetic activity. RV ejection fraction was assessed in 112 patients with PAH. Expression of nicotinic (α-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor) and muscarinic (muscarinic acetylcholine type 2 receptor) receptors, and acetylcholinesterase activity were evaluated in RV (n=11) and lungs (n=7) from patients with PAH undergoing heart/lung transplantation and compared with tissue obtained from controls.

De novo design of tunable, pH-driven conformational changes
<p>The ability of naturally occurring proteins to change conformation in response to environmental changes is critical to biological function. Although there have been advances in the de novo design of stable proteins with a single, deep free-energy minimum, the design of conformational switches remains challenging. We present a general strategy to design <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>-responsive protein conformational changes by precisely preorganizing histidine residues in buried hydrogen-bond networks. We design homotrimers and heterodimers that are stable above <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> 6.5 but undergo cooperative, large-scale conformational changes when the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> is lowered and electrostatic and steric repulsion builds up as the network histidine residues become protonated. The transition <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> and cooperativity can be controlled through the number of histidine-containing networks and the strength of the surrounding hydro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>obic interactions. Upon disassembly, the designed proteins disrupt lipid membranes both in vitro and after being endocytosed in mammalian cells. Our results demonstrate that environmentally triggered conformational changes can now be programmed by de novo protein design.</p>

Cytosine, but not adenine, base editors induce genome-wide off-target mutations in rice
<p>Cytosine and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenin</span></strong>e <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong> editors (CBEs and ABEs) are promising new tools for achieving the precise genetic changes required for disease treatment and trait improvement. However, genome-wide and unbiased analyses of their off-target effects in vivo are still lacking. Our whole-genome sequencing analysis of rice plants treated with the third-generation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong> editor (BE3), high-fidelity BE3 (HF1-BE3), or ABE revealed that BE3 and HF1-BE3, but not ABE, induce substantial genome-wide off-target mutations, which are mostly the C→T type of single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and appear to be enriched in genic regions. Notably, treatment of rice with BE3 or HF1-BE3 in the absence of single-guide RNA also results in the rise of genome-wide SNVs. Thus, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>-editing unit of BE3 or HF1-BE3 needs to be optimized in order to attain high fidelity.</p>

Cytosine base editor generates substantial off-target single-nucleotide variants in mouse embryos
<p>Genome editing holds promise for correcting pathogenic mutations. However, it is difficult to determine off-target effects of editing due to single-nucleotide polymor<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ism in individuals. Here we developed a method named GOTI (genome-wide off-target analysis by two-cell embryo injection) to detect off-target mutations by editing one blastomere of two-cell mouse embryos using either CRISPR-Cas9 or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong> editors. Comparison of the whole-genome sequences of progeny cells of edited and nonedited blastomeres at embryonic day 14.5 showed that off-target single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) were rare in embryos edited by CRISPR-Cas9 or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenin</span></strong>e <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong> editor, with a frequency close to the spontaneous mutation rate. By contrast, cytosine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong> editing induced SNVs at more than 20-fold higher frequencies, requiring a solution to address its fidelity.</p>

The geologic history of seawater pH
<p>Although <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> is a fundamental property of Earth’s oceans, critical to our understanding of seawater biogeochemistry, its long-timescale geologic history is poorly constrained. We constrain seawater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> through time by accounting for the cycles of the major components of seawater. We infer an increase from early Archean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> values between ~6.5 and 7.0 and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>anerozoic values between ~7.5 and 9.0, which was caused by a gradual decrease in atmos<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>eric <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> in response to solar brightening, alongside a decrease in hydrothermal exchange between seawater and the ocean crust.

<p>KEA4, KEA5, and KEA6 are members of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) K<sup>+</sup> efflux antiporter (KEA) family that share high sequence similarity but whose function remains unknown. Here, we show their gene expression pattern, subcellular localization, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ysiological function in Arabidopsis. <i>KEA4</i>, <i>KEA5</i>, and <i>KEA6</i> had similar tissue expression patterns, and the three KEA proteins localized to the Golgi, the trans-Golgi network, and the prevacuolar compartment/multivesicular bodies, suggesting overlapping roles of these proteins in the endomembrane system. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>enotypic analyses of single, double, and triple mutants confirmed functional redundancy. The triple mutant <i>kea4 kea5 kea6</i> had small rosettes, short seedlings, and was sensitive to low K<sup>+</sup> availability and to the sodicity imposed by high salinity. Also, the <i>kea4 kea5 kea6</i> mutant plants had a reduced luminal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> in the Golgi, trans-Golgi network, prevacuolar compartment, and vacuole, in accordance with the K/H exchange activity of KEA proteins. Genetic analysis indicated that KEA4, KEA5, and KEA6 as well as endosomal Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup>exchanger5 (NHX5) and NHX6 acted coordinately to facilitate endosomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> homeostasis and salt tolerance. Neither cancelling nor overexpressing the vacuolar antiporters <i>NHX1</i> and <i>NHX2</i> in the <i>kea4 kea5 kea6</i> mutant background altered the salt-sensitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>enotype. The NHX1 and NHX2 proteins in the <i>kea4 kea5 kea6</i> mutant background could not suppress the acidity of the endomembrane system but brought the vacuolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> close to wild-type values. Together, these data signify that KEA4, KEA5, and KEA6 are endosomal K<sup>+</sup> transporters functioning in maintaining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> and ion homeostasis in the endomembrane network.</p>

The Persistent Homology Mathematical Framework Provides Enhanced Genotype-to-Phenotype Associations for Plant Morphology
<p>Efforts to understand the genetic and environmental conditioning of plant mor<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ology are hindered by the lack of flexible and effective tools for quantifying mor<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ology. Here, we demonstrate that persistent-homology-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d topological methods can improve measurement of variation in leaf shape, serrations, and root architecture. We apply these methods to 2D images of leaves and root systems in field-grown plants of a domesticated introgression line population of tomato (<i>Solanum pennellii</i>). We find that compared with some commonly used conventional traits, (1) persistent-homology-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d methods can more comprehensively capture mor<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ological variation; (2) these techniques discriminate between genotypes with a larger normalized effect size and detect a greater number of unique quantitative trait loci (QTLs); (3) multivariate traits, whether statistically derived from univariate or persistent-homology-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d traits, improve our ability to understand the genetic basis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>enotype; and (4) persistent-homology-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d techniques detect unique QTLs compared to conventional traits or their multivariate derivatives, indicating that previously unmeasured aspects of mor<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ology are now detectable. The QTL results further imply that genetic contributions to mor<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ology can affect both the shoot and root, revealing a pleiotropic basis to natural variation in tomato. Persistent homology is a versatile framework to quantify plant mor<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ology and developmental processes that complements and extends existing methods.</p>

F-Actin Mediated Focusing of Vesicles at the Cell Tip Is Essential for Polarized Growth
<p>F-actin has been shown to be essential for tip growth in an array of plant models, including <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>yscomitrella patens</i>. One hypothesis is that diffusion can transport secretory vesicles, while actin plays a regulatory role during secretion. Alternatively, it is possible that actin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d transport is necessary to overcome vesicle transport limitations to sustain secretion. Therefore, a quantitative analysis of diffusion, secretion kinetics, and cell geometry is necessary to clarify the role of actin in polarized growth. Using fluorescence recovery after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>otobleaching analysis, we first show that secretory vesicles move toward and accumulate at the tip in an actin-dependent manner. We then depolymerized F-actin to decouple vesicle diffusion from actin-mediated transport and measured the diffusion coefficient and concentration of vesicles. Using these values, we constructed a theoretical diffusion-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d model for growth, demonstrating that with fast-enough vesicle fusion kinetics, diffusion could support normal cell growth rates. We further refined our model to explore how experimentally extrapolated vesicle fusion kinetics and the size of the secretion zone limit diffusion-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d growth. This model predicts that diffusion-mediated growth is dependent on the size of the region of exocytosis at the tip and that diffusion-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d growth would be significantly slower than normal cell growth. To further explore the size of the secretion zone, we used a cell wall degradation enzyme cocktail and determined that the secretion zone is smaller than 6 μm in diameter at the tip. Taken together, our results highlight the requirement for active transport in polarized growth and provide important insight into vesicle secretion during tip growth.</p>

Identification and Characterization of Daurichromenic Acid Synthase Active in Anti-HIV Biosynthesis
<p>Daurichromenic acid (DCA) synthase catalyzes the oxidative cyclization of grifolic acid to produce DCA, an anti-HIV meroterpenoid isolated from <i>Rhododendron dauricum</i>. We identified a novel cDNA encoding DCA synthase by transcriptome-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d screening from young leaves of <i>R. dauricum</i>. The gene coded for a 533-amino acid polypeptide with moderate homologies to flavin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenin</span></strong>e dinucleotide oxidases from other plants. The primary structure contained an amino-terminal signal peptide and conserved amino acid residues to form bicovalent linkage to the flavin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenin</span></strong>e dinucleotide isoalloxazine ring at histidine-112 and cysteine-175. In addition, the recombinant DCA synthase, purified from the culture supernatant of transgenic <i>Pichia pastoris</i>, exhibited structural and functional properties as a flavoprotein. The reaction mechanism of DCA synthase characterized herein partly shares a similarity with those of cannabinoid synthases from <i>Cannabis sativa</i>, whereas DCA synthase catalyzes a novel cyclization reaction of the farnesyl moiety of a meroterpenoid natural product of plant origin. Moreover, in this study, we present evidence that DCA is biosynthesized and accumulated specifically in the glandular scales, on the surface of <i>R. dauricum</i> plants, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d on various analytical studies at the chemical, biochemical, and molecular levels. The extracellular localization of DCA also was confirmed by a confocal microscopic analysis of its autofluorescence. These data highlight the unique feature of DCA: the final step of biosynthesis is completed in apoplastic space, and it is highly accumulated outside the scale cells.</p>

Sucrose Transporter Localization and Function in Phloem Unloading in Developing Stems
<p>How sucrose transporters (SUTs) regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>loem unloading in monocot stems is poorly understood and particularly so for species storing high Suc concentrations. To this end, <i>Sorghum bicolor</i> SUTs SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 were characterized by determining their transport properties heterologously expressed in yeast or <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes, and their in planta cellular and subcellular localization. The plasma membrane-localized SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 exhibited a strong selectivity for Suc and high Suc affinities in <i>X. laevis</i> oocytes at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> 5—SbSUT1, 6.3 ± 0.7 m<sc>m,</sc> and SbSUT5, 2.4 ± 0.5 m<sc>m</sc> Suc. The Suc affinity of SbSUT1 was dependent on membrane potential and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>. In contrast, SbSUT5 Suc affinity was independent of membrane potential and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> but supported high transport rates at neutral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>. Suc transport by the tonoplast localized SbSUT4 could not be detected using yeast or <i>X. laevis</i> oocytes. Across internode development, SUTs, other than SbSUT4, were immunolocalized to sieve elements, while for elongating and recently elongated internodes, SUTs also were detected in storage parenchyma cells. We conclude that apoplasmic Suc unloading from de-energized proto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>loem sieve elements in meristematic zones may be mediated by reversal of SbSUT1 and/or by uniporting SWEETs. Storage parenchyma localized SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 may accumulate Suc from the stem apoplasms of elongating and recently elongated internodes, whereas SbSUT4 may function to release Suc from vacuoles. Transiting from an apoplasmic to symplasmic unloading pathway as the stem matures, SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 increasingly function in Suc retrieval into meta<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>loem sieve elements to maintain a high turgor to drive symplasmic unloading by bulk flow.</p>

Combined Experimental and Computational Approaches Reveal Distinct pH Dependence of Pectin Methylesterase Inhibitors
<p>The fine-tuning of the degree of methylesterification of cell wall pectin is a key to regulating cell elongation and ultimately the shape of the plant body. Pectin methylesterification is spatiotemporally controlled by pectin methylesterases (PMEs; 66 members in Arabidopsis [<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>]). The comparably large number of proteinaceous pectin methylesterase inhibitors (PMEIs; 76 members in Arabidopsis) questions the specificity of the PME-PMEI interaction and the functional role of such abundance. To understand the difference, or redundancy, between PMEIs, we used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to predict the behavior of two PMEIs that are coexpressed and have distinct effects on plant development: AtPMEI4 and AtPMEI9. Simulations revealed the structural determinants of the pH dependence for the interaction of these inhibitors with AtPME3, a major PME expressed in roots. Key residues that are likely to play a role in the pH dependence were identified. The predictions obtained from MD simulations were confirmed in vitro, showing that AtPMEI9 is a stronger, less pH-independent inhibitor compared with AtPMEI4. Using pollen tubes as a developmental model, we showed that these biochemical differences have a biological significance. Application of purified proteins at pH ranges in which PMEI inhibition differed between AtPMEI4 and AtPMEI9 had distinct consequences on pollen tube elongation. Therefore, MD simulations have proven to be a powerful tool to predict functional diversity between PMEIs, allowing the discovery of a strategy that may be used by PMEIs to inhibit PMEs in different microenvironmental conditions and paving the way to identify the specific role of PMEI diversity in muro.</p>

Genomic Basis of Adaptive Evolution: The Survival of Amur Ide (<i>Leuciscu</i>s <i>waleckii</i>) in an Extremely Alkaline Environment
<p>The Amur ide (<i>Leuciscus waleckii</i>) is a cyprinid fish that is widely distributed in Northeast Asia. The Lake Dali Nur population inhabits one of the most extreme aquatic environments on Earth, with an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alkali</span></strong>nity up to 50 mmol/L (pH 9.6), thus providing an exceptional model with which to characterize the mechanisms of genomic evolution underlying adaptation to extreme environments. Here, we developed the reference genome assembly for <i>L. waleckii</i> from Lake Dali Nur. Intriguingly, we identified unusual expanded long terminal repeats (LTRs) with higher nucleotide substitution rates than in many other teleosts, suggesting their more recent insertion into the <i>L. waleckii</i> genome. We also identified expansions in genes encoding egg coat proteins and natriuretic peptide receptors, possibly underlying the adaptation to extreme environmental stress. We further sequenced the genomes of 10 additional individuals from freshwater and 18 from Lake Dali Nur populations, and we detected a total of 7.6 million SNPs from both populations. In a genome scan and comparison of these two populations, we identified a set of genomic regions under selective sweeps that harbor genes involved in ion homoeostasis, acid-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong> regulation, unfolded protein response, reactive oxygen species elimination, and urea excretion. Our findings provide comprehensive insight into the genomic mechanisms of teleost fish that underlie their adaptation to extreme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alkali</span></strong>ne environments.</p>

An Evidence-Based Medicine Approach to Antihyperglycemic Therapy in Diabetes Mellitus to Overcome Overtreatment
<p>Overtreatment is pervasive in medicine and leads to potential patient harms and excessive costs in health care. Although evidence-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d medicine is often derided as practice by rote algorithmic medicine, the appropriate application of key evidence-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d medicine principles in clinical decision making is fundamental to preventing overtreatment and promoting high-value, individualized patient-centered care. Specifically, this article discusses the importance of (1) using absolute rather than relative estimates of benefits to inform treatment decisions; (2) considering the time horizon to benefit of treatments; (3) balancing potential harms and benefits; and (4) using shared decision making by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ysicians to incorporate the patient’s values and preferences into treatment decisions.

Structural insights into ion conduction by channelrhodopsin 2

We present high-resolution structures of ChR2 and the C128T mutant, which has a markedly increased open-state lifetime.

They are connected by extended hydrogen-bonding networks involving water molecules and side-chain residues. Central is the retinal Schiff <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong> that controls and synchronizes three gates that separate the cavities.

Extracellular ATP Shapes a Defense-Related Transcriptome Both Independently and along with Other Defense Signaling Pathways
<p>ATP is not only an essential metabolite of cellular biochemistry but also acts as a signal in the extracellular milieu. In plants, extracellular ATP is monitored by the purinergic receptor P2K1. Recent studies have revealed that extracellular ATP acts as a damage-associated molecular pattern in plants, and its signaling through P2K1 is important for mounting an effective defense response against various pathogenic microorganisms. Biotro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ic and necrotro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ic pathogens attack plants using different strategies, to which plants respond accordingly with salicylate-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d or jasmonate/ethylene-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d defensive signaling, respectively. Interestingly, defense mediated by P2K1 is effective against pathogens of both lifestyles, raising the question of the level of interplay between extracellular ATP signaling and that of jasmonate, ethylene, and salicylate. To address this issue, we analyzed ATP-induced transcriptomes in wild-type Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings and mutant seedlings defective in essential components in the signaling pathways of jasmonate, ethylene, and salicylate (classic defense hormones) as well as a mutant and an overexpression line of the P2K1 receptor. We found that P2K1 function is crucial for faithful ATP-induced transcriptional changes and that a subset of genes is more responsive in the P2K1 overexpression line. We also found that more than half of the ATP-responsive genes required signaling by one or more of the pathways for the classical defense hormones, with the jasmonate-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d signaling being more critical than others. By contrast, the other ATP-responsive genes were unaffected by deficiencies in signaling for any of the classical defense hormones. These ATP-responsive genes were highly enriched for defense-related Gene Ontology terms. We further tested the ATP-induced genes in knockout mutants of transcription factors, demonstrating that MYCs acting downstream of the jasmonate receptor complex and calmodulin-binding transcription activators are nuclear transducers of P2K1-mediated extracellular ATP signaling.</p>

<p>Rapid and cost-effective virus-derived transient expression systems for plants are invaluable in elucidating gene function and are particularly useful in plant species for which transformation-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d methods are unavailable or are too time and labor demanding, such as wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). The virus-mediated overexpression (VOX) vectors <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d on <i>Barley stripe mosaic virus</i> and <i>Wheat streak mosaic virus</i> described previously for these species are incapable of expressing free recombinant proteins of more than 150 to 250 amino acids, are not suited for high-throughput screens, and have other limitations. In this study, we report the development of a VOX vector <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d on a monopartite single-stranded positive sense RNA virus, <i>Foxtail mosaic virus</i> (genus <i>Potexvirus</i>). In this vector, PV101, the gene of interest was inserted downstream of the duplicated subgenomic promoter of the viral coat protein gene, and the corresponding protein was expressed in its free form. The vector allowed the expression of a 239-amino acid-long GFP in both virus-inoculated and upper uninoculated (systemic) leaves of wheat and maize and directed the systemic expression of a larger approximately 600-amino acid protein, GUSPlus, in maize. Moreover, we demonstrated that PV101 can be used for in planta expression and functional analysis of apoplastic pathogen effector proteins such as the host-specific toxin ToxA of <i>Parastagonospora nodorum</i>. Therefore, this VOX vector opens possibilities for functional genomics studies in two important cereal crops.</p>

Time-Course Transcriptomics Analysis Reveals Key Responses of Submerged Deepwater Rice to Flooding
<p>Water submergence is an environmental factor that limits plant growth and survival. Deepwater rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) adapts to submergence by rapidly elongating its internodes and thereby maintaining its leaves above the water surface. We performed a comparative RNA sequencing transcriptome analysis of the shoot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong> region, including basal nodes, internodes, and shoot apices of seedlings at two developmental stages from two varieties with contrasting deepwater growth responses. A transcriptomic comparison between deepwater rice cv C9285 and nondeepwater rice cv Taichung 65 revealed both similar and differential expression patterns between the two genotypes during submergence. The expression of genes related to gibberellin biosynthesis, trehalose biosynthesis, anaerobic fermentation, cell wall modification, and transcription factors that include ethylene-responsive factors was significantly different between the varieties. Interestingly, in both varieties, the jasmonic acid content at the shoot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong> decreased during submergence, while exogenous jasmonic acid inhibited submergence-induced internode elongation in cv C9285, suggesting that jasmonic acid plays a role in the submergence response of rice. Furthermore, a targeted de novo transcript assembly revealed transcripts that were specific to cv C9285, including submergence-induced biotic stress-related genes. Our multifaceted transcriptome approach using the rice shoot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong> region illustrates a differential response to submergence between deepwater and nondeepwater rice. Jasmonic acid metabolism appears to participate in the submergence-mediated internode elongation response of deepwater rice.</p>

A New Barley Stripe Mosaic Virus Allows Large Protein Overexpression for Rapid Function Analysis
<p>Understanding the genetic and molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>s of gene function is of increasing importance to harness their potential to produce plants with novel traits. One important objective is the improvement of plant productivity to meet future demands in food crop production. Gene function is mostly characterized through overexpression or silencing in transgenic plants. This approach is a lengthy procedure, especially in cereals. Plant viral expression systems can be used for rapid expression of proteins. However, current systems have a small cargo capacity and have mostly been used for gene silencing. Here, a four-component barley stripe mosaic virus-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d system with high cargo capacity was constructed for the rapid and stable expression of recombinant proteins in different plant species, allowing function analyses at different stages of development. Fluorescent marker proteins are expressed at high levels within 1 week, and a proof of efficient function analysis is shown using the aluminum malate transporter1 gene. In addition to the ability of gene cotransformation, this work demonstrates that the four-component barley stripe mosaic virus-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d system allows the overexpression of cDNAs of up to 2,100 nucleotides (encoding a protein of ∼78 kD), thereby providing an invaluable tool to accelerate functional genomics and proteomic research in monocot and dicot species.</p>

PaCeQuant: A Tool for High-Throughput Quantification of Pavement Cell Shape Characteristics
<p>Pavement cells (PCs) are the most frequently occurring cell type in the leaf epidermis and play important roles in leaf growth and function. In many plant species, PCs form highly complex jigsaw-puzzle-shaped cells with interlocking lobes. Understanding of their development is of high interest for plant science research because of their importance for leaf growth and hence for plant fitness and crop yield. Studies of PC development, however, are limited, because robust methods are lacking that enable automatic segmentation and quantification of PC shape parameters suitable to reflect their cellular complexity. Here, we present our new ImageJ-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d tool, PaCeQuant, which provides a fully automatic image analysis workflow for PC shape quantification. PaCeQuant automatically detects cell boundaries of PCs from confocal input images and enables manual correction of automatic segmentation results or direct import of manually segmented cells. PaCeQuant simultaneously extracts 27 shape features that include global, contour-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d, skeleton-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d, and PC-specific object descriptors. In addition, we included a method for classification and analysis of lobes at two-cell junctions and three-cell junctions, respectively. We provide an R script for gra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ical visualization and statistical analysis. We validated PaCeQuant by extensive comparative analysis to manual segmentation and existing quantification tools and demonstrated its usability to analyze PC shape characteristics during development and between different genotypes. PaCeQuant thus provides a platform for robust, efficient, and reproducible quantitative analysis of PC shape characteristics that can easily be applied to study PC development in large data sets.</p>

Quartet-Net: A Quartet-Based Method to Reconstruct Phylogenetic Networks
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ylogenetic networks can model reticulate evolutionary events such as hybridization, recombination, and horizontal gene transfer. However, reconstructing such networks is not trivial. Popular character-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d methods are computationally inefficient, whereas distance-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d methods cannot guarantee reconstruction accuracy because pairwise genetic distances only reflect partial information about a reticulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ylogeny. To balance accuracy and computational efficiency, here we introduce a quartet-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d method to construct a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ylogenetic network from a multiple sequence alignment. Unlike distances that only reflect the relationship between a pair of taxa, quartets contain information on the relationships among four taxa; these quartets provide adequate capacity to infer a more accurate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ylogenetic network. In applications to simulated and biological data sets, we demonstrate that this novel method is robust and effective in reconstructing reticulate evolutionary events and it has the potential to infer more accurate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ylogenetic distances than other conventional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ylogenetic network construction methods such as Neighbor-Joining, Neighbor-Net, and Split Decomposition. This method can be used in constructing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ylogenetic networks from simple evolutionary events involving a few reticulate events to complex evolutionary histories involving a large number of reticulate events. A software called “Quartet-Net” is implemented and available at <ext-link>http://sysbio.cvm.msstate.edu/QuartetNet/</ext-link>.</p>

Application of Large-Scale Aptamer-Based Proteomic Profiling to Planned Myocardial Infarctions
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Emerging proteomic technologies using novel affinity-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d reagents allow for efficient multiplexing with high-sample throughput. To identify early biomarkers of myocardial injury, we recently applied an aptamer-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d proteomic profiling platform that measures 1129 proteins to samples from patients undergoing septal alcohol ablation for hypertro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ic cardiomyopathy, a human model of planned myocardial injury. Here, we examined the scalability of this approach using a markedly expanded platform to study a far broader range of human proteins in the context of myocardial injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We applied a highly multiplexed, expanded proteomic technique that uses single-stranded DNA aptamers to assay 4783 human proteins (4137 distinct human gene targets) to derivation and validation cohorts of planned myocardial injury, individuals with spontaneous myocardial infarction, and at-risk controls.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We found 376 target proteins that significantly changed in the blood after planned myocardial injury in a derivation cohort (n=20; <i>P</i><1.05E-05, 1-way repeated measures analysis of variance, Bonferroni threshold). Two hundred forty-seven of these proteins were validated in an independent planned myocardial injury cohort (n=15; <i>P</i><1.33E-04, 1-way repeated measures analysis of variance); >90% were directionally consistent and reached nominal significance in the validation cohort. Among the validated proteins that were increased within 1 hour after planned myocardial injury, 29 were also elevated in patients with spontaneous myocardial infarction (n=63; <i>P</i><6.17E-04). Many of the novel markers identified in our study are intracellular proteins not previously identified in the peri<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>eral circulation or have functional roles relevant to myocardial injury. For example, the cardiac LIM protein, cysteine- and glycine-rich protein 3, is thought to mediate cardiac mechanotransduction and stress responses, whereas the mitochondrial ATP synthase F<sub>0</sub> subunit component is a vasoactive peptide on its release from cells. Last, we performed aptamer-affinity enrichment coupled with mass spectrometry to technically verify aptamer specificity for a subset of the new biomarkers.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our results demonstrate the feasibility of large-scale aptamer multiplexing at a level that has not previously been reported and with sample throughput that greatly exceeds other existing proteomic methods.

Efficacy and Safety of the Use of Non–Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants in Patients With Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation and Concomitant Aspirin Therapy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Current guidelines recommend non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) as the first-choice therapy in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation because these drugs have several benefits over the vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). It is unknown whether these benefits remain when NOACs have to be combined with aspirin therapy. To assess the efficacy and safety of NOACs compared with VKAs in patients with atrial fibrillation and concomitant aspirin therapy, we conducted a systematic review and study–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d meta-analysis of published randomized controlled trials.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A systematic electronic literature search was done in MEDLINE, EM<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>, and Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Controlled Trials for studies including published data of patients ≥18 years of age with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, randomized to either VKAs or NOACs, or receiving aspirin therapy at any time during the study that report all-cause stroke or systemic embolism, vascular death, myocardial infarction, major bleeding, or intracranial hemorrhage as an outcome.

Learning and attention reveal a general relationship between population activity and behavior
<p>Prior studies have demonstrated that correlated variability changes with cognitive processes that improve perceptual performance. We tested whether correlated variability covaries with subjects’ performance—whether performance improves quickly with attention or slowly with perceptual learning. We found a single, consistent relationship between correlated variability and behavioral performance, regardless of the time frame of correlated variability change. This correlated variability was oriented along the dimensions in population space used by the animal on a trial-by-trial basis to make decisions. That subjects’ choices were predicted by specific dimensions that were aligned with the correlated variability axis clarifies long-standing paradoxes about the relationship between shared variability and behavior.</p>

Prognostic Value of Follow-Up Hemodynamic Variables After Initial Management in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Hemodynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variabl</span></strong>es such as cardiac index and right atrial pressure have consistently been associated with survival in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) at the time of diagnosis. Recent studies have suggested that pulmonary arterial compliance may also predict prognosis in PAH. The prognostic importance of hemodynamic values achieved after treatment initiation is less well established.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Our objective was to evaluate the prognostic importance of clinical and hemodynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variabl</span></strong>es during follow-up, including pulmonary arterial compliance, after initial management in PAH. We evaluated incident patients with idiopathic, drug- and toxin-induced, or heritable PAH enrolled in the French pulmonary hypertension registry between 2006 and 2016 who had a follow-up right-sided heart catheterization (RHC). The primary outcome was death or lung transplantation. We used stepwise Cox regression and the Kaplan-Meier method to assess <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variabl</span></strong>es obtained at baseline and at first follow-up RHC.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 981 patients, a primary outcome occurred in 331 patients (33.7%) over a median follow-up duration of 2.8 years (interquartile range, 1.1–4.6 years). In a multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variabl</span></strong>e model considering only baseline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variabl</span></strong>es, no hemodynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variabl</span></strong>es independently predicted prognosis. Median time to first follow-up RHC was 4.6 months (interquartile range, 3.7–7.8 months). At first follow-up RHC (n=763), New York Heart Association functional class, 6-minute walk distance, stroke volume index (SVI), and right atrial pressure were independently associated with death or lung transplantation, adjusted for age, sex, and type of PAH. Pulmonary arterial compliance did not independently predict outcomes at baseline or during follow-up. The adjusted hazard ratio for SVI was 1.28 (95% confidence interval, 1.11–1.49; <i>P</i><0.01) per 10-mL/m<sup>2</sup> decrease and for right atrial pressure was 1.05 (95% confidence interval, 1.02–1.09; <i>P</i><0.01) per 1–mm Hg increase. Among patients who had 2 (n=355) or 3 (n=193) low-risk prognostic features at follow-up, including a cardiac index ≥2.5 L·min<sup>−1</sup>·m<sup>−2</sup>, 6-minute walk distance >440 m, and New York Heart Association class I or II functional class, lower SVI was still associated with higher rates of death or lung transplantation (<i>P</i><0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>SVI and right atrial pressure were the hemodynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variabl</span></strong>es that were independently associated with death or lung transplantation at first follow-up RHC after initial PAH treatment.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Concerted Divergence after Gene Duplication in Polycomb Repressive Complexes
<p>Duplicated genes are a major contributor to genome evolution and phenotypic novelty. There are multiple possible evolutionary fates of duplicated genes. Here, we provide an example of concerted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence of simultaneously duplicated genes whose products function in the same complex. We studied POLYCOMB REPRESSIVE COMPLEX2 (PRC2) in Brassicaceae. The VERNALIZATION (VRN)-PRC2 complex contains VRN2 and SWINGER (SWN), and both genes were duplicated during a whole-genome duplication to generate FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT SEED2 (FIS2) and MEDEA (MEA), which function in the Brassicaceae-specific FIS-PRC2 complex that regulates seed development. We examined the expression of <i>FIS2</i>, <i>MEA</i>, and their paralogs, compared their cytosine and histone methylation patterns, and analyzed the sequence evolution of the genes. We found that <i>FIS2</i> and <i>MEA</i> have reproductive-specific expression patterns that are correlated and derived from the broadly expressed <i>VRN2</i> and <i>SWN</i> in outgroup species. In vegetative tissues of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), repressive methylation marks are enriched in <i>FIS2</i> and <i>MEA</i>, whereas active marks are associated with their paralogs. We detected comparable accelerated amino acid substitution rates in <i>FIS2</i> and <i>MEA</i> but not in their paralogs. We also show <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence patterns of the PRC2-associated <i>VERNALIZATION5/VIN3-LIKE2</i> that are similar to <i>FIS2</i> and <i>MEA</i>. These lines of evidence indicate that <i>FIS2</i> and <i>MEA</i> have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ed in concert, resulting in functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence of the PRC2 complexes in Brassicaceae. This type of concerted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence is a previously unreported fate of duplicated genes. In addition, the Brassicaceae-specific FIS-PRC2 complex modified the regulatory pathways in female gametophyte and seed development.</p>

Root diameter variations explained by anatomy and phylogeny of 50 tropical and temperate tree species
<p>Root diameter, a critical indicator of root physiological function, varies greatly among tree species, but the underlying mechanism of this high variability is unclear. Here, we sampled 50 tree species across tropical and temperate zones in China, and measured root morphological and anatomical traits along the first five branch orders in each species. Our objectives were (i) to reveal the relationships between root diameter, cortical thickness and stele diameter among tree species in tropical and temperate forests, and (ii) to investigate the relationship of both root morphological and anatomical traits with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence time during species radiation. The results showed that root diameter was strongly affected by cortical thickness but less by stele diameter in both tropical and temperate species. Changes in cortical thickness explained over 90% of variation in root diameter for the first order, and ∼74–87% for the second and third orders. Thicker roots displayed greater cortical thickness and more cortical cell layers than thinner roots. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that root diameter, cortical thickness and number of cortical cell layers significantly correlated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence time at the family level, showing similar variation trends in geological time. The results also suggested that trees tend to decrease their root cortical thickness rather than stele diameter during species radiation. The close linkage of variations in root morphology and anatomy to phylogeny as demonstrated by the data from the 50 tree species should provide some insights into the mechanism of root diameter variability among tree species.</p>

Evolutionary and Functional Analysis of Membrane-Bound NAC Transcription Factor Genes in Soybean
<p>Functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence is thought to be an important evolutionary driving force for the retention of duplicate genes. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) membrane-bound NAC transcription factor (NTL) genes. NTLs are thought to be components of stress signaling and unique in their requirement for proteolytic cleavage to free them from the membrane. Most of the 15 <i>GmNTL</i> genes appear to have evolved under strong purifying selection. By analyzing the phylogenetic tree and gene synteny, we identified seven duplicate gene pairs generated by the latest whole-genome duplication. The members of each pair were shown to have variously <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ed at the transcriptional (organ specificity and responsiveness to stress), posttranscriptional (alternative splicing), and protein (proteolysis-mediated membrane release and transactivation activity) levels. The dormant (full-length protein) and active (protein without a transmembrane motif) forms of one pair of duplicated gene products (GmNTL1/GmNLT11) were each separately constitutively expressed in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The heteroexpression of active but not dormant forms of these proteins caused improved tolerance to abiotic stresses, suggesting that membrane release was required for their functionality. Arabidopsis carrying the dormant form of GmNTL1 was more tolerant to hydrogen peroxide, which induces its membrane release. Tolerance was not increased in the line carrying dormant GmNTL11, which was not released by hydrogen peroxide treatment. Thus, NTL-release pattern changes may cause phenotypic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence. It was concluded that a variety of functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ences contributed to the retention of these <i>GmNTL</i> duplicates.</p>

Inference of Natural Selection from Interspersed Genomic Elements Based on Polymorphism and Divergence
<p>Complete genome sequences contain valuable information about natural selection, but this information is difficult to access for short, widely scattered noncoding elements such as transcription factor binding sites or small noncoding RNAs. Here, we introduce a new computational method, called <i>I</i>nference of <i>N</i>atural <i>S</i>election from <i>I</i>nterspersed <i>G</i>enomically co<i>H</i>erent elemen<i>T</i>s (INSIGHT), for measuring the influence of natural selection on such elements. INSIGHT uses a generative probabilistic model to contrast patterns of polymorphism and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence in the elements of interest with those in flanking neutral sites, pooling weak information from many short elements in a manner that accounts for variation among loci in mutation rates and coalescent times. The method is able to disentangle the contributions of weak negative, strong negative, and positive selection based on their distinct effects on patterns of polymorphism and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence. It obtains information about <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence from multiple outgroup genomes using a general statistical phylogenetic approach. The INSIGHT model is efficiently fitted to genome-wide data using an approximate expectation maximization algorithm. Using simulations, we show that the method can accurately estimate the parameters of interest even in complex demographic scenarios, and that it significantly improves on methods based on summary statistics describing polymorphism and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence. To demonstrate the usefulness of INSIGHT, we apply it to several classes of human noncoding RNAs and to GATA2-binding sites in the human genome.</p>

Thermal tolerance breadths among groundwater crustaceans living in a thermally constant environment
<p>The climate variability hypothesis assumes that the thermal tolerance breadth of a species is primarily determined by temperature variations experienced in its environment. If so, aquatic invertebrates living in thermally buffered environments would be expected to exhibit narrow thermal tolerance breadths (stenothermy). We tested this prediction by studying the thermal physiology of three isopods (Asellidae, <i>Proasellus</i>) colonizing groundwater habitats characterized by an annual temperature amplitude of less than 1°C. The species responses to temperature variation were assessed in the laboratory using five physiological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variabl</span></strong>es: survival, locomotor activity, aerobic respiration, immune defense and concentrations of total free amino acids and sugars. The three species exhibited contrasted thermal physiologies, although all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variabl</span></strong>es were not equally informative. In accordance with the climate variability hypothesis, two species were extremely sensitive even to moderate changes in temperature (2°C) below and above their habitat temperature. In contrast, the third species exhibited a surprisingly high thermal tolerance breadth (11°C). Differences in response to temperature variation among <i>Proasellus</i> species indicated that their thermal physiology was not solely shaped by the current temperature seasonality in their natural habitats. More particularly, recent gene flow among populations living in thermally constant yet contrasted habitats might explain the occurrence of eurytherm species in thermally buffered environments.</p>

Day-to-Day Blood Pressure Variability and Risk of Dementia in a General Japanese Elderly Population

Home blood pressure was measured 3 times every morning for a median of 28 days. Day-to-day systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure variabilities, calculated as coefficients of variation (CoV) of home SBP and diastolic blood pressure, were categorized into quartiles. The hazard ratios and their 95% confidence intervals of the CoV levels of home blood pressure on the development of all-cause dementia, vascular dementia (VaD), and Alzheimer disease (AD) were computed with a Cox proportional hazards model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>During the follow-up, 194 subjects developed all-cause dementia; of these, 47 had VaD and 134 had AD.

These associations remained unchanged after adjustment for potential confounding factors, including home SBP. Compared with subjects in the first quartile of CoV levels of home SBP, the risks of the development of all-cause dementia, VaD, and AD were significantly higher in those in the fourth quartile (hazard ratio=2.27, 95% confidence interval=1.45–3.55, <i>P</i><0.001 for all-cause dementia; hazard ratio=2.79, 95% confidence interval=1.04–7.51, <i>P</i>=0.03 for VaD; hazard ratio=2.22, 95% confidence interval=1.31–3.75, <i>P</i><0.001 for AD).

Highly variable chemical signatures over short spatial distances among Scots pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i>) populations
<p>Understanding within-species variability in terpenoid content and composition is highly relevant for predicting species adaptive potential to biotic stresses, but there is still limited information on terpene variations even for widespread species. We studied the foliage content and composition of terpenoids, foliage structure, and carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) contents in <i>Pinus sylvestris</i> L. in four Estonian sites ranging from dry forest to raised bog. In the bogs, samples were taken along the environmental gradient from drier margins towards wetter central parts. A chiral column was used to gain insight into the variation in terpene composition. We hypothesized that terpene contents increase and the composition becomes more diverse in more strongly N-limited sites (greater C/N ratio) and that terpene signatures cluster together in sub-sites with similar conditions (drier/wetter). Altogether 37 terpenes were quantified across the sites. Extremely large variability of terpene contents, 48–62% for monoterpenes and 61–89% for sesquiterpenes, was observed. According to the amounts of α-pinenes and (+)-3-carene, we distinguished two different ‘pine chemotypes’. Contrary to the hypothesis, terpene contents and variability were the greatest in the dry site with the lowest C/N ratio. However, individual terpenoids correlated differently with C or N in different sites, indicating site effects on terpene composition. Moreover, correlations between the terpenoids and C or N depended on the pine chemotype. The sub-sites with different water regime were more strongly clustered together within the site than across the sites. The study demonstrates extensive variations in terpene contents and composition among the populations and over short spatial distances within the populations, suggesting a large among- and within-population adaptive capacity of <i>P. sylvestris</i>.</p>

A sea change in our view of overturning in the subpolar North Atlantic
<p>To provide an observational basis for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projections of a slowing Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (MOC) in the 21st century, the Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Program (OSNAP) observing system was launched in the summer of 2014. The first 21-month record reveals a highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variabl</span></strong>e overturning circulation responsible for the majority of the heat and freshwater transport across the OSNAP line. In a departure from the prevailing view that changes in deep water formation in the Labrador Sea dominate MOC variability, these results suggest that the conversion of warm, salty, shallow Atlantic waters into colder, fresher, deep waters that move southward in the Irminger and Iceland basins is largely responsible for overturning and its variability in the subpolar basin.</p>

Aging increases cell-to-cell transcriptional variability upon immune stimulation
<p>Aging is characterized by progressive loss of physiological and cellular functions, but the molecular basis of this decline remains unclear. We explored how aging affects transcriptional dynamics using single-cell RNA sequencing of unstimulated and stimulated naive and effector memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from young and old mice from two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ent species. In young animals, immunological activation drives a conserved transcriptomic switch, resulting in tightly controlled gene expression characterized by a strong up-regulation of a core activation program, coupled with a decrease in cell-to-cell variability. Aging perturbed the activation of this core program and increased expression heterogeneity across populations of cells in both species. These discoveries suggest that increased cell-to-cell transcriptional variability will be a hallmark feature of aging across most, if not all, mammalian tissues.</p>

A New Phenotyping Pipeline Reveals Three Types of Lateral Roots and a Random Branching Pattern in Two Cereals
<p>Recent progress in root phenotyping has focused mainly on increasing throughput for genetic studies, while identifying root developmental patterns has been comparatively underexplored. We introduce a new phenotyping pipeline for producing high-quality spatiotemporal root system development data and identifying developmental patterns within these data. The SmartRoot image-analysis system and temporal and spatial statistical models were applied to two cereals, pearl millet (<i>Pennisetum glaucum</i>) and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). Semi-Markov switching linear models were used to cluster lateral roots based on their growth rate profiles. These models revealed three types of lateral roots with similar characteristics in both species. The first type corresponds to fast and accelerating roots, the second to rapidly arrested roots, and the third to an intermediate type where roots cease elongation after a few days. These types of lateral roots were retrieved in different proportions in a maize mutant affected in auxin signaling, while the first most vigorous type was absent in maize plants exposed to severe shading. Moreover, the classification of growth rate profiles was mirrored by a ranking of anatomical traits in pearl millet. Potential dependencies in the succession of lateral root types along the primary root were then analyzed using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variabl</span></strong>e-order Markov chains. The lateral root type was not influenced by the shootward neighbor root type or by the distance from this root. This random branching pattern of primary roots was remarkably conserved, despite the high variability of root systems in both species. Our phenotyping pipeline opens the door to exploring the genetic variability of lateral root developmental patterns.</p>

Light Sheet Microscopy Imaging of Light Absorption and Photosynthesis Distribution in Plant Tissue
<p>In vivo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variabl</span></strong>e chlorophyll fluorescence measurements of photosystem II (PSII) quantum yields in optically dense systems are complicated by steep tissue light gradients due to scattering and absorption. Consequently, externally measured effective PSII quantum yields may be composed of signals derived from cells differentially exposed to actinic light, where cells located deeper inside tissues receive lower irradiance than cells closer to the surface and can display distinct photophysiological status. We demonstrate how measured distributions of PSII quantum yields in plant tissue change under natural tissue light gradients as compared with conventionally measured quantum yields with even exposure to actinic light. This was achieved by applying actinic irradiance perpendicular to one side of thallus cross sections of the aquatic macrophyte <i>Fucus vesiculosus</i> with laser light sheets of defined spectral composition, while imaging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variabl</span></strong>e chlorophyll fluorescence from cross sections with a microscope-mounted pulse amplitude-modulated imaging system. We show that quantum yields are highly affected by light gradients and that traditional surface-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variabl</span></strong>e chlorophyll fluorescence measurements result in substantial underestimations and/or overestimations, depending on incident actinic irradiance. We present a method for using chlorophyll fluorescence profiles in combination with integrating sphere measurements of reflectance and transmittance to calculate depth-resolved photon absorption profiles, which can be used to correct apparent PSII electron transport rates to photons absorbed by PSII. Absorption profiles of the investigated aquatic macrophyte were different in shape from what is typically observed in terrestrial leaves, and based on this finding, we discuss strategies for optimizing photon absorption via modulation of the structural organization of phytoelements according to in situ light environments.</p>

Comparative Genomics of the Pine Pathogens and Beetle Symbionts in the Genus <i>Grosmannia</i>
<p>Studies on beetle/tree fungal symbionts typically characterize the ecological and geographic distributions of the fungal populations. There is limited understanding of the genome-wide evolutionary processes that act within and between species as such fungi adapt to different environments, leading to physiological differences and reproductive isolation. Here, we assess genomic evidence for such evolutionary processes by extending our recent work on <i>Grosmannia clavigera</i>, which is vectored by the mountain pine beetle and jeffrey pine beetle. We report the genome sequences of an additional 11 <i>G. clavigera</i> (Gc) sensu lato strains from the two known sibling species, <i>Grosmannia</i> sp. (Gs) and Gc. The 12 fungal genomes are structurally similar, showing large-scale synteny within and between species. We identified 103,430 single-nucleotide variations that separated the <i>Grosmannia</i> strains into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ent Gs and Gc clades, and further divided each of these clades into two subclades, one of which may represent an additional species. Comparing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variabl</span></strong>e genes between these lineages, we identified truncated genes and potential pseudogenes, as well as seven genes that show evidence of positive selection. As these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variabl</span></strong>e genes are involved in secondary metabolism and in detoxifying or utilizing host-tree defense chemicals (e.g., polyketide synthases, oxidoreductases, and mono-oxygenases), their variants may reflect adaptation to the specific chemistries of the host trees <i>Pinus contorta</i>, <i>P. ponderosa</i>, and <i>P. jeffreyi</i>. This work provides a comprehensive resource for developing informative markers for landscape population genomics of these ecologically and economically important fungi, and an approach that could be extended to other beetle–tree-associated fungi.</p>

Progressive Recombination Suppression and Differentiation in Recently Evolved Neo-sex Chromosomes
<p>Recombination suppression leads to the structural and functional differentiation of sex chromosomes and is thus a crucial step in the process of sex chromosome evolution. Despite extensive theoretical work, the exact processes and mechanisms of recombination suppression and differentiation are not well understood. In threespine sticklebacks (<i>Gasterosteus aculeatus</i>), a different sex chromosome system has recently evolved by a fusion between the Y chromosome and an autosome in the Japan Sea lineage, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ed from the ancestor of other lineages approximately 2 Ma. We investigated the evolutionary dynamics and differentiation processes of sex chromosomes based on comparative analyses of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ent lineages using 63 microsatellite loci. Both chromosome-wide differentiation patterns and phylogenetic inferences with X and Y alleles indicated that the ancestral sex chromosomes were extensively differentiated before the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence of these lineages. In contrast, genetic differentiation appeared to have proceeded only in a small region of the neo-sex chromosomes. The recombination maps constructed for the Japan Sea lineage indicated that recombination has been suppressed or reduced over a large region spanning the ancestral and neo-sex chromosomes. Chromosomal regions exhibiting genetic differentiation and suppressed or reduced recombination were detected continuously and sequentially in the neo-sex chromosomes, suggesting that differentiation has gradually spread from the fusion point following the extension of recombination suppression. Our study illustrates an ongoing process of sex chromosome differentiation, providing empirical support for the theoretical model postulating that recombination suppression and differentiation proceed in a gradual manner in the very early stage of sex chromosome evolution.</p>

Drag, but not buoyancy, affects swim speed in captive Steller sea lions
<p>Swimming at an optimal speed is critical for breath-hold divers seeking to maximize the time they can spend foraging underwater. Theoretical studies have predicted that the optimal swim speed for an animal while transiting to and from depth is independent of buoyancy, but is dependent on drag and metabolic rate. However, this prediction has never been experimentally tested. Our study assessed the effects of buoyancy and drag on the swim speed of three captive Steller sea lions (<i>Eumetopias jubatus</i>) that made 186 dives. Our study animals were trained to dive to feed at fixed depths (10–50 m) under artificially controlled buoyancy and drag conditions. Buoyancy and drag were manipulated using a pair of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tubes attached to harnesses worn by the sea lions, and buoyancy conditions were designed to fall within the natural range of wild animals (∼12–26% subcutaneous fat). Drag conditions were changed with and without the PVC tubes, and swim speeds were recorded and compared during descent and ascent phases using an accelerometer attached to the harnesses. Generalized linear mixed-effect models with the animal as the random <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variabl</span></strong>e and five explanatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variabl</span></strong>es (body mass, buoyancy, dive depth, dive phase, and drag) showed that swim speed was best predicted by two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variabl</span></strong>es, drag and dive phase (AIC = −139). Consistent with a previous theoretical prediction, the results of our study suggest that the optimal swim speed of Steller sea lions is a function of drag, and is independent of dive depth and buoyancy.</p>

Southern African ancient genomes estimate modern human divergence to 350,000 to 260,000 years ago
<p>Southern Africa is consistently placed as a potential region for the evolution of <i>Homo sapiens</i>. We present genome sequences, up to 13x coverage, from seven ancient individuals from KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The remains of three Stone Age hunter-gatherers (about 2000 years old) were genetically similar to current-day southern San groups, and those of four Iron Age farmers (300 to 500 years old) were genetically similar to present-day Bantu-language speakers. We estimate that all modern-day Khoe-San groups have been influenced by 9 to 30% genetic admixture from East Africans/Eurasians. Using traditional and new approaches, we estimate the first modern human population <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence time to between 350,000 and 260,000 years ago. This estimate increases the deepest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence among modern humans, coinciding with anatomical developments of archaic humans into modern humans, as represented in the local fossil record.</p>

A human-driven decline in global burned area
<p>Fire is an essential Earth system process that alters ecosystem and atmospheric composition. Here we assessed long-term fire trends using multiple satellite data sets. We found that global burned area declined by 24.3 ± 8.8% over the past 18 years. The estimated decrease in burned area remained robust after adjusting for precipitation variability and was largest in savannas. Agricultural expansion and intensification were primary drivers of declining fire activity. Fewer and smaller fires reduced aerosol concentrations, modified vegetation structure, and increased the magnitude of the terrestrial carbon sink. Fire models were unable to reproduce the pattern and magnitude of observed declines, suggesting that they may overestimate fire emissions in future projections. Using economic and demographic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variabl</span></strong>es, we developed a conceptual model for predicting fire in human-dominated landscapes.</p>

Ecological speciation of bacteriophage lambda in allopatry and sympatry
<p>Understanding the conditions that allow speciation to occur is difficult because most research has focused on either long-lived organisms or asexual microorganisms. We propagated bacteriophage λ, a virus with rapid generations and frequent recombination, on two <i>Escherichia coli</i> host genotypes that expressed either the LamB or OmpF receptor. When supplied with either single host (allopatry), phage λ improved its binding to the available receptor while losing its ability to use the alternative. When evolving on both hosts together (sympatry), the viruses split into two lineages with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ent receptor preferences. Although the level of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence varied among replicates, some lineages evolved reproductive isolation via genetic incompatibilities. This outcome indicates that, under suitable conditions, allopatric and sympatric speciation can occur with similar ease.</p>

Midbrain dopamine neurons control judgment of time
<p>Our sense of time is far from constant. For instance, time flies when we are having fun, and it slows to a trickle when we are bored. Midbrain dopamine neurons have been implicated in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variabl</span></strong>e time estimation. However, a direct link between signals carried by dopamine neurons and temporal judgments is lacking. We measured and manipulated the activity of dopamine neurons as mice judged the duration of time intervals. We found that pharmacogenetic suppression of dopamine neurons decreased behavioral sensitivity to time and that dopamine neurons encoded information about trial-to-trial variability in time estimates. Last, we found that transient activation or inhibition of dopamine neurons was sufficient to slow down or speed up time estimation, respectively. Dopamine neuron activity thus reflects and can directly control the judgment of time.</p>

Climate change: The 2015 Paris Agreement thresholds and Mediterranean basin ecosystems
<p>The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Paris Agreement of December 2015 aims to maintain the global average warming well below 2°C above the preindustrial level. In the Mediterranean basin, recent pollen-based reconstructions of climate and ecosystem variability over the past 10,000 years provide insights regarding the implications of warming thresholds for biodiversity and land-use potential. We compare scenarios of climate-driven future change in land ecosystems with reconstructed ecosystem dynamics during the past 10,000 years. Only a 1.5°C warming scenario permits ecosystems to remain within the Holocene variability. At or above 2°C of warming, climatic change will generate Mediterranean land ecosystem changes that are unmatched in the Holocene, a period characterized by recurring precipitation deficits rather than temperature anomalies.</p>

Auxin Function in the Brown Alga <i>Dictyota dichotoma</i>
<p>Auxin controls body plan patterning in land plants and has been proposed to play a similar role in the development of brown algae (Phaeophyta) despite their distant evolutionary relationship with land plants. The mechanism of auxin action in brown algae remains controversial because of contradicting conclusions derived from pharmacological studies on <i>Fucus</i>. In this study, we used <i>Dictyota</i> <i>dichotoma</i> as a model system to show that auxin plays a role during the apical-basal patterning of the embryo of brown algae. Indole-3-acetic acid was detectable in <i>D. dichotoma</i> germlings and mature tissue. Although two-celled <i>D. dichotoma</i> zygotes normally develop a rhizoid from one pole and a thallus meristem from the other, addition of exogenous auxins to one-celled embryos affected polarization, and both poles of the spheroidal embryo developed into rhizoids instead. The effect was strongest at lower pH and when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variabl</span></strong>e extrinsic informational cues were applied. 2-[4-(diethylamino)-2-hydroxybenzoyl]benzoic acid, an inhibitor of the ABC-B/multidrug resistance/P-glycoprotein subfamily of transporters in land plants, affected rhizoid formation by increasing rhizoid branching and inducing ectopic rhizoids. An in silico survey of auxin genes suggested that a diverse range of biosynthesis genes and transport genes, such as PIN-LIKES, and the ATP-binding cassette subfamily (ABC-B/multidrug resistance/P-glycoprotein) transporters from land plants have homologs in <i>D. dichotoma</i> and <i>Ectocarpus siliculosus</i>. Together with reports on auxin function in basal lineages of green algae, these results suggest that auxin function predates the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence between the green and brown lineage and the transition toward land plants.</p>

An in Vivo Imaging Assay Detects Spatial Variability in Glucose Release from Plant Roots
<p>Plants secrete a plethora of metabolites into the rhizosphere that allow them to obtain nutrients necessary for growth and modify microbial communities around the roots. Plants release considerable amounts of photosynthetically fixed carbon into the rhizosphere; hence, it is important to understand how carbon moves from the roots into the rhizosphere. Approaches used previously to address this question involved radioactive tracers, fluorescent probes, and biosensors to study sugar movement in the roots and into the rhizosphere. Although quite effective for studying sugar movement, it has been challenging to obtain data on spatial and temporal variability in sugar exudation using these techniques. In this study, we developed a gel-based enzyme-coupled colorimetric and fluorometric assay to image glucose (Glc) in vivo and used this assay to show that there is spatial variability in Glc release from plant roots. We found that the primary roots of maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) released more Glc from the base of the root than from the root tip and that the Glc release rate is reduced in response to water stress. These findings were confirmed independently by quantifying Glc release in well-watered and water-stressed maize primary roots using high-performance anion-exchange chromatography. Additionally, we demonstrated differential patterns of Glc exudation in different monocot and eudicot plant species. These findings and their implications on root-rhizosphere interactions are discussed.</p>

Two Tabersonine 6,7-Epoxidases Initiate Lochnericine-Derived Alkaloid Biosynthesis in <i>Catharanthus roseus</i>
<p>Lochnericine is a major monoterpene indole alkaloid (MIA) in the roots of Madagascar periwinkle (<i>Catharanthus roseus</i>). Lochnericine is derived from the stereoselective C6,C7-epoxidation of tabersonine and can be metabolized further to generate other complex MIAs. While the enzymes responsible for its downstream modifications have been characterized, those involved in lochnericine biosynthesis remain unknown. By combining gene correlation studies, functional assays, and transient gene inactivation, we identified two highly conserved P450s that efficiently catalyze the epoxidation of tabersonine: tabersonine 6,7-epoxidase isoforms 1 and 2 (TEX1 and TEX2). Both proteins are quite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ent from the previously characterized tabersonine 2,3-epoxidase and are more closely related to tabersonine 16-hydroxylase, involved in vindoline biosynthesis in leaves. Biochemical characterization of TEX1/2 revealed their strict substrate specificity for tabersonine and their inability to epoxidize 19-hydroxytabersonine, indicating that they catalyze the first step in the pathway leading to horhammericine production. <i>TEX1</i> and <i>TEX2</i> displayed complementary expression profiles, with <i>TEX1</i> expressed mainly in roots and <i>TEX2</i> in aerial organs. Our results suggest that <i>TEX1</i> and <i>TEX2</i> originated from a gene duplication event and later acquired <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ent, organ-specific regulatory elements for lochnericine biosynthesis throughout the plant, as supported by the presence of lochnericine in flowers. Finally, through the sequential expression of <i>TEX1</i> and up to four other MIA biosynthetic genes in yeast, we reconstituted the 19-acetylhorhammericine biosynthetic pathway and produced tailor-made MIAs by mixing enzymatic modules that are naturally spatially separated in the plant. These results lay the groundwork for the metabolic engineering of tabersonine/lochnericine derivatives of pharmaceutical interest.</p>

Parental DNA Methylation States Are Associated with Heterosis in Epigenetic Hybrids
<p>Despite the importance and wide exploitation of heterosis in commercial crop breeding, the molecular mechanisms behind this phenomenon are not completely understood. Recent studies have implicated changes in DNA methylation and small RNAs in hybrid performance; however, it remains unclear whether epigenetic changes are a cause or a consequence of heterosis. Here, we analyze a large panel of over 500 Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) epigenetic hybrid plants (epiHybrids), which we derived from near-isogenic but epigenetically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ent parents. This proof-of-principle experimental system allowed us to quantify the contribution of parental methylation differences to heterosis. We measured traits such as leaf area, growth rate, flowering time, main stem branching, rosette branching, and final plant height and observed several strong positive and negative heterotic phenotypes among the epiHybrids. Using an epigenetic quantitative trait locus mapping approach, we were able to identify specific differentially methylated regions in the parental genomes that are associated with hybrid performance. Sequencing of methylomes, transcriptomes, and genomes of selected parent-epiHybrid combinations further showed that these parental differentially methylated regions most likely mediate the remodeling of methylation and transcriptional states at specific loci in the hybrids. Taken together, our data suggest that locus-specific epigenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence between the parental lines can directly or indirectly trigger heterosis in Arabidopsis hybrids independent of genetic changes. These results add to a growing body of evidence that points to epigenetic factors as one of the key determinants of hybrid performance.</p>

Seasonal Regulation of Petal Number
<p>Four petals characterize the flowers of most species in the Brassicaceae family, and this phenotype is generally robust to genetic and environmental variation. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variabl</span></strong>e petal number distinguishes the flowers of <i>Cardamine hirsuta</i> from those of its close relative Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), and allelic variation at many loci contribute to this trait. However, it is less clear whether <i>C. hirsuta</i> petal number varies in response to seasonal changes in environment. To address this question, we assessed whether petal number responds to a suite of environmental and endogenous cues that regulate flowering time in <i>C. hirsuta</i>. We found that petal number showed seasonal variation in <i>C. hirsuta</i>, such that spring flowering plants developed more petals than those flowering in summer. Conditions associated with spring flowering, including cool ambient temperature, short photoperiod, and vernalization, all increased petal number in <i>C. hirsuta</i>. Cool temperature caused the strongest increase in petal number and lengthened the time interval over which floral meristems matured. We performed live imaging of early flower development and showed that floral buds developed more slowly at 15°C versus 20°C. This extended phase of floral meristem formation, coupled with slower growth of sepals at 15°C, produced larger intersepal regions with more space available for petal initiation. In summary, the growth and maturation of floral buds is associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variabl</span></strong>e petal number in <i>C. hirsuta</i> and responds to seasonal changes in ambient temperature.</p>

Primitive Auxin Response without TIR1 and Aux/IAA in the Charophyte Alga <i>Klebsormidium nitens</i>
<p>The phytohormone auxin regulates many aspects of growth and development in land plants, but the origin and evolution of auxin signaling and response mechanisms remain largely unknown. Indeed, it remains to be investigated whether auxin-related pathways <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ed before the emergence of land plants. To address this knowledge deficit, we analyzed auxin responses in the charophyte alga <i>Klebsormidium nitens</i> NIES-2285, whose ancestor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ed from a green algal ancestor during the evolution of land plants. This strain is the same as <i>Klebsormidium flaccidum</i> NIES-2285, for which the draft genome was sequenced in 2014, and was taxonomically reclassified as <i>K. nitens</i>. This genome sequence revealed genes involved in auxin responses. Furthermore, the auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) was detected in cultures of <i>K. nitens</i>, but <i>K. nitens</i> lacks the central regulators of the canonical auxin-signaling pathway found in land plants. Exogenous IAA inhibited cell division and cell elongation in <i>K. nitens</i>. Inhibitors of auxin biosynthesis and of polar auxin transport also inhibited cell division and elongation. Moreover, exogenous IAA rapidly induced expression of a LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES-DOMAIN transcription factor. These results suggest that <i>K. nitens</i> has acquired the part of the auxin system that regulates transcription and cell growth without the requirement for the central players that govern auxin signaling in land plants.</p>

Hierarchically Aligning 10 Legume Genomes Establishes a Family-Level Genomics Platform
<p>Mainly due to their economic importance, genomes of 10 legumes, including soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>), wild peanut (<i>Arachis duranensis</i> and <i>Arachis ipaensis</i>), and barrel medic (<i>Medicago truncatula</i>), have been sequenced. However, a family-level comparative genomics analysis has been unavailable. With grape (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) and selected legume genomes as outgroups, we managed to perform a hierarchical and event-related alignment of these genomes and deconvoluted layers of homologous regions produced by ancestral polyploidizations or speciations. Consequently, we illustrated genomic fractionation characterized by widespread gene losses after the polyploidizations. Notably, high similarity in gene retention between recently duplicated chromosomes in soybean supported the likely autopolyploidy nature of its tetraploid ancestor. Moreover, although most gene losses were nearly random, largely but not fully described by geometric distribution, we showed that polyploidization contributed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ently to the copy number variation of important gene families. Besides, we showed significantly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ent evolutionary levels among legumes and, by performing synonymous nucleotide substitutions at synonymous sites correction, redated major evolutionary events during their expansion. This effort laid a solid foundation for further genomics exploration in the legume research community and beyond.

High Fitness Costs and Instability of Gene Duplications Reduce Rates of Evolution of New Genes by Duplication-Divergence Mechanisms
<p>An important mechanism for generation of new genes is by duplication-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence of existing genes. Duplication-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence includes several different submodels, such as subfunctionalization where after accumulation of neutral mutations the original function is distributed between two partially functional and complementary genes, and neofunctionalization where a new function evolves in one of the duplicated copies while the old function is maintained in another copy. The likelihood of these mechanisms depends on the longevity of the duplicated state, which in turn depends on the fitness cost and genetic stability of the duplications. Here, we determined the fitness cost and stability of defined gene duplications/amplifications on a low copy number plasmid. Our experimental results show that the costs of carrying extra gene copies are substantial and that each additional kilo base pairs of DNA reduces fitness by approximately 0.15%. Furthermore, gene amplifications are highly unstable and rapidly segregate to lower copy numbers in absence of selection. Mathematical modeling shows that the fitness costs and instability strongly reduces the likelihood of both sub- and neofunctionalization, but that these effects can be offset by positive selection for novel beneficial functions.</p>

Brown and Polar Bear Y Chromosomes Reveal Extensive Male-Biased Gene Flow within Brother Lineages
<p>Brown and polar bears have become prominent examples in phylogeography, but previous phylogeographic studies relied largely on maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or were geographically restricted. The male-specific Y chromosome, a natural counterpart to mtDNA, has remained underexplored. Although this paternally inherited chromosome is indispensable for comprehensive analyses of phylogeographic patterns, technical difficulties and low variability have hampered its application in most mammals. We developed 13 novel Y-chromosomal sequence and microsatellite markers from the polar bear genome and screened these in a broad geographic sample of 130 brown and polar bears. We also analyzed a 390-kb-long Y-chromosomal scaffold using sequencing data from published male ursine genomes. Y chromosome evidence support the emerging understanding that brown and polar bears started to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>e no later than the Middle Pleistocene. Contrary to mtDNA patterns, we found 1) brown and polar bears to be reciprocally monophyletic sister (or rather brother) lineages, without signals of introgression, 2) male-biased gene flow across continents and on phylogeographic time scales, and 3) male dispersal that links the Alaskan ABC islands population to mainland brown bears. Due to female philopatry, mtDNA provides a highly structured estimate of population differentiation, while male-biased gene flow is a homogenizing force for nuclear genetic variation. Our findings highlight the importance of analyzing both maternally and paternally inherited loci for a comprehensive view of phylogeographic history, and that mtDNA-based phylogeographic studies of many mammals should be reevaluated. Recent advances in sequencing technology render the analysis of Y-chromosomal variation feasible, even in nonmodel organisms.</p>

Whole-Genome Sequencing of Tibetan Macaque (<i>Macaca thibetana</i>) Provides New Insight into the Macaque Evolutionary History
<p>Macaques are the most widely distributed nonhuman primates and used as animal models in biomedical research. The availability of full-genome sequences from them would be essential to both biomedical and primate evolutionary studies. Previous studies have reported whole-genome sequences from rhesus macaque (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>) and cynomolgus macaque (<i>M. fascicularis</i>, CE), both of which belong to the <i>fascicularis</i> group. Here, we present a 37-fold coverage genome sequence of the Tibetan macaque (<i>M. thibetana</i>; TM). TM is an endemic species to China belonging to the <i>sinica</i> group<i>.</i> On the basis of mapping to the rhesus macaque genome, we identified approximately 11.9 million single-nucleotide variants), of which 3.9 million were TM specific, as assessed by comparison two Chinese rhesus macaques (CR) and two CE genomes. Some genes carried TM-specific homozygous nonsynonymous variants (TSHNVs), which were scored as deleterious in human by both PolyPhen-2 and SIFT (Sorting Tolerant From Intolerant) and were enriched in the eye disease genes. In total, 273 immune response and disease-related genes carried at least one TSHNV. The heterozygosity rates of two CRs (0.002617 and 0.002612) and two CEs (0.003004 and 0.003179) were approximately three times higher than that of TM (0.000898). Polymerase chain reaction resequencing of 18 TM individuals showed that 29 TSHNVs exhibited high allele frequencies, thus confirming their low heterozygosity. Genome-wide genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence analysis demonstrated that TM was more closely related to CR than to CE. We further detected unusual low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence regions between TM and CR. In addition, after applying statistical criteria to detect putative introgression regions (PIRs) in the TM genome, up to 239,620 kb PIRs (8.84% of the genome) were identified. Given that TM and CR have overlapping geographical distributions, had the same refuge during the Middle Pleistocene, and show similar mating behaviors, it is highly likely that there was an ancient introgression event between them. Moreover, demographic inferences revealed that TM exhibited a similar demographic history as other macaques until 0.5 Ma, but then it maintained a lower effective population size until present time. Our study has provided new insight into the macaque evolutionary history, confirming hybridization events between macaque species groups based on genome-wide data.</p>

Old but Not (So) Degenerated—Slow Evolution of Largely Homomorphic Sex Chromosomes in Ratites
<p>Degeneration of the nonrecombining chromosome is a common feature of sex chromosome evolution, readily evident by the presence of a pair of largely heteromorphic chromosomes, like in eutherian mammals and birds. However, in ratites (order Palaeognathae, including, e.g., ostrich), the Z and W chromosomes are similar in size and largely undifferentiated, despite avian sex chromosome evolution was initiated > 130 Ma. To better understand what may limit sex chromosome evolution, we performed ostrich transcriptome sequencing and studied genes from the nonrecombining region of the W chromosome. Fourteen gametologous gene pairs present on the W chromosome and Z chromosome were identified, with synonymous sequence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence of 0.027–0.177. The location of these genes on the Z chromosome was consistent with a sequential increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence, starting 110–157 and ending 24–30 Ma. On the basis of the occurrence of Z-linked genes hemizygous in females, we estimate that about one-third of the Z chromosome does not recombine with the W chromosome in female meiosis. Pairwise <i>d</i><sub>N</sub><i>/d</i><sub>S</sub> between gametologs decreased with age, suggesting strong evolutionary constraint in old gametologs. Lineage-specific <i>d</i><sub>N</sub><i>/d</i><sub>S</sub> was consistently higher in W-linked genes, in accordance with the lower efficacy of selection expected in nonrecombining chromosomes. A higher ratio of GC > AT:AT > GC substitutions in W-linked genes supports a role for GC-biased gene conversion in differentially driving base composition on the two sex chromosomes. A male-to-female (M:F) expression ratio of close to one for recombining genes and close to two for Z-linked genes lacking a W copy show that dosage compensation is essentially absent. Some gametologous genes have retained active expression of the W copy in females (giving a M:F ratio of 1 for the gametologous gene pair), whereas for others W expression has become severely reduced resulting in a M:F ratio of close to 2. These observations resemble the patterns of sex chromosome evolution seen in other avian and mammalian lineages, suggesting similar underlying evolutionary processes, although the rate of sex chromosome differentiation has been atypically low. Lack of dosage compensation may be a factor hindering sex chromosome evolution in this lineage.</p>

Correcting for Differential Transcript Coverage Reveals a Strong Relationship between Alternative Splicing and Organism Complexity
<p>What at the genomic level underlies organism complexity? Although several genomic features have been associated with organism complexity, in the case of alternative splicing, which has long been proposed to explain the variation in complexity, no such link has been established. Here, we analyzed over 39 million expressed sequence tags available for 47 eukaryotic species with fully sequenced genomes to obtain a comparable index of alternative splicing estimates, which corrects for the distorting effect of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variabl</span></strong>e number of transcripts per species—an important obstacle for comparative studies of alternative splicing. We find that alternative splicing has steadily increased over the last 1,400 My of eukaryotic evolution and is strongly associated with organism complexity, assayed as the number of cell types. Importantly, this association is not explained as a by-product of covariance between alternative splicing with other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variabl</span></strong>es previously linked to complexity including gene content, protein length, proteome disorder, and protein interactivity. In addition, we found no evidence to suggest that the relationship of alternative splicing to cell type number is explained by drift due to reduced <i>N</i><sub>e</sub> in more complex species. Taken together, our results firmly establish alternative splicing as a significant predictor of organism complexity and are, in principle, consistent with an important role of transcript diversification through alternative splicing as a means of determining a genome’s functional information capacity.</p>

The Evolution of Male–Female Sexual Dimorphism Predates the Gender-Based Divergence of the Mating Locus Gene <i>MAT3/RB</i>
<p>The molecular bases for the evolution of male–female sexual dimorphism are possible to study in volvocine algae because they encompass the entire range of reproductive morphologies from isogamy to oogamy. In 1978, Charlesworth suggested the model of a gamete size gene becoming linked to the sex-determining or mating type locus (<i>MT</i>) as a mechanism for the evolution of anisogamy. Here, we carried out the first comprehensive study of a candidate <i>MT-</i>linked oogamy gene, <i>MAT3/RB</i>, across the volvocine lineage. We found that evolution of anisogamy/oogamy predates the extremely high male–female <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence of <i>MAT3</i> that characterizes the <i>Volvox carteri</i> lineage. These data demonstrate very little sex-linked sequence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence of <i>MAT3</i> between the two sexes in other volvocine groups, though linkage between <i>MAT3</i> and the mating locus appears to be conserved. These data implicate genetic determinants other than or in addition to <i>MAT3</i> in the evolution of anisogamy in volvocine algae.</p>

Evolution of Ancient Functions in the Vertebrate Insulin-Like Growth Factor System Uncovered by Study of Duplicated Salmonid Fish Genomes
<p>Whole-genome duplication (WGD) was experienced twice by the vertebrate ancestor (2 rounds; 2R), again by the teleost fish ancestor (3R) and most recently in certain teleost lineages (4R). Consequently, vertebrate gene families are often expanded in 3R and 4R genomes. Arguably, many types of “functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence” present across 2R gene families will exceed that between 3R/4R paralogs of genes comprising 2R families. Accordingly, 4R offers a form of replication of 2R. Examining whether this concept has implications for molecular evolutionary research, we studied insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding proteins (IGFBPs), whose six 2R family members carry IGF hormones and regulate interactions between IGFs and IGF1-receptors (IGF1Rs). Using phylogenomic approaches, we resolved the complete IGFBP repertoire of 4R-derived salmonid fishes (19 genes; 13 more than human) and established evolutionary relationships/nomenclature with respect to WGDs. Traits central to IGFBP action were determined for all genes, including atomic interactions in IGFBP–IGF1/IGF2 complexes regulating IGF–IGF1R binding. Using statistical methods, we demonstrate that attributes of these protein interfaces are overwhelming a product of 2R IGFBP family membership, explain 49–68% of variation in <i>IGFBP</i> mRNA concentration in several different tissues, and strongly predict the strength and direction of <i>IGFBP</i> transcriptional regulation under differing nutritional states. The results support a model where vertebrate IGFBP family members evolved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ent structural attributes to provide distinct competition for IGFs with IGF1Rs, predisposing different functions in the regulation of IGF signaling. Evolution of gene expression then acted to ensure the appropriate physiological production of IGFBPs according to their structural specializations, leading to optimal IGF-signaling according to nutritional-status and the endocrine/local mode of action. This study demonstrates that relatively recent gene family expansion can facilitate inference of functional evolution within ancient genetic systems.</p>

Molecular Evolution of α-Latrotoxin, the Exceptionally Potent Vertebrate Neurotoxin in Black Widow Spider Venom
<p>Black widow spiders (members of the genus <i>Latrodectus</i>) are widely feared because of their potent neurotoxic venom. α-Latrotoxin is the vertebrate-specific toxin responsible for the dramatic effects of black widow envenomation. The evolution of this toxin is enigmatic because only two α-latrotoxin sequences are known. In this study, ∼4 kb α-latrotoxin sequences and their homologs were characterized from a diversity of <i>Latrodectus</i> species, and representatives of <i>Steatoda</i> and <i>Parasteatoda</i>, establishing the wide distribution of latrotoxins across the mega-diverse spider family Theridiidae. Across black widow species, α-latrotoxin shows ≥94% nucleotide identity and variability consistent with purifying selection. Multiple codon and branch-specific estimates of the nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution rate ratio also suggest a long history of purifying selection has acted on α-latrotoxin across <i>Latrodectus</i> and <i>Steatoda</i>. However, α-latrotoxin is highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ent in amino acid sequence between these genera, with 68.7% of protein differences involving non-conservative substitutions, evidence for positive selection on its physiochemical properties and particular codons, and an elevated rate of nonsynonymous substitutions along α-latrotoxin’s <i>Latrodectus</i> branch. Such variation likely explains the efficacy of red-back spider, <i>L. hasselti</i>, antivenom in treating bites from other <i>Latrodectus</i> species, and the weaker neurotoxic symptoms associated with <i>Steatoda</i> and <i>Parasteatoda</i> bites. Long-term purifying selection on α-latrotoxin indicates its functional importance in black widow venom, even though vertebrates are a small fraction of their diet. The greater differences between <i>Latrodectus</i> and <i>Steatoda</i> α-latrotoxin, and their relationships to invertebrate-specific latrotoxins, suggest a shift in α-latrotoxin toward increased vertebrate toxicity coincident with the evolution of widow spiders.</p>

Increased homeothermy during reproduction in a basal placental mammal
<p>Homeothermic endothermy, the maintenance of a high and stable body temperature (<i>T</i><sub>b</sub>) using heat produced by elevated metabolism, is energetically expensive. There is increasing evidence that the earliest endotherms were heterotherms that, rather than maintaining strict homeothermy, allowed <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> to fluctuate with large variations between active and rest-phase <i>T</i><sub>b</sub>. The high level of homeothermy observed in modern mammals is therefore likely to have evolved from an ancestral heterothermic state. One of the hypotheses for the evolution of endothermy is that homeothermy allows for greater energetic output during reproduction (parental care model). We tested this hypothesis by measuring metabolic rates over a range of ambient temperatures in both reproductive and non-reproductive greater hedgehog tenrecs (<i>Setifer setosus</i>), a physiologically primitive mammal from Madagascar. Tenrecs have some of the lowest metabolic rates and highest levels of <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> variability of any mammal and are therefore good models of the ancestral eutherian state. During pregnancy and lactation, there was an increase in metabolism and <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> below the thermoneutral zone, accompanied by a decrease in <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> variability. The lower critical limit of the thermoneutral zone was estimated at ~25°C. However, whereas increases in resting metabolism were substantial below 20°C (up to 150% higher during reproduction), daytime rest-phase ambient temperatures at the study site rarely reached equivalent low levels. Thus, <i>S. setosus</i> provide an example for how relatively low-cost increases in homeothermy could have led to substantial increases in fitness by allowing for the faster production of young. The mechanisms necessary for increases in thermogenesis during reproduction would have further benefited the development of homeothermy in mammals.</p>

Genetic and phenotypically flexible components of seasonal variation in immune function
<p>Animals cope with seasonal variation in environmental factors by adjustments of physiology and life history. When seasonal variation is partly predictable, such adjustments can be based on a genetic component or be phenotypically flexible. Animals have to allocate limited resources over different demands, including immune function. Accordingly, immune traits could change seasonally, and such changes could have a genetic component that differs between environments. We tested this hypothesis in genotypically distinct groups of a widespread songbird, the stonechat (<i>Saxicola torquata</i>). We compared variation in immunity during 1 year in long-distance migrants, short-distance migrants, tropical residents and hybrids in a common garden environment. Additionally, we investigated phenotypically flexible responses to temperature by applying different temperature regimes to one group. We assessed constitutive immunity by measuring hemagglutination, hemolysis, haptoglobin and bactericidal ability against <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. Genotypic groups differed in patterns of variation of all measured immune indices except haptoglobin. Hybrids differed from, but were rarely intermediate to, parental subspecies. Temperature treatment only influenced patterns of hemolysis and bactericidal ability against <i>E. coli.</i> We conclude that seasonal variation in constitutive immunity has a genetic component, that heredity does not follow simple Mendelian rules, and that some immune measures are relatively rigid while others are more flexible. Furthermore, our results support the idea that seasonal variability in constitutive immunity is associated with variability in environment and annual-cycle demands. This study stresses the importance of considering seasonal variation in immune function in relation to the ecology and life history of the organism of interest.</p>

Physiological basis of starvation resistance in <i>Drosophila leontia</i>: analysis of sexual dimorphism
<p>Geographically varying starvation stress has often been considered as a natural selector that constrains between-population differences for starvation resistance (SR) in <i>Drosophila</i> species. On the Indian subcontinent, a dozen <i>Drosophila</i> species have shown clinal variations in SR across latitude, but the evolved physiological basis of such contrasting adaptations is largely unknown. In the present study, I untangled the physiological basis of sex-specific as well as between-population <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence for SR in <i>D. leontia</i>, collected across a latitudinal transect of the Indian subcontinent (11°45′–31°19′N). Secondly, I tested the assumptions that hardening to starvation stress facilitates an increased survival under subsequent lethal levels of starvation, and such plastic effects differ between the sexes. I observed several interesting results. In contrast to a steeper cline of starvation-related traits with latitude in females, a shallower gradient was observed for males. Females stored higher (~1.3-fold) dry-mass-specific levels of body lipids and glycogen contents, and utilized these both of these energy resources under starvation stress, whereas the starved males metabolized only body lipids as a source of energy. Conversely, the rate of body lipid utilization and threshold need were considerably higher in females as compared with males. Between-population differences were significant for storage levels of energy reserves only, but not for other avenues (rate of metabolite utilization and threshold need) of SR for both sexes. These findings indicate that multiple pathways shape the physiological basis of sexual dimorphism for SR in <i>D. leontia</i>. Further, single or multiple bouts of starvation hardening conferred an increased longevity (~4–9 h; <i>P</i><0.001) under subsequent lethal levels of starvation stress for females only, and such plastic responses were consistent with a decrease in rate of metabolite utilization. Nevertheless, between-population effects were non-significant for absolute hardening capacity (AHC=<i>K</i><sub>SR</sub>–C). Altogether, these findings suggest that similar evolutionary constraints have resulted in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ent genetic as well as plastic responses to evolve adaptations under starvation stress, and account for the observed sexual dimorphism for basal SR in <i>D. leontia</i>.</p>

Tight junction protein gene expression patterns and changes in transcript abundance during development of model fish gill epithelia
<p>In vertebrates, tight junction (TJ) proteins play an important role in epithelium formation and development, the maintenance of tissue integrity and regulation of TJ permeability. In this study, primary cultured model gill epithelia composed of pavement cells (PVCs) were used to examine TJ protein transcript abundance during the development of epithelium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confluenc</span></strong>e and epithelium resistive properties. Differences in TJ protein expression patterns and transcript abundance between gill models composed of PVCs and models composed of PVCs and mitochondrion-rich cells (MRCs) were also examined. Marked alterations in TJ protein transcript abundance were observed as cells developed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confluenc</span></strong>e in flask-cultured model gill epithelia. In contrast, during the formation of tissue resistance in insert-cultured epithelia (i.e. epithelia cultured on a permeable substrate), changes in TJ protein mRNA abundance were conservative, despite paracellular marker flux decreasing by orders of magnitude. In both cases significant changes in <i>claudin-8b, -8d, -27b, -28b</i> and -<i>32a</i> transcript abundance were observed, suggesting that temporal alterations in the abundance of these genes are important end points of model gill epithelium integrity. When MRCs were present in cultured gill models, the mRNA abundance of several TJ proteins significantly altered and <i>claudin-10c, -10d</i> and -<i>33b</i> were only detected in preparations that included MRCs. These data provide insight into the role of select TJ proteins in the formation and development of gill epithelia and the maintenance of gill barrier properties. In addition, observations reveal a heterogeneous distribution of claudin TJ proteins in the gill epithelial cells of rainbow trout.</p>

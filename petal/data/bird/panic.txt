Reactivation of recall-induced neurons contributes to remote fear memory attenuation
<p>Whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fear</span></strong> attenuation is mediated by inhibition of the original memory trace of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fear</span></strong> with a new memory trace of safety or by updating of the original <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fear</span></strong> trace toward safety has been a long-standing question in neuroscience and psychology alike. In particular, which of the two scenarios underlies the attenuation of r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emot</span></strong>e (month-old) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fear</span></strong> memories is completely unknown, despite the impetus to better understand this process against the backdrop of enduring traumata. We found—chemogenetically and in an engram-specific manner—that effective r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emot</span></strong>e <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fear</span></strong> attenuation is accompanied by the reactivation of memory recall–induced neurons in the dentate gyrus and that the continued activity of these neurons is critical for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fear</span></strong> reduction. This suggests that the original memory trace of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fear</span></strong> actively contributes to r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emot</span></strong>e <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fear</span></strong> attenuation.</p>

Parsing reward from aversion
<p>Starting from the moment we hear our alarms in the morning, our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emot</span></strong>ions guide the thousands of decisions we make every day. More specifically, it is the valence of our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emot</span></strong>ions that determines our subsequent behavior. Valence is a concept that was originally defined in psychology and corresponds to the value we assign to the perceptions of our external and internal environments (<i>1</i>). Valence varies from negative, when we are afraid or anxious, to positive, when we are happy or peaceful. In the case of the morning alarm, if your <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emot</span></strong>ional state has a positive valence you might jump out of bed, eager to engage with whatever is motivating you. Conversely, if your <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emot</span></strong>ional state has a negative valence, you might choose to stay in bed to Avoid the causes of your negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emot</span></strong>ions.</p>

Facing your fears
<p>Remembering traumatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fear</span></strong>ful events is adaptive. However, treating no-longer-threatening situations as dangerous may be maladaptive and lead to anxiety disorders, including phobias and posttraumatic stress disorder. Central to many forms of therapy designed to tackle these anxiety disorders is the idea that to overcome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fear</span></strong>, one needs to face it. For instance, cognitive behavioral therapy and exposure therapy allow patients to confront the objects or situations that provoke their anxiety in the controlled environment of the therapist's office. With repeated exposures, the patients' anxiety levels gradually decline, and the objects or situations that they once <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fear</span></strong>ed no longer trouble them. On page 1239 of this issue Khalaf <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) provide a neural mechanism in mice for “facing one's <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fear</span></strong>s.” These findings may inform the development of more effective forms of treatment for anxiety disorders.</p>

Unexpected rewards induce dopamine-dependent positive emotion–like state changes in bumblebees
<p>Whether invertebrates exhibit positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emot</span></strong>ion–like states and what mechanisms underlie such states remain poorly understood. We demonstrate that bumblebees exhibit dopamine-dependent positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emot</span></strong>ion–like states across behavioral contexts. After training with one rewarding and one unrewarding cue, bees that received pretest sucrose responded in a positive manner toward ambiguous cues. In a second experiment, pretest consumption of sucrose solution resulted in a shorter time to reinitiate foraging after a simulated predator attack. These behavioral changes were abolished with topical application of the dopamine antagonist fluphenazine. Further experiments established that pretest sucrose does not simply cause bees to become more exploratory. Our findings present a new opportunity for understanding the fundamental neural elements of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emot</span></strong>ions and may alter the view of how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emot</span></strong>ion states affect decision-making in animals.</p>

Insular cortex processes aversive somatosensory information and is crucial for threat learning
<p>Learning about threats is essential for survival. During threat learning, an innocuous sensory percept such as a tone acquires an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emot</span></strong>ional meaning when paired with an aversive stimulus such as a mild footshock. The amygdala is critical for threat memory formation, but little is known about upstream brain areas that process aversive somatosensory information. Using optogenetic techniques in mice, we found that silencing of the posterior insula during footshock reduced acute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fear</span></strong> behavior and impaired 1-day threat memory. Insular cortex neurons respond to footshocks, acquire responses to tones during threat learning, and project to distinct amygdala divisions to drive acute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fear</span></strong> versus threat memory formation. Thus, the posterior insula conveys aversive footshock information to the amygdala and is crucial for learning about potential dangers in the environment.</p>

Synapse-specific representation of the identity of overlapping memory engrams
<p>Memories are integrated into interconnected networks; nevertheless, each memory has its own identity. How the brain defines specific memory identity out of intermingled memories stored in a shared cell ensemble has remained elusive. We found that after complete retrograde amnesia of auditory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fear</span></strong> conditioning in mice, optogenetic stimulation of the auditory inputs to the lateral amygdala failed to induce memory recall, implying that the memory engram no longer existed in that circuit. Complete amnesia of a given <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fear</span></strong> memory did not affect another linked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fear</span></strong> memory encoded in the shared ensemble. Optogenetic potentiation or depotentiation of the plasticity at synapses specific to one memory affected the recall of only that memory. Thus, the sharing of engram cells underlies the linkage between memories, whereas synapse-specific plasticity guarantees the identity and storage of individual memories.</p>

The cerebellum gets social
<p>The cerebellum contains the second main cortex of the brain and ∼50% of the neurons that constitute the brain. Although the cerebellum has long been thought to subserve motor learning and coordination, more recently it has been recognized to take part in cognitive and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emot</span></strong>ional processing. Additionally, evidence for cerebellar involvement in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, and addiction is growing. On page 248 of this issue, Carta <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) extend this theme and show that the cerebellum can activate the ventral tegmental area (VTA). The VTA is a mesencephalic nucleus giving rise to the mesocortical and mesolimbic fiber bundles that release dopamine to the prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum. Dopamine, in turn, plays a fundamental role in cognitive and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emot</span></strong>ional functioning by regulating motivation and reward. This places the cerebellum into the main circuits regulating brain states and social behavior.</p>

Engrams and circuits crucial for systems consolidation of a memory
<p>Episodic memories initially require rapid synaptic plasticity within the hippocampus for their formation and are gradually consolidated in neocortical networks for permanent storage. However, the engrams and circuits that support neocortical memory consolidation have thus far been unknown. We found that neocortical prefrontal memory engram cells, which are critical for r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emot</span></strong>e contextual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fear</span></strong> memory, were rapidly generated during initial learning through inputs from both the hippocampal–entorhinal cortex network and the basolateral amygdala. After their generation, the prefrontal engram cells, with support from hippocampal memory engram cells, became functionally mature with time. Whereas hippocampal engram cells gradually became silent with time, engram cells in the basolateral amygdala, which were necessary for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fear</span></strong> memory, were maintained. Our data provide new insights into the functional reorganization of engrams and circuits underlying systems consolidation of memory.</p>

Breathing to inspire and arouse
<p>Breathing is one of the perpetual rhythms of life that is often taken for granted, its apparent simplicity belying the complex neural machinery involved. This behavior is more complicated than just producing inspiration, as breathing is integrated with many other motor functions such as vocalization, orofacial motor behaviors, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emot</span></strong>ional expression (laughing and crying), and locomotion (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). In addition, cognition can strongly influence breathing. Conscious breathing during yoga, meditation, or psychotherapy can modulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emot</span></strong>ion, arousal state, or stress (<i>3</i>). Therefore, understanding the links between breathing behavior, brain arousal state, and higher-order brain activity is of great interest. On page 1411 of this issue, Yackle <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) identify an apparently specialized, molecularly identifiable, small subset of ∼350 neurons in the mouse brain that forms a circuit for transmitting information about respiratory activity to other central nervous system neurons, specifically with a group of noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) in the brainstem, that influences arousal state (see the figure). This finding provides new insight into how the motor act of breathing can influence higher-order brain functions.</p>

A role for corticotropin-releasing factor signaling in the lateral habenula and its modulation by early-life stress
<p>Centrally released corticotropin-releasing factor or hormone (extrahypothalamic CRF or CRH) in the brain is involved in the behavioral and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emot</span></strong>ional responses to stress. The lateral habenula (LHb) is an epithalamic brain region involved in value-based decision-making and stress evasion. Through its inhibition of dopamine-mediated reward circuitry, the increased activity of the LHb is associated with addiction, depression, schizophrenia, and behavioral disorders. We found that extrahypothalamic CRF neurotransmission increased neuronal excitability in the LHb. Through its receptor CRFR1 and subsequently protein kinase A (PKA), CRF application increased the intrinsic excitability of LHb neurons by affecting changes in small-conductance SK-type and large-conductance BK-type K<sup>+</sup> channels. CRF also reduced inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid–containing (GABAergic) synaptic transmission onto LHb neurons through endocannabinoid-mediated retrograde signaling. Maternal deprivation is a severe early-life stress that alters CRF neural circuitry and is likewise associated with abnormal mental health later in life. LHb neurons from pups deprived of maternal care exhibited increased intrinsic excitability, reduced GABAergic transmission, decreased abundance of SK2 channel protein, and increased activity of PKA, without any substantial changes in <i>Crh</i> or <i>Crhr1</i> expression. Furthermore, maternal deprivation blunted the response of LHb neurons to subsequent, acute CRF exposure. Activating SK channels or inhibiting postsynaptic PKA activity prevented the effects of both CRF and maternal deprivation on LHb intrinsic excitability, thus identifying potential pharmacological targets to reverse central CRF circuit dysregulation in patients with associated disorders.</p>

Subtle modifications to oxytocin produce ligands that retain potency and improved selectivity across species
<p>Oxytocin and vasopressin mediate various physiological functions that are important for osmoregulation, reproduction, cardiovascular function, social behavior, memory, and learning through four G protein–coupled receptors that are also implicated in high-profile disorders. Targeting these receptors is challenging because of the difficulty in obtaining ligands that retain selectivity across rodents and humans for translational studies. We identified a selective and more stable oxytocin receptor (OTR) agonist by subtly modifying the pharmacophore framework of human oxytocin and vasopressin. [Se-Se]-oxytocin-OH displayed similar potency to oxytocin but improved selectivity for OTR, an effect that was retained in mice. Centrally infused [Se-Se]-oxytocin-OH potently reversed social <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fear</span></strong> in mice, confirming that this action was mediated by OTR and not by V1a or V1b vasopressin receptors. In addition, [Se-Se]-oxytocin-OH produced a more regular contraction pattern than did oxytocin in a preclinical labor induction and augmentation model using myometrial strips from cesarean sections. [Se-Se]-oxytocin-OH had no activity in human cardiomyocytes, indicating a potentially improved safety profile and therapeutic window compared to those of clinically used oxytocin. In conclusion, [Se-Se]-oxytocin-OH is a novel probe for validating OTR as a therapeutic target in various biological systems and is a promising new lead for therapeutic development. Our medicinal chemistry approach may also be applicable to other peptidergic signaling systems with similar selectivity issues.</p>

Are hormones a “female problem” for animal research?
<p>One of the most deep-seated misconceptions about the human psyche is that men are simple and women are complicated (<i>1</i>). Gender psychology scholars trace this belief back to at least the 19th century, when the long-standing view that women were inferior versions of men started to fall out of favor (<i>2</i>). In response, biological theories on the sexes were restructured into a narrative that characterized the emergent psychological properties of the female brain—“sensitivity, perceptual acumen, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emot</span></strong>ionality”—as not lesser than, but complementary to, those of men's brains (<i>1</i>). This framed women as a disordered, unstable yin to men's rational, orderly yang, thus preserving the patriarchy. So-called scientific explanations of why women's mental proclivities deviated from men's relied heavily on the purported influence of reproductive physiology on the female mind (<i>3</i>). More than 100 years later, this idea still shapes not just how society perceives women but also how biomedical scientists approach animal research.</p>

Cascading impacts of large-carnivore extirpation in an African ecosystem
<p>Populations of the world’s largest carnivores are declining and now occupy mere fractions of their historical ranges. Theory predicts that when apex predators disappear, large herbivores become less <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fear</span></strong>ful, occupy new habitats, and modify those habitats by eating new food plants. Yet experimental support for this prediction has been difficult to obtain in large-mammal systems. After the extirpation of leopards and African wild dogs from Mozambique’s Gorongosa National Park, forest-dwelling antelopes [bushbuck (<i>Tragelaphus sylvaticus</i>)] expanded into treeless floodplains, where they consumed novel diets and suppressed a common food plant [waterwort (<i>Bergia mossambicensis</i>)]. By experimentally simulating predation risk, we demonstrate that this behavior was reversible. Thus, whereas anthropogenic predator extinction disrupted a trophic cascade by enabling rapid differentiation of prey behavior, carnivore restoration may just as rapidly reestablish that cascade.</p>

The strength of long-range ties in population-scale social networks

Using data from 11 culturally diverse population-scale networks on four continents—encompassing 56 million Twitter users and 58 million mobile phone subscribers—we find that long-range ties are nearly as strong as social ties embedded within a small circle of friends. These high-bandwidth connections have important implications for diffusion and social integration.</p>

Worries about Ebola outbreak grow, despite use of vaccine
<p>There's growing concern about an Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) that surfaced in August and, despite a coordinated response that has included vaccinating more than 40,000 people, persists. Although it's not being formally evaluated, the vaccine appears to be having an impact, says Peter Salama, who coordinates the response for the World Health Organization in Geneva, Switzerland. But the outbreak in the northeastern region of the country is taking place in an area that has long suffered from armed conflict, which repeatedly has brought Ebola response teams to a halt. The outbreak has had some 500 cases, about half of which have resulted in death, making it the second largest Ebola outbreak on record. The largest, which took place in West Africa from 2014 to 2016, was considerably larger—28,000 cases, 11,000 deaths—but there is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fear</span></strong> that if the international community does not do more to help the DRC by sending experienced personnel and more money, the outbreak could continue its spread—and could easily breach borders to neighboring countries. Editorials in two leading medical journals urge the United States government in particular to change a policy that, for safety reasons, bars staff from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from traveling to the DRC and helping in the affected region.</p>

Neurotechnology to address big questions
<p>Emotions, cognition, and consciousness emerge with the processing of neuronal information provided by memory readouts and senses. How this actually works seemed for a long time to be a question too big to ask. Advances in neuroscience have always been driven by methodological inventions, and current efforts to develop neurotechnologies are motivated by experimental strategies, including analytical dissection (that is, inverse engineering), large-scale interrogation, and synthetic reconstruction of the mammalian cerebral cortex (which is important for higher cognitive functions) and connected brain structures (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). As part of this neurotechnological endeavor, mapping the transcriptome of neurons with single-cell resolution and with known three-dimensional tissue localization has been a long-sought enabling technology (<i>3</i>). On page 380 of this issue, Wang <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) present the technology and workflow to access transcriptional states of more than 100 genes from up to 30,000 cells in a cubic millimeter of cortical tissue. This advanced methodology will facilitate studies that improve our understanding of the neuronal hardware and, when combined with other emerging neurotechnologies, will enable big questions in neuroscience to be addressed.</p>

‘Frightening’ typhoid fever outbreak spreads in Pakistan

The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fear</span></strong> is that if <i>S. typhi</i> develops resistance to azithromycin, many people will die from the disease, which leads to bowl perforation and other life-threatening complications in about 15% of untreated people.

Polio outbreaks in the DRC threaten eradication effort
<p>There's an alarming polio outbreak in the Democratic of the Congo (DRC) that you have probably never heard of. Part of the reason is that it is overshadowed by Ebola.

Public health experts have worked for months to stamp out the virus, but it keeps spreading. It has already paralyzed 29 children, and on 21 June a case was reported on the border with Uganda, far outside the known outbreak zone, heightening <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fear</span></strong>s that the virus will sweep across Africa.

Scaling of human brain size
<p>What makes humans unique as a species and as individuals? Our uniqueness stems from language, tool use, reasoning, and other cognitive abilities that are largely mediated by specialized regions of the cerebral cortex. These regions of higher cognitive function have expanded disproportionately during human evolution (compared with nonhuman primates) and during postnatal maturation, when cortical surface area expands threefold between infancy and adulthood (<i>1</i>). Our uniqueness as individuals reflects countless differences in brain structure, function, and connectivity. One basic anatomical difference between similarly aged individuals is a more than 1.5-fold variation in total brain size (and total cortical volume) (<i>2</i>). On page 1222 of this issue, Reardon <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) bring this aspect of individual variability under the umbrella of “differential scaling” by showing that human brains of different sizes do not scale uniformly across all regions. Rather, larger brains show greater expansion in regions associated with higher cognition and less expansion in regions associated with sensory, motor, and limbic (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emot</span></strong>ion- and affect-related) functions.</p>

Interregional synaptic maps among engram cells underlie memory formation
<p>Memory resides in engram cells distributed across the brain. However, the site-specific substrate within these engram cells remains theoretical, even though it is generally accepted that synaptic plasticity encodes memories. We developed the dual-eGRASP (green fluorescent protein reconstitution across synaptic partners) technique to examine synapses between engram cells to identify the specific neuronal site for memory storage. We found an increased number and size of spines on CA1 engram cells receiving input from CA3 engram cells. In contextual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fear</span></strong> conditioning, this enhanced connectivity between engram cells encoded memory strength. CA3 engram to CA1 engram projections strongly occluded long-term potentiation. These results indicate that enhanced structural and functional connectivity between engram cells across two directly connected brain regions forms the synaptic correlate for memory formation.</p>

We classified news as true or false using information from six independent fact-checking organizations that exhibited 95 to 98% agreement on the classifications. Falsehood diffused significantly farther, faster, deeper, and more broadly than the truth in all categories of information, and the effects were more pronounced for false political news than for false news about terrorism, natural disasters, science, urban legends, or financial information. We found that false news was more novel than true news, which suggests that people were more likely to share novel information. Whereas false stories inspired <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fear</span></strong>, disgust, and surprise in replies, true stories inspired anticipation, sadness, joy, and trust. Contrary to conventional wisdom, robots accelerated the spread of true and false news at the same rate, implying that false news spreads more than the truth because humans, not robots, are more likely to spread it.</p>

Paradoxical escape responses by narwhals (<i>Monodon monoceros</i>)
<p>Until recent declines in Arctic sea ice levels, narwhals (<i>Monodon monoceros</i>) have lived in relative isolation from human perturbation and sustained predation pressures. The resulting naivety has made this cryptic, deep-diving cetacean highly susceptible to disturbance, although quantifiable effects have been lacking. We deployed a submersible, animal-borne electrocardiograph-accelerometer-depth recorder to monitor physiological and behavioral responses of East Greenland narwhals after release from net entanglement and stranding. Escaping narwhals displayed a paradoxical cardiovascular down-regulation (extreme bradycardia with heart rate ≤4 beats per minute) superimposed on exercise up-regulation (stroke frequency >25 strokes per minute and energetic costs three to six times the resting rate of energy expenditure) that rapidly depleted onboard oxygen stores. We attribute this unusual reaction to opposing cardiovascular signals—from diving, exercise, and neurocognitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fear</span></strong> responses—that challenge physiological homeostasis.</p>

Neurons that drive and quench thirst

Although regions in the brain that are critical for water intake have been known for more than 60 years, the identification and functional analysis of thirst-related neurons only became possible with the recent advent of genetically targeted photoactivation and photometry, methods that respectively allow manipulation and monitoring of electrical activity in vivo, using fiber-optic microprobes (<i>4</i>–<i>7</i>). On page 1149 of this issue, Allen <i>et al.</i> (<i>8</i>) reveal the existence of neurons that specifically encode the intensity and aversive quality of thirst within the median preoptic nucleus (MnPO) of the hypothalamus.</p>

All of them had attended a funeral and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fear</span></strong>s quickly spread that Ebola had returned to Liberia. But samples were rapidly tested and Ebola ruled out. In fact, the disease, which has sickened 30 people and killed 13, appears to be meningitis caused by <i>Neisseria meninigitidis</i>. The samples of four patients tested at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were positive for the bacterium.</p>

How “you” makes meaning
<p>“You” is one of the most common words in the English language. Although it typically refers to the person addressed (“How are you?”), “you” is also used to make timeless statements about people in general (“You win some, you lose some.”). Here, we demonstrate that this ubiquitous but understudied linguistic device, known as “generic-you,” has important implications for how people derive meaning from experience. Across six experiments, we found that generic-you is used to express norms in both ordinary and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emot</span></strong>ional contexts and that producing generic-you when reflecting on negative experiences allows people to “normalize” their experience by extending it beyond the self. In this way, a simple linguistic device serves a powerful meaning-making function.</p>

Ebola: A postmortem
<p>In <i>The Politics of Fear, </i>experts and aid workers use personal experience and the organization's archives to examine the course of the West African Ebola epidemic and the factors that drove and sustained it. The book focuses on four critical aspects of the epidemic: the public reaction to the outbreak, the organizations and individuals who responded to it, how care was delivered, and the containment of infection. Although vignettes and case studies are included that provide readers with a vivid on-the-ground perspective, it is the book's examination of politics, policies, and decisions that offers critical insight into the epidemic.</p>

Overlapping memory trace indispensable for linking, but not recalling, individual memories
<p>Memories are not stored in isolation from other memories but are integrated into associative networks. However, the mechanisms underlying memory association remain elusive. Using two amygdala-dependent behavioral paradigms—conditioned taste aversion (CTA) and auditory-cued <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fear</span></strong> conditioning (AFC)—in mice, we found that presenting the conditioned stimulus used for the CTA task triggered the conditioned response of the AFC task after natural coreactivation of the memories. This was accompanied through an increase in the overlapping neuronal ensemble in the basolateral amygdala. Silencing of the overlapping ensemble suppressed CTA retrieval-induced freezing. However, retrieval of the original CTA or AFC memory was not affected. A small population of coshared neurons thus mediates the link between memories. They are not necessary for recalling individual memories.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Molecular Evolution of α-Latrotoxin, the Exceptionally Potent Vertebrate Neurotoxin in Black Widow Spider Venom
<p>Black widow spiders (members of the genus <i>Latrodectus</i>) are widely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fear</span></strong>ed because of their potent neurotoxic venom. α-Latrotoxin is the vertebrate-specific toxin responsible for the dramatic effects of black widow envenomation. The evolution of this toxin is enigmatic because only two α-latrotoxin sequences are known. In this study, ∼4 kb α-latrotoxin sequences and their homologs were characterized from a diversity of <i>Latrodectus</i> species, and representatives of <i>Steatoda</i> and <i>Parasteatoda</i>, establishing the wide distribution of latrotoxins across the mega-diverse spider family Theridiidae. Across black widow species, α-latrotoxin shows ≥94% nucleotide identity and variability consistent with purifying selection. Multiple codon and branch-specific estimates of the nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution rate ratio also suggest a long history of purifying selection has acted on α-latrotoxin across <i>Latrodectus</i> and <i>Steatoda</i>. However, α-latrotoxin is highly divergent in amino acid sequence between these genera, with 68.7% of protein differences involving non-conservative substitutions, evidence for positive selection on its physiochemical properties and particular codons, and an elevated rate of nonsynonymous substitutions along α-latrotoxin’s <i>Latrodectus</i> branch. Such variation likely explains the efficacy of red-back spider, <i>L. hasselti</i>, antivenom in treating bites from other <i>Latrodectus</i> species, and the weaker neurotoxic symptoms associated with <i>Steatoda</i> and <i>Parasteatoda</i> bites. Long-term purifying selection on α-latrotoxin indicates its functional importance in black widow venom, even though vertebrates are a small fraction of their diet. The greater differences between <i>Latrodectus</i> and <i>Steatoda</i> α-latrotoxin, and their relationships to invertebrate-specific latrotoxins, suggest a shift in α-latrotoxin toward increased vertebrate toxicity coincident with the evolution of widow spiders.</p>

Persistent Long-Term Structural, Functional, and Metabolic Changes After Stress-Induced (Takotsubo) Cardiomyopathy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is an increasingly recognized acute heart failure syndrome precipitated by intense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emot</span></strong>ional stress. Although there is an apparent rapid and spontaneous recovery of left ventricular ejection fraction, the long-term clinical and functional consequences of takotsubo cardiomyopathy are ill-defined.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In an observational case-control study, we recruited 37 patients with prior (>12-month) takotsubo cardiomyopathy, and 37 age-, sex-, and comorbidity-matched control subjects. Patients completed the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire. All participants underwent detailed clinical phenotypic characterization, including serum biomarker analysis, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, echocardiography, and cardiac magnetic resonance including cardiac <sup>31</sup>P-spectroscopy.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Participants were predominantly middle-age (64±11 years) women (97%). Although takotsubo cardiomyopathy occurred 20 (range 13–39) months before the study, the majority (88%) of patients had persisting symptoms compatible with heart failure (median of 13 [range 0–76] in the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire) and cardiac limitation on exercise testing (reduced peak oxygen consumption, 24±1.3 versus 31±1.3 mL/kg/min, <i>P</i><0.001; increased VE/V<sc>co</sc><sub>2</sub> slope, 31±1 versus 26±1, <i>P</i>=0.002). Despite normal left ventricular ejection fraction and serum biomarkers, patients with prior takotsubo cardiomyopathy had impaired cardiac deformation indices (reduced apical circumferential strain, −16±1.0 versus −23±1.5%, <i>P</i><0.001; global longitudinal strain, −17±1 versus −20±1%, <i>P</i>=0.006), increased native T1 mapping values (1264±10 versus 1184±10 ms, <i>P</i><0.001), and impaired cardiac energetic status (phosphocreatine/γ-adenosine triphosphate ratio, 1.3±0.1 versus 1.9±0.1, <i>P</i><0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In contrast to previous perceptions, takotsubo cardiomyopathy has long-lasting clinical consequences, including demonstrable symptomatic and functional impairment associated with persistent subclinical cardiac dysfunction. Taken together our findings demonstrate that after takotsubo cardiomyopathy, patients develop a persistent, long-term heart failure phenotype.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

NDH-PSI Supercomplex Assembly Precedes Full Assembly of the NDH Complex in Chloroplast
<p>The chloroplast NADH dehydrogenase-like (NDH) complex is structurally similar to respiratory complex I and mediates PSI cyclic electron flow. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), chloroplast NDH is composed of at least 29 subunits and associates with two copies of PSI to form the NDH-PSI supercomplex. Here, we found that CHLORORESPIRATORY REDUCTION3 (CRR3) is an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y factor required for the accumulation of subcomplex B (SubB) of chloroplast NDH. In Suc density gradient centrifugation, CRR3 was detected in three protein complexes. Accumulation of the largest peak III complex was impaired in mutants defective in the SubB subunits PnsB2-PnsB5. The oligomeric form of CRR3 likely functions to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>e the core of SubB to form the peak III complex as an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y intermediate. A defect in the PnsL3 subunit increased the level of the peak III complex, suggesting that CRR3 was released from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y intermediate after PnsL3 binding. Unlike PnsB2-PnsB5 and PnsL3, PnsB1 was not absolutely necessary for stabilizing SubB. PnsB1 is likely incorporated into the intermediate at the final step during SubB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y. Lhca6 is a linker protein mediating NDH-PSI supercomplex formation, and its site of contact with NDH was suggested to be SubB. In the <i>lhca6</i> mutant, accumulation of the peak III complex was impaired, suggesting that SubB interacted with Lhca6 during the step of SubB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y. The process of supercomplex formation was triggered before the completion of the NDH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y. Consistent with its predicted function, CRR3 accumulated in young leaves, where the NDH complex was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>ed.</p>

De novo assembly of the <i>Aedes aegypti</i> genome using Hi-C yields chromosome-length scaffolds
<p>The Zika outbreak, spread by the <i>Aedes aegypti</i> mosquito, highlights the need to create high-quality <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>ies of large genomes in a rapid and cost-effective way. Here we combine Hi-C data with existing draft <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>ies to generate chromosome-length scaffolds. We validate this method by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>ing a human genome, de novo, from short reads alone (67× coverage). We then combine our method with draft sequences to create genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>ies of the mosquito disease vectors <i>Ae</i>.<i> aegypti</i> and <i>Culex quinquefasciatus</i>, each consisting of three scaffolds corresponding to the three chromosomes in each species. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>ies indicate that almost all genomic rearrangements among these species occur within, rather than between, chromosome arms.

MoChlo: A Versatile, Modular Cloning Toolbox for Chloroplast Biotechnology
<p>Plant synthetic biology is a rapidly evolving field with new tools constantly emerging to drive innovation. Of particular interest is the application of synthetic biology to chloroplast biotechnology to generate plants capable of producing new metabolites, vaccines, biofuels, and high-value chemicals. Progress made in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y of large DNA molecules, composing multiple transcriptional units, has significantly aided in the ability to rapidly construct novel vectors for genetic engineering. In particular, Golden Gate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y has provided a facile molecular tool for standardized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y of synthetic genetic elements into larger DNA constructs. In this work, a complete modular chloroplast cloning system, MoChlo, was developed and validated for fast and flexible chloroplast engineering in plants. A library of 128 standardized chloroplast-specific parts (47 promoters, 38 5′ untranslated regions [5′UTRs], nine promoter:5′UTR fusions, 10 3′UTRs, 14 genes of interest, and 10 chloroplast-specific destination vectors) were mined from the literature and modified for use in MoChlo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y, along with chloroplast-specific destination vectors. The strategy was validated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>ing synthetic operons of various sizes and determining the efficiency of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y. This method was successfully used to generate chloroplast transformation vectors containing up to seven transcriptional units in a single vector (∼10.6-kb synthetic operon). To enable researchers with limited resources to engage in chloroplast biotechnology, and to accelerate progress in the field, the entire kit, as described, is available through Addgene at minimal cost. Thus, the MoChlo kit represents a valuable tool for fast and flexible design of heterologous metabolic pathways for plastid metabolic engineering.</p>

Characterization of Trichome-Expressed BAHD Acyltransferases in <i>Petunia axillaris</i> Reveals Distinct Acylsugar Assembly Mechanisms within the Solanaceae
<p>Acylsugars are synthesized in the glandular trichomes of the Solanaceae family and are implicated in protection against abiotic and biotic stress. Acylsugars are composed of either sucrose or glucose esterified with varying numbers of acyl chains of differing length. In tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>), acylsugar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y requires four acylsugar acyltransferases (ASATs) of the BAHD superfamily. Tomato ASATs catalyze the sequential esterification of acyl-coenzyme A thioesters to the R4, R3, R3′, and R2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ions of sucrose, yielding a tetra-acylsucrose. <i>Petunia</i> spp. synthesize acylsugars that are structurally distinct from those of tomato. To explore the mechanisms underlying this chemical diversity, a <i>Petunia</i> <i>axillaris</i> transcriptome was mined for trichome preferentially expressed BAHDs. A combination of phylogenetic analyses, gene silencing, and biochemical analyses coupled with structural elucidation of metabolites revealed that acylsugar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y is not conserved between tomato and petunia. In <i>P. axillaris</i>, tetra-acylsucrose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y occurs through the action of four ASATs, which catalyze sequential addition of acyl groups to the R2, R4, R3, and R6 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ions. Notably, in <i>P. axillaris</i>, PaxASAT1 and PaxASAT4 catalyze the acylation of the R2 and R6 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ions of sucrose, respectively, and no clear orthologs exist in tomato. Similarly, petunia acylsugars lack an acyl group at the R3′ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion, and congruently, an ortholog of SlASAT3, which catalyzes acylation at the R3′ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion in tomato, is absent in <i>P. axillaris</i>. Furthermore, where putative orthologous relationships of ASATs are predicted between tomato and petunia, these are not supported by biochemical assays. Overall, these data demonstrate the considerable evolutionary plasticity of acylsugar biosynthesis.</p>

Complex signal processing in synthetic gene circuits using cooperative regulatory assemblies
<p>Eukaryotic genes are regulated by multivalent transcription factor complexes. Through cooperative self-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y, these complexes perform nonlinear regulatory operations involved in cellular decision-making and signal processing. In this study, we apply this design principle to synthetic networks, testing whether engineered cooperative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>ies can program nonlinear gene circuit behavior in yeast. Using a model-guided approach, we show that specifying the strength and number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y subunits enables predictive tuning between linear and nonlinear regulatory responses for single- and multi-input circuits. We demonstrate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>ies can be adjusted to control circuit dynamics. We harness this capability to engineer circuits that perform dynamic filtering, enabling frequency-dependent decoding in cell populations.

High-resolution comparative analysis of great ape genomes

RPA binds histone H3-H4 and functions in DNA replication–coupled nucleosome assembly
<p>DNA replication–coupled nucleosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y is essential to maintain genome integrity and retain epigenetic information. Multiple involved histone chaperones have been identified, but how nucleosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y is coupled to DNA replication remains elusive. Here we show that replication protein A (RPA), an essential replisome component that binds single-stranded DNA, has a role in replication-coupled nucleosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y. RPA directly binds free H3-H4. Assays using a synthetic sequence that mimics freshly unwound single-stranded DNA at replication fork showed that RPA promotes DNA-(H3-H4) complex formation immediately adjacent to double-stranded DNA. Further, an RPA mutant defective in H3-H4 binding exhibited attenuated nucleosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y on nascent chromatin. Thus, we propose that RPA functions as a platform for targeting histone de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion to replication fork, through which RPA couples nucleosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y with ongoing DNA replication.</p>

VAMP721 Conformations Unmask an Extended Motif for K<sup>+</sup> Channel Binding and Gating Control
<p>Soluble <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins play a major role in membrane fusion and contribute to cell expansion, signaling, and polar growth in plants. The SNARE SYP121 of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> that facilitates vesicle fusion at the plasma membrane also binds with, and regulates, K<sup>+</sup> channels already present at the plasma membrane to affect K<sup>+</sup> uptake and K<sup>+</sup>-dependent growth. Here, we report that its cognate partner VAMP721, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>es with SYP121 to drive membrane fusion, binds to the KAT1 K<sup>+</sup> channel via two sites on the protein, only one of which contributes to channel-gating control. Binding to the VAMP721 SNARE domain suppressed channel gating. By contrast, interaction with the amino-terminal longin domain conferred specificity on VAMP721 binding without influencing gating. Channel binding was defined by a linear motif within the longin domain. The SNARE domain is thought to wrap around this structure when not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>ed with SYP121 in the SNARE complex. Fluorescence lifetime analysis showed that mutations within this motif, which suppressed channel binding and its effects on gating, also altered the conformational displacement between the VAMP721 SNARE and longin domains. The presence of these two channel-binding sites on VAMP721, one also required for SNARE complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y, implies a well-defined sequence of events coordinating K<sup>+</sup> uptake and the final stages of vesicle traffic. It suggests that binding begins with VAMP721, and subsequently with SYP121, thereby coordinating K<sup>+</sup> channel gating during SNARE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y and vesicle fusion. Thus, our findings also are consistent with the idea that the K<sup>+</sup> channels are nucleation points for SNARE complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y.</p>

Mitotic chromosome assembly despite nucleosome depletion in <i>Xenopus</i> egg extracts
<p>The nucleosome is the fundamental structural unit of eukaryotic chromatin. During mitosis, duplicated nucleosome fibers are organized into a pair of rod-shaped structures (chromatids) within a mitotic chromosome. However, it remains unclear whether nucleosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y is indeed an essential prerequisite for mitotic chromosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y.

The resultant “nucleosome-depleted” chromatids contained discrete central axes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive for condensins, although they were more fragile than normal nucleosome-containing chromatids. Combinatorial depletion experiments underscored the central importance of condensins in mitotic chromosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y, which sheds light on their functional cross-talk with nucleosomes in this process.</p>

ANGUSTIFOLIA Regulates Actin Filament Alignment for Nuclear Positioning in Leaves
<p>During dark adaptation, plant nuclei move centripetally toward the midplane of the leaf blade; thus, the nuclei on both the adaxial and abaxial sides become <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioned at the inner periclinal walls of cells. This centripetal nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning implies that a characteristic cell polarity exists within a leaf, but little is known about the mechanism underlying this process. Here, we show that ANGUSTIFOLIA (AN) and ACTIN7 regulate centripetal nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves. Two mutants defective in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning of nuclei in the dark were isolated and designated as <i>unusual nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning1</i> (<i>unp1</i>) and <i>unp2</i>. In the dark, nuclei of <i>unp1</i> were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioned at the anticlinal walls of adaxial and abaxial mesophyll cells and abaxial pavement cells, whereas the nuclei of <i>unp2</i> were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioned at the anticlinal walls of mesophyll and pavement cells on both the adaxial and abaxial sides. <i>unp1</i> was caused by a dominant-negative mutation in <i>ACTIN7</i>, and <i>unp2</i> resulted from a recessive mutation in <i>AN</i>. Actin filaments in <i>unp1</i> were fragmented and reduced in number, which led to pleiotropic defects in nuclear morphology, cytoplasmic streaming, and plant growth. The mutation in <i>AN</i> caused aberrant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning of nuclei-associated actin filaments at the anticlinal walls. AN was detected in the cytosol, where it interacted physically with plant-specific dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinases (DYRKPs) and itself. The DYRK inhibitor (1<i>Z</i>)-1-(3-ethyl-5-hydroxy-2(3<i>H</i>)-benzothiazolylidene)-2-propanone significantly inhibited dark-induced nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning. Collectively, these results suggest that the AN-DYRKP complex regulates the alignment of actin filaments during centripetal nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning in leaf cells.</p>

Atomic structures of low-complexity protein segments reveal kinked β sheets that assemble networks

To illuminate these forces, we determined the atomic structures of five segments from protein low-complexity domains associated with membraneless <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>ies. Their common structural feature is the stacking of segments into kinked β sheets that pair into protofilaments. Unlike steric zippers of amyloid fibrils, the kinked sheets interact weakly through polar atoms and aromatic side chains. By computationally threading the human proteome on our kinked structures, we identified hundreds of low-complexity segments potentially capable of forming such interactions. These segments are found in proteins as diverse as RNA binders, nuclear pore proteins, and keratins, which are known to form networks and localize to membraneless <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>ies.</p>

Roles of RbcX in Carboxysome Biosynthesis in the Cyanobacterium <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> PCC7942

Crystallizing a memory
<p>What is the physical basis of memory? What does it take to retrieve a memory in the brain? What would it take to activate or erase memories? In the early 20th century, the German zoologist Richard Semon coined the term “engram” to denote the physical manifestation of a memory in the brain (<i>1</i>). Two decades later, Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ed a physiological correlate for learning and recollection: The process of learning strengthens the connections, or synapses, between neurons, which leads to the development of brain-wide cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>ies that undergo changes in their structural and functional connectivity (<i>2</i>). The coordinated activity of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>ies—called ensembles, traces, or engrams—that occurs during learning (memory formation) is thought to be reengaged during recall and thereby forms a stable neuronal correlate of memory (<i>2</i>). As subsequent memories are formed, the dynamics of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>ies evolve and provide preexisting scaffolds to influence how the brain processes the variety of memories an organism forms. Studies by Abdou <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) on page 1227 of this issue and by Choi <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) develop new technologies to visualize discrete engrams in the brain and modulate them in a synapse-specific manner to understand memory strength and memory restoration from an amnestic state. This improved understanding could eventually be translated to modulate memories to alleviate maladaptive memory states.</p>

We found that INP1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y occurs after meiotic cytokinesis at the interface between the plasma membrane and the overlying callose wall, and requires the normal callose wall formation.

T-plastin is essential for basement membrane assembly and epidermal morphogenesis
<p>The establishment of epithelial architecture is a complex process involving cross-talk between cells and the basement membrane. Basement membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y requires integrin activity but the role of the associated actomyosin cytoskeleton is poorly understood. Here, we identify the actin-bundling protein T-plastin (Pls3) as a regulator of basement membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y and epidermal morphogenesis. In utero depletion of <i>Pls3</i> transcripts in mouse embryos caused basement membrane and polarity defects in the epidermis but had little effect on cell adhesion and differentiation. Loss-of-function experiments demonstrated that the apicobasal polarity defects were secondary to the disruption of the basement membrane. However, the basement membrane itself was profoundly sensitive to subtle perturbations in the actin cytoskeleton. We further show that Pls3 localized to the cell cortex, where it was essential for the localization and activation of myosin II. Inhibition of myosin II motor activity disrupted basement membrane organization. Our results provide insights into the regulation of cortical actomyosin and its importance for basement membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y and skin morphogenesis.</p>

Stoichiometry controls activity of phase-separated clusters of actin signaling proteins
<p>Biomolecular condensates concentrate macromolecules into foci without a surrounding membrane. Many condensates appear to form through multivalent interactions that drive liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). LLPS increases the specific activity of actin regulatory proteins toward actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y by the Arp2/3 complex. We show that this increase occurs because LLPS of the Nephrin–Nck–N-WASP signaling pathway on lipid bilayers increases membrane dwell time of N-WASP and Arp2/3 complex, consequently increasing actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y. Dwell time varies with relative stoichiometry of the signaling proteins in the phase-separated clusters, rendering N-WASP and Arp2/3 activity stoichiometry dependent. This mechanism of controlling protein activity is enabled by the stoichiometrically undefined nature of biomolecular condensates. Such regulation should be a general feature of signaling systems that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>e through multivalent interactions and drive nonequilibrium outputs.</p>

Flagellar microtubule doublet assembly in vitro reveals a regulatory role of tubulin C-terminal tails
<p>Microtubule doublets (MTDs), consisting of an incomplete B-microtubule at the surface of a complete A-microtubule, provide a structural scaffold mediating intraflagellar transport and ciliary beating. Despite the fundamental role of MTDs, the molecular mechanism governing their formation is unknown. We used a cell-free assay to demonstrate a crucial inhibitory role of the carboxyl-terminal (C-terminal) tail of tubulin in MTD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y. Removal of the C-terminal tail of an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>ed A-microtubule allowed for the nucleation of a B-microtubule on its surface. C-terminal tails of only one A-microtubule protofilament inhibited this side-to-surface tubulin interaction, which would be overcome in vivo with binding protein partners. The dynamics of B-microtubule nucleation and its distinctive isotropic elongation was elucidated by using live imaging. Thus, inherent interaction properties of tubulin provide a structural basis driving flagellar MTD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y.</p>

De novo design of self-assembling helical protein filaments

Emergent simplicity in microbial community assembly
<p>A major unresolved question in microbiome research is whether the complex taxonomic architectures observed in surveys of natural communities can be explained and predicted by fundamental, quantitative principles. Bridging theory and experiment is hampered by the multiplicity of ecological processes that simultaneously affect community <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y in natural ecosystems. We addressed this challenge by monitoring the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y of hundreds of soil- and plant-derived microbiomes in well-controlled minimal synthetic media. Both the community-level function and the coarse-grained taxonomy of the resulting communities are highly predictable and governed by nutrient availability, despite substantial species variability. By generalizing classical ecological models to include widespread nonspecific cross-feeding, we show that these features are all emergent properties of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y of large microbial communities, explaining their ubiquity in natural microbiomes.</p>

Wild emmer genome architecture and diversity elucidate wheat evolution and domestication
<p>Wheat (<i>Triticum</i> spp.) is one of the founder crops that likely drove the Neolithic transition to sedentary agrarian societies in the Fertile Crescent more than 10,000 years ago. Identifying genetic modifications underlying wheat’s domestication requires knowledge about the genome of its allo-tetraploid progenitor, wild emmer (<i>T. turgidum</i> ssp. <i>dicoccoides</i>). We report a 10.1-gigabase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y of the 14 chromosomes of wild tetraploid wheat, as well as analyses of gene content, genome architecture, and genetic diversity.

CyanoGate: A Modular Cloning Suite for Engineering Cyanobacteria Based on the Plant MoClo Syntax
<p>Recent advances in synthetic biology research have been underpinned by an exponential increase in available genomic information and a proliferation of advanced DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y tools. The adoption of plasmid vector <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y standards and parts libraries has greatly enhanced the reproducibility of research and the exchange of parts between different labs and biological systems. However, a standardized modular cloning (MoClo) system is not yet available for cyanobacteria, which lag behind other prokaryotes in synthetic biology despite their huge potential regarding biotechnological applications. By building on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y library and syntax of the Plant Golden Gate MoClo kit, we have developed a versatile system called CyanoGate that unites cyanobacteria with plant and algal systems. Here, we describe the generation of a suite of parts and acceptor vectors for making (1) marked/unmarked knock-outs or integrations using an integrative acceptor vector, and (2) transient multigene expression and repression systems using known and previously undescribed replicative vectors. We tested and compared the CyanoGate system in the established model cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 and the more recently described fast-growing strain <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973. The UTEX 2973 fast-growth phenotype was only evident under specific growth conditions; however, UTEX 2973 accumulated high levels of proteins with strong native or synthetic promoters. The system is publicly available and can be readily expanded to accommodate other standardized MoClo parts to accelerate the development of reliable synthetic biology tools for the cyanobacterial community.</p>

Dual Sites for SEC11 on the SNARE SYP121 Implicate a Binding Exchange during Secretory Traffic
<p>SNARE (soluble <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) proteins facilitate vesicle traffic through their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y in a heteromeric complex that drives membrane fusion. Much of vesicle traffic at the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plasma membrane is subject to the Sec1/Munc18 protein SEC11, which, along with plasma membrane K<sup>+</sup> channels, selectively binds with the SNARE SYP121 to regulate its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y in complex. How SEC11 binding is coordinated with the K<sup>+</sup> channels is poorly understood, as both SEC11 and the channels are thought to compete for the same SNARE binding site. Here, we identify a second binding motif within the N terminus of SYP121 and demonstrate that this motif affects SEC11 binding independently of the F<sup>9</sup>xRF motif that is shared with the K<sup>+</sup> channels. This second, previously unrecognized motif is centered on residues R<sup>20</sup>R<sup>21</sup> of SYP121 and is essential for SEC11 interaction with SYP121. Mutation of the R<sup>20</sup>R<sup>21</sup> motif blocked vesicle traffic without uncoupling the effects of SYP121 on solute and K<sup>+</sup> uptake associated with the F<sup>9</sup>xRF motif; the mutation also mimicked the effects on traffic block observed on coexpression of the dominant-negative SEC11<sup>Δ149</sup> fragment. We conclude that the R<sup>20</sup>R<sup>21</sup> motif represents a secondary site of interaction for the Sec1/Munc18 protein during the transition of SYP121 from the occluded to the open conformation that leads to SNARE complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y.</p>

The AAA-ATPase MIDASIN 1 Functions in Ribosome Biogenesis and Is Essential for Embryo and Root Development
<p>Ribosome biogenesis is an orchestrated process that relies on many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y factors. The AAA-ATPase Midasin 1 (Mdn1) functions as a ribosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y factor in yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>), but the roles of MDN1 in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) are poorly understood. Here, we showed that the Arabidopsis null mutant of <i>MDN1</i> is embryo-lethal. Using the weak mutant <i>mdn1</i>-<i>1</i>, which maintains viability, we found that MDN1 is critical for the regular pattern of auxin maxima in the globular embryo and functions in root meristem maintenance. By detecting the subcellular distribution of ribosome proteins, we noted that <i>mdn1</i>-<i>1</i> impairs nuclear export of the pre-60S ribosomal particle. The processing of ribosomal precusor RNAs, including 35S, 27SB, and 20S, is also affected in this mutant. MDN1 physically interacts with PESCADILLO2 (PES2), an essential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y factor of the 60S ribosome, and the observed mislocalization of PES2 in <i>mdn1</i>-<i>1</i> further implied that MDN1 plays an indispensable role in 60S ribosome biogenesis. Therefore, the observed hypersensitivity of <i>mdn1</i>-<i>1</i> to a eukaryotic translation inhibitor and high-sugar conditions might be associated with the defect in ribosome biogenesis. Overall, this work establishes a role of Arabidopsis MDN1 in ribosome biogenesis, which agrees with its roles in embryogenesis and root development.</p>

OHP1, OHP2, and HCF244 Form a Transient Functional Complex with the Photosystem II Reaction Center
<p>The reaction center (RC) of photosystem II (PSII), which is composed of D1, D2, PsbI, and cytochrome <i>b559</i> subunits, forms at an early stage of PSII biogenesis. However, it is largely unclear how these components <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>e to form a functional unit. In this work, we show that synthesis of the PSII core proteins D1/D2 and formation of the PSII RC is blocked specifically in the absence of ONE-HELIX PROTEIN1 (OHP1) and OHP2 proteins in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), indicating that OHP1 and OHP2 are essential for the formation of the PSII RC. Mutagenesis of the chlorophyll-binding residues in OHP proteins impairs their function and/or stability, suggesting that they may function in the binding of chlorophyll in vivo. We further show that OHP1, OHP2, and HIGH CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE244 (HCF244), together with D1, D2, PsbI, and cytochrome <i>b559</i>, form a complex. We designated this complex the PSII RC-like complex to distinguish it from the RC subcomplex in the intact PSII complex.

In a subsequent stage of PSII biogenesis, OHP1, OHP2, and HCF244 are released from the PSII RC-like complex and replaced by the other PSII subunits. Together with previous reports on the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i>, our results demonstrate that the process of PSII RC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y is highly conserved among photosynthetic species.</p>

ONE-HELIX PROTEIN2 (OHP2) Is Required for the Stability of OHP1 and Assembly Factor HCF244 and Is Functionally Linked to PSII Biogenesis
<p>The members of the light-harvesting complex protein family, which include the one-helix proteins (OHPs), are characterized by one to four membrane-spanning helices. These proteins function in light absorption and energy dissipation, sensing light intensity, and triggering photomorphogenesis or the binding of chlorophyll and intermediates of chlorophyll biosynthesis. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) contains two OHPs, while four homologs (named high-light-induced proteins) exist in <i>Synechocystis</i> PCC6803. Various functions have been assigned to high-light-induced proteins, ranging from photoprotection and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y of photosystem I (PSI) and PSII to regulation of the early steps of chlorophyll biosynthesis, but little is known about the function of the two plant OHPs. Here, we show that the two Arabidopsis OHPs form heterodimers and that the stromal part of OHP2 interacts with the plastid-localized PSII <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y factor HIGH CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE244 (HCF244). Moreover, concurrent accumulation of the two OHPs and HCF244 is critical for the stability of all three proteins. In particular, the absence of OHP2 leads to the complete loss of OHP1 and HCF244. We used a virus-induced gene silencing approach to minimize the expression of <i>OHP1</i> or <i>OHP2</i> in adult Arabidopsis plants and revealed that OHP2 is essential for the accumulation of the PSII core subunits, while the other photosynthetic complexes and the major light-harvesting complex proteins remained unaffected. We examined the potential functions of the OHP1-OHP2-HCF244 complex in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y and/or repair of PSII and propose a role for this heterotrimeric complex in thylakoid membrane biogenesis.</p>

Synthesis and Self-Assembly of Cellulose Microfibrils from Reconstituted Cellulose Synthase
<p>Cellulose, the major component of plant cell walls, can be converted to bioethanol and is thus highly studied. In plants, cellulose is produced by cellulose synthase, a processive family-2 glycosyltransferase. In plant cell walls, individual β-1,4-glucan chains polymerized by CesA are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>ed into microfibrils that are frequently bundled into macrofibrils. An in vitro system in which cellulose is synthesized and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>ed into fibrils would facilitate detailed study of this process. Here, we report the heterologous expression and partial purification of His-tagged CesA5 from <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. Immunoblot analysis and mass spectrometry confirmed enrichment of PpCesA5. The recombinant protein was functional when reconstituted into liposomes made from yeast total lipid extract. The functional studies included incorporation of radiolabeled Glc, linkage analysis, and imaging of cellulose microfibril formation using transmission electron microscopy. Several microfibrils were observed either inside or on the outer surface of proteoliposomes, and strikingly, several thinner fibrils formed ordered bundles that either covered the surfaces of proteoliposomes or were spawned from liposome surfaces. We also report this arrangement of fibrils made by proteoliposomes bearing CesA8 from hybrid aspen. These observations describe minimal systems of membrane-reconstituted CesAs that polymerize β-1,4-glucan chains that coalesce to form microfibrils and higher-ordered macrofibrils. How these micro- and macrofibrils relate to those found in primary and secondary plant cell walls is uncertain, but their presence enables further study of the mechanisms that govern the formation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y of fibrillar cellulosic structures and cell wall com<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>es during or after the polymerization process controlled by CesA proteins.</p>

Importance of Translocon Subunit Tic56 for rRNA Processing and Chloroplast Ribosome Assembly
<p>Toc159-containing complexes at the outer chloroplast envelope membrane form stable supercomplexes with a 1-MD translocon at the inner chloroplast envelope membrane of which Tic56 is one essential subunit. While the single mutants <i>tic56-1</i> and <i>ppi2</i> (<i>toc159</i>) have an albino phenotype and are able to grow heterotrophically, we find the double mutant to be embryo lethal. Comprehensive quantitative proteome profiling with both single mutants in combination with GeneChip analyses identified a posttranscriptional defect in the accumulation of plastid ribosomal proteins and diminished expression of plastid encoded proteins. In the <i>tic56-1</i> mutant, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y of functional ribosomes is furthermore hampered by a processing defect of the plastid 23S rRNA. Spectinomycin-treatment of wild-type plants phenocopies the molecular phenotype of plastid proteome accumulation in <i>tic56-1</i> and to a smaller degree also <i>ppi2</i> plastids, suggesting that a defect in plastid translation is largely responsible for the phenotype of both import mutants. Import experiments with the <i>tic56-3</i> mutant revealed no significant defect in the import of small ribosomal protein 16 in the absence of full-length Tic56, suggesting that the defect in ribosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y in <i>tic56-1</i> may be independent of a function of Tic56 in protein import. Our data establish a previously unknown link between plastid protein import, the processing of plastid rRNAs, and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y of plastid ribosomes and provide further knowledge on the function of the translocon components and the molecular basis for their albino phenotype.</p>

Genome-Wide Landscape of Alternative Splicing Events in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>
<p>Recently, <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i> has emerged as a model plant for studying monocot grasses and cereal crops. Using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>ed expressed transcript sequences and subsequent mapping to the corresponding genome, we identified 1219 alternative splicing (AS) events spanning across 2021 putatively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>ed transcripts generated from 941 genes. Approximately, 6.3% of expressed genes are alternatively spliced in <i>B. distachyon</i>. We observed that a majority of the identified AS events were related to retained introns (55.5%), followed by alternative acceptor sites (16.7%). We also observed a low percentage of exon skipping (5.0%) and alternative donor site events (8.8%). The ‘complex event’ that consists of a combination of two or more basic splicing events accounted for ∼14.0%. Comparative AS transcript analysis revealed 163 and 39 homologous pairs between <i>B. distachyon</i> and <i>Oryza sativa</i> and between <i>B. distachyon</i> and <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, respectively<i>.</i> In all, we found 16 AS transcripts to be conserved in all 3 species.

Architecture and subunit arrangement of native AMPA receptors elucidated by cryo-EM
<p>Glutamate-gated AMPA receptors mediate the fast component of excitatory signal transduction at chemical synapses throughout all regions of the mammalian brain.

Here we elucidate the structures of 10 distinct native AMPA receptor complexes by single-particle cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM). We find that receptor subunits are arranged nonstochastically, with the GluA2 subunit preferentially occupying the B and D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ions of the tetramer and with triheteromeric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>ies comprising a major population of native AMPA receptors.

Social place-cells in the bat hippocampus
<p>Social animals have to know the spatial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ions of conspecifics. However, it is unknown how the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion of others is represented in the brain. We designed a spatial observational-learning task, in which an observer bat mimicked a demonstrator bat while we recorded hippocampal dorsal-CA1 neurons from the observer bat. A neuronal subpopulation represented the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion of the other bat, in allocentric coordinates. About half of these “social place-cells” represented also the observer’s own <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion—that is, were place cells. The representation of the demonstrator bat did not reflect self-movement or trajectory planning by the observer. Some neurons represented also the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion of inanimate moving objects; however, their representation differed from the representation of the demonstrator bat. This suggests a role for hippocampal CA1 neurons in social-spatial cognition.</p>

Braiding a molecular knot with eight crossings
<p>Knots may ultimately prove just as versatile and useful at the nanoscale as at the macroscale. However, the lack of synthetic routes to all but the simplest molecular knots currently prevents systematic investigation of the influence of knotting at the molecular level. We found that it is possible to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>e four building blocks into three braided ligand strands. Octahedral iron(II) ions control the relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ions of the three strands at each crossing point in a circular triple helicate, while structural constraints on the ligands determine the braiding connections. This approach enables two-step <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y of a molecular 8<sub>19</sub> knot featuring eight nonalternating crossings in a 192-atom closed loop ~20 nanometers in length.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
SHORTROOT-Mediated Increase in Stomatal Density Has No Impact on Photosynthetic Efficiency
<p>The coordinated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning of veins, mesophyll cells, and stomata across a leaf is crucial for efficient gas exchange and transpiration and, therefore, for overall function. In monocot leaves, stomatal cell files are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioned at the flanks of underlying longitudinal leaf veins, rather than directly above or below. This pattern suggests either that stomatal formation is inhibited in epidermal cells directly in contact with the vein or that specification is induced in cell files beyond the vein. The SHORTROOT pathway specifies distinct cell types around the vasculature in subepidermal layers of both root and shoots, with cell type identity determined by distance from the vein. To test whether the pathway has the potential to similarly pattern epidermal cell types, we expanded the expression domain of the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> ssp <i>japonica</i>) <i>OsSHR2</i> gene, which we show is restricted to developing leaf veins, to include bundle sheath cells encircling the vein. In transgenic lines, which were generated using the orthologous <i>ZmSHR1</i> gene to avoid potential silencing of <i>OsSHR2</i>, stomatal cell files were observed both in the normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ion and in more distant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ions from the vein. Contrary to theoretical predictions, and to phenotypes observed in eudicot leaves, the increase in stomatal density did not enhance photosynthetic capacity or increase mesophyll cell density. Collectively, these results suggest that the SHORTROOT pathway may coordinate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ioning of veins and stomata in monocot leaves and that distinct mechanisms may operate in monocot and eudicot leaves to coordinate stomatal patterning with the development of underlying mesophyll cells.</p>

Phospholipase Dζ Enhances Diacylglycerol Flux into Triacylglycerol<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plant seeds are the primary source of triacylglycerols (TAG) for food, feed, fuel, and industrial applications. As TAG is produced from diacylglycerol (DAG), successful engineering strategies to enhance TAG levels have focused on the conversion of DAG to TAG. However, the production of TAG can be limited by flux through the enzymatic reactions that supply DAG. In this study, two <i>Arabidopsis phospholipase D</i><sub>ζ</sub> genes (<i>AtPLD<sub>ζ1</sub></i> and <i>AtPLD<sub>ζ2</sub></i>) were coexpressed in <i>Camelina sativa</i> to test whether the conversion of phosphatidylcholine to DAG impacts TAG levels in seeds. The resulting transgenic plants produced 2% to 3% more TAG as a component of total seed biomass and had increased 18:3 and 20:1 fatty acid levels relative to wild type. Increased DAG and decreased PC levels were examined through the kinetics of lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong></span></strong>y by [<sup>14</sup>C]acetate and [<sup>14</sup>C]glycerol incorporation into glycerolipids.

Dynamic Convergent Evolution Drives the Passage Adaptation across 48 Years’ History of H3N2 Influenza Evolution
<p>Influenza viruses are often propagated in a diverse set of culturing media and additional substitutions known as passage adaptation can cause extra evolution in the target strain, leading to ineffective vaccines. Using 25,482 H3N2 HA1 sequences curated from Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data and National Center for Biotechnology Information databases, we found that passage adaptation is a very dynamic process that changes over time and evolves in a seesaw like pattern. After crossing the species boundary from bird to human in 1968, the influenza H3N2 virus evolves to be better adapted to the human environment and passaging them in embryonated eggs (i.e., an avian environment) leads to increasingly stronger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive selection. On the contrary, passage adaptation to the mammalian cell lines changes from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive selection to negative selection. Using two statistical tests, we identified 19 codon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ions around the receptor binding domain strongly contributing to passage adaptation in the embryonated egg. These sites show strong convergent evolution and overlap extensively with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ively selected sites identified in humans, suggesting that passage adaptation can confound many of the earlier studies on influenza evolution. Interestingly, passage adaptation in recent years seems to target a few codon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ions in antigenic surface epitopes, which makes it difficult to produce antigenically unaltered vaccines using embryonic eggs. Our study outlines another interesting scenario whereby both convergent and adaptive evolution are working in synchrony driving viral adaptation. Future studies from sequence analysis to vaccine production need to take careful consideration of passage adaptation.</p>

Three groups were established: group 1 patients who were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive for IgA anti-β<sub>2</sub>-glycoprotein I (aB2GP1) and B2A-CIC (n=125); group 2 patients who were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive only for IgA aB2GP1 (n=240); and control group, patients who were negative for IgA aB2GP1 (n=974). Levels of autoantibodies and B2A-CIC were quantified immediately before the transplant surgery and patients were followed up for 6 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In group 1, 46.4% of patients experienced any type of thrombosis versus 10.4% in group 2 (<i>P</i><0.001) and 8.6% in the control group (<i>P</i><0.001). The incidence of graft thrombosis in group 1 (31.2%) was significantly higher than that observed in group 2 (3.3%, <i>P</i><0.001) and the control group (2.6%, <i>P</i><0.001). In a multivariate analysis, the presence of B2A-CIC was an independent variable to experience any type of posttransplant thrombosis (hazard ratio, 6.72; 95% confidence interval, 4.81–9.37) and, prominently, for graft thrombosis (hazard ratio, 14.75; 95% confidence interval, 9.11–23.89). No significant differences were found between B2A-CIC–negative and control group patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The presence of B2A-CIC is a predictor of acute thrombotic events. Patients who were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive for IgA aB2GP1 only are at risk of experiencing thrombosis if they are B2A-CIC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive. If they are B2A-CIC–negative patients, they have the same risk as the control group. Treatments to prevent acute thrombotic events should focus on B2A-CIC–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">posit</span></strong>ive patients.</p></sec>

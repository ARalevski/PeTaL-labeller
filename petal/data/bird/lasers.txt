A single-photon switch and transistor enabled by a solid-state quantum memory
<p>Single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> switches and transistors generate strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> interactions that are essential for quantum circuits and networks. However, the deterministic control of an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al signal with a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> requires strong interactions with a quantum memory, which has been challenging to achieve in a solid-state platform. We demonstrate a single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> switch and transistor enabled by a solid-state quantum memory. Our device consists of a semiconductor spin qubit strongly coupled to a nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic cavity. The spin qubit enables a single 63-picosecond gate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> to switch a signal field containing up to an average of 27.7 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s before the internal state of the device resets. Our results show that semiconductor nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic devices can produce strong and controlled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> interactions that could enable high-bandwidth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic quantum information processing.</p>

Observation of three-photon bound states in a quantum nonlinear medium
<p>Bound states of massive particles, such as nuclei, atoms, or molecules, constitute the bulk of the visible world around us. By contrast, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s typically only interact weakly. We report the observation of traveling three-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> bound states in a quantum nonlinear medium where the interactions between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s are mediated by atomic Rydberg states. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> correlation and conditional phase measurements reveal the distinct bunching and phase features associated with three-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> and two-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> bound states. Such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic trimers and dimers possess shape-preserving wave functions that depend on the constituent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> number. The observed bunching and strongly nonlinear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al phase are described by an effective field theory of Rydberg-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> interactions. These observations demonstrate the ability to realize and control strongly interacting quantum many-body states of light.</p>

An integrated diamond nanophotonics platform for quantum-optical networks
<p>Efficient interfaces between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s and quantum emitters form the basis for quantum networks and enable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al nonlinearities at the single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> level. We demonstrate an integrated platform for scalable quantum nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ics based on silicon-vacancy (SiV) color centers coupled to diamond nanodevices. By placing SiV centers inside diamond <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic crystal cavities, we realize a quantum-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al switch controlled by a single color center. We control the switch using SiV metastable states and observe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al switching at the single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> level. Raman transitions are used to realize a single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> source with a tunable frequency and bandwidth in a diamond waveguide. By measuring intensity correlations of indistinguishable Raman <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s emitted into a single waveguide, we observe a quantum interference effect resulting from the superradiant emission of two entangled SiV centers.</p>

Deterministic generation of a cluster state of entangled photons
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic cluster states are a resource for quantum computation based solely on single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> measurements. We use semiconductor quantum dots to deterministically generate long strings of polarization-entangled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s in a cluster state by periodic timed excitation of a precessing matter qubit. In each period, an entangled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> is added to the cluster state formed by the matter qubit and the previously emitted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s. In our prototype device, the qubit is the confined dark exciton, and it produces strings of hundreds of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s in which the entanglement persists over five sequential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s. The measured process map characterizing the device has a fidelity of 0.81 with that of an ideal device.

Quantum entanglement of the spin and orbital angular momentum of photons using metamaterials
<p>Metamaterials constructed from deep subwavelength building blocks have been used to demonstrate phenomena ranging from negative refractive index and Îµ-near-zero to cloaking, emulations of general relativity, and superresolution imaging. More recently, metamaterials have been suggested as a new platform for quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>s. We present the use of a dielectric metasurface to generate entanglement between the spin and orbital angular momentum of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s. We demonstrate the generation of the four Bell states on a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> by using the geometric phase that arises from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic spin-orbit interaction and subsequently show nonlocal correlations between two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s that interacted with the metasurface. Our results show that metamaterials are suitable for the generation and manipulation of entangled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> states, introducing the area of quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>s metamaterials.</p>

A silicon Brillouin laser
<p>Brillouin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lase</span></strong>r oscillators offer powerful and flexible dynamics as the basis for mode-locked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lase</span></strong>rs, microwave oscillators, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al gyroscopes in a variety of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al systems. However, Brillouin interactions are markedly weak in conventional silicon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic waveguides, stifling progress toward silicon-based Brillouin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lase</span></strong>rs. The recent advent of hybrid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic-phononic waveguides has revealed Brillouin interactions to be one of the strongest and most tailorable nonlinearities in silicon. In this study, we have harnessed these engineered nonlinearities to demonstrate Brillouin lasing in silicon.

Quantum optical circulator controlled by a single chirally coupled atom
<p>Integrated nonreciprocal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al components, which have an inherent asymmetry between their forward and backward propagation direction, are key for routing signals in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic circuits. Here, we demonstrate a fiber-integrated quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al circulator operated by a single atom. Its nonreciprocal behavior arises from the chiral interaction between the atom and the transversally confined light. We demonstrate that the internal quantum state of the atom controls the operation direction of the circulator and that it features a strongly nonlinear response at the single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> level. This enables, for example, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> numberâdependent routing and novel quantum simulation protocols. Furthermore, such a circulator can in principle be prepared in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ent superposition of its operational states and may become a key element for quantum information processing in scalable integrated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al circuits.</p>

Disorder-induced optical transition from spin Hall to random Rashba effect
<p>Disordered structures give rise to intriguing phenomena owing to the complex nature of their interaction with light. We report on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic spin-symmetry breaking and unexpected spin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al transport phenomena arising from subwavelength-scale disordered geometric phase structure. Weak disorder induces a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic spin Hall effect, observed via quantum weak measurements, whereas strong disorder leads to spin-split modes in momentum space, a random <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al Rashba effect. Study of the momentum space entropy reveals an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al transition upon reaching a critical point where the structureâs anisotropy axis vanishes. Incorporation of singular topology into the disordered structure demonstrates repulsive vortex interaction depending on the disorder strength.

Strongly correlated quantum walks with a 12-qubit superconducting processor
<p>Quantum walks are the quantum analogs of classical random walks, which allow for the simulation of large-scale quantum many-body systems and the realization of universal quantum computation without time-dependent control. We experimentally demonstrate quantum walks of one and two strongly correlated microwave <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s in a one-dimensional array of 12 superconducting qubits with short-range interactions. First, in one-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> quantum walks, we observed the propagation of the density and correlation of the quasiparticle excitation of the superconducting qubit and quantum entanglement between qubit pairs. Second, when implementing two-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> quantum walks by exciting two superconducting qubits, we observed the fermionization of strongly interacting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s from the measured time-dependent long-range anticorrelations, representing the antibunching of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s with attractive interactions.

Quantum reference beaconâguided superresolution optical focusing in complex media

Quantum metasurface for multiphoton interference and state reconstruction

We simultaneously image multiple projections of quantum states with a single metasurface, enabling a robust reconstruction of amplitude, phase, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ence, and entanglement of multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> polarization-encoded states.

Optical skyrmion lattice in evanescent electromagnetic fields
<p>Topological defects play a key role in a variety of physical systems, ranging from high-energy to solid-state physics.

Imaging CF<sub>3</sub>I conical intersection and photodissociation dynamics with ultrafast electron diffraction
<p>Conical intersections play a critical role in excited-state dynamics of polyatomic molecules because they govern the reaction pathways of many nonadiabatic processes.

Dynamic use of optic flow during pheromone tracking by the male silkmoth, <i>Bombyx mori</i>
<p>Several insects require both olfactory and visual cues during odour-source localisation to successfully locate an odour source. In the male silkmoth, <i>Bombyx mori</i>, detection of the female sex pheromone triggers a programmed walking pattern, starting from a surge (straight-line walking) followed by zigzag walking. Although pheromone-triggered behaviour in silkmoths is well understood, the role of visual cues remains obscure. To address this question, we performed behavioural experiments on tethered-walking moths by recording their locomotion during stimulation with a pheromone and a visual motion pattern (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong> flow). The experiments were conducted under open- and closed-loop visual stimuli. We found that the use of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong> flow input was determined by the behavioural state of surge and zigzagging. Silkmoths exhibited an optomotor response, which is a behavioural visual response, by turning towards the same direction as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong> flow stimuli only during surge, but not during zigzagging. In addition, modulation of the zigzag walking pattern was observed when the moths were presented with biased closed-loop visual stimuli (visual feedback with biased constant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong> flow); however, the directional preference mechanism was different from that of the optomotor response. Based on these findings, we suggest that the optomotor response is utilised for course control during straight-line walking, whereas the absence of optomotor response during zigzagging is used to effectively perform the programmed walking pattern. Considering the neural basis of programmed behaviour, we speculate that at least two visual pathways are involved in the state-dependent use of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong> flow during odour tracking behaviour in silkmoths.</p>

Observation of chiral zero mode in inhomogeneous three-dimensional Weyl metamaterials

We report <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ent atomically thin superlattices in which different transition metal dichalcogenide monolayersâdespite large lattice mismatchesâare repeated and laterally integrated without dislocations within the monolayer plane. Grown by an omnidirectional epitaxy, these superlattices display fully matched lattice constants across heterointerfaces while maintaining an isotropic lattice structure and triangular symmetry. This strong epitaxial strain is precisely engineered via the nanoscale supercell dimensions, thereby enabling broad tuning of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al properties and producing photoluminescence peak shifts as large as 250 millielectron volts. We present theoretical models to explain this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ent growth and the energetic interplay governing the ripple formation in these strained monolayers. Such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ent superlattices provide building blocks with targeted functionalities at the atomically thin limit.</p>

Strong spin-photon coupling in silicon
<p>Long <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ence times of single spins in silicon quantum dots make these systems highly attractive for quantum computation, but how to scale up spin qubit systems remains an open question. As a first step to address this issue, we demonstrate the strong coupling of a single electron spin and a single microwave <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>. The electron spin is trapped in a silicon double quantum dot, and the microwave <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> is stored in an on-chip high-impedance superconducting resonator. The electric field component of the cavity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> couples directly to the charge dipole of the electron in the double dot, and indirectly to the electron spin, through a strong local magnetic field gradient from a nearby micromagnet. Our results provide a route to realizing large networks of quantum dotâbased spin qubit registers.</p>

Light amplification by seeded Kerr instability
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplifi</span></strong>cation of femtosecond <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lase</span></strong>r pulses typically requires a lasing medium or a nonlinear crystal. In either case, the chemical properties of the lasing medium or the momentum conservation in the nonlinear crystal constrain the frequency and the bandwidth of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplifi</span></strong>ed pulses. We demonstrate high gain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplifi</span></strong>cation (greater than 1000) of widely tunable (0.5 to 2.2 micrometers) and short (less than 60 femtosecond) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lase</span></strong>r pulses, up to intensities of 1 terawatt per square centimeter, by seeding the modulation instability in an Y<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub> crystal pumped by femtosecond near-infrared pulses. Our method avoids constraints related to doping and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase match</span></strong>ing and therefore can occur in a wider pool of glasses and crystals even at far-infrared frequencies and for single-cycle pulses. Such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplifi</span></strong>ed pulses are ideal to study strong-field processes in solids and highly excited states in gases.</p>

Large, valley-exclusive Bloch-Siegert shift in monolayer WS<sub>2</sub>
<p>Coherent interaction with off-resonance light can be used to shift the energy levels of atoms, molecules, and solids. The dominant effect is the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al Stark shift, but there is an additional contribution from the so-called Bloch-Siegert shift that has eluded direct and exclusive observation in solids. We observed an exceptionally large Bloch-Siegert shift in monolayer tungsten disulfide (WS<sub>2</sub>) under infrared <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al driving. By controlling the light helicity, we could confine the Bloch-Siegert shift to occur only at one valley, and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al Stark shift at the other valley, because the two effects obey opposite selection rules at different valleys. Such a large and valley-exclusive Bloch-Siegert shift allows for enhanced control over the valleytronic properties of two-dimensional materials.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Light Sheet Microscopy Imaging of Light Absorption and Photosynthesis Distribution in Plant Tissue
<p>In vivo variable chlorophyll fluorescence measurements of photosystem II (PSII) quantum yields in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>ally dense systems are complicated by steep tissue light gradients due to scattering and absorption. Consequently, externally measured effective PSII quantum yields may be composed of signals derived from cells differentially exposed to actinic light, where cells located deeper inside tissues receive lower irradiance than cells closer to the surface and can display distinct photophysiological status. We demonstrate how measured distributions of PSII quantum yields in plant tissue change under natural tissue light gradients as compared with conventionally measured quantum yields with even exposure to actinic light. This was achieved by applying actinic irradiance perpendicular to one side of thallus cross sections of the aquatic macrophyte <i>Fucus vesiculosus</i> with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lase</span></strong>r light sheets of defined spectral composition, while imaging variable chlorophyll fluorescence from cross sections with a microscope-mounted pulse amplitude-modulated imaging system. We show that quantum yields are highly affected by light gradients and that traditional surface-based variable chlorophyll fluorescence measurements result in substantial underestimations and/or overestimations, depending on incident actinic irradiance. We present a method for using chlorophyll fluorescence profiles in combination with integrating sphere measurements of reflectance and transmittance to calculate depth-resolved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> absorption profiles, which can be used to correct apparent PSII electron transport rates to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s absorbed by PSII. Absorption profiles of the investigated aquatic macrophyte were different in shape from what is typically observed in terrestrial leaves, and based on this finding, we discuss strategies for optimizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> absorption via modulation of the structural organization of phytoelements according to in situ light environments.</p>

Artifactual mutations resulting from DNA lesions limit detection levels in ultrasensitive sequencing applications
<p>The need in cancer research or evolutionary biology to detect rare mutations or variants present at very low frequencies (<10<sup>â5</sup>) poses an increasing demand on lowering the detection limits of available methods. Here we demonstrated that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplifi</span></strong>able DNA lesions introduce important error sources in ultrasensitive technologies such as single molecule PCR (smPCR) applications (e.g. droplet-digital PCR), or next-generation sequencing (NGS) based methods. Using templates with known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplifi</span></strong>able lesions (8-oxoguanine, deaminated 5-methylcytosine, uracil, and DNA heteroduplexes), we assessed with smPCR and duplex sequencing that templates with these lesions were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplifi</span></strong>ed very efficiently by proofreading polymerases (except uracil), leading to G->T, and to a lesser extent, to unreported G->C substitutions at 8-oxoguanine lesions, and C->T transitions in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplifi</span></strong>ed uracil containing templates. Long heat incubations common in many DNA extraction protocols significantly increased the number of G->T substitutions. Moreover, in â¼50-80% smPCR reactions we observed the random <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplifi</span></strong>cation preference of only one of both DNA strands explaining the known âPCR jackpot effectâ, with the result that a lesion became indistinguishable from a true mutation or variant. Finally, we showed that artifactual mutations derived from uracil and 8-oxoguanine could be significantly reduced by DNA repair enzymes.</p>

Topological insulator laser: Theory
<p>Topological insulators are phases of matter characterized by topological edge states that propagate in a unidirectional manner that is robust to imperfections and disorder.

We propose a concept that exploits topological effects in a unique way: the topological insulator <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lase</span></strong>r. These are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lase</span></strong>rs whose lasing mode exhibits topologically protected transport without magnetic fields.

Observation of bulk Fermi arc and polarization half charge from paired exceptional points

Moreover, we discover half-integer topological charges in the polarization of far-field radiation around the bulk Fermi arc.

Probing optically silent superfluid stripes in cuprates
<p>Unconventional superconductivity in the cuprates coexists with other types of electronic order. However, some of these orders are invisible to most experimental probes because of their symmetry. For example, the possible existence of superfluid stripes is not easily validated with linear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>s, because the stripe alignment causes interlayer superconducting tunneling to vanish on average. Here we show that this frustration is removed in the nonlinear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al response. A giant terahertz third harmonic, characteristic of nonlinear Josephson tunneling, is observed in La<sub>1.885</sub>Ba<sub>0.115</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> above the transition temperature <i>T</i><sub>c</sub> = 13 kelvin and up to the charge-ordering temperature <i>T</i><sub>co</sub> = 55 kelvin.

Giant nonlinear response at a plasmonic nanofocus drives efficient four-wave mixing
<p>Efficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al frequency mixing typically must accumulate over large interaction lengths because nonlinear responses in natural materials are inherently weak. This limits the efficiency of mixing processes owing to the requirement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase match</span></strong>ing. Here, we report efficient four-wave mixing (FWM) over micrometer-scale interaction lengths at telecommunications wavelengths on silicon. We used an integrated plasmonic gap waveguide that strongly confines light within a nonlinear organic polymer. The gap waveguide intensifies light by nanofocusing it to a mode cross-section of a few tens of nanometers, thus generating a nonlinear response so strong that efficient FWM accumulates over wavelength-scale distances.

Femtosecond electron-phonon lock-in by photoemission and x-ray free-electron laser
<p>The interactions that lead to the emergence of superconductivity in iron-based materials remain a subject of debate. It has been suggested that electron-electron correlations enhance electron-phonon coupling in iron selenide (FeSe) and related pnictides, but direct experimental verification has been lacking. Here we show that the electron-phonon coupling strength in FeSe can be quantified by combining two time-domain experiments into a â<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ent lock-inâ measurement in the terahertz regime. X-ray diffraction tracks the light-induced femtosecond <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ent lattice motion at a single phonon frequency, and photoemission monitors the subsequent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ent changes in the electronic band structure. Comparison with theory reveals a strong enhancement of the coupling strength in FeSe owing to correlation effects. Given that the electron-phonon coupling affects superconductivity exponentially, this enhancement highlights the importance of the cooperative interplay between electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions.</p>

Submillihertz magnetic spectroscopy performed with a nanoscale quantum sensor

High-harmonic generation in graphene enhanced by elliptically polarized light excitation

By probing the emitter with a local intensity minimum of excitation light, MINFLUX minimizes the fluorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s needed for high localization precision. In our experiments, 22 times fewer fluorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>s are required as compared to popular centroid localization. In superresolution microscopy, MINFLUX attained ~1-nm precision, resolving molecules only 6 nanometers apart. MINFLUX tracking of single fluorescent proteins increased the temporal resolution and the number of localizations per trace by a factor of 100, as demonstrated with diffusing 30<i>S</i> ribosomal subunits in living <i>Escherichia coli</i>. As conceptual limits have not been reached, we expect this localization modality to break new ground for observing the dynamics, distribution, and structure of macromolecules in living cells and beyond.</p>

Strong coupling of a single electron in silicon to a microwave photon
<p>Silicon is vital to the computing industry because of the high quality of its native oxide and well-established doping technologies. Isotopic purification has enabled quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ence times on the order of seconds, thereby placing silicon at the forefront of efforts to create a solid-state quantum processor. We demonstrate strong coupling of a single electron in a silicon double quantum dot to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong>ic field of a microwave cavity, as shown by the observation of vacuum Rabi splitting. Strong coupling of a quantum dot electron to a cavity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photon</span></strong> would allow for long-range qubit coupling and the long-range entanglement of electrons in semiconductor quantum dots.</p>

Combined effects of defoliation and water stress on pine growth and non-structural carbohydrates
<p>Climate change is expected to increase both pest insect damage and the occurrence of severe drought. There is therefore a need to better understand the combined effects of biotic and abiotic damage on tree growth in order to predict the multi-factorial effect of climate change on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> ecosy<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stem</span></strong> productivity. Indeed, the effect of stress interactions on tree growth is an increasingly important topic that greatly lacks experiments and data, and it is unlikely that the impact of combined stresses can be extrapolated from the outcomes of studies that focused on a single stress. We developed an original manipulative study under real field conditions where we applied artificial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defoli</span></strong></span></strong>ation and induced water stress on 10-year-old (∼10 m high) maritime pine trees (<i>Pinus pinaster</i> Ait.). Tree response to combined stresses was quantitatively assessed following tree secondary growth and carbohydrate pools. Such a design allowed us to address the crucial question of combined stresses on trees under stand conditions, sharing soil supplies with neighboring trees. Our initial hypotheses were that (i) moderate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defoli</span></strong></span></strong>ation can limit the impact of water stress on tree growth through reduced transpiration demand by a tree canopy partly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defoli</span></strong></span></strong>ated and that (ii) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defoli</span></strong></span></strong>ation results in reduced non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) pools, affecting tree tolerance to drought. Our results showed additive effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defoli</span></strong></span></strong>ation and water stress on tree growth and contradict our initial hypothesis. Indeed, under stand conditions, we found that partial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defoli</span></strong></span></strong>ation does not limit the impact of water stress through reduced transpiration. Our study also highlighted that, even if NSC in all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>s were affected by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defoli</span></strong></span></strong>ation, tree response to water stress was not triggered. We found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stem</span></strong> NSC were maintained or increased during the entire growing season, supporting literature-based hypotheses such as an active maintenance of the hydraulic sy<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stem</span></strong> or another limiting resource for tree growth under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defoli</span></strong></span></strong>ation. We also observed a significant decrease in root carbohydrates, which suggests a shift in the root carbon balance under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defoli</span></strong></span></strong>ation. The decrease in carbohydrate supply under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defoli</span></strong></span></strong>ation may not counterbalance the carbon use for mineral and water uptakes or a translocation to other tissues.</p>

cis-Cinnamic Acid Is a Novel, Natural Auxin Efflux Inhibitor That Promotes Lateral Root Formation
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> steers numerous physiological processes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, making the tight control of its endogenous levels and spatiotemporal distribution a necessity. This regulation is achieved by different mechanisms, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> biosynthesis, metabolic conversions, degradation, and transport. Here, we introduce cis-cinnamic acid (<i>c</i>-CA) as a novel and unique addition to a small group of endogenous molecules affecting in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> concentrations. <i>c-CA</i> is the photo-isomerization product of the phenylpropanoid pathway intermediate trans-CA (<i>t</i>-CA). When grown on <i>c</i>-CA-containing medium, an evolutionary diverse set of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> species were shown to exhibit phenotypes characteristic for high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> levels, including inhibition of primary root growth, induction of root hairs, and promotion of adventitious and lateral rooting. By molecular docking and receptor binding assays, we showed that <i>c</i>-CA itself is neither an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> nor an anti-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> profiling data revealed that <i>c</i>-CA does not significantly interfere with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> biosynthesis. Single cell-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> accumulation assays showed that <i>c</i>-CA, and not <i>t</i>-CA, is a potent inhibitor of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> efflux. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling reporters detected changes in spatiotemporal distribution of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> response along the root of <i>c</i>-CA-treated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, and long-distance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport assays showed no inhibition of rootward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport. Overall, these results suggest that the phenotypes of <i>c</i>-CA-treated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s are the consequence of a local change in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> accumulation, induced by the inhibition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> efflux. This work reveals a novel mechanism how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s may regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> levels and adds a novel, naturally occurring molecule to the chemical toolbox for the studies of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> homeostasis.</p>

MicroRNA166 Modulates Cadmium Tolerance and Accumulation in Rice
<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 20- to 24-nucleotide small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression in eukaryotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>isms. Several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> miRNAs, such as miR166, have vital roles in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth, development and responses to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>mental stresses. One such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>mental stress encountered by crop <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s is exposure to cadmium (Cd), an element highly toxic to most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>isms, including humans and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. In this study, we analyzed the role of miR166 in Cd accumulation and tolerance in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). The expression levels of miR166 in both root and leaf tissues were significantly higher in the reproductive stage than in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>ling stage in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>. The expression of miR166 in the roots of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>lings was reduced after Cd treatment. Overexpression of miR166 in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> improved Cd tolerance, a result associated with the reduction of Cd-induced oxidative stress in transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Furthermore, overexpression of miR166 reduced both Cd translocation from roots to shoots and Cd accumulation in the grains. miR166 targets genes encoding the class-III homeodomain-Leu zipper (HD-Zip) family proteins in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>, <i>HOMEODOMAIN CONTAINING PROTEIN4</i> (<i>OsHB4</i>) gene (Os03g43930), which encodes an HD-Zip protein, was up-regulated by Cd treatment but down-regulated by overexpression of miR166 in transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Overexpression of <i>OsHB4</i> increased Cd sensitivity and Cd accumulation in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es and grains of transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. By contrast, silencing <i>OsHB4</i> by RNA interference enhanced Cd tolerance in transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. These results indicate a critical role for miR166 in Cd accumulation and tolerance through regulation of its target gene, <i>OsHB4</i>, in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>.</p>

Rice Morphology Determinant-Mediated Actin Filament Organization Contributes to Pollen Tube Growth
<p>For successful fertilization in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiosperm</span></strong>s, rapid tip growth in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes delivers the male gamete into the ovules. The actin-binding protein-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ization of the actin cytoskeleton within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube plays a crucial role in this polarized process. However, the mechanism underlying the polarity of the actin filament (F-actin) array and behaviors in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that an actin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>izing protein, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> Morphology Determinant (RMD), a type II formin from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), controls <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth by modulating the polarity and distribution of the F-actin array. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> <i>rmd</i> mutant exhibits abnormal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth and a decreased germination rate of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> grain in vitro and in vivo. The <i>rmd</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes display a dis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ized F-actin pattern with disrupted apical actin density and shank longitudinal cable direction/arrangement, indicating the novel role of RMD in F-actin polarity during tip growth. Consistent with this role, RMD localizes at the tip of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube, which is essential for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth and polarity as well as F-actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ization. Furthermore, the direction and characteristics of the RMD-guided F-actin array positively regulate the deposition of cell wall components and the pattern and velocity of cytoplasmic streaming during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth. Collectively, our results suggest that RMD is essential for the spatial regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth via modulating F-actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ization and array orientation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>. This work provides insights into tip-focused cell growth and polarity.</p>

<i>pheno</i>Seeder - A Robot System for Automated Handling and Phenotyping of Individual Seeds
<p>The enormous diversity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> traits is an intriguing feature and critical for the overwhelming success of higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. In particular, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> mass is generally regarded to be key for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>ling development but is mostly approximated by using scanning methods delivering only two-dimensional data, often termed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> size. However, three-dimensional traits, such as the volume or mass of single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s, are very rarely determined in routine measurements. Here, we introduce a device named <i>pheno</i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>er, which enables the handling and phenotyping of individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s of very different sizes. The sy<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stem</span></strong> consists of a pick-and-place robot and a modular setup of sensors that can be versatilely extended. Basic biometric traits detected for individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s are two-dimensional data from projections, three-dimensional data from volumetric measures, and mass, from which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> density is also calculated. Each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> is tracked by an identifier and, after phenotyping, can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>ed, sorted, or individually stored for further evaluation or processing (e.g. in routine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>-to-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> tracking pipelines). By investigating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), rape<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> (<i>Brassica napus</i>), and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), we observed that, even for apparently round-shaped <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s of rape<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>, correlations between the projected area and the mass of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s were much weaker than between volume and mass. This indicates that simple projections may not deliver good proxies for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> mass. Although throughput is limited, we expect that automated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> phenotyping on a single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> basis can contribute valuable information for applications in a wide range of wild or crop species, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> classification, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> sorting, and assessment of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> quality.</p>

Chemical responses to modified lignin composition in tension wood of hybrid poplar (<i>Populus tremula × Populus alba</i>)
<p>The effect of altering the expression level of the <i>F5H</i> gene was investigated in three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong> tissues (normal, opposite and tension <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong>) in 1-year-old hybrid poplar clone 717 (<i>Populus tremula × Populus alba</i> L.), containing the <i>F5H</i> gene under the control of the <i>C4H</i> promoter. Elevated expression of the <i>F5H</i> gene in poplar has been previously reported to increase the percent syringyl content of lignin. The wild-type and three transgenic lines were inclined 45° for 3 months to induce tension <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong> formation. Tension and opposite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong> from inclined trees, along with normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong> from control trees, were analyzed separately for carbohydrates, lignin, cellulose crystallinity and microfibril angle (MFA). In the wild-type poplar, the lignin in tension <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong> contained a significantly higher percentage of syringyl than normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong> or opposite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong>. However, there was no significant difference in the percent syringyl content of the three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong> types within each of the transgenic lines. Increasing the <i>F5H</i> gene expression caused an increase in the percent syringyl content and a slight decrease in the total lignin in normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong>. In tension <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong>, the addition of a gelatinous layer in the fiber walls resulted in a consistently lower percentage of total lignin in the tissue. Acid-soluble lignin was observed to increase by up to 2.3-fold in the transgenic lines. Compared with normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong> and opposite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong>, cell wall crystallinity in tension <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong> was higher and the MFA was smaller, as expected, with no evidence of an effect from modifying the syringyl monomer ratio. Tension <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong> in all the lines contained consistently higher total sugar and glucose percentages when compared with normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong> within the respective lines. However, both sugar and glucose percentages were lower in the tension <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong> of transgenic lines when compared with the tension <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong> of wild-type trees. Evaluating the response of trees with altered syringyl content to gravity will improve our understanding of the changes in cell wall chemistry and ultrastructural properties of normal, opposite and tension <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong> in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Initial Bud Outgrowth Occurs Independent of Auxin Flow from Out of Buds
<p>Apical dominance is the process whereby the shoot tip inhibits the growth of axillary buds along the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stem</span></strong>. It has been proposed that the shoot tip, which is the predominant source of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> hormone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>, prevents bud outgrowth by suppressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> canalization and export from axillary buds into the main <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stem</span></strong>. In this theory, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> flow out of axillary buds is a prerequisite for bud outgrowth, and buds are triggered to grow by an enhanced proportional flow of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> from the buds. A major challenge of directly testing this model is in being able to create a bud- or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stem</span></strong>-specific change in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport. Here we evaluate the relationship between specific changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> efflux from axillary buds and bud outgrowth after shoot tip removal (decapitation) in the pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport inhibitor 1-<i>N</i>-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) and to a lesser extent, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> perception inhibitor <i>p</i>-chlorophenoxyisobutyric acid (PCIB), effectively blocked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> efflux from axillary buds of intact and decapitated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s without affecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> flow in the main <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stem</span></strong>. Gene expression analyses indicate that NPA and PCIB regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-inducible, and biosynthesis and transport genes, in axillary buds within 3 h after application. These inhibitors had no effect on initial bud outgrowth after decapitation or cytokinin (benzyladenine; BA) treatment. Inhibitory effects of PCIB and NPA on axillary bud outgrowth only became apparent from 48 h after treatment. These findings demonstrate that the initiation of decapitation- and cytokinin-induced axillary bud outgrowth is independent of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> canalization and export from the bud.</p>

Aphid-borne Viral Spread Is Enhanced by Virus-induced Accumulation of Plant Reactive Oxygen Species
<p>Most known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> viruses are spread from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> by insect vectors. There is strong evidence that nonpersistently transmitted viruses manipulate the release of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> volatiles to attract insect vectors, thereby promoting virus spread. The mechanisms whereby aphid settling and feeding is altered on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s infected with these viruses, however, are unclear. Here we employed loss-of-function mutations in cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) and one of its host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tobacco</span></strong> (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>), to elucidate such mechanisms. We show that, relative to a CMVΔ2b strain with a deletion of the viral suppressor of RNAi 2b protein in CMV, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s infected with wild-type CMV produce higher concentrations of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> tissues. Aphids on wild-type CMV-infected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s engage in shorter probes, less phloem feeding, and exhibit other changes, as detected by electrical penetration graphing technology, relative to CMVΔ2b-infected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Therefore, the frequency of virus acquisition and the virus load per aphid were greater on CMV-infected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s than on CMVΔ2b-infected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Aphids also moved away from initial feeding sites more frequently on wild-type CMV infected versus CMVΔ2b-infected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. The role of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in eliciting these effects on aphids was corroborated using healthy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s infused with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Finally, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels were not elevated, and aphid behavior was unchanged, on CMV-infected RbohD-silenced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tobacco</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, which are deficient in the induction of ROS production. These results suggest that CMV uses its viral suppressor of RNAi protein to increase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> ROS levels, thereby enhancing its acquisition and transmission by vector insects.</p>

Leaf Amino Acid Supply Affects Photosynthetic and Plant Nitrogen Use Efficiency under Nitrogen Stress
<p>The coordinated distribution of nitrogen to source <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es and sinks is essential for supporting leaf metabolism while also supplying sufficient nitrogen to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s for development. This study aimed to understand how regulated amino acid allocation to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es affects photosynthesis and overall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> nitrogen use efficiency in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and how soil nitrogen availability influences these processes. Arabidopsis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s with a knockout of <i>AAP2</i>, encoding an amino acid permease involved in xylem-to-phloem transfer of root-derived amino acids, were grown in low-, moderate-, and high-nitrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments. We analyzed nitrogen allocation to shoot tissues, photosynthesis, and photosynthetic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> nitrogen use efficiency in these knockout <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Our results demonstrate that, independent of nitrogen conditions, <i>aap2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s allocate more nitrogen to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es than wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Increased leaf nitrogen supply positively affected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l and Rubisco levels, photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency, and carbon assimilation and transport to sinks. The <i>aap2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s outperformed wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s with respect to growth, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> yield and carbon storage pools, and nitrogen use efficiency in both high and deficient nitrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments. Overall, this study demonstrates that increasing nitrogen allocation to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es represents an effective strategy for improving carbon fixation and photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency. The results indicate that an optimized coordination of nitrogen and carbon partitioning processes is critical for high oil<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> production in Arabidopsis, including in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s exposed to limiting nitrogen conditions.</p>

Primitive Auxin Response without TIR1 and Aux/IAA in the Charophyte Alga <i>Klebsormidium nitens</i>
<p>The phytohormone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> regulates many aspects of growth and development in land <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, but the origin and evolution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling and response mechanisms remain largely unknown. Indeed, it remains to be investigated whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-related pathways diverged before the emergence of land <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. To address this knowledge deficit, we analyzed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> responses in the charophyte <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong> <i>Klebsormidium nitens</i> NIES-2285, whose ancestor diverged from a green <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong>l ancestor during the evolution of land <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. This strain is the same as <i>Klebsormidium flaccidum</i> NIES-2285, for which the draft genome was sequenced in 2014, and was taxonomically reclassified as <i>K. nitens</i>. This genome sequence revealed genes involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> responses. Furthermore, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) was detected in cultures of <i>K. nitens</i>, but <i>K. nitens</i> lacks the central regulators of the canonical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-signaling pathway found in land <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Exogenous IAA inhibited cell division and cell elongation in <i>K. nitens</i>. Inhibitors of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> biosynthesis and of polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport also inhibited cell division and elongation. Moreover, exogenous IAA rapidly induced expression of a LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES-DOMAIN transcription factor. These results suggest that <i>K. nitens</i> has acquired the part of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> sy<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stem</span></strong> that regulates transcription and cell growth without the requirement for the central players that govern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling in land <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s.</p>

Gall induction may benefit host plant: a case of a gall wasp and eucalyptus tree
<p>Gall-inducing insects display intimate interactions with their host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, usually described as parasitic relationships; the galls seem to favor the galler alone. We report on a case in which the presence of the galls induced by <i>Leptocybe invasa</i> Fisher & LaSalle (Hymenoptera; Eulophidae) benefit its host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>, the river red gum <i>Eucalyptus camaldulensis</i> Dehnh. Field observations showed that <i>E. camaldulensis</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s infected by this gall wasp were less susceptible to cold injury than neighboring conspecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s without galls. In the laboratory, frost resistance was compared between galled and non-galled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s which were both divided into two subgroups: cold-acclimated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s that were non-acclimated. Galled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s displayed higher frost resistance than the non-galled ones, and the differences were higher in non-acclimated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s compared with acclimated ones. Physiological changes in host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> were determined by chemical analyses of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>ls, proteins, soluble sugars and anthocyanin contents. The results showed higher values of all physiological parameters in the galled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, supporting the hypothesis that the presence of the gall wasp induces physiological changes on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">foliag</span></strong>e, which may in turn increase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> defense mechanisms against cold. Therefore, the toll of galling by the herbivore may pay off by the host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> acquiring increased frost resistance. This work provides evidence for physiological changes induced by a herbivore which might have a positive indirect effect on the host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>, promoting frost resistance such as cold acclimation.</p>

The Hydrogen Isotope Composition δ<sup>2</sup>H Reflects Plant Performance
<p>The stable carbon (δ<sup>13</sup>C) and oxygen (δ<sup>18</sup>O) isotope compositions in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> matter reflect photosynthetic and transpirative conditions in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, respectively. However, the nature of hydrogen isotope composition (δ<sup>2</sup>H) and what it reflects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> performance is poorly understood. Using durum wheat (<i>Triticum turgidum</i> var <i>durum</i>), this study evaluated the effect of different water and nitrogen growing field conditions on transpiration and how this effect influenced the performance of δ<sup>2</sup>H in autotrophic (flag leaf), mixotrophic (ears), and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heterotroph</span></strong>ic (grains and roots) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>s. Moreover, δ<sup>2</sup>H was compared with the δ<sup>13</sup>C and δ<sup>18</sup>O in the same <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>s. Isotope compositions were analyzed in dry matter, the water-soluble fraction, and in water from different tissues of a set of genotypes. Similar to δ<sup>13</sup>C, the δ<sup>2</sup>H correlated negatively with stomatal conductance, whereas no correlation was observed for δ<sup>18</sup>O. Moreover, δ<sup>2</sup>H was not only affected by changes in transpiration but also by photosynthetic reactions, probably as a consequence of NADPH formation in autotrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>s. Compared with the δ<sup>2</sup>H of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stem</span></strong> water, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> δ<sup>2</sup>H was strongly diminished in photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>s such as the flag <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es, whereas it strongly increased in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heterotroph</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>s such as grains and roots. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heterotroph</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>s, δ<sup>2</sup>H was associated with postphotosynthetic effects because there are several processes that lead to <sup>2</sup>H-enrichment of carbohydrates. In summary, δ<sup>2</sup>H exhibited specific features that inform about the water conditions of the wheat crop, together with the photosynthetic characteristics of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> part considered. Moreover, correlations of δ<sup>2</sup>H with grain yield illustrate that this isotope can be used to assess <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> performance under different growing conditions.</p>

A Group D MAPK Protects Plants from Autotoxicity by Suppressing Herbivore-Induced Defense Signaling
<p>The mechanisms by which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s activate and enhance defense responses have been well studied; however, the regulatory mechanisms that allow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s to avoid excessive defense responses are poorly understood. Here, we identified a group D mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) gene from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), <i>OsMAPK20-5</i>, whose expression was rapidly induced by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infest</span></strong>ation of gravid female adults of a destructive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> pest, brown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>hopper (BPH, <i>Nilaparvata lugens</i>), but not by BPH nymphs. Expression silencing of <i>OsMAPK20-5</i> (irMAPK) increased the accumulation of ethylene and nitric oxide (NO) after gravid female BPH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infest</span></strong>ation, and thereby increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> resistance to BPH adults and oviposited eggs. However, when exposed to high densities of gravid BPH females, irMAPK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s wilted earlier than wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, which could be attributed to the hyperaccumulation of ethylene and NO in irMAPK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Interestingly, when released into the field, irMAPK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s displayed broad resistance to BPH and white-backed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>hopper (<i>Sogatella furcifera</i>), the two most destructive pests of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>, and produced higher yield. Taken together, our study shows that although OsMAPK20-5 can reduce the resistance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>hoppers, it also enables <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s to control excessive defense responses and thereby prevents defense-response–related autotoxicity.</p>

Early Senescence in Older Leaves of Low Nitrate-Grown <i>Atxdh1</i> Uncovers a Role for Purine Catabolism in N Supply
<p>The nitrogen (N)-rich ureides allantoin and allant<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oat</span></strong>e, which are products of purine catabolism, play a role in N delivery in Leguminosae. Here, we examined their role as an N source in nonlegume <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s using Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s mutated in XANTHINE DEHYDROGENASE1 (AtXDH1), a catalytic bottleneck in purine catabolism. Older <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es of the <i>Atxdh1</i> mutant exhibited early senescence, lower soluble protein, and lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ic N levels as compared with wild-type older <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es when grown with 1 m<sc>m</sc> nitrate but were comparable to the wild type under 5 m<sc>m</sc> nitrate. Similar nitrate-dependent senescence phenotypes were evident in the older <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es of <i>allantoinase</i> (<i>Ataln</i>) and <i>allant<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oat</span></strong>e amidohydrolase</i> (<i>Ataah</i>) mutants, which also are impaired in purine catabolism. Under low-nitrate conditions, xanthine accumulated in older <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es of <i>Atxdh1</i>, whereas allantoin accumulated in both older and younger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es of <i>Ataln</i> but not in wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es, indicating the remobilization of xanthine-degraded products from older to younger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. Supporting this notion, ureide transporter expression was enhanced in older <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es of the wild type in low-nitrate as compared with high-nitrate conditions. Elevated transcripts and proteins of AtXDH and AtAAH were detected in low-nitrate-grown wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, indicating regulation at protein and transcript levels. The higher nitrate reductase activity in <i>Atxdh1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es compared with wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es indicated a need for nitrate assimilation products. Together, these results indicate that the absence of remobilized purine-degraded N from older <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es of <i>Atxdh1</i> caused senescence symptoms, a result of higher chloroplastic protein degradation in older <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es of low-nitrate-grown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s.</p>

Pollen-Expressed Leucine-Rich Repeat Extensins Are Essential for Pollen Germination and Growth
<p>During <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth, the walls of the tube provide the mechanical strength resisting turgor pressure to protect two sperm cells. Cell wall proteins may play an important role in this process. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube cell wall proteins known as leucine-rich repeat extensins (LRXs) harbor a leucine-rich repeat domain and an extensin domain. In this study, the functions of four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>-expressed LRXs, LRX8, LRX9, LRX10, and LRX11 (LRX8–11), were characterized in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). <i>LRX8–11</i> displayed a consistent expression pattern in mature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> grains and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes. In a phenotypic analysis of four single mutants, six double mutants, four triple mutants, and a quadruple mutant, the triple and quadruple mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s displayed markedly reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> set and decreased male transmission efficiency accompanied by compromised <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> germination and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth. GFP-fused LRX8, LRX10, and LRX11 were found to be localized to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube cell walls. An immunohistochemical analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube cell wall polysaccharides showed an increase in the amount of rhamnogalacturonan I in the subapical walls of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes of the <i>lrx9 lrx10 lrx11</i> and <i>lrx8 lrx9 lrx11</i> mutants and a decrease in the content of fucosylated xyloglucans in <i>lrx8 lrx9 lrx11</i> compared with wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Moreover, the callose content in the apical walls of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes increased in the <i>lrx8 lrx9 lrx11</i> mutant. In conclusion, we propose that LRX8–11 function synergistically to maintain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube cell wall integrity; thus, they play critical roles in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> germination and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth.</p>

Cytological and Transcriptomic Analyses Reveal Important Roles of <i>CLE19</i> in Pollen Exine Formation
<p>The CLAVATA3/ESR-RELATED (CLE) peptide signals are required for cell-cell communication in several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth and developmental processes. However, little is known regarding the possible functions of the CLEs in the anther. Here, we show that a T-DNA insertional mutant, and dominant-negative (DN) and overexpression (OX) transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s of the <i>CLE19</i> gene, exhibited significantly reduced anther size and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> grain number and abnormal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> wall formation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Interestingly, the <i>DN</i>-<i>CLE19</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> grains showed a more extensively covered surface, but <i>CLE19-OX</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> exine exhibited clearly missing connections in the network and lacked separation between areas that normally form the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lacuna</span></strong>e. With a combination of cell biological, genetic, and transcriptomic analyses on <i>cle19</i>, <i>DN</i>-<i>CLE19</i>, and <i>CLE19-OX</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, we demonstrated that <i>CLE19-OX</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s produced highly vacuolated and swollen <i>aborted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microspor</span></strong>es</i> (<i>ams</i>)-like ta<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">petal</span></strong> cells, lacked lipidic tapetosomes and elaioplasts, and had abnormal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> primexine without obvious accumulation of sporo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>in precursors. Moreover, <i>CLE19</i> is important for the normal expression of more than 1,000 genes, including the transcription factor gene <i>AMS</i>, 280 <i>AMS</i>-downstream genes, and other genes involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> c<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oat</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> exine formation, lipid metabolism, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> germination, and hormone metabolism. In addition, the <i>DN-CLE19(+/+) ams(−/−)</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s exhibited the <i>ams</i> anther phenotype and <i>ams(+/−)</i> partially suppressed the <i>DN-CLE19</i> transgene-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> exine defects. These findings demonstrate that the proper amount of CLE19 signal is essential for the normal expression of <i>AMS</i> and its downstream gene networks in the regulation of anther development and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> exine formation.</p>

Mesophyll Abscisic Acid Restrains Early Growth and Flowering But Does Not Directly Suppress Photosynthesis
<p>Abscisic acid (ABA) levels increase significantly in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s under stress conditions, and ABA is thought to serve as a key stress-response regulator. However, the direct effect of ABA on photosynthesis and the effect of mesophyll ABA on yield under both well-watered and drought conditions are still the subject of debate. Here, we examined this issue using transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s carrying a dominant ABA-signaling inhibitor under the control of a mesophyll-specific promoter (<i>FBPase::abi1-1</i>, abbreviated to <i>fa</i>). Under normal conditions, <i>fa</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s displayed slightly higher stomatal conductance and carbon assimilation than wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s; however, these parameters were comparable following ABA treatment. These observations suggest that ABA does not directly inhibit photosynthesis in the short term. The <i>fa</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s also exhibited a variety of altered phenotypes under optimal conditions, including more vigorous initial growth, earlier flowering, smaller flowers, and delayed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l degradation. Furthermore, under optimal conditions, <i>fa</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> production was less than a third of that observed for the wild type. However, under drought conditions, wild-type and <i>fa</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> yields were similar due to a significant reduction in wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> and no reduction in <i>fa</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>. These findings suggest that endogenous basal ABA inhibits a stress-escape response under nonstressed conditions, allowing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s to accumulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> and maximize yield. The lack of a correlation between flowering time and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> combined with delayed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l degradation suggests that this stress-escape behavior is regulated independently and upstream of other ABA-induced effects such as rapid growth and flowering.</p>

Auxin Function in the Brown Alga <i>Dictyota dichotoma</i>
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> controls body plan patterning in land <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s and has been proposed to play a similar role in the development of brown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong>e (Phaeophyta) despite their distant evolutionary relationship with land <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. The mechanism of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> action in brown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong>e remains controversial because of contradicting conclusions derived from pharmacological studies on <i>Fucus</i>. In this study, we used <i>Dictyota</i> <i>dichotoma</i> as a model sy<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stem</span></strong> to show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> plays a role during the apical-basal patterning of the embryo of brown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong>e. Indole-3-acetic acid was detectable in <i>D. dichotoma</i> germlings and mature tissue. Although two-celled <i>D. dichotoma</i> zygotes normally develop a rhizoid from one pole and a thallus meri<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stem</span></strong> from the other, addition of exogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>s to one-celled embryos affected polarization, and both poles of the spheroidal embryo developed into rhizoids instead. The effect was strongest at lower pH and when variable extrinsic informational cues were applied. 2-[4-(diethylamino)-2-hydroxybenzoyl]benzoic acid, an inhibitor of the ABC-B/multidrug resistance/P-glycoprotein subfamily of transporters in land <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, affected rhizoid formation by increasing rhizoid branching and inducing ectopic rhizoids. An in silico survey of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> genes suggested that a diverse range of biosynthesis genes and transport genes, such as PIN-LIKES, and the ATP-binding cassette subfamily (ABC-B/multidrug resistance/P-glycoprotein) transporters from land <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s have homologs in <i>D. dichotoma</i> and <i>Ectocarpus siliculosus</i>. Together with reports on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> function in basal lineages of green <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong>e, these results suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> function predates the divergence between the green and brown lineage and the transition toward land <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s.</p>

Knockdown of Rice MicroRNA166 Confers Drought Resistance by Causing Leaf Rolling and Altering Stem Xylem Development
<p>MicroRNAs are 19- to 22-nucleotide small noncoding RNAs that have been implicated in abiotic stress responses. In this study, we found that knockdown of microRNA166, using the Short Tandem Target Mimic (STTM) sy<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stem</span></strong>, resulted in morphological changes that confer drought resistance in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). From a large-scale screen for miRNA knockdown lines in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>, we identified miR166 knockdown lines (STTM166); these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s exhibit a rolled-leaf phenotype, which is normally displayed by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s under drought stress. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es of STTM166 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s had smaller bulliform cells and abnormal sclerenchymatous cells, likely causing the rolled-leaf phenotype. The STTM166 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s had reduced stomatal conductance and showed decreased transpiration rates. The STTM166 lines also exhibited altered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stem</span></strong> xylem and decreased hydraulic conductivity, likely due to the reduced diameter of the xylem vessels. Molecular analyses identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> <i>HOMEODOMAIN CONTAINING PROTEIN4</i> (<i>OsHB4</i>), a member of HD-Zip III gene family, as a major target of miR166; moreover, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s overexpressing a miR166-resistant form of <i>OsHB4</i> resembled the STTM166 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, including leaf rolling and higher drought resistance. The genes downstream of miR166-<i>OsHB4</i> consisted of polysaccharide synthesis-related genes that may contribute to cell wall formation and vascular development. Our results suggest that drought resistance in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> can be increased by manipulating miRNAs, which leads to developmental changes, such as leaf rolling and reduced diameter of the xylem, that mimic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s’ natural responses to water-deficit stress.</p>

Control of Adventitious Root Architecture in Rice by Darkness, Light, and Gravity
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) is a semi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aquatic pl</span></strong>ant that is well adapted to partial flooding. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stem</span></strong>s develop adventitious root (AR) primordia at each node that slowly mature but emerge only when the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> gets flooded, leading to the formation of a whole new secondary root sy<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stem</span></strong> upon flooding. AR growth is induced by ethylene that accumulates in submerged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> tissues due to its lowered diffusion rate in water. Here, we report that the architecture of the secondary root sy<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stem</span></strong> in flooded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s is controlled not only by altered gas diffusion but also by gravity and light. While ethylene promotes the emergence and growth of ARs, gravity and light determine their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravitrop</span></strong>ic setpoint angle (i.e. the deviation of growth direction relative to vertical). ARs grow upward at about 120° in the dark and downward at 54° in the light. The upward growth direction is conserved in <i>indica</i> and <i>japonica</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> varieties, suggestive of a conserved trait in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>. Experiments with a klinostat and with inverted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stem</span></strong> orientation revealed that gravity promotes upward growth by about 10°. Red, far-red, and blue light lead to negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>ism in a dose-dependent manner, with blue light being most effective, indicating that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phytochrom</span></strong>e and blue light signaling control AR sy<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stem</span></strong> architecture. The <i>cpt1</i> (<i>coleoptile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>ism1</i>) mutant, which lacks one of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>in-interacting CPT proteins, shows reduced sensitivity to blue light. Hence, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravitrop</span></strong>ic setpoint angle of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> ARs is controlled by genetic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>mental factors that likely balance the need for oxygen supply (upward growth) with avoidance of root desiccation (downward growth).</p>

Arabidopsis Responds to <i>Alternaria alternata</i> Volatiles by Triggering Plastid Phosphoglucose Isomerase-Independent Mechanisms
<p>Volatile compounds (VCs) emitted by phylogenetically diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">micro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong></span></strong>isms (including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> pathogens and microbes that do not normally interact mutualistically with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s) promote photosynthesis, growth, and the accumulation of high levels of starch in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es through cytokinin (CK)-regulated processes. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s not exposed to VCs, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>ic phosphoglucose isomerase (pPGI) acts as an important determinant of photosynthesis and growth, likely as a consequence of its involvement in the synthesis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>ic CKs in roots. Moreover, this enzyme plays an important role in connecting the Calvin-Benson cycle with the starch biosynthetic pathway in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. To elucidate the mechanisms involved in the responses of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s to microbial VCs and to investigate the extent of pPGI involvement, we characterized pPGI-null <i>pgi1-2</i> Arabidopsis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s cultured in the presence or absence of VCs emitted by <i>Alternaria alternata</i>. We found that volatile emissions from this fungal phytopathogen promote growth, photosynthesis, and the accumulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>ic CKs in <i>pgi1-2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. Notably, the mesophyll cells of <i>pgi1-2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es accumulated exceptionally high levels of starch following VC exposure. Proteomic analyses revealed that VCs promote global changes in the expression of proteins involved in photosynthesis, starch metabolism, and growth that can account for the observed responses in <i>pgi1-2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. The overall data show that Arabidopsis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s can respond to VCs emitted by phytopathogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">micro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong></span></strong>isms by triggering pPGI-independent mechanisms.</p>

Natural Variation in <i>OsLG3</i> Increases Drought Tolerance in Rice by Inducing ROS Scavenging
<p>Improving the performance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) under drought stress has the potential to significantly affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> productivity. Here, we report that the ERF family transcription factor OsLG3 positively regulates drought tolerance in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>. In our previous work, we found that <i>OsLG3</i> has a positive effect on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> grain length without affecting grain quality. In this study, we found that <i>OsLG3</i> was more strongly expressed in upland <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> than in lowland <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> under drought stress conditions. By performing candidate gene association analysis, we found that natural variation in the promoter of <i>OsLG3</i> is associated with tolerance to osmotic stress in germinating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s. Overexpression of <i>OsLG3</i> significantly improved the tolerance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s to simulated drought, whereas suppression of <i>OsLG3</i> resulted in greater susceptibility. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the tolerant allele of <i>OsLG3</i> may improve drought tolerance in cultivated <i>japonica</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>. Introgression lines and complementation transgenic lines containing the elite allele of <i>OsLG3</i><sup>IRAT109</sup> showed increased drought tolerance, demonstrating that natural variation in <i>OsLG3</i> contributes to drought tolerance in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>. Further investigation suggested that <i>OsLG3</i> plays a positive role in drought stress tolerance in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> by inducing reactive oxygen species scavenging. Collectively, our findings reveal that natural variation in <i>OsLG3</i> contributes to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> drought tolerance and that the elite allele of <i>OsLG3</i> is a promising genetic resource for the development of drought-tolerant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> varieties.</p>

Improving Plant Nitrogen Use Efficiency through Alteration of Amino Acid Transport Processes
<p>Improving the efficiency of nitrogen (N) uptake and utilization in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s could potentially increase crop yields while reducing N fertilization and, subsequently, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>mental pollution. Within most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, N is transported primarily as amino acids. In this study, pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s overexpressing <i>AMINO ACID PERMEASE1</i> (<i>AAP1</i>) were used to determine if and how genetic manipulation of amino acid transport from source to sink affects <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> N use efficiency. The modified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s were grown under low, moderate, or high N fertilization regimes. The results showed that, independent of the N nutrition, the engineered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s allocate more N via the vasculature to the shoot and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s and produce more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> and higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> yields than wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Dependent on the amount of N supplied, the <i>AAP1</i>-overexpressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s displayed improved N uptake or utilization efficiency, or a combination of the two. They also showed significantly increased N use efficiency in N-deficient as well as in N-rich soils and, impressively, required half the amount of N to produce as many fruits and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s as control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Together, these data support that engineering N allocation from source to sink presents an effective strategy to produce crop <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s with improved productivity as well as N use efficiency in a range of N <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments.</p>

Repression of CYSTATHIONINE <i>γ</i>-SYNTHASE in Seeds Recruits the <i>S</i>-Methylmethionine Cycle
<p><i>S</i>-Methylmethionine (SMM) was suggested previously to participate in the metabolism of methionine (Met) in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s. To further reveal its roles, we had previously produced transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) RNA interference (RNAi) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s with lower transcript expression of CYSTATHIONINE γ-SYNTHASE (<i>AtCGS</i>), Met’s main regulatory enzyme. Unexpectedly, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s accumulated significantly higher levels of Met compared with control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s through an as yet unknown mechanism. Here, transcript and metabolic analyses coupled with isotope-labeled [<sup>13</sup>C]SMM and [<sup>13</sup>C]Met feeding experiments enabled us to reveal that SMM that was synthesized in rosette <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es of RNAi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s significantly contributed to the accumulation of Met in their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s at late stages of development. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>-specific repression of <i>AtCGS</i> in RNAi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s triggered the induction of genes operating in the SMM cycle of rosette <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es, leading to elevated transport of SMM toward the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s, where higher reconversion rates of SMM to Met were detected. The metabolic rearrangements in RNAi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s resulted in an altered sulfur-associated metabolism, such as lower amounts of Cys and glutathione, as well as a differential composition of glucosinolates. Together, the data propose a novel cross talk existing between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s and rosette <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es along with mutual effects between the Asp family and SMM pathways operating in these tissues. They also shed light on the effects of higher Met levels on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> physiology and behavior.</p>

The Non-Mendelian Green Cotyledon Gene in Soybean Encodes a Small Subunit of Photosystem II
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l degradation plays important roles in leaf senescence including regulation of degradation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l-binding proteins. Although most genes encoding enzymes of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l degradation pathway have been identified, the regulation of their activity has not been fully understood. Green cotyledon mutants in legume are stay-green mutants, in which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l degradation is impaired during leaf senescence and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> maturation. Among them, the soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) green cotyledon gene <i>cytG</i> is unique because it is maternally inherited. To isolate <i>cytG</i>, we extensively sequenced the soybean chloroplast genome, and detected a 5-bp insertion causing a frame-shift in <i>psbM</i>, which encodes one of the small subunits of photosy<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stem</span></strong> II. Mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tobacco</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) with a disrupted <i>psbM</i> generated using a chloroplast transformation technique had green senescent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es, confirming that <i>cytG</i> encodes PsbM. The phenotype of <i>cytG</i> was very similar to that of mutant of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l <i>b</i> reductase catalyzing the first step of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l <i>b</i> degradation. In fact, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l <i>b</i>-degrading activity in dark-grown <i>cytG</i> and <i>psbM</i>-knockout <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>lings was significantly lower than that of wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Our results suggest that PsbM is a unique protein linking photosynthesis in presenescent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l degradation during leaf senescence and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> maturation. Additionally, we discuss the origin of <i>cytG</i>, which may have been selected during domestication of soybean.</p>

Deetiolation Enhances Phototropism by Modulating NON-PHOTOTROPIC HYPOCOTYL3 Phosphorylation Status
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>in (phot) receptor kinases play important roles in promoting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth by controlling light-capturing processes, such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>ism. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>ism is mediated through the action of NON-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>IC HYPOCOTYL3 (NPH3), which is dephosphorylated following phot activation. However, the functional significance of this early signaling event remains unclear. Here, we show that the onset of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>ism in dark-grown (etiolated) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>lings of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) is enhanced by greening (deetiolation). Red and blue light were equally effective in promoting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>ism in Arabidopsis, consistent with our observations that deetiolation by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phytochrom</span></strong>e or cryptochrome was sufficient to enhance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>ism. Increased responsiveness did not result from an enhanced sensitivity to the phytohormone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>, nor does it involve the phot-interacting protein, ROOT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>ISM2. Instead, deetiolated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>lings showed attenuated levels of NPH3 dephosphorylation and diminished relocalization of NPH3 from the plasma membrane during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>ism. Likewise, etiolated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>lings that lack the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phytochrom</span></strong>E-INTERACTING FACTORS (PIFs) PIF1, PIF3, PIF4, and PIF5 displayed reduced NPH3 dephosphorylation and enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>ism, consistent with their constitutive photomorphogenic phenotype in darkness. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>ic enhancement could also be achieved in etiolated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>lings by lowering the light intensity to diminish NPH3 dephosphorylation. Thus, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phototrop</span></strong>ism is enhanced following deetiolation through the modulation of a phosphorylation rheostat, which in turn sustains the activity of NPH3. We propose that this dynamic mode of regulation enables young <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>lings to maximize their establishment under changing light conditions, depending on their photoautotrophic capacity.</p>

Modulation of Auxin Signaling and Development by Polyadenylation Machinery
<p>Polyadenylation influences gene expression by affecting mRNA stability, transport, and translatability. Here, we report that C<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>age stimulation Factor 77 (AtCstF77), a component of the pre-mRNA 3′-end polyadenylation machinery, affects polyadenylation site (PAS) selection in transcripts of some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling genes in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Disruption of <i>AtCstF77</i> reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> sensitivity and decreased the expression of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> reporter <i>DR5</i>-<i>GFP</i>. Null mutations of <i>cstf77</i> caused severe developmental defects, but were not lethal as previously reported. <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> genetically interacted with <i>transport inhibitor response 1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling f</i>-<i>box 2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> receptor double mutants, further supporting that polyadenylation affects <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling. <i>AtCstF77</i> was ubiquitously expressed in embryos, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>lings, and adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. The AtCstF77 protein was localized in the nucleus, which is consistent with its function in pre-mRNA processing. We observed that PASs in transcripts from approximately 2,400 genes were shifted in the <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> mutant. Moreover, most of the PAS shifts were from proximal to distal sites. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> treatment also caused PAS shifts in transcripts from a small number of genes. Several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling or homeostasis genes had different PASs in their transcripts in the <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> mutant. The expression levels of <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> RESISTANT 2</i>/<i>INDOLE</i>-<i>3</i>-<i>ACETIC ACID 7</i> were significantly increased in the <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> mutant, which can partially account for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> resistance phenotype of this mutant. Our results demonstrate that AtCstF77 plays pleiotropic and critical roles in Arabidopsis development. Moreover, disruption of AtCstF64, another component of the polyadenylation machinery, led to developmental defects and reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> response, similar to those of the <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> mutant. We conclude that AtCstF77 affects <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> responses, likely by controlling PAS selection of transcripts of some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling components.</p>

Root Gravitropism Is Regulated by a Crosstalk between <i>para</i>-Aminobenzoic Acid, Ethylene, and Auxin
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s respond to gravitational force through directional growth along the gravity vector. Although <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> is the central component of the root graviresponse, it works in concert with other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> hormones. Here, we show that the folate precursor <i>para</i>-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) is a key modulator of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-ethylene interplay during root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravitrop</span></strong>ism in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). In gravistimulated roots, PABA promotes an asymmetric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> response, which causes the asymmetric growth responsible for root curvature. This activity requires the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> response transcription factors <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> RESPONSE FACTOR7 (ARF7) and ARF19 as well as ethylene biosynthesis and signaling, indicating that PABA activity requires both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> and ethylene pathways. Similar to ethylene, exogenous PABA reverses the a<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravitrop</span></strong>ic root growth of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport mutant <i>pin-formed2</i> (<i>pin2</i>) and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> biosynthetic double mutant with loss of function of <i>weak ethylene insensitive</i> (<i>wei</i>) genes, <i>wei8wei2</i>, but not the <i>pin2wei8wei2</i> triple mutant. This finding suggests that PABA regulates the ethylene-dependent reciprocal compensation between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> transport and biosynthesis. Furthermore, manipulation of endogenous free PABA levels by modulating the expression of the gene encoding its glucosylation enzyme, UDP-GLYCOSYL TRANSFERASE75B1, impacts the root graviresponse, suggesting that endogenous free PABA levels may play a crucial role in modulating the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-ethylene cross talk necessary for root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravitrop</span></strong>ism.</p>

Mutations in <i>FAB1A</i> to <i>FAB1D</i>, the genes encoding phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate [PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>]-converting kinases, are male gametophyte lethal in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) due to defective vacuolar fission after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> mitosis I, suggesting a key role of the phospholipid in dynamic vacuolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ization. However, other genetic components that regulate the production of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> and its involvement in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> germination and tube growth are unknown. Here, we identified and characterized Arabidopsis VAC14, a homolog of the yeast and metazoan VAC14s that are crucial for the production of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>. <i>VAC14</i> is constitutively expressed and highly present in developing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>. Loss of function of <i>VAC14</i> was male gametophyte lethal due to defective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> development. Ultrastructural studies showed that vacuolar fission after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> mitosis I was compromised in <i>vac14</i> mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microspor</span></strong>es, which led to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> abortion. We further showed that inhibiting the production of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> or exogenous application of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> mimicked or rescued the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> developmental defect of the <i>vac14</i> mutant, respectively. Genetic interference and pharmacological approaches suggested a role of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> germination and tube growth.

A Maternally Deposited Endosperm Cuticle Contributes to the Physiological Defects of <i>transparent testa</i> Seeds
<p>Mature dry <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s are highly resilient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> structures where the encapsulated embryo is kept protected and dormant to facilitate its ultimate dispersion. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">viabil</span></strong>ity is heavily dependent on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> c<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oat</span></strong>’s capacity to shield living tissues from mechanical and oxidative stress. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> c<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oat</span></strong>, also called the testa, arises after the differentiation of maternal ovular integuments during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> development. We recently described a thick cuticle tightly embedded in the mature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>’s endosperm cell wall. We show here that it is produced by the maternal inner integument 1 layer and, remarkably, transferred to the developing endosperm. Arabidopsis <i>transparent testa</i> (<i>tt</i>) mutations cause maternally derived <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> c<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oat</span></strong> pigmentation defects. <i>TT</i> gene products encode proteins involved in flavonoid metabolism and regulators of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> c<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oat</span></strong> development. <i>tt</i> mutants have abnormally high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> c<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oat</span></strong> permeability, resulting in lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">viabil</span></strong>ity and dormancy. However, the biochemical basis of this high permeability is not fully understood. We show that the cuticles of developing <i>tt</i> mutant integuments have profound structural defects, which are associated with enhanced cuticle permeability. Genetic analysis indicates that a functional proanthocyanidin synthesis pathway is required to limit cuticle permeability, and our results suggest that proanthocyanidins could be intrinsic components of the cuticle. Together, these results show that the formation of a maternal cuticle is an intrinsic part of the normal integumental differentiation program leading to testa formation and is essential for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>’s physiological properties.</p>

Auxin Efflux Carrier ZmPGP1 Mediates Root Growth Inhibition under Aluminum Stress
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> has been shown to enhance root growth inhibition under aluminum (Al) stress in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). However, in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> may play a negative role in the Al-induced inhibition of root growth. In this study, we identified mutants deficient in the maize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> efflux carrier P-glycoprotein (ZmPGP1) after ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis and used them to elucidate the contribution of ZmPGP1 to Al-induced root growth inhibition. Root growth in the <i>zmpgp1</i> mutant, which forms shortened roots and is hyposensitive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>, was less inhibited by Al stress than that in the inbred line B73. In the <i>zmpgp1</i> mutants, the root tips displayed higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> accumulation and enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling under Al stress, which was also consistent with the increased expression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-responsive genes. Based on the behavior of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-responsive marker transgene, <i>DR5rev:RFP</i>, we concluded that Al stress reduced the level of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> in the root tip, which contrasts with the tendency of Al stress-induced Arabidopsis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s to accumulate more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> in their root tips. In addition, Al stress induced the expression of <i>ZmPGP1</i>. Therefore, in maize, Al stress is associated with reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> accumulation in root tips, a process that is regulated by ZmPGP1 and thus causes inhibition of root growth. This study provides further evidence about the role of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> polar transport in Al-induced root growth regulation in maize.</p>

Arabidopsis <i>LORELEI</i>, a Maternally Expressed Imprinted Gene, Promotes Early Seed Development
<p>In flowering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, the female gametophyte controls <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube reception immediately before fertilization and regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> development immediately after fertilization, although the controlling mechanisms remain poorly understood. Previously, we showed that <i>LORELEI</i> (<i>LRE</i>), which encodes a putative glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane protein, is critical for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube reception by the female gametophyte before fertilization and the initiation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> development after fertilization. Here, we show that <i>LRE</i> is expressed in the synergid, egg, and central cells of the female gametophyte and in the zygote and proliferating endosperm of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>. Interestingly, <i>LRE</i> expression in the developing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s was primarily from the matrigenic <i>LRE</i> allele, indicating that <i>LRE</i> expression is imprinted. However, <i>LRE</i> was biallelically expressed in 8-d-old <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>lings, indicating that the patrigenic allele does not remain silenced throughout the sporophytic generation. Regulation of imprinted <i>LRE</i> expression is likely novel, as <i>LRE</i> was not expressed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes of mutants defective for MET1, DDM1, RNA-dependent DNA methylation, or MSI-dependent histone methylation. Additionally, the patrigenic <i>LRE</i> allele inherited from these mutants was not expressed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s. Surprisingly, and contrary to the predictions of the parental conflict hypothesis, LRE promotes growth in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s, as loss of the matrigenic but not the patrigenic <i>LRE</i> allele caused delayed initiation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> development. Our results showed that <i>LRE</i> is a rare imprinted gene that functions immediately after double fertilization and supported the model that a passage through the female gametophyte establishes monoalleleic expression of <i>LRE</i> in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s and controls early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> development.</p>

Efficient Plastid Transformation in Arabidopsis
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> transformation is routine in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tobacco</span></strong> (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) but 100-fold less frequent in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), preventing its use in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> biology. A recent study revealed that null mutations in <i>ACC2</i>, encoding a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>-targeted acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase, cause hypersensitivity to spectinomycin. We hypothesized that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> transformation efficiency should increase in the <i>acc2</i> background, because when ACC2 is absent, fatty acid biosynthesis becomes dependent on translation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>-encoded ACC β-carboxylase subunit. We bombarded <i>ACC2</i>-defective Arabidopsis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es with a vector carrying a selectable spectinomycin resistance (<i>aadA</i>) gene and <i>gfp</i>, encoding the green fluorescence protein GFP. Spectinomycin-resistant clones were identified as green cell clusters on a spectinomycin medium. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> transformation was confirmed by GFP accumulation from the second open reading frame of a polycistronic messenger RNA, which would not be translated in the cytoplasm. We obtained one to two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> transformation events per bombarded sample in spectinomycin-hypersensitive Slavice and Columbia <i>acc2</i> knockout backgrounds, an approximately 100-fold enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> transformation frequency. Slavice and Columbia are accessions in which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> regeneration is uncharacterized or difficult to obtain. A practical sy<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stem</span></strong> for Arabidopsis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> transformation will be obtained by creating an <i>ACC2</i> null background in a regenerable Arabidopsis accession. The recognition that the duplicated ACCase in Arabidopsis is an impediment to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> transformation provides a rational template to implement <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> transformation in related recalcitrant crops.</p>

Leaf Photosynthetic Parameters Related to Biomass Accumulation in a Global Rice Diversity Survey
<p>Mining natural variations is a major approach to identify new options to improve crop light use efficiency. So far, successes in identifying photosynthetic parameters positively related to crop <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> accumulation through this approach are scarce, possibly due to the earlier emphasis on properties related to leaf instead of canopy photosynthetic efficiency. This study aims to uncover <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) natural variations to identify leaf physiological parameters that are highly correlated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> accumulation, a surrogate of canopy photosynthesis. To do this, we sy<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stem</span></strong>atically investigated 14 photosynthetic parameters and four morphological traits in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> population, which consists of 204 U.S. Department of Agriculture-curated minicore accessions collected globally and 11 elite Chinese <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> cultivars in both Beijing and Shanghai. To identify key components responsible for the variance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> accumulation, we applied a stepwise feature-selection approach based on linear regression models. Although there are large variations in photosynthetic parameters measured in different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments, we observed that photosynthetic rate under low light (A<sub>low</sub>) was highly related to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> accumulation and also exhibited high genomic inheritability in both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments, suggesting its great potential to be used as a target for future <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> breeding programs. Large variations in A<sub>low</sub> among modern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> cultivars further suggest the great potential of using this parameter in contemporary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> breeding for the improvement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomass</span></strong> and, hence, yield potential.</p>

Enhanced Secondary- and Hormone Metabolism in Leaves of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal <i>Medicago truncatula</i>
<p>Arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM) are the most common symbiotic associations between a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>’s root compartment and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fungi</span></strong>. They provide nutritional benefit (mostly in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ic phosphate [P<sub>i</sub>]), leading to improved growth, and nonnutritional benefits, including defense responses to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>mental cues throughout the host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>, which, in return, delivers carbohydrates to the symbiont. However, how transcriptional and metabolic changes occurring in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es of AM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s differ from those induced by P<sub>i</sub> fertilization is poorly understood. We investigated sy<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stem</span></strong>ic changes in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es of mycorrhized <i>Medicago truncatula</i> in conditions with no improved P<sub>i</sub> status and compared them with those induced by high-P<sub>i</sub> treatment in nonmycorrhized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Microarray-based genome-wide profiling indicated up-regulation by mycorrhization of genes involved in flavonoid, terpenoid, jasmonic acid (JA), and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abscisic acid</span></strong> (ABA) biosynthesis as well as enhanced expression of <i>MYC2</i>, the master regulator of JA-dependent responses. Accordingly, total anthocyanins and flavonoids increased, and most flavonoid species were enriched in AM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. Both the AM and P<sub>i</sub> treatments corepressed iron homeostasis genes, resulting in lower levels of available iron in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. In addition, higher levels of cytokinins were found in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es of AM- and P<sub>i</sub>-treated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, whereas the level of ABA was increased specifically in AM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. Foliar treatment of nonmycorrhized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s with either ABA or JA induced the up-regulation of <i>MYC2</i>, but only JA also induced the up-regulation of flavonoid and terpenoid biosynthetic genes. Based on these results, we propose that mycorrhization and P<sub>i</sub> fertilization share cytokinin-mediated improved shoot growth, whereas enhanced ABA biosynthesis and JA-regulated flavonoid and terpenoid biosynthesis in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es are specific to mycorrhization.</p>

Importance of Fluctuations in Light on Plant Photosynthetic Acclimation
<p>The acclimation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s to light has been studied extensively, yet little is known about the effect of dynamic fluctuations in light on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> phenotype and acclimatory responses. We mimicked natural fluctuations in light over a diurnal period to examine the effect on the photosynthetic processes and growth of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). High and low light intensities, delivered via a realistic dynamic fluctuating or square wave pattern, were used to grow and assess <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s subjected to square wave light had thicker <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es and greater photosynthetic capacity compared with fluctuating light-grown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. This, together with elevated levels of proteins associated with electron transport, indicates greater investment in leaf structural components and photosynthetic processes. In contrast, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s grown under fluctuating light had thinner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es, lower leaf light absorption, but maintained similar photosynthetic rates per unit leaf area to square wave-grown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Despite high light use efficiency, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s grown under fluctuating light had a slow growth rate early in development, likely due to the fact that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s grown under fluctuating conditions were not able to fully utilize the light energy absorbed for carbon fixation. Diurnal leaf-level measurements revealed a negative feedback control of photosynthesis, resulting in a decrease in total diurnal carbon assimilated of at least 20%. These findings highlight that growing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s under square wave growth conditions ultimately fails to predict <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> performance under realistic light regimes and stress the importance of considering fluctuations in incident light in future experiments that aim to infer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> productivity under natural conditions in the field.</p>

A Rice Ca<sup>2+</sup> Binding Protein Is Required for Tapetum Function and Pollen Formation
<p>In flowering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, successful male reproduction requires the sophisticated interaction between somatic anther wall layers and reproductive cells. Timely degradation of the innermost tissue of the anther wall layer, the ta<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">petal</span></strong> layer, is critical for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> development. Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a well-known stimulus for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> development, but whether it plays a role in affecting male reproduction remains elusive. Here we report a role of Defective in Exine Formation 1 (OsDEX1) in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), a Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding protein, in regulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> ta<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">petal</span></strong> cell degradation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> formation. In <i>osdex1</i> anthers, ta<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">petal</span></strong> cell degeneration is delayed and degradation of the callose wall surrounding the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microspor</span></strong>es is compromised, leading to aborted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> formation and complete male sterility. <i>OsDEX1</i> is expressed in ta<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">petal</span></strong> cells and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microspor</span></strong>es during early anther development. Recombinant OsDEX1 is able to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> and regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in vitro, and <i>osdex1</i> exhibited disturbed Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in ta<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">petal</span></strong> cells. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that OsDEX1 may have a conserved function in binding Ca<sup>2+</sup> in flowering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, and genetic complementation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> wall defects of an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>dex1</i> mutant confirmed its evolutionary conservation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> development. Collectively, these findings suggest that OsDEX1 plays a fundamental role in the development of ta<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">petal</span></strong> cells and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> formation, possibly via modulating the Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> development.</p>

Genome-Wide Development and Use of Microsatellite Markers for Large-Scale Genotyping Applications in Foxtail Millet [<i>Setaria italica</i> (L.)]
<p>The availability of well-validated informative co-dominant microsatellite markers and saturated genetic linkage map has been limited in foxtail <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">millet</span></strong> (<i>Setaria italica</i> L.). In view of this, we conducted a genome-wide analysis and identified 28 342 microsatellite repeat-motifs spanning 405.3 Mb of foxtail <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">millet</span></strong> genome. The trinucleotide repeats (∼48%) was prevalent when compared with dinucleotide repeats (∼46%). Of the 28 342 microsatellites, 21 294 (∼75%) primer pairs were successfully designed, and a total of 15 573 markers were physically mapped on 9 chromosomes of foxtail <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">millet</span></strong>. About 159 markers were validated successfully in 8 accessions of <i>Setaria</i> sp. with ∼67% polymorphic potential. The high percentage (89.3%) of cross-genera transferability across <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">millet</span></strong> and non-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">millet</span></strong> species with higher transferability percentage in bioenergy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grass</span></strong>es (∼79%, Switch<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grass</span></strong> and ∼93%, Pearl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">millet</span></strong>) signifies their importance in studying the bioenergy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grass</span></strong>es. <i>In silico</i> comparative mapping of 15 573 foxtail <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">millet</span></strong> microsatellite markers against the mapping data of sorghum (16.9%), maize (14.5%) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> (6.4%) indicated syntenic relationships among the chromosomes of foxtail <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">millet</span></strong> and target species.

SEED CAROTENOID DEFICIENT Functions in Isoprenoid Biosynthesis via the Plastid MEP Pathway
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> isoprenoids, a diverse group of compounds that includes carotenoids, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>ls, tocopherols, and multiple hormones, are essential for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth and development. Here, we identified and characterized <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> CAROTENOID DEFICIENT</i> (<i>SCD</i>), which encodes an enzyme that functions in the biosynthesis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> isoprenoids in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). SCD converts 2<i>C</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-erytrithol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate to 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl 4-diphosphate in the penultimate step of the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway. In <i>scd</i> mutants, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth and development are impaired and the levels of MEP-derived isoprenoids, such as carotenoids, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>ls, and tocopherols, as well as abscisic and gibberellic acids, are reduced in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s. This <i>scd</i> metabolic alteration varies among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> tissues and under different light conditions. RNA-sequencing of the <i>scd</i> mutant and wild type identified a limited number of differentially expressed genes in the MEP pathway, although isoprenoid levels were significantly reduced in <i>scd</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s and dark-grown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. Furthermore, <i>SCD</i>-overexpressing transgenic lines showed little or no differences in isoprenoid levels, indicating that SCD may be subject to posttranslational regulation or not represent a rate-limiting step in the MEP pathway. These results enhance our understanding of the transcriptomic and metabolic regulatory roles of enzymes in the MEP pathway and of their effects on downstream isoprenoid pathways in various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> tissues and under different light conditions.</p>

Dynamics of the Pollen Sequestrome Defined by Subcellular Coupled Omics
<p>Reproduction success in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiosperm</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s depends on robust <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth through the female pistil tissues to ensure successful fertilization. Accordingly, there is an apparent evolutionary trend to accumulate significant reserves during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> maturation, including a population of stored mRNAs, that are utilized later for a massive translation of various proteins in growing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes. Here, we performed a thorough transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of stored and translated transcripts in three subcellular compartments of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tobacco</span></strong> (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>), long-term storage EDTA/puromycin-resistant particles, translating polysomes, and free ribonuclear particles, throughout <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tobacco</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> development and in in vitro-growing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes. We demonstrated that the composition of the aforementioned complexes is not rigid and that numerous transcripts were redistributed among these complexes during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> development, which may represent an important mechanism of translational regulation. Therefore, we defined the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> sequestrome as a distinct and highly dynamic compartment for the storage of stable, translationally repressed transcripts and demonstrated its dynamics. We propose that EDTA/puromycin-resistant particle complexes represent aggregated nontranslating monosomes as the primary mediators of messenger RNA sequestration. Such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ization is extremely useful in fast tip-growing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes, where rapid and orchestrated protein synthesis must take place in specific regions.</p>

The ADAPTOR PROTEIN-3 Complex Mediates Pollen Tube Growth by Coordinating Vacuolar Targeting and Organization
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth is an essential step for successful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> reproduction. Vacuolar trafficking and dynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ization are important for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth; however, the key proteins involved in these processes are not well understood. Here, we report that the ADAPTOR PROTEIN-3 (AP-3) complex and its tonoplast cargo PROTEIN S-ACYL TRANSFERASE10 (PAT10) are critical for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). AP-3 is a heterotetrameric protein complex consisting of four subunits, δ, β, µ, and σ. AP-3 regulates tonoplast targeting of several cargoes, such as PAT10. We show that functional loss of any of the four AP-3 subunits reduces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> fertility. In <i>ap-3</i> mutants, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> development was normal but <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth was compromised, leading to reduced male transmission. Functional loss of <i>PAT10</i> caused a similar reduction in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth, suggesting that the tonoplast association of PAT10 mediated by AP-3 is crucial for this process. Indeed, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> gradient during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth was reduced significantly due to <i>AP-3</i> loss of function, consistent with the abnormal targeting of CALCINUERIN B-LIKE2 (CBL2) and CBL3, whose tonoplast association depends on PAT10. Furthermore, we show that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes of <i>ap-3</i> mutants have vacuoles with simplified tubules and bulbous structures, indicating that AP-3 affects vacuolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ization. Our results demonstrate a role for AP-3 in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> reproduction and provide insights into the role of vacuoles in polarized cell growth.</p>

<i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> Induces the Expression of a MicroRNA to Suppress the Immune Response in Rice
<p>MicroRNAs play crucial roles in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> responses to pathogen infections. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> blast disease, caused by the fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>, is the most important disease of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). To explore the microRNA species that participate in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> immunity against the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> blast disease, we compared the expression of small RNAs between mock- and <i>M. oryzae</i>-treated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>. We found that infection by <i>M. oryzae</i> strain Guy11 specifically induced the expression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> miR319 and, consequently, suppressed its target gene <i>TEOSINTE BRANCHED/CYCLOIDEA/PROLIFERATING CELL FACTOR1</i> (<i>OsTCP21</i>), which encodes a transcription factor. Using transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> that overexpresses miR319b (OE) or expresses <i>OsTCP21</i>-Res (which is resistant to miR319-mediated silencing), we found that <i>OsTCP21</i> is a positive regulator of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> defense response against the blast disease. When wild-type and miR319b-OE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> were infected by Guy11, multiple jasmonic acid (JA) synthetic and signaling components were suppressed, indicating that Guy11 suppresses JA signaling through inducing miR319. In particular, we found that <i>LIPOXYGENASE2</i> (<i>LOX2</i>) and <i>LOX5</i> were specifically suppressed by miR319 overexpression or by Guy11 infection. LOXs are the key enzymes of JA synthesis, which catalyze the conversion of α-linoleic acid to hydroperoxy-octadecadienoic acid. The application of α-linoleic acid rescued disease symptoms on the <i>OsTCP21</i>-Res <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> but not wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>, supporting our hypothesis that <i>OsLOX2</i> and <i>OsLOX5</i> are the key JA synthesis genes hijacked by Guy11 to subvert host immunity and facilitate pathogenicity. We propose that induced expression of <i>OsLOX2/5</i> may improve resistance to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> blast disease.</p>

SEIPIN Proteins Mediate Lipid Droplet Biogenesis to Promote Pollen Transmission and Reduce Seed Dormancy
<p>Lipid droplets (LDs) are ubiquitous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>elles in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> cells, but their physiological roles are largely unknown. To gain insight into the function of LDs in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, we have characterized the Arabidopsis homologs of SEIPIN proteins, which are crucial factors for LD biogenesis in yeast and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anim</span></strong>als. <i>SEIPIN1</i> is expressed almost exclusively in embryos, while <i>SEIPIN2</i> and <i>SEIPIN3</i> have broader expression profiles with maximal levels in embryos and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>, where LDs accumulate most abundantly. Genetic analysis demonstrates that all three <i>SEIPINs</i> contribute to proper LD biogenesis in embryos, whereas in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>, only <i>SEIPIN2</i> and <i>SEIPIN3</i> play a significant role. The double <i>seipin2 seipin3</i> and triple <i>seipin</i> mutants accumulate extremely enlarged LDs in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>, which hinders their subsequent mobilization during germination. Interestingly, electron microscopy analysis reveals the presence of nuclear LDs attached to type I nucleoplasmic reticulum in triple <i>seipin</i> mutant embryos, supporting that SEIPINs are essential for maintaining the correct polarity of LD budding at the nuclear envelope, restricting it to the outer membrane. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>, the perturbations in LD biogenesis and turnover are coupled to reduced germination in vitro and with lower fertilization efficiency in vivo. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s, germination per se is not affected in <i>seipin2 seipin3</i> and triple <i>seipin</i> mutants, but there is a striking increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> dormancy levels. Our findings reveal the relevance of SEIPIN-dependent LD biogenesis in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> transmission and in adjusting the timing of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> germination, two key adaptive traits of great importance in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">agricultur</span></strong>e.</p>

<p>The loss of photosynthesis is frequently associated with parasitic or pathogenic lifestyles, but it also can occur in free-living, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>-bearing lineages. A common consequence of becoming nonphotosynthetic is the reduction in size and gene content of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> genome. In exceptional circumstances, it can even result in the complete loss of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> DNA (ptDNA) and its associated gene expression sy<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stem</span></strong>, as reported recently in several lineages, including the nonphotosynthetic green <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong>l genus <i>Polytomella</i>. Closely related to <i>Polytomella</i> is the polyphyletic genus <i>Polytoma</i>, the members of which lost photosynthesis independently of <i>Polytomella</i>. Species from both genera are free-living <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>isms that contain nonphotosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s, but unlike <i>Polytomella</i>, <i>Polytoma</i> members have retained a genome in their colorless <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>. Here, we present the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> genome of <i>Polytoma uvella</i>: to our knowledge, the first report of ptDNA from a nonphotosynthetic chlamydomonadalean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong>. The <i>P. uvella</i> ptDNA contains 25 protein-coding genes, most of which are related to gene expression and none are connected to photosynthesis. However, despite its reduced coding capacity, the <i>P. uvella</i> ptDNA is inflated with short repeats and is tens of kilobases larger than the ptDNAs of its closest known photosynthetic relatives, <i>Chlamydomonas leiostraca</i> and <i>Chlamydomonas applanata</i>. In fact, at approximately 230 kb, the ptDNA of <i>P. uvella</i> represents the largest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> genome currently reported from a nonphotosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong> or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>. Overall, the <i>P. uvella</i> and <i>Polytomella</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> genomes reveal two very different evolutionary paths following the loss of photosynthesis: expansion and complete deletion, respectively. We hypothesize that recombination-based DNA-repair mechanisms are at least partially responsible for the different evolutionary outcomes observed in such closely related nonphotosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alga</span></strong>e.</p>

Identification of a Hexenal Reductase That Modulates the Composition of Green Leaf Volatiles
<p>Green leaf volatiles (GLVs), including six-carbon (C6) aldehydes, alcohols, and esters, are formed when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> tissues are damaged. GLVs play roles in direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> defense at wound sites, indirect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> defense via the attraction of herbivore predators, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> communication. GLV components provoke distinctive responses in their target recipients; therefore, the control of GLV composition is important for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s to appropriately manage stress responses. The reduction of C6-aldehydes into C6-alcohols is a key step in the control of GLV composition and also is important to avoid a toxic buildup of C6-aldehydes. However, the molecular mechanisms behind C6-aldehyde reduction remain poorly understood. In this study, we purified an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) NADPH-dependent cinnamaldehyde and hexenal reductase encoded by At4g37980, named here CINNAMALDEHYDE AND HEXENAL REDUCTASE (CHR). <i>CHR</i> T-DNA knockout mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s displayed a normal growth phenotype; however, we observed significant suppression of C6-alcohol production following partial mechanical wounding or herbivore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infest</span></strong>ation. Our data also showed that the parasitic wasp <i>Cotesia vestalis</i> was more attracted to GLVs emitted from herbivore-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infest</span></strong>ed wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s compared with GLVs emitted from <i>chr</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, which corresponded with reduced C6-alcohol levels in the mutant. Moreover, <i>chr</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s were more susceptible to exogenous high-dose exposure to (<i>Z</i>)-3-hexenal, as indicated by their markedly lowered photosy<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stem</span></strong> II activity. Our study shows that reductases play significant roles in changing GLV composition and, thus, are important in avoiding toxicity from volatile carbonyls and in the attraction of herbivore predators.</p>

SMALL AUXIN UP RNA62/75 Are Required for the Translation of Transcripts Essential for Pollen Tube Growth
<p>Successful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube elongation is critical for double fertilization, but the biological functions of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube genes and the regulatory machinery underlying this crucial process are largely unknown. A previous translatomic study revealed two Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>SAUR</i> (<i>SMALL AUXIN UP RNA</i>) genes, <i>SAUR62</i> and <i>SAUR75</i>, whose expression is up-regulated by pollination. Here, we found that both SAUR62 and SAUR75 localized mainly to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube nuclei. The siliques of homozygous <i>saur62</i> (<i>saur62/−</i>), <i>saur75</i> (<i>saur75/−</i>), and the <i>SAUR62</i>/<i>75</i> RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown line had many aborted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s. These lines had normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">viabil</span></strong>ity but defective in vitro and in vivo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth, with branching phenotypes. Immunoprecipitation with transgenic SAUR62/75-GFP flowers revealed ribosomal protein RPL12 family members as potential interacting partners, and their individual interactions were confirmed further by yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays. Polysome profiling showed reduced 80S ribosome abundance in homozygous <i>saur62</i>, <i>saur75</i>, <i>ribosomal large subunit12c</i>, and <i>SAUR62/75</i> RNAi flowers, suggesting that SAUR62/75 play roles in ribosome assembly. To clarify their roles in translation, we analyzed total proteins from RNAi versus wild-type flowers by isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation, revealing significantly reduced expression of factors participating in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube wall biogenesis and F-actin dynamics, which are critical for the elastic properties of tube elongation. Indeed, RNAi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes showed mislocalization of deesterified and esterified pectins and F-actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ization. Thus, the biological roles of SAUR62/75 and their RPL12 partners are critical in ribosomal pre-60S subunit assembly for efficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube elongation and subsequent fertilization.</p>

Jasmonic Acid Inhibits Auxin-Induced Lateral Rooting Independently of the CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 Receptor
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> root sy<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stem</span></strong>s are indispensable for water uptake, nutrient acquisition, and anchoring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s in the soil. Previous studies using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> inhibitors definitively established that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> plays a central role regulating root growth and development. Most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> inhibitors affect all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling at the same time, which obscures an understanding of individual events. Here, we report that jasmonic acid (JA) functions as a lateral root (LR)-preferential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> inhibitor in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) in a manner that is independent of the JA receptor, CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 (COI1). Treatment of wild-type Arabidopsis with either (−)-JA or (+)-JA reduced primary root length and LR number; the reduction of LR number was also observed in <i>coi1</i> mutants. Treatment of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>lings with (−)-JA or (+)-JA suppressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-inducible genes related to LR formation, diminished accumulation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> reporter <i>DR5::GUS</i>, and inhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>-dependent DII-VENUS degradation. A structural mimic of (−)-JA and (+)-coronafacic acid also inhibited LR formation and stabilized DII-VENUS protein. COI1-independent activity was retained in the double mutant of <i>transport inhibitor response1</i> and <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong> signaling f-box protein2</i> (<i>tir1 afb2</i>) but reduced in the <i>afb5</i> single mutant. These results reveal JAs and (+)-coronafacic acid to be selective counter-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auxin</span></strong>s, a finding that could lead to new approaches for studying the mechanisms of LR formation.</p>

A Putative Protein <i>O</i>-Fucosyltransferase Facilitates Pollen Tube Penetration through the Stigma<i>–</i>Style Interface
<p>During <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>-pistil interactions in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiosperm</span></strong>s, the male gametophyte (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>) germinates to produce a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube. To fertilize ovules located within the female pistil, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube must physically penetrate specialized tissues. Whereas the process of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube penetration through the pistil has been anatomically well described, the genetic regulation remains poorly understood. In this study, we identify a novel Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) gene, <i>O-FUCOSYLTRANSFERASE1</i> (<i>AtOFT1</i>), which plays a key role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube penetration through the stigma-style interface. Semi-in vivo growth assays demonstrate that <i>oft1</i> mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes have a reduced ability to penetrate the stigma-style interface, leading to a nearly 2,000-fold decrease in <i>oft1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> transmission efficiency and a 5- to 10-fold decreased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> set. We also demonstrate that AtOFT1 is localized to the Golgi apparatus, indicating its potential role in cellular glycosylation events. Finally, we demonstrate that <i>AtOFT1</i> and other similar Arabidopsis genes represent a novel clade of sequences related to metazoan protein <i>O</i>-fucosyltransferases and that mutation of residues that are important for <i>O</i>-fucosyltransferase activity compromises AtOFT1 function in vivo. The results of this study elucidate a physiological function for AtOFT1 in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube penetration through the stigma-style interface and highlight the potential importance of protein <i>O</i>-glycosylation events in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong>-pistil interactions.</p>

SIPP, a Novel Mitochondrial Phosphate Carrier, Mediates in Self-Incompatibility
<p>In Solanaceae, the <i>S</i>-specific interaction between the pistil S-RNase and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> <i>S</i>-Locus F-box protein controls self-incompatibility (SI). Although this interaction defines the specificity of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> rejection response, the identification of three pistil essential modifier genes unlinked to the <i>S</i>-locus (<i>HT-B</i>, <i>120K</i>, and <i>NaStEP</i>) unveils a higher degree of complexity in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> rejection pathway. We showed previously that NaStEP, a stigma protein with homology with Kunitz-type protease inhibitors, is essential to SI in <i>Nicotiana</i> spp. During pollination, NaStEP is taken up by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes, where potential interactions with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube proteins might underlie its function. Here, we identified NaSIPP, a mitochondrial protein with phosphate transporter activity, as a novel NaStEP-interacting protein. Coexpression of NaStEP and NaSIPP in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes showed interaction in the mitochondria, although when expressed alone, NaStEP remains mostly cytosolic, implicating NaSIPP-mediated translocation of NaStEP into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>elle. The <i>NaSIPP</i> transcript is detected specifically in mature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> of <i>Nicotiana</i> spp.; however, in self-compatible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, this gene has accumulated mutations, so its coding region is unlikely to produce a functional protein. RNA interference suppression of NaSIPP in <i>Nicotiana</i> spp. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> grains disrupts the SI by preventing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube inhibition. Taken together, our results are consistent with a model whereby the NaStEP and NaSIPP interaction, in incompatible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tubes, might destabilize the mitochondria and contribute to arrest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollen</span></strong> tube growth.</p>

Seasonal Regulation of Petal Number
<p>Four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">petal</span></strong>s characterize the flowers of most species in the Brassicaceae family, and this phenotype is generally robust to genetic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>mental variation. A variable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">petal</span></strong> number distinguishes the flowers of <i>Cardamine hirsuta</i> from those of its close relative Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), and allelic variation at many loci contribute to this trait. However, it is less clear whether <i>C. hirsuta</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">petal</span></strong> number varies in response to seasonal changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment. To address this question, we assessed whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">petal</span></strong> number responds to a suite of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>mental and endogenous cues that regulate flowering time in <i>C. hirsuta</i>. We found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">petal</span></strong> number showed seasonal variation in <i>C. hirsuta</i>, such that spring flowering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s developed more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">petal</span></strong>s than those flowering in summer. Conditions associated with spring flowering, including cool ambient temperature, short photoperiod, and vernalization, all increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">petal</span></strong> number in <i>C. hirsuta</i>. Cool temperature caused the strongest increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">petal</span></strong> number and lengthened the time interval over which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flora</span></strong>l meri<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stem</span></strong>s matured. We performed live imaging of early flower development and showed that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flora</span></strong>l buds developed more slowly at 15°C versus 20°C. This extended phase of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flora</span></strong>l meri<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stem</span></strong> formation, coupled with slower growth of sepals at 15°C, produced larger intersepal regions with more space available for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">petal</span></strong> initiation. In summary, the growth and maturation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flora</span></strong>l buds is associated with variable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">petal</span></strong> number in <i>C. hirsuta</i> and responds to seasonal changes in ambient temperature.</p>

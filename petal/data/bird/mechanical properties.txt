Root Tip Shape Governs Root Elongation Rate under Increased Soil Strength
<p>Increased soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong> due to soil compaction or soil drying is a major limitation to root growth and crop productivity. Roots need to exert higher penetration force, resulting in increased penetration <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ating in soils of greater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong>. This study aimed to quantify how the genotypic diversity of root tip geometry and root diameter influences root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation under different levels of soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong> and to determine the extent to which roots adjust to increased soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong>. Fourteen wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) varieties were grown in soil columns packed to three bulk densities representing low, moderate, and high soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong>. Under moderate and high soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong>, smaller root tip radius-to-length ratio was correlated with higher genotypic root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation rate, whereas root diameter was not related to genotypic root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation. Based on cavity expansion theory, it was found that smaller root tip radius-to-length ratio reduced penetration <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>, thus enabling higher root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation rates in soils with greater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong>. Furthermore, it was observed that roots could only partially adjust to increased soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong>. Root thickening was bounded by a maximum diameter, and root tips did not become more acute in response to increased soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong>. The obtained results demonstrated that root tip geometry is a pivotal trait governing root penetration <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> and root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation rate in soils of greater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong>. Hence, root tip shape needs to be taken into account when selecting for crop varieties that may tolerate high soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong>.</p>

Conventional Versus Compression-Only Versus No-Bystander Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation for Pediatric Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) (chest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compress</span></strong></span></strong>ion and rescue breathing) has been recommended for pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) because of the asphyxial nature of the majority of pediatric cardiac arrest events. However, the clinical effectiveness of additional rescue breathing (conventional CPR) compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compress</span></strong></span></strong>ion-only CPR in children is uncertain.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This nationwide population-based study of pediatric OHCA patients was based on data from the All-Japan Utstein Registry. We included all pediatric patients who experienced OHCA in Japan from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2012. The primary outcome was a favorable neurological state 1 month after OHCA defined as a Glasgow-Pittsburgh Cerebral Performance Category score of 1 to 2 (corresponding to a Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category score of 1–3). Outcomes were compared with logistic regression with uni- and multivariable modeling in the overall cohort and for a propensity-matched sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">set</span></strong> of patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 2157 patients were included; 417 received conventional CPR, 733 received <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compress</span></strong></span></strong>ion-only CPR, and 1007 did not receive any bystander CPR. Among these patients, 213 (9.9%) survived with a favorable neurological status 1 month after OHCA, including 108/417 (25.9%) for conventional, 68/733 (9.3%) for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compress</span></strong></span></strong>ion-only, and 37/1007 (3.7%) for no-bystander CPR. In unadjusted analyses, conventional CPR was superior to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compress</span></strong></span></strong>ion-only CPR in neurologically favorable survival (odds ratio [OR] 3.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.45–4.76; <i>P</i><0.0001), with a trend favoring conventional CPR that was no longer statistically significant after multivariable adjustment (OR<sub>adjusted</sub> 1.52, 95% CI 0.93–2.49), and with further attenuation of the difference in a propensity-matched sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">set</span></strong> (OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.81–1.77).

Unique Physiological and Transcriptional Shifts under Combinations of Salinity, Drought, and Heat
<p>Climate-change-driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>es such as extreme temperatures, water deficit, and ion imbalance are projected to exacerbate and jeopardize global food security. Under field conditions, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>es usually occur simultaneously and cause damages that exceed single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>es. Here, we investigated the transcriptional patterns and morpho-physiological acclimations of <i>Brachypodium dystachion</i> to single salinity, d<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rough</span></strong>t, and heat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>es, as well as their double and triple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> combinations. Hierarchical clustering analysis of morpho-physiological acclimations showed that several traits exhibited a gradually aggravating effect as plants were exposed to combined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>es. On the other hand, other morphological traits were dominated by salinity, while some physiological traits were shaped by heat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. Response patterns of differentially expressed genes, under single and combined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>es (i.e. common <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> genes), were maintained only among 37% of the genes, indicating a limited expression consistency among partially overlapping <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>es. A comparison between common <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> genes and genes that were uniquely expressed only under combined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>es (i.e. combination unique genes) revealed a significant shift from increased intensity to antagonistic responses, respectively. The different transcriptional signatures imply an alteration in the mode of action under combined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>es and limited ability to predict plant responses as different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>es are combined. Coexpression analysis coupled with enrichment analysis revealed that each gene sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">set</span></strong> was enriched with different biological processes. Common <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> genes were enriched with known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> response pathways, while combination unique-genes were enriched with unique processes and genes with unknown functions that hold the potential to improve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> tolerance and enhance cereal productivity under suboptimal field conditions.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
The Arabidopsis DNA Methylome Is Stable under Transgenerational Drought Stress
<p>Improving the responsiveness, acclimation, and memory of plants to abiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> holds substantive potential for improving agriculture. An unresolved question is the involvement of chromatin marks in the memory of agriculturally relevant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>es. Such potential has spurred numerous investigations yielding both promising and conflicting results. Consequently, it remains unclear to what extent robust <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>-induced DNA methylation variation can underpin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> memory. Using a slow-on<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">set</span></strong> water deprivation treatment in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), we investigated the malleability of the DNA methylome to d<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rough</span></strong>t <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> within a generation and under repeated d<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rough</span></strong>t <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> over five successive generations. While d<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rough</span></strong>t-associated epi-alleles in the methylome were detected within a generation, they did not correlate with d<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rough</span></strong>t-responsive gene expression. Six traits were analyzed for transgenerational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> memory, and the descendants of d<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rough</span></strong>t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>ed lineages showed one case of memory in the form of increased seed dormancy, and that persisted one generation removed from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. With respect to transgenerational d<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rough</span></strong>t <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>, there were negligible conserved differentially methylated regions in d<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rough</span></strong>t-exposed lineages compared with un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>ed lineages. Instead, the majority of observed variation was tied to stochastic or preexisting differences in the epigenome occurring at repetitive regions of the Arabidopsis genome. Furthermore, the experience of repeated d<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rough</span></strong>t <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> was not observed to influence transgenerational epi-allele accumulation. Our findings demonstrate that, while transgenerational memory is observed in one of six traits examined, they are not associated with causative changes in the DNA methylome, which appears relatively impervious to d<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rough</span></strong>t <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>.</p>

High dislocation density–induced large ductility in deformed and partitioned steels

Unfortunately, the strategies for increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong></span></strong>, such as processing to create line defects (dislocations), tend to decrease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ductil</span></strong>ity. We developed a strategy to circumvent this in inexpensive, medium manganese steel. Cold rolling followed by low-temperature tempering developed steel with metastable austenite grains embedded in a highly dislocated martensite matrix. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ed and partitioned (D and P) process produced dislocation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hard</span></strong>ening but retained high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ductil</span></strong>ity, both th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rough</span></strong> the glide of intensive mobile dislocations and by allowing us to control martensitic transformation. The D and P strategy should apply to any other alloy with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ation-induced martensitic transformation and provides a pathway for the development of high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong>, high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ductil</span></strong>ity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als.</p>

Mental Stress–Induced-Myocardial Ischemia in Young Patients With Recent Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Mental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI) is frequent in patients with coronary artery disease and is associated with worse prognosis. Young women with a previous myocardial infarction (MI), a group with unexplained higher mortality than men of comparable age, have shown elevated rates of MSIMI, but the mechanisms are unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied 306 patients (150 women and 156 men) ≤61 years of age who were hospitalized for MI in the previous 8 months and 112 community controls (58 women and 54 men) frequency matched for sex and age to the patients with MI. Endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilation and microvascular reactivity (reactive hyperemia index) were measured at rest and 30 minutes after mental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. The digital vasomotor response to mental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> was assessed using peripheral arterial tonometry. Patients received <sup>99m</sup>Tc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging at rest, with mental (speech task) and conventional (exercise/pharmacological) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean age of the sample was 50 years (range, 22–61). In the MI group but not among controls, women had a more adverse socioeconomic and psychosocial profile than men. There were no sex differences in cardiovascular risk factors, and among patients with MI, clinical severity tended to be lower in women. Women in both groups showed a higher peripheral arterial tonometry ratio during mental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> but a lower reactive hyperemia index after mental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>, indicating enhanced microvascular dysfunction after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. There were no sex differences in flow-mediated dilation changes with mental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. The rate of MSIMI was twice as high in women as in men (22% versus 11%, <i>P</i>=0.009), and ischemia with conventional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> was similarly elevated (31% versus 16%, <i>P</i>=0.002). Psychosocial and clinical risk factors did not explain sex differences in inducible ischemia. Although vascular responses to mental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> (peripheral arterial tonometry ratio and reactive hyperemia index) also did not explain sex differences in MSIMI, they were predictive of MSIMI in women only.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Young women after MI have a 2-fold likelihood of developing MSIMI compared with men and a similar increase in conventional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> ischemia. Microvascular dysfunction and peripheral vasoconstriction with mental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> are implicated in MSIMI among women but not among men, perhaps reflecting women’s proclivity toward ischemia because of microcirculatory abnormalities.</p></sec>

Duration of Ventilations During Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation by Lay Rescuers and First Responders

Tree Physiology
Combined effects of defoliation and water stress on pine growth and non-structural carbohydrates
<p>Climate change is expected to increase both pest insect damage and the occurrence of severe d<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rough</span></strong>t. There is therefore a need to better understand the combined effects of biotic and abiotic damage on tree growth in order to predict the multi-factorial effect of climate change on forest ecosystem productivity. Indeed, the effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> interactions on tree growth is an increasingly important topic that greatly lacks experiments and data, and it is unlikely that the impact of combined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>es can be extrapolated from the outcomes of studies that focused on a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. We developed an original manipulative study under real field conditions where we applied artificial defoliation and induced water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> on 10-year-old (∼10 m high) maritime pine trees (<i>Pinus pinaster</i> Ait.). Tree response to combined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>es was quantitatively assessed following tree secondary growth and carbohydrate pools. Such a design allowed us to address the crucial question of combined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>es on trees under stand conditions, sharing soil supplies with neighboring trees. Our initial hypotheses were that (i) moderate defoliation can limit the impact of water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> on tree growth th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rough</span></strong> reduced transpiration demand by a tree canopy partly defoliated and that (ii) defoliation results in reduced non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) pools, affecting tree tolerance to d<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rough</span></strong>t. Our results showed additive effects of defoliation and water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> on tree growth and contradict our initial hypothesis. Indeed, under stand conditions, we found that partial defoliation does not limit the impact of water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rough</span></strong> reduced transpiration. Our study also highlighted that, even if NSC in all organs were affected by defoliation, tree response to water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> was not triggered. We found that stem NSC were maintained or increased during the entire growing season, supporting literature-based hypotheses such as an active maintenance of the hydraulic system or another limiting resource for tree growth under defoliation. We also observed a significant decrease in root carbohydrates, which suggests a shift in the root carbon balance under defoliation. The decrease in carbohydrate supply under defoliation may not counterbalance the carbon use for mineral and water uptakes or a translocation to other tissues.</p>

Multicomponent intermetallic nanoparticles and superb mechanical behaviors of complex alloys
<p>Alloy design based on single–principal-element systems has approached its limit for performance enhancements. A substantial increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong> up to gigapascal levels typically causes the premature failure of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als with reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ductil</span></strong>ity. Here, we report a strategy to break this trade-off by controllably introducing high-density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ductil</span></strong>e multicomponent intermetallic nanoparticles (MCINPs) in complex alloy systems. Distinct from the intermetallic-induced em<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brittl</span></strong>ement under conventional wisdom, such MCINP-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong>ened alloys exhibit superior <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong>s of 1.5 gigapascals and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ductil</span></strong>ity as high as 50% in tension at ambient temperature. The plastic instability, a major concern for high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als, can be completely eliminated by generating a distinctive multistage work-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hard</span></strong>ening behavior, resulting from pronounced dislocation activities and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ation-induced microbands. This MCINP strategy offers a paradigm to develop next-generation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als for structural applications.</p>

Here we establish a “two-hit” <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> model in mice wherein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> at a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic postnatal period increases susceptibility to adult social defeat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> and causes long-lasting transcriptional alterations that prime the ventral tegmental area (VTA)—a brain reward region—to be in a depression-like state. We identify a role for the developmental transcription factor orthodenticle homeobox 2 (<i>Otx2</i>) as an upstream mediator of these enduring effects. Transient juvenile—but not adult—knockdown of <i>Otx2</i> in VTA mimics early life <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> by increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> susceptibility, whereas its overexpression reverses the effects of early life <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. This work establishes a mechanism by which early life <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> encodes lif<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong> susceptibility to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> via long-lasting transcriptional programming in VTA mediated by <i>Otx2</i>.</p>

Elongator Is Required for Root Stem Cell Maintenance by Regulating <i>SHORTROOT</i> Transcription
<p><i>SHORTROOT</i> (<i>SHR</i>) is essential for stem cell maintenance and radial patterning in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) roots, but how its expression is regulated is unknown. Here, we report that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ator complex, which consists of six subunits (ELP1 to ELP6), regulates the transcription of <i>SHR</i>. Depletion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ator drastically reduced <i>SHR</i> expression and led to defective root stem cell maintenance and radial patterning. The importance of the nuclear localization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ator for its functioning, together with the insensitivity of the <i>elp1</i> mutant to the transcription <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation inhibitor 6-azauracil, and the direct interaction of the ELP4 subunit with the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, support the notion that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ator plays important roles in transcription <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation. Indeed, we found that ELP3 associates with the premessenger RNA of <i>SHR</i> and that mutation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ator reduces the enrichment of RNA polymerase II on the <i>SHR</i> gene body. Moreover, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ator interacted in vivo with SUPPRESSOR OF Ty4, a well-established transcription <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation factor that is recruited to the <i>SHR</i> locus. Together, these results demonstrate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ator acts in concert with SUPPRESSOR OF Ty4 to regulate the transcription of <i>SHR</i>.</p>

Actin Reorganization Triggers Rapid Cell Elongation in Roots
<p>Root growth is controlled by mechanisms underlying cell division and cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation, which respond to various internal and external factors. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), cells produced in the proximal meristem (PM) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ate and differentiate in the transition zone (TZ) and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation/differentiation zone (EDZ). Previous studies have demonstrated that endoreplication is involved in root cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation; however, the manner by which cells increase in length by more than 2-fold remains unknown. Here, we show that epidermal and cortical cells in Arabidopsis roots undergo two modes of rapid cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation: the first rapid cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation occurs at the border of the proximal meristem and the TZ, and the second mode occurs during the transition from the TZ to the EDZ. Our previous study showed that cytokinin signaling promotes endoreplication, which triggers the first rapid cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation. Our cytological and genetic data revealed that the second rapid cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation involves dynamic actin reorganization independent of endoreplication. Cytokinins promote actin bundling and the resultant second rapid cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rough</span></strong> activating the signaling pathway involving the cytokinin receptors ARABIDOPSIS HISTIDINE KINASE3 (AHK3) and AHK4 and the B-type transcription factor ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR2. Our results suggest that cytokinins promote the two modes of rapid cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation by controlling distinct cellular events: endoreplication and actin reorganization.</p>

The Distinct Roles of Class I and II RPD3-Like Histone Deacetylases in Salinity Stress Response
<p>Histone acetylation is an essential process in the epigenetic regulation of diverse biological processes, including environmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> responses in plants. Previously, our research group identified a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor (HDI) that confers salt tolerance in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). In this study, we demonstrate that class I HDAC (HDA19) and class II HDACs (HDA5/14/15/18) control responses to salt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rough</span></strong> different pathways. The screening of 12 different selective HDIs indicated that seven newly reported HDIs enhance salt tolerance. Genetic analysis, based on a pharmacological study, identified which HDACs function in salinity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> tolerance. In the wild-type Columbia-0 background, <i>hda19</i> plants exhibit tolerance to high-salinity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>, while <i>hda5/14/15/18</i> plants exhibit hypersensitivity to salt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the effect of <i>HDA19</i> deficiency on the response to salinity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> is distinct from that of <i>HDA5/14/15/18</i> deficiencies. In <i>hda19</i> plants, the expression levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> tolerance-related genes, late embryogenesis abundant proteins that prevent protein aggregation and positive regulators such as ABI5 and NAC019 in abscisic acid signaling, were induced strongly relative to the wild type. Neither of these elements was up-regulated in the <i>hda5/14/15/18</i> plants. The mutagenesis of HDA19 by genome editing in the <i>hda5/14/15/18</i> plants enhanced salt tolerance, suggesting that suppression of HDA19 masks the phenotype caused by the suppression of class II HDACs in the salinity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> response. Collectively, our results demonstrate that HDIs that inhibit class I HDACs allow the rescue of plants from salinity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> regardless of their selectivity, and they provide insight into the hierarchal regulation of environmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> responses th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rough</span></strong> HDAC isoforms.</p>

STABILIZED1 Modulates Pre-mRNA Splicing for Thermotolerance
<p>High-temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> often leads to differential RNA splicing, thus accumulating different types and/or amounts of mature mRNAs in eukaryotic cells. However, regulatory mechanisms underlying plant precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) splicing in the environmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> conditions remain elusive. Herein, we describe that a U5-snRNP-interacting protein homolog STABILIZED1 (STA1) has pre-mRNA splicing activity for heat-inducible transcripts including <i>HEAT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR</i>s and various <i>HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN</i>s for the establishment of heat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> tolerance in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Our cell-based splicing reporter assay demonstrated STA1 acts on pre-mRNA splicing for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">set</span></strong>s of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>-related genes. Cellular reconstitution of heat-inducible transcription cascades supported the view that STA1-dependent pre-mRNA splicing plays a role in DREB2A-dependent <i>HSFA3</i> expression for heat-responsive gene expression. Further genetic analysis with a loss-of-function mutant <i>sta1</i>-<i>1</i>, <i>STA1</i>-expressing transgenic plants in Col background, and <i>STA1</i>-expressing transgenic plants in the <i>sta1</i>-<i>1</i> background verified that STA1 is essential in expression of necessary genes including <i>HSFA3</i> for two-step heat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> tolerance in plants. However, constitutive overexpression of the cDNA version of <i>HSFA3</i> in the <i>sta1</i>-<i>1</i> background is unable to execute plant heat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> tolerance in <i>sta1</i>-<i>1</i>. Consistently our global target analysis of STA1 showed that its splicing activity modulates a rather broad range of gene expression in response to heat treatment. The findings of this study reveal that heat-inducible STA1 activity for pre-mRNA splicing serves as a molecular regulatory mechanism underlying the plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> tolerance to high-temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>.</p>

Bioorthogonal Noncanonical Amino Acid Tagging (BONCAT) Enables Time-Resolved Analysis of Protein Synthesis in Native Plant Tissue
<p>Proteomic plasticity undergirds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> responses in plants, and understanding such responses requires accurate measurement of the extent to which proteins levels are adjusted to counter external stimuli. Here, we adapt bioorthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) to interrogate protein synthesis in vegetative Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings. BONCAT relies on the translational incorporation of a noncanonical amino acid probe into cellular proteins. In this study, the probe is the Met surrogate azidohomoalanine (Aha), which carries a reactive azide moiety in its amino acid side chain. The azide handle in Aha can be selectively conjugated to dyes and functionalized beads to enable visualization and enrichment of newly synthesized proteins. We show that BONCAT is sensitive enough to detect Arabidopsis proteins synthesized within a 30-min interval defined by an Aha pulse and that the method can be used to detect proteins made under conditions of light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>, osmotic shock, salt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>, heat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>, and recovery from heat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. We further establish that BONCAT can be coupled to tandem liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to identify and quantify proteins synthesized during heat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> and recovery from heat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. Our results are consistent with a model in which, upon the on<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">set</span></strong> of heat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>, translation is rapidly reprogrammed to enhance the synthesis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> mitigators and is again altered during recovery. All experiments were carried out with commercially available reagents, highlighting the accessibility of the BONCAT method to researchers interested in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> responses as well as translational and posttranslational regulation in plants.</p>

Cardiomyocyte glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors directly and antagonistically regulate heart disease in mice
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> is increasingly associated with heart dysfunction and is linked to higher mortality rates in patients with cardiometabolic disease. Glucocorticoids are primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> hormones that regulate homeostasis th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rough</span></strong> two nuclear receptors, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), both of which are present in cardiomyocytes. To examine the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic and coordinated roles that these receptors play in mediating the direct effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> on the heart, we generated mice with cardiomyocyte-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic deletion of GR (cardioGRKO), MR (cardioMRKO), or both GR and MR (cardioGRMRdKO). The cardioGRKO mice spontaneously developed cardiac hypertrophy and left ventricular systolic dysfunction and died prematurely from heart failure. In contrast, the cardioMRKO mice exhibited normal heart morphology and function. Despite the presence of myocardial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>, the cardioGRMRdKO mice were resistant to the cardiac remodeling, left ventricular dysfunction, and early death observed in the cardioGRKO mice. Gene expression analysis revealed the loss of gene changes associated with impaired Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling, increased oxidative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>, and enhanced cell death and the presence of gene changes that limited the hypertrophic response and promoted cardiomyocyte survival in the double knockout hearts. Reexpression of MR in cardioGRMRdKO hearts reversed many of the cardioprotective gene changes and resulted in cardiac failure. These findings reveal a critical role for balanced cardiomyocyte GR and MR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> signaling in cardiovascular health. Therapies that shift <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> signaling in the heart to favor more GR and less MR activity may provide an improved approach for treating heart disease.</p>

Extraordinary plasticity of an inorganic semiconductor in darkness
<p>Inorganic semiconductors generally tend to fail in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brittl</span></strong>e manner. Here, we report that extraordinary “plasticity” can take place in an inorganic semiconductor if the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ation is carried out “in complete darkness.” Room-temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ation tests of zinc sulfide (ZnS) were performed under varying light conditions. ZnS crystals immediately fractured when they <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ed under light irradiation. In contrast, it was found that ZnS crystals can be plastically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ed up to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ation strain of ε<sub>t</sub> = 45% in complete darkness. In addition, the optical bandgap of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ed ZnS crystals was distinctly decreased after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ation. These results suggest that dislocations in ZnS become mobile in complete darkness and that multiplied dislocations can affect the optical bandgap over the whole crystal. Inorganic semiconductors are not necessarily intrinsically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brittl</span></strong>e.</p>

The Energy-Signaling Hub SnRK1 Is Important for Sucrose-Induced Hypocotyl Elongation

The hypocotyls of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ate in response to sucrose. Here, we investigated the role of cellular sugar-sensing mechanisms in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation of hypocotyls in response to Suc. We focused upon the role of SnRK1, which is a sugar-signaling hub that regulates metabolism and transcription in response to cellular energy status. We also investigated the role of TPS1, which synthesizes the signaling sugar trehalose-6-P that is proposed to regulate SnRK1 activity. Under light/dark cycles, we found that Suc-induced hypocotyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation did not occur in <i>tps1</i> mutants and overexpressors of KIN10 (AKIN10/SnRK1.1), a catalytic subunit of SnRK1. We demonstrate that the magnitude of Suc-induced hypocotyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation depends on the day length and light intensity. We identified roles for auxin and gibberellin signaling in Suc-induced hypocotyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation under short photoperiods.

Coordinated Regulation of Hypocotyl Cell Elongation by Light and Ethylene through a Microtubule Destabilizing Protein<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Precise regulation of hypocotyl cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation is essential for plant growth and survival. Light suppresses hypocotyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation by degrading transcription factor phytochrome-interacting factor 3 (PIF3), whereas the phytohormone ethylene promotes hypocotyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation by activating PIF3. However, the underlying mechanisms regarding how these two pathways coordinate downstream effectors to mediate hypocotyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation are largely unclear. In this study, we identified the novel Microtubule-Destabilizing Protein 60 (MDP60), which plays a positive role in hypocotyl cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>); this effect is mediated th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rough</span></strong> PIF3. Ethylene signaling up-regulates <i>MDP60</i> expression via PIF3 binding to the <i>MDP60</i> promoter. <i>MDP60</i> loss-of-function mutants exhibit much shorter hypocotyls, whereas <i>MDP60</i> overexpression significantly promotes hypocotyl cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation when grown in light compared to the control. MDP60 protein binds to microtubules in vitro and in vivo. The organization of cortical microtubules was significantly disrupted in <i>mdp60</i> mutant cells and <i>MDP60</i>-overexpressing seedlings. These findings indicate that MDP60 is an important mediator of hypocotyl cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation. This study reveals a mechanism in which light and ethylene signaling coordinate <i>MDP60</i> expression to modulate hypocotyl cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation by altering cortical microtubules in Arabidopsis.</p>

According to the acid growth theory proposed in the 1970s, auxin activates plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases (PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases) to facilitate cell expansion by both loosening the cell wall th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rough</span></strong> acidification and promoting solute uptake. Mechanistically, however, this process is poorly understood. Recent findings in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) have demonstrated that auxin-induced <i>SMALL AUXIN UP RNA</i> (<i>SAUR</i>) genes promote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation growth and play a key role in PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activation by inhibiting PP2C.D family protein phosphatases. Here, we extend these findings by demonstrating that SAUR proteins also inhibit tomato PP2C.D family phosphatases and that AtSAUR19 overexpression in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) confers the same suite of phenotypes as previously reported for Arabidopsis. Furthermore, we employ a custom image-based method for measuring hypocotyl segment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation with high resolution and a method for measuring cell wall mechanical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es, to add mechanistic details to the emerging description of auxin-mediated cell expansion. We find that constitutive expression of GFP-AtSAUR19 bypasses the normal requirement of auxin for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation growth by increasing the mechanical extensibility of excised hypocotyl segments. In contrast, hypocotyl segments overexpressing a PP2C.D phosphatase are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ically impaired in auxin-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation. The time courses of auxin-induced <i>SAUR</i> expression and auxin-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation growth were closely correlated. These findings indicate that induction of <i>SAUR</i> expression is sufficient to elicit auxin-mediated expansion growth by activating PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases to facilitate apoplast acidification and mechanical wall loosening.</p>

Jasmonic Acid Enhances Al-Induced Root Growth Inhibition<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>Phytohormones such as ethylene and auxin are involved in the regulation of the aluminum (Al)-induced root growth inhibition. Although jasmonate (JA) has been reported to play a crucial role in the regulation of root growth and development in response to environmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>es th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rough</span></strong> interplay with ethylene and auxin, its role in the regulation of root growth response to Al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> is not yet known. In an attempt to elucidate the role of JA, we found that exogenous application of JA enhanced the Al-induced root growth inhibition. Furthermore, phenotype analysis with mutants defective in either JA biosynthesis or signaling suggests that JA is involved in the regulation of Al-induced root growth inhibition. The expression of the JA receptor CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 (COI1) and the key JA signaling regulator MYC2 was up-regulated in response to Al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> in the root tips. This process together with COI1-mediated Al-induced root growth inhibition under Al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> was controlled by ethylene but not auxin. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that many responsive genes under Al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> were regulated by JA signaling. The differential responsive of microtubule organization-related genes between the wild-type and <i>coi1-2</i> mutant is consistent with the changed depolymerization of cortical microtubules in <i>coi1</i> under Al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. In addition, ALMT-mediated malate exudation and thus Al exclusion from roots in response to Al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> was also regulated by COI1-mediated JA signaling. Together, this study suggests that root growth inhibition is regulated by COI1-mediated JA signaling independent from auxin signaling and provides novel insights into the phytohormone-mediated root growth inhibition in response to Al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>.</p>

Load-induced changes in bone stiffness and cancellous and cortical bone mass following tibial compression diminish with age in female mice
<p>The vertebrate skeleton is an adaptive structure that responds to mechanical stimuli by increasing bone mass under increased mechanical loads. Although experimental animal models have shown the anabolic cortical bone response to applied load decreases with age, no consensus exists regarding whether this adaptive mechanism is affected by age in cancellous bone, the tissue most impacted by age-related bone loss. We used an established murine <i>in vivo</i> tibial loading model to characterize the load-induced cancellous, cortical and whole-bone responses to mechanical stimuli in growing and mature female mice at 6, 10 and 16 weeks of age. The effects of applied load on tibial morphology and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stiff</span></strong>ness were determined using microcomputed tomography and <i>in vivo</i> bone strains measured at the medial tibial midshaft during applied loading. At all ages, 2 weeks of applied load produced larger midshaft cortical cross-sectional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es (+13–72%) and greater cancellous bone volume (+21–107%) and thicker trabeculae (+31–68%) in the proximal metaphyses of the loaded tibiae. The relative anabolic response decreased from 6 to 16 weeks of age in both the cancellous and cortical envelopes. Load-induced tibial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>es decreased more in 6-week-old mice following loading, which corresponded to increased <i>in vivo</i> tibial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stiff</span></strong>ness. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stiff</span></strong>ness in the loaded tibiae of 16-week-old mice decreased despite moderately increased cortical cross-sectional geometry, suggesting load-induced changes in bone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es. This study shows that the cancellous and cortical anabolic responses to mechanical stimuli decline with age into adulthood and that cortical cross-sectional geometry alone does not necessarily predict whole-bone functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stiff</span></strong>ness.</p>

Biomimetic shark skin: design, fabrication and hydrodynamic function
<p>Although the functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es of shark skin have been of considerable interest to both biologists and engineers because of the complex hydrodynamic effects of surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rough</span></strong>ness, no study to date has successfully fabricated a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flexibl</span></strong>e biomimetic shark skin that allows detailed study of hydrodynamic function. We present the first study of the design, fabrication and hydrodynamic testing of a synthetic, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flexibl</span></strong>e, shark skin membrane. A three-dimensional (3D) model of shark skin denticles was constructed using micro-CT imaging of the skin of the shortfin mako (<i>Isurus oxyrinchus</i>). Using 3D printing, thousands of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rigid</span></strong> synthetic shark denticles were placed on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flexibl</span></strong>e membranes in a controlled, linear-arrayed pattern. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flexibl</span></strong>e 3D printed shark skin model was then tested in water using a robotic flapping device that allowed us to either hold the models in a stationary position or move them dynamically at their self-propelled swimming speed. Compared with a smooth control model without denticles, the 3D printed shark skin showed increased swimming speed with reduced energy consumption under certain motion programs. For example, at a heave frequency of 1.5 Hz and an amplitude of ±1 cm, swimming speed increased by 6.6% and the energy cost-of-transport was reduced by 5.9%. In addition, a leading-edge vortex with greater vorticity than the smooth control was generated by the 3D printed shark skin, which may explain the increased swimming speeds. The ability to fabricate synthetic biomimetic shark skin opens up a wide array of possible manipulations of surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rough</span></strong>ness parameters, and the ability to examine the hydrodynamic consequences of diverse skin denticle shapes present in different shark species.</p>

Mechanistic origin and prediction of enhanced ductility in magnesium alloys
<p>Pure magnesium exhibits poor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ductil</span></strong>ity owing to pyramidal [Formula] dislocation transformations to immobile structures, making this lowest-density structural metal unusable for many applications where it could enhance energy efficiency. We show why magnesium can be made <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ductil</span></strong>e by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic dilute solute additions, which increase the [Formula] cross-slip and multiplication rates to levels much faster than the deleterious [Formula] transformation, enabling both favorable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">textur</span></strong>e during processing and continued plastic straining during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ation. A quantitative theory establishes the conditions for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ductil</span></strong>ity as a function of alloy composition in very good agreement with experiments on many existing magnesium alloys, and the solute-enhanced cross-slip mechanism is confirmed by transmission electron microscopy observations in magnesium-yttrium. The mechanistic theory can quickly screen for alloy compositions favoring conditions for high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ductil</span></strong>ity and may help in the development of high-formability magnesium alloys.</p>

Synthetic transcription elongation factors license transcription across repressive chromatin
<p>The release of paused RNA polymerase II into productive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation is highly regulated, especially at genes that affect human development and disease. To exert control over this rate-limiting step, we designed sequence-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic synthetic transcription <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation factors (Syn-TEFs). These molecules are composed of programmable DNA-binding ligands <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flexibl</span></strong>y tethered to a small molecule that engages the transcription <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation machinery.

Here we present Syn-TEF1, a molecule that actively enables transcription across repressive GAA repeats that silence frataxin expression in Friedreich’s ataxia, a terminal neurodegenerative disease with no effective therapy. The modular design of Syn-TEF1 defines a general framework for developing a class of molecules that license transcription <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elong</span></strong>ation at targeted genomic loci.</p>

Toughening elastomers using mussel-inspired iron-catechol complexes
<p>Materials often exhibit a trade-off between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stiff</span></strong>ness and extensibility; for example, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong>ening elastomers by increasing their cross-link density leads to em<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brittl</span></strong>ement and decreased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tough</span></strong>ness. Inspired by cuticles of marine mussel byssi, we circumvent this inherent trade-off by incorporating sacrificial, reversible iron-catechol cross-links into a dry, loosely cross-linked epoxy network. The iron-containing network exhibits two to three orders of magnitude increases in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stiff</span></strong>ness, tensile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong>, and tensile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tough</span></strong>ness compared to its iron-free precursor while gaining recoverable hysteretic energy dissipation and maintaining its original extensibility. Compared to previous realizations of this chemistry in hydrogels, the dry nature of the network enables larger property enhancement owing to the cooperative effects of both the increased cross-link density given by the reversible iron-catecholate complexes and the chain-restricting ionomeric nanodomains that they form.</p>

Retrieval practice protects memory against acute stress
<p>More than a decade of research has supported a robust consensus: Acute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> impairs memory retrieval. We aimed to determine whether a highly effective learning technique could <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strength</span></strong>en memory against the negative effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. To bolster memory, we used retrieval practice, or the act of taking practice tests. Participants first learned stimuli by either restudying or engaging in retrieval practice. Twenty-four hours later, we induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> in half of the participants and assessed subsequent memory performance. Participants who learned by restudying demonstrated the typical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>-related memory impairment, whereas those who learned by retrieval practice were immune to the deleterious effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>.

A Functional Unfolded Protein Response Is Required for Normal Vegetative Development
<p>The unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated in plants in response to endoplasmic reticulum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> and plays an important role in mitigating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> damage. Multiple factors act in the UPR, including the membrane-associated transcription factor, BASIC LEUCINE ZIPPER 17 (bZIP17), and the membrane-associated RNA splicing factor, INOSITOL REQUIRING ENZYME1 (IRE1). We have analyzed an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>ire1a ire1b bzip17</i> triple mutant, with defects in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> signaling, and found that the mutant is also impaired in vegetative plant growth under conditions without externally applied <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>.

Local and Systemic Metabolic Responses during Light-Induced Rapid Systemic Signaling
<p>Plants evolved multiple signaling pathways that transduce light-related signals between leaves. These are thought to improve light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> acclimation in a process termed systemic acquired acclimation. Although responses to light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> have been studied extensively in local leaves, and to a lesser degree in systemic leaves, little is known about the responses that occur in the different tissues that connect the local to the systemic leaves. These could be important in defining the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity of the systemic response as well as in supporting the generation of different systemic signals. Here, we report that local application of light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> to one ro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">set</span></strong>te leaf of bolting Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants resulted in a metabolic response that encompassed local, systemic and transport tissues (stem tissues that connect the local to the systemic tissues), demonstrating a high degree of physical and metabolic continuity between different tissues th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rough</span></strong>out the plant. Our results further indicate that the response of many of the systemically altered metabolites is associated with the function of the reactive oxygen species wave and that the levels of eight different metabolites are altered in a similar manner in all tissues tested (local, systemic, and transport). These compounds could define a core metabolic signature for light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> that propagates from the local to the systemic leaves. Our findings suggest that metabolic changes occurring in cells that connect the local and systemic tissues play an important role in systemic acquired acclimation and could convey <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity to the rapid systemic response of plants to light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>.</p>

Functional Diversity of Diterpene Synthases in the Biofuel Crop Switchgrass
<p>Diterpenoids constitute a diverse class of metabolites with critical functions in plant development, defense, and ecological adaptation. Major monocot crops, such as maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) and rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), deploy diverse blends of specialized diterpenoids as core components of biotic and abiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resili</span></strong>ence. Here, we describe the genome-wide identification and functional characterization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>-related diterpene synthases (diTPSs) in the dedicated bioenergy crop switchgrass (<i>Panicum virgatum</i>). Mining of the allotetraploid switchgrass genome identified an expansive diTPS family of 31 members, and biochemical analysis of 11 diTPSs revealed a modular metabolic network producing a diverse array of diterpenoid metabolites. In addition to <i>ent</i>-copalyl diphosphate (CPP) and <i>ent</i>-kaurene synthases predictably involved in gibberellin biosynthesis, we identified <i>syn</i>-CPP and <i>ent</i>-labda-13-en-8-ol diphosphate (LPP) synthases as well as two diTPSs forming (+)-labda-8,13<i>E</i>-dienyl diphosphate (8,13-CPP) and <i>ent-neo-</i>cis-trans-clerodienyl diphosphate (CT-CLPP) scaffolds not observed previously in plants. Structure-guided mutagenesis of the (+)-8,13-CPP and <i>ent-neo-</i>CT-CLPP synthases revealed residue substitutions in the active sites that altered product outcome, representing potential neofunctionalization events that occurred during diversification of the switchgrass diTPS family. The conversion of <i>ent</i>-CPP, <i>ent</i>-LPP, <i>syn</i>-CPP, and <i>ent-neo</i>-CT-CLPP by promiscuous diTPSs further yielded distinct labdane-type diterpene olefins and alcohols. Of these metabolites, the formation of 9β-hydroxy-<i>syn</i>-pimar-15-ene and the expression of the corresponding genes were induced in roots and leaves in response to oxidative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> and ultraviolet irradiation, indicating their possible roles in abiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> adaptation. Together, these findings expand the known chemical space of diterpenoid metabolism in monocot crops toward systematically investigating and ultimately improving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resili</span></strong>ence traits in crop species.</p>

A Maternally Deposited Endosperm Cuticle Contributes to the Physiological Defects of <i>transparent testa</i> Seeds
<p>Mature dry seeds are highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resili</span></strong>ent plant structures where the encapsulated embryo is kept protected and dormant to facilitate its ultimate dispersion. Seed viability is heavily dependent on the seed coat’s capacity to shield living tissues from mechanical and oxidative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the seed coat, also called the testa, arises after the differentiation of maternal ovular integuments during seed development. We recently described a thick cuticle tightly embedded in the mature seed’s endosperm cell wall. We show here that it is produced by the maternal inner integument 1 layer and, remarkably, transferred to the developing endosperm. Arabidopsis <i>transparent testa</i> (<i>tt</i>) mutations cause maternally derived seed coat pigmentation defects. <i>TT</i> gene products encode proteins involved in flavonoid metabolism and regulators of seed coat development. <i>tt</i> mutants have abnormally high seed coat permeability, resulting in lower seed viability and dormancy. However, the biochemical basis of this high permeability is not fully understood. We show that the cuticles of developing <i>tt</i> mutant integuments have profound structural defects, which are associated with enhanced cuticle permeability. Genetic analysis indicates that a functional proanthocyanidin synthesis pathway is required to limit cuticle permeability, and our results suggest that proanthocyanidins could be intrinsic components of the cuticle. Together, these results show that the formation of a maternal cuticle is an intrinsic part of the normal integumental differentiation program leading to testa formation and is essential for the seed’s physiological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es.</p>

The Tomato Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase SlMPK1 Is as a Negative Regulator of the High-Temperature Stress Response
<p>High-temperature (HT) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> is a major environmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> that limits plant growth and development. MAPK cascades play key roles in plant growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> signaling, but their involvement in the HT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> response is poorly understood. Here, we describe a 47-kD MBP-phosphorylated protein (p47-MBPK) activated in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) leaves under HT and identify it as SlMPK1 by tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Silencing of <i>SlMPK1</i> in transgenic tomato plants resulted in enhanced tolerance to HT, while overexpression resulted in reduced tolerance. Proteomic analysis identified a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">set</span></strong> of proteins involved in antioxidant defense that are significantly more abundant in RNA interference-<i>SlMPK1</i> plants than nontransgenic plants under HT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. RNA interference-<i>SlMPK1</i> plants also showed changes in membrane lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzyme activities. Furthermore, using yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified a serine-proline-rich protein homolog, SlSPRH1, which interacts with SlMPK1 in yeast, in plant cells, and in vitro. We demonstrate that SlMPK1 can directly phosphorylate SlSPRH1. Furthermore, the serine residue serine-44 of SlSPRH1 is a crucial phosphorylation site in the SlMPK1-mediated antioxidant defense mechanism activated during HT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. We also demonstrate that heterologous expression of <i>SlSPRH1</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) led to a decrease in thermotolerance and lower antioxidant capacity. Taken together, our results suggest that SlMPK1 is a negative regulator of thermotolerance in tomato plants. SlMPK1 acts by regulating antioxidant defense, and its substrate SlSPRH1 is involved in this pathway.</p>

Auxin Efflux Carrier ZmPGP1 Mediates Root Growth Inhibition under Aluminum Stress
<p>Auxin has been shown to enhance root growth inhibition under aluminum (Al) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). However, in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), auxin may play a negative role in the Al-induced inhibition of root growth. In this study, we identified mutants deficient in the maize auxin efflux carrier P-glycoprotein (ZmPGP1) after ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis and used them to elucidate the contribution of ZmPGP1 to Al-induced root growth inhibition. Root growth in the <i>zmpgp1</i> mutant, which forms shortened roots and is hyposensitive to auxin, was less inhibited by Al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> than that in the inbred line B73. In the <i>zmpgp1</i> mutants, the root tips displayed higher auxin accumulation and enhanced auxin signaling under Al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>, which was also consistent with the increased expression of auxin-responsive genes. Based on the behavior of the auxin-responsive marker transgene, <i>DR5rev:RFP</i>, we concluded that Al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> reduced the level of auxin in the root tip, which contrasts with the tendency of Al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>-induced Arabidopsis plants to accumulate more auxin in their root tips. In addition, Al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> induced the expression of <i>ZmPGP1</i>. Therefore, in maize, Al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> is associated with reduced auxin accumulation in root tips, a process that is regulated by ZmPGP1 and thus causes inhibition of root growth. This study provides further evidence about the role of auxin and auxin polar transport in Al-induced root growth regulation in maize.</p>

3′-Phosphoadenosine 5′-Phosphate Accumulation Delays the Circadian System
<p>The circadian system optimizes cellular responses to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>, but the signaling pathways that convey the metabolic consequences of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> into this molecular timekeeping mechanism remain unclear. Redox regulation of the SAL1 phosphatase during abiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> initiates a signaling pathway from chloroplast to nucleus by regulating the accumulation of a metabolite, 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphate (PAP). Consequently, PAP accumulates in response to redox <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> and inhibits the activity of exoribonucleases (XRNs) in the nucleus and cytosol. We demonstrated that osmotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> induces a lengthening of circadian period and that genetically inducing the SAL1-PAP-XRN pathway in plants lacking either SAL1 or XRNs similarly delays the circadian system. Exogenous application of PAP was also sufficient to extend circadian period. Thus, SAL1-PAP-XRN signaling likely regulates circadian rhythms in response to redox <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. Our findings exemplify how two central processes in plants, molecular timekeeping and responses to abiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>, can be interlinked to regulate gene expression.</p>

Ethylene Signaling Modulates Cortical Microtubule Reassembly in Response to Salt Stress<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Regulation of cortical microtubule reorganization is essential for plant cell survival under high salinity conditions. In response to salt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>, microtubules undergo rapid depolymerization followed by reassembly to form a new microtubule network that promotes cell survival; however, the upstream regulatory mechanisms for this recovery response are largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that ethylene signaling facilitates salt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>-induced reassembly of cortical microtubules in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Microtubule depolymerization was not affected under salt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> following the suppression of ethylene signaling with Ag<sup>+</sup> or in ethylene-insensitive mutants, whereas microtubule reassembly was significantly inhibited. ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3, a key transcription factor in the ethylene signaling pathway, was shown to play a central role in microtubule reassembly under salt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. In addition, we performed functional characterization of the microtubule-stabilizing protein WAVE-DAMPENED2-LIKE5 (WDL5), which was found to promote ethylene-associated microtubule reassembly and plant salt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> tolerance. These findings indicate that ethylene signaling regulates microtubule reassembly by up-regulating <i>WDL5</i> expression in response to salt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>, thereby implicating ethylene signaling in salt-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> tolerance in plants.</p>

TsNAC1 Is a Key Transcription Factor in Abiotic Stress Resistance and Growth
<p>NAC proteins constitute one of the largest families of plant-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic transcription factors, and a number of these proteins participate in the regulation of plant development and responses to abiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. <i>T. HALOPHILA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> RELATED NAC1</i> (<i>TsNAC1</i>), cloned from the halophyte <i>Thellungiella halophila</i>, is a <i>NAC</i> transcription factor gene, and its overexpression can improve abiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> resistance, especially in salt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> tolerance, in both <i>T. halophila</i> and Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and retard the growth of these plants. In this study, the transcriptional activation activity of TsNAC1 and RD26 from Arabidopsis was compared with the target genes’ promoter regions of TsNAC1 from <i>T. halophila</i>, and the results showed that the transcriptional activation activity of TsNAC1 was higher in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) and yeast. The target sequence of the promoter from the target genes also was identified, and TsNAC1 was shown to target the positive regulators of ion transportation, such as <i>T. HALOPHILA H<sup>+</sup>-PPASE1</i>, and the transcription factors <i>MYB HYPOCOTYL ELONGATION-RELATED</i> and <i>HOMEOBOX12</i>. In addition, TsNAC1 negatively regulates the expansion of cells, inhibits <i>LIGHT-DEPENDENT SHORT HYPOCOTYLS1</i> and <i>UDP-XYLOSYLTRANSFERASE2</i>, and directly controls the expression of <i>MULTICOPY SUPPRESSOR OF IRA14</i>. Based on these results, we propose that TsNAC1 functions as an important upstream regulator of plant abiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> responses and vegetative growth.</p>

A Nucleus-Localized Long Non-Coding RNA Enhances Drought and Salt Stress Tolerance
<p>Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) affect gene expression th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rough</span></strong> a wide range of mechanisms and are considered as important regulators in many essential biological processes. A large number of lncRNA transcripts have been predicted or identified in plants in recent years. However, the biological functions for most of them are still unknown. In this study, we identified an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) lncRNA, <i>D<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rough</span></strong>T INDUCED lncRNA</i> (<i>DRIR</i>), as a novel positive regulator of the plant response to d<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rough</span></strong>t and salt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. <i>DRIR</i> was expressed at a low level under non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> conditions but can be significantly activated by d<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rough</span></strong>t and salt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> as well as by abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. We identified a T-DNA insertion mutant, <i>drir<sup>D</sup></i>, which had higher expression of the <i>DRIR</i> gene than the wild-type plants. The <i>drir<sup>D</sup></i> mutant exhibits increased tolerance to d<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rough</span></strong>t and salt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. Overexpressing <i>DRIR</i> in Arabidopsis also increased tolerance to d<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rough</span></strong>t and salt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> of the transgenic plants. The <i>drir<sup>D</sup></i> mutant and the overexpressing seedlings are more sensitive to ABA than the wild type in stomata closure and seedling growth. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis demonstrated that the expression of a large number of genes was altered in <i>drir<sup>D</sup></i> and the overexpressing plants. These include genes involved in ABA signaling, water transport, and other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>-relief processes. Our study reveals a mechanism whereby <i>DRIR</i> regulates the plant response to abiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> by modulating the expression of a series of genes involved in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> response.</p>

A Histone Code Reader and a Transcriptional Activator Interact to Regulate Genes for Salt Tolerance
<p>Plant homeodomain (PHD) finger proteins are involved in various developmental processes and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> responses. They recognize and bind to epigenetically modified histone H3 tail and function as histone code readers. Here we report that GmPHD6 reads low methylated histone H3K4me0/1/2 but not H3K4me3 with its N-terminal domain instead of the PHD finger. GmPHD6 does not possess transcriptional regulatory ability but has DNA-binding ability. Th<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rough</span></strong> the PHD finger, GmPHD6 interacts with its coactivator, LHP1-1/2, to form a transcriptional activation complex. Using a transgenic hairy root system, we demonstrate that overexpression of <i>GmPHD6</i> improves <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> tolerance in soybean (<i>Glycine</i> <i>max</i>) plants. Knocking down the <i>LHP1</i> expression disrupts this role of <i>GmPHD6</i>, indicating that GmPHD6 requires LHP1 functions during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> response. GmPHD6 influences expression of dozens of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>-related genes. Among these, we identified three targets of GmPHD6, including ABA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>-ripening-induced <i>CYP75B1</i> and <i>CYP82C4</i>. Overexpression of each gene confers <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> tolerance in soybean plants. GmPHD6 is recruited to H3K4me0/1/2 marks and recognizes the G-rich elements in target gene promoters, whereas LHP1 activates expression of these targets. Our study reveals a mechanism involving two partners in a complex. Manipulation of the genes in this pathway should improve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> tolerance in soybean or other legumes/crops.</p>

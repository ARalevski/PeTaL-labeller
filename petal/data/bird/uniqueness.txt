Prognostic Value of Coronary Artery Calcium in the PROMISE Study (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is an established predictor of future major adverse atherosclerotic cardiovascular events in asymptomatic individuals. However, limited data exist as to how CAC compares with functional testing (FT) in estimating prognosis in symptomatic patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In the PROMISE trial (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain), patients with stable chest pain (or dyspnea) and intermediate pretest probability for obstructive coronary artery disease were randomized to FT (exercise electrocardiography, nuclear stress, or stress echocardiography) or anatomic testing. We evaluated those who underwent CAC testing as part of the anatomic evaluation (n=4209) and compared that with results of FT (n=4602). We stratified CAC and FT results as normal or mildly, moderately, or severely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abnorm</span></strong>al (for CAC: 0, 1–99 Agatston score [AS], 100–400 AS, and >400 AS, respectively; for FT: normal, mild=late positive treadmill, moderate=early positive treadmill or single-vessel ischemia, and severe=large ischemic region <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abnorm</span></strong>ality). The primary end point was all-cause death, myocardial infarction, or unstable angina hospitalization over a median follow-up of 26.1 months. Cox regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and C statistics to determine predictive and discriminatory values.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, the distribution of normal or mildly, moderately, or severely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abnorm</span></strong>al test results was significantly different between FT and CAC (FT: normal, n=3588 [78.0%]; mild, n=432 [9.4%]; moderate, n=217 [4.7%]; severe, n=365 [7.9%]; CAC: normal, n=1457 [34.6%]; mild, n=1340 [31.8%]; moderate, n=772 [18.3%]; severe, n=640 [15.2%]; <i>P</i><0.0001). Moderate and severe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abnorm</span></strong>alities in both arms robustly predicted events (moderate: CAC: HR, 3.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.81–5.44; and FT: HR, 2.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.46–4.83; severe: CAC: HR, 3.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.99–6.36; and FT: HR, 3.88; 95% confidence interval, 2.58–5.85). In the CAC arm, the majority of events (n=112 of 133, 84%) occurred in patients with any positive CAC test (score >0), whereas fewer than half of events occurred in patients with mildly, moderately, or severely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abnorm</span></strong>al FT (n=57 of 132, 43%; <i>P</i><0.001). In contrast, any <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abnorm</span></strong>ality on FT was significantly more specific for predicting events (78.6% for FT versus 35.2% for CAC; <i>P</i><0.001). Overall discriminatory ability in predicting the primary end point of mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and unstable angina hospitalization was similar and fair for both CAC and FT (C statistic, 0.67 versus 0.64). Coronary computed tomographic angiography provided significantly better prognostic information compared with FT and CAC testing (C index, 0.72).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among stable outpatients presenting with suspected coronary artery disease, most patients experiencing clinical events have measurable CAC at baseline, and fewer than half have any <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abnorm</span></strong>alities on FT.

Identification of MicroRNA-124 as a Major Regulator of Enhanced Endothelial Cell Glycolysis in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension via PTBP1 (Polypyrimidine Tract Binding Protein) and Pyruvate Kinase M2
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abnorm</span></strong>al growth and enhanced glycolysis of pulmonary artery endothelial cells. However, the mechanisms underlying alterations in energy production have not been identified.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Here, we examined the miRNA and proteomic profiles of blood outgrowth endothelial cells (BOECs) from patients with heritable PAH caused by mutations in the bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 (<i>BMPR2</i>) gene and patients with idiopathic PAH to determine mechanisms underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abnorm</span></strong>al endothelial glycolysis. We hypothesized that in BOECs from patients with PAH, the downregulation of microRNA-124 (miR-124), determined with a tiered systems biology approach, is responsible for increased expression of the splicing factor <i>PTBP1</i> (polypyrimidine tract binding protein), resulting in alternative splicing of pyruvate kinase muscle isoforms 1 and 2 (PKM1 and 2) and consequently increased PKM2 expression. We questioned whether this alternative regulation plays a critical role in the hyperglycolytic phenotype of PAH endothelial cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Heritable PAH and idiopathic PAH BOECs recapitulated the metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abnorm</span></strong>alities observed in pulmonary artery endothelial cells from patients with idiopathic PAH, confirming a switch from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis. Overexpression of miR-124 or siRNA silencing of <i>PTPB1</i> restored normal proliferation and glycolysis in heritable PAH BOECs, corrected the dysregulation of glycolytic genes and lactate production, and partially restored mitochondrial respiration. <i>BMPR2</i> knockdown in control BOECs reduced the expression of miR-124, increased <i>PTPB1</i>, and enhanced glycolysis. Moreover, we observed reduced miR-124, increased <i>PTPB1</i> and <i>PKM2</i> expression, and significant dysregulation of glycolytic genes in the rat SUGEN-hypoxia model of severe PAH, characterized by reduced <i>BMPR2</i> expression and endothelial hyperproliferation, supporting the relevance of this mechanism in vivo.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Pulmonary vascular and circulating progenitor endothelial cells isolated from patients with PAH demonstrate downregulation of miR-124, leading to the metabolic and proliferative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abnorm</span></strong>alities in PAH ECs via PTPB1 and PKM1/PKM2.

Disease Models & Mechanisms
A novel mouse model of Warburg Micro syndrome reveals roles for RAB18 in eye development and organisation of the neuronal cytoskeleton
<p>Mutations in <i>RAB18</i> have been shown to cause the heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorder Warburg Micro syndrome (WARBM). Individuals with WARBM present with a range of clinical symptoms, including ocular and neurological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abnorm</span></strong>alities. However, the underlying cellular and molecular pathogenesis of the disorder remains unclear, largely owing to the lack of any robust animal models that phenocopy both the ocular and neurological features of the disease. We report here the generation and characterisation of a novel <i>Rab18</i>-mutant mouse model of WARBM. <i>Rab18</i>-mutant mice are viable and fertile. They present with congenital nuclear cataracts and atonic pupils, recapitulating the characteristic ocular features that are associated with WARBM. Additionally, <i>Rab18</i>-mutant cells exhibit an increase in lipid droplet size following treatment with oleic acid. Lipid droplet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abnorm</span></strong>alities are a characteristic feature of cells taken from WARBM individuals, as well as cells taken from individuals with other neurodegenerative conditions. Neurological dysfunction is also apparent in <i>Rab18</i>-mutant mice, including progressive weakness of the hind limbs. We show that the neurological defects are, most likely, not caused by gross perturbations in synaptic vesicle recycling in the central or peripheral nervous system. Rather, loss of <i>Rab18</i> is associated with widespread disruption of the neuronal cytoskeleton, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abnorm</span></strong>al accumulations of neurofilament and microtubule proteins in synaptic terminals, and gross disorganisation of the cytoskeleton in peripheral nerves. Global proteomic profiling of peripheral nerves in <i>Rab18</i>-mutant mice reveals significant alterations in several core molecular pathways that regulate cytoskeletal dynamics in neurons. The apparent similarities between the WARBM phenotype and the phenotype that we describe here indicate that the <i>Rab18</i>-mutant mouse provides an important platform for investigation of the disease pathogenesis and therapeutic interventions.</p>

Aberrant Rac1-cofilin signaling mediates defects in dendritic spines, synaptic function, and sensory perception in fragile X syndrome
<p>Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disabilities and a leading cause of autism. FXS is caused by a trinucleotide expansion in the gene <i>FMR1</i> on the X chromosome. The neuroanatomical hallmark of FXS is an overabundance of immature dendritic spines, a factor thought to underlie synaptic dysfunction and impaired cognition. We showed that aberrantly increased activity of the Rho GTPase Rac1 inhibited the actin-depolymerizing factor cofilin, a major determinant of dendritic spine structure, and caused disease-associated spine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abnorm</span></strong>alities in the somatosensory cortex of FXS model mice. Increased cofilin phosphorylation and actin polymerization coincided with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abnorm</span></strong>al dendritic spines and impaired synaptic maturation. Viral delivery of a constitutively active cofilin mutant (cofilinS3A) into the somatosensory cortex of <i>Fmr1</i>-deficient mice rescued the immature dendritic spine phenotype and increased spine density. Inhibition of the Rac1 effector PAK1 with a small-molecule inhibitor rescued cofilin signaling in FXS mice, indicating a causal relationship between PAK1 and cofilin signaling. PAK1 inhibition rescued synaptic signaling (specifically the synaptic ratio of NMDA/AMPA in layer V pyramidal neurons) and improved sensory processing in FXS mice. These findings suggest a causal relationship between increased Rac1-cofilin signaling, synaptic defects, and impaired sensory processing in FXS and uncover a previously unappreciated role for impaired Rac1-cofilin signaling in the aberrant spine morphology and spine density associated with FXS.</p>

3D Imaging of Tapetal Mitochondria Suggests the Importance of Mitochondrial Fission in Pollen Growth
<p>Mitochondrial fission occurs frequently in plant cells, but its biological significance is poorly understood because mutants specifically impaired in mitochondrial fission do not show obvious defects in vegetative growth. Here, we revealed that the production of viable pollen was reduced in mutants lacking one of the three main proteins involved in mitochondrial fission in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), DYNAMIN-RELATED PROTEIN3A (DRP3A)/Arabidopsis DYNAMIN-LIKE PROTEIN2A, DRP3B, and ELONGATED MITOCHONDRIA1 (ELM1). In <i>drp3b</i> and <i>elm1</i>, young microspores contained an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abnorm</span></strong>al number of nuclei, and mature pollen had aberrant accumulation of lipids in their coat and an irregular pollen outer wall. Because the formation of the pollen wall and coat is mainly associated with tapetal function, we used 3D imaging to quantify geometric and textural features of cells and mitochondria in the tapetum at different stages, using isolated single tapetal cells in which the in vivo morphology and volume of cells and mitochondria were preserved. Tapetal cells and their mitochondria changed in the volume and morphology at different developmental stages. Defective mitochondrial fission in the <i>elm1</i> and <i>drp3b</i> mutants caused changes in mitochondrial status, including mitochondrial elongation, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abnorm</span></strong>al mitochondrial ultrastructure, a decrease in cross-sectional area, and a slight alteration of mitochondrial distribution, as well as a large reduction in mitochondrial density. Our studies suggest that mitochondrial fission is required for proper mitochondrial status in the tapetum and possibly in pollen as well and therefore plays an important role for the production of viable pollen.</p>

Two SUMO Proteases SUMO PROTEASE RELATED TO FERTILITY1 and 2 Are Required for Fertility in Arabidopsis
<p>In plants, the posttranslational modification small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) is involved in regulating several important developmental and cellular processes, including flowering time control and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. Here, we report two proteases, SUMO PROTEASE RELATED TO FERTILITY1 (SPF1) and SPF2, that regulate male and female gamete and embryo development and remove SUMO from proteins in vitro and in vivo. <i>spf1</i> mutants exhibit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abnorm</span></strong>al floral structures and embryo development, while <i>spf2</i> mutants exhibit largely a wild-type phenotype. However, <i>spf1 spf2</i> double mutants exhibit severe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abnorm</span></strong>alities in microgametogenesis, megagametogenesis, and embryo development, suggesting that the two genes are functionally redundant. Mutation of <i>SPF1</i> and <i>SPF2</i> genes also results in misexpression of generative- and embryo-specific genes. In vitro, SPF1 and SPF2 process SUMO1 precursors into a mature form, and as expected in vivo, <i>spf1</i> and <i>spf2</i> mutants accumulate SUMO conjugates. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified EMBRYO SAC DEVELOPMENT ARREST9 (EDA9) as an SPF1-interacting protein. In vivo, we demonstrate that EDA9 is sumolyated and that, in <i>spf1</i> mutants, EDA9-SUMO conjugates increase in abundance, demonstrating that EDA9 is a substrate of SPF1. Together, our results demonstrate that SPF1 and SPF2 are two SUMO proteases important for plant development in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>).</p>

Cytological and Transcriptomic Analyses Reveal Important Roles of <i>CLE19</i> in Pollen Exine Formation
<p>The CLAVATA3/ESR-RELATED (CLE) peptide signals are required for cell-cell communication in several plant growth and developmental processes. However, little is known regarding the possible functions of the CLEs in the anther. Here, we show that a T-DNA insertional mutant, and dominant-negative (DN) and overexpression (OX) transgenic plants of the <i>CLE19</i> gene, exhibited significantly reduced anther size and pollen grain number and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abnorm</span></strong>al pollen wall formation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Interestingly, the <i>DN</i>-<i>CLE19</i> pollen grains showed a more extensively covered surface, but <i>CLE19-OX</i> pollen exine exhibited clearly missing connections in the network and lacked separation between areas that normally form the lacunae. With a combination of cell biological, genetic, and transcriptomic analyses on <i>cle19</i>, <i>DN</i>-<i>CLE19</i>, and <i>CLE19-OX</i> plants, we demonstrated that <i>CLE19-OX</i> plants produced highly vacuolated and swollen <i>aborted microspores</i> (<i>ams</i>)-like tapetal cells, lacked lipidic tapetosomes and elaioplasts, and had <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abnorm</span></strong>al pollen primexine without obvious accumulation of sporopollenin precursors. Moreover, <i>CLE19</i> is important for the normal expression of more than 1,000 genes, including the transcription factor gene <i>AMS</i>, 280 <i>AMS</i>-downstream genes, and other genes involved in pollen coat and pollen exine formation, lipid metabolism, pollen germination, and hormone metabolism. In addition, the <i>DN-CLE19(+/+) ams(−/−)</i> plants exhibited the <i>ams</i> anther phenotype and <i>ams(+/−)</i> partially suppressed the <i>DN-CLE19</i> transgene-induced pollen exine defects. These findings demonstrate that the proper amount of CLE19 signal is essential for the normal expression of <i>AMS</i> and its downstream gene networks in the regulation of anther development and pollen exine formation.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Cuticle Biosynthesis in Tomato Leaves Is Developmentally Regulated by Abscisic Acid
<p>The expansion of aerial organs in plants is coupled with the synthesis and deposition of a hydrophobic cuticle, composed of cutin and waxes, which is critically important in limiting water loss. While the abiotic stress-related hormone abscisic acid (ABA) is known to up-regulate wax accumulation in response to drought, the hormonal regulation of cuticle biosynthesis during organ ontogeny is poorly understood. To address the hypothesis that ABA also mediates cuticle formation during organ development, we assessed the effect of ABA deficiency on cuticle formation in three ABA biosynthesis-impaired tomato mutants. The mutant leaf cuticles were thinner, had structural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abnorm</span></strong>alities, and had a substantial reduction in levels of cutin. ABA deficiency also consistently resulted in differences in the composition of leaf cutin and cuticular waxes. Exogenous application of ABA partially rescued these phenotypes, confirming that they were a consequence of reduced ABA levels. The ABA mutants also showed reduced expression of genes involved in cutin or wax formation. This difference was again countered by exogenous ABA, further indicating regulation of cuticle biosynthesis by ABA. The fruit cuticles were affected differently by the ABA-associated mutations, but in general were thicker. However, no structural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abnorm</span></strong>alities were observed, and the cutin and wax compositions were less affected than in leaf cuticles, suggesting that ABA action influences cuticle formation in an organ-dependent manner. These results suggest dual roles for ABA in regulating leaf cuticle formation: one that is fundamentally associated with leaf expansion, independent of abiotic stress, and another that is drought induced.</p>

KNS4/UPEX1: A Type II Arabinogalactan <i>β</i>-(1,3)-Galactosyltransferase Required for Pollen Exine Development
<p>Pollen exine is essential for protection from the environment of the male gametes of seed-producing plants, but its assembly and composition remain poorly understood. We previously characterized Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis</i> <i>thaliana</i>) mutants with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abnorm</span></strong>al pollen exine structure and morphology that we named <i>kaonashi</i> (<i>kns</i>). Here we describe the identification of the causal gene of <i>kns4</i> that was found to be a member of the CAZy glycosyltransferase 31 gene family, identical to <i>UNEVEN PATTERN OF EXINE1</i>, and the biochemical characterization of the encoded protein. The characteristic exine phenotype in the <i>kns4</i> mutant is related to an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abnorm</span></strong>ality of the primexine matrix laid on the surface of developing microspores. Using light microscopy with a combination of type II arabinogalactan (AG) antibodies and staining with the arabinogalactan-protein (AGP)-specific β-Glc Yariv reagent, we show that the levels of AGPs in the <i>kns4</i> microspore primexine are considerably diminished, and their location differs from that of wild type, as does the distribution of pectin labeling. Furthermore, <i>kns4</i> mutants exhibit reduced fertility as indicated by shorter fruit lengths and lower seed set compared to the wild type, confirming that KNS4 is critical for pollen viability and development. KNS4 was heterologously expressed in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>, and was shown to possess β-(1,3)-galactosyltransferase activity responsible for the synthesis of AG glycans that are present on both AGPs and/or the pectic polysaccharide rhamnogalacturonan I. These data demonstrate that defects in AGP/pectic glycans, caused by disruption of <i>KNS4</i> function, impact pollen development and viability in Arabidopsis.</p>

ZRF1 Chromatin Regulators Have Polycomb Silencing and Independent Roles in Development
<p>Histone H2A monoubiquitination (H2Aub1), catalyzed by Polycomb-Repressive Complex1 (PRC1), is a key epigenetic mark in Polycomb silencing. However, little is known about how H2Aub1 is read to exert downstream physiological functions. The animal ZUOTIN-RELATED FACTOR1 (ZRF1) has been reported to bind H2Aub1 to promote or repress the expression of varied target genes. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) ZRF1 homologs, AtZRF1a and AtZRF1b, are key regulators of multiple processes during plant growth and development. Loss of function of both <i>AtZRF1a</i> and <i>AtZRF1b</i> in <i>atzrf1a atzrf1b</i> mutants causes seed germination delay, small plant size, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abnorm</span></strong>al meristem activity, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abnorm</span></strong>al flower development, as well as gametophyte transmission and embryogenesis defects. Some of these defects overlap with those described previously in the PRC1-defective mutants <i>atbmi1a atbmi1b</i> and <i>atring1a atring1b</i>, but others are specific to <i>atzrf1a atzrf1b</i>. In line with this, 4,519 genes (representing more than 14% of all genes) within the Arabidopsis genome are found differentially expressed in <i>atzrf1a atzrf1b</i> seedlings, and among them, 114 genes are commonly up-regulated in <i>atring1a atring1b</i> and <i>atbmi1a atbmi1b</i>. Finally, we show that in both <i>atzrf1a atzrf1b</i> and <i>atbmi1a atbmi1b</i> seedlings, the seed developmental genes <i>ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE3</i>, <i>CRUCIFERIN3</i>, and <i>CHOTTO1</i> are derepressed, in association with the reduced levels of H2Aub1 and histone H3 lysine-27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). Collectively, our results indicate that <i>AtZRF1a/b</i> play both PRC1-related and PRC1-unrelated functions in regulating plant growth and development and that <i>AtZRF1a/b</i> promote H2Aub1 and H3K27me3 deposition in gene suppression. Our work provides novel insight into the mechanisms of function of this family of evolutionarily conserved chromatin regulators.</p>

Decreased and increased relative acetabular volume predict the development of osteoarthritis of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Recently, there has been considerable interest in quantifying   the associations between bony <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abnorm</span></strong>alities around and in the hip   joint and osteoarthritis (OA). Our aim was to investigate the relationships   between acetabular undercoverage, acetabular overcoverage, and femoroacetabular   impingement (FAI) with OA of the hip, which currently remain controversial. </p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A total of 545 cadaveric skeletons (1090 hips) from the Hamann-Todd   osteological collection were obtained. Femoral head volume (FHV),   acetabular volume (AV), the FHV/AV ratio, acetabular version, alpha   angle and anterior femoral neck offset (AFNO) were measured. A validated   grading system was used to quantify OA of the hip as minimal, moderate,   or severe. Multiple linear and multinomial logistic regression were   used to determine the factors that correlated independently with   the FHV, AV, and the FHV/AV ratio. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Female cadavers had smaller FHVs (standardised beta -0.382, p   < 0.001), and AVs (standardised beta -0.351, p < 0.001), compared   with male patients, although the FHV/AV ratio was unchanged. Every   1° increase in alpha angle increased the probability of having moderate   OA of the hip compared with minimal OA by 7.1%. Every 1 mm decrease   in AFNO increased the probability of having severe or moderate OA   of the hip, compared with minimal OA, by 11% and 9%, respectively.   The relative risk ratios of having severe OA of the hip compared   with minimal OA were 7.2 and 3.3 times greater for acetabular undercoverage   and overcoverage, respectively, relative to normal acetabular cover. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion </title><p>Acetabular undercoverage and overcoverage were independent predictors   of increased OA of the hip. The alpha angle and AFNO had modest   effects, supporting the hypothesis that bony <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abnorm</span></strong>alities both   in acetabular dysplasia and FAI are associated with severe OA.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:432–9.</p></sec>

Age-Related Autonomous Aldosteronism
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Both aging and inappropriate secretion of aldosterone increase the risk for developing cardiovascular disease; however, the influence of aging on aldosterone secretion and physiology is not well understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The relationship between age and adrenal aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) expression was evaluated in 127 normal adrenal glands from deceased kidney donors (age, 9 months to 68 years). Following immunohistochemistry, CYP11B2-expressing area and areas of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abnorm</span></strong>al foci of CYP11B2-expressing cells, called aldosterone-producing cell clusters, were analyzed. In a separate ancillary clinical study of 677 participants without primary aldosteronism, who were studied on both high and restricted sodium diets (age, 18–71 years), we used multivariable linear regression to assess the independent associations between age and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system physiology.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In adrenal tissue, the total CYP11B2-expressing area was negatively correlated with age (<i>r</i>=−0.431, <i>P</i><0.0001), whereas the total aldosterone-producing cell cluster area was positively correlated with age (<i>r</i>=0.390, <i>P</i><0.0001). The integrated ratio of aldosterone-producing cell cluster to CYP11B2-expressing area was most strongly and positively correlated with age (<i>r</i>=0.587, <i>P</i><0.0001). When participants in the clinical study were maintained on a high sodium balance, renin activity progressively declined with older age, whereas serum and urinary aldosterone did not significantly decline. Correspondingly, the aldosterone-to-renin ratio was positively and independently associated with older age (adjusted β=+5.54 ng/dL per ng/mL per hour per 10 years, <i>P</i><0.001). In contrast, when participants were assessed under sodium-restricted conditions, physiological stimulation of aldosterone was blunted with older age (β=−4.6 ng/dL per 10 years, <i>P</i><0.0001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Aging is associated with a pattern of decreased normal zona glomerulosa CYP11B2 expression and increased aldosterone-producing cell cluster expression. This histopathologic finding parallels an age-related autonomous aldosteronism and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abnorm</span></strong>al aldosterone physiology that provides 1 potential explanation for age-related cardiovascular risk.</p></sec>

Delayed Repolarization Underlies Ventricular Arrhythmias in Rats With Heart Failure and Preserved Ejection Fraction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) represents approximately half of heart failure, and its incidence continues to increase. The leading cause of mortality in HFpEF is sudden death, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Dahl salt-sensitive rats were fed a high-salt diet (8% NaCl) from 7 weeks of age to induce HFpEF (n=38). Rats fed a normal-salt diet (0.3% NaCl) served as controls (n=13). Echocardiograms were performed to assess systolic and diastolic function from 14 weeks of age. HFpEF-verified and control rats underwent programmed electrical stimulation. Corrected QT interval was measured by surface ECG. The mechanisms of ventricular arrhythmias (VA) were probed by optical mapping, whole-cell patch clamp to measure action potential duration and ionic currents, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting to investigate changes in ion channel expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>After 7 weeks of a high-salt diet, 31 of 38 rats showed diastolic dysfunction and preserved ejection fraction along with signs of heart failure and hence were diagnosed with HFpEF. Programmed electric stimulation demonstrated increased susceptibility to VA in HFpEF rats (<i>P</i><0.001 versus controls). The arrhythmogenicity index was increased (<i>P</i><0.001) and the corrected QT interval on ECG was prolonged (<i>P</i><0.001) in HFpEF rats. Optical mapping of HFpEF hearts demonstrated prolonged action potentials (<i>P</i><0.05) and multiple reentry circuits during induced VA. Single-cell recordings of cardiomyocytes isolated from HFpEF rats confirmed a delay of repolarization (<i>P</i>=0.001) and revealed downregulation of transient outward potassium current (<i>I</i><sub>to</sub>; <i>P</i><0.05). The rapid components of the delayed rectifier potassium current (<i>I</i><sub>Kr</sub>) and the inward rectifier potassium current (<i>I</i><sub>K1</sub>) were also downregulated (<i>P</i><0.05), but the current densities were much lower than for <i>I</i><sub>to</sub>. In accordance with the reduction of <i>I</i><sub>to</sub>, both <i>Kcnd3</i> transcript and Kv4.3 protein levels were decreased in HFpEF rat hearts.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Susceptibility to VA was markedly increased in rats with HFpEF. Underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abnorm</span></strong>alities include QT prolongation, delayed repolarization from downregulation of potassium currents, and multiple reentry circuits during VA. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that potassium current downregulation leads to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abnorm</span></strong>al repolarization in HFpEF, which in turn predisposes to VA and sudden cardiac death.</p></sec>

Neurological Injury and Cerebral Blood Flow in Single Ventricles Throughout Staged Surgical Reconstruction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients with a single ventricle experience a high rate of brain injury and adverse neurodevelopmental outcome; however, the incidence of brain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abnorm</span></strong>alities throughout surgical reconstruction and their relationship with cerebral blood flow, oxygen delivery, and carbon dioxide reactivity remain unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients with a single ventricle were studied with magnetic resonance imaging scans immediately prior to bidirectional Glenn (pre-BDG), before Fontan (BDG), and then 3 to 9 months after Fontan reconstruction.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>One hundred sixty-eight consecutive subjects recruited into the project underwent 235 scans: 63 pre-BDG (mean age, 4.8±1.7 months), 118 BDG (2.9±1.4 years), and 54 after Fontan (2.4±1.0 years). Nonacute ischemic white matter changes on T2-weighted imaging, focal tissue loss, and ventriculomegaly were all more commonly detected in BDG and Fontan compared with pre-BDG patients (<i>P</i><0.05). BDG patients had significantly higher cerebral blood flow than did Fontan patients. The odds of discovering brain injury with adjustment for surgical stage as well as ≥2 coexisting lesions within a patient decreased (63%–75% and 44%, respectively) with increasing amount of cerebral blood flow (<i>P</i><0.05).

Prognostic Value of Noninvasive Cardiovascular Testing in Patients With Stable Chest Pain
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Optimal management of patients with stable chest pain relies on the prognostic information provided by noninvasive cardiovascular testing, but there are limited data from randomized trials comparing anatomic with functional testing.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In the PROMISE trial (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain), patients with stable chest pain and intermediate pretest probability for obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) were randomly assigned to functional testing (exercise electrocardiography, nuclear stress, or stress echocardiography) or coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA). Site-based diagnostic test reports were classified as normal or mildly, moderately, or severely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abnorm</span></strong>al. The primary end point was death, myocardial infarction, or unstable angina hospitalizations over a median follow-up of 26.1 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Both the prevalence of normal test results and incidence rate of events in these patients were significantly lower among 4500 patients randomly assigned to CTA in comparison with 4602 patients randomly assigned to functional testing (33.4% versus 78.0%, and 0.9% versus 2.1%, respectively; both <i>P</i><0.001). In CTA, 54.0% of events (n=74/137) occurred in patients with nonobstructive CAD (1%–69% stenosis). Prevalence of obstructive CAD and myocardial ischemia was low (11.9% versus 12.7%, respectively), with both findings having similar prognostic value (hazard ratio, 3.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.60–5.39; and 3.47; 95% CI, 2.42–4.99). When test findings were stratified as mildly, moderately, or severely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abnorm</span></strong>al, hazard ratios for events in comparison with normal tests increased proportionally for CTA (2.94, 7.67, 10.13; all <i>P</i><0.001) but not for corresponding functional testing categories (0.94 [<i>P</i>=0.87], 2.65 [<i>P</i>=0.001], 3.88 [<i>P</i><0.001]). The discriminatory ability of CTA in predicting events was significantly better than functional testing (c-index, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.68–0.76 versus 0.64; 95% CI, 0.59–0.69; <i>P</i>=0.04).

Postmortem Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Fetuses and Children
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Perinatal and pediatric autopsies have declined worldwide in the past decade. We compared the diagnostic accuracy of postmortem, cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging with conventional autopsy and histopathology assessment in fetuses and children.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We performed postmortem magnetic resonance imaging in 400 fetuses and children, using a 1.5-T Siemens Avanto magnetic resonance scanner before conventional autopsy. A pediatric CMR imager reported the CMR images, masked to autopsy information. The pathologists were masked to the information from CMR images. The institutional research ethics committee approved the study, and parental consent was obtained. Assuming a diagnostic accuracy of 50%, 400 cases were required for a 5% precision of estimate. Three cases were excluded from analysis, 2 with no conventional autopsy performed and 1 with insufficient CMR sequences performed. Thirty-eight CMR data sets were nondiagnostic (37 in fetuses ≤24 weeks; 1 in a fetus >24 weeks). In the remaining 359 cases, 44 cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abnorm</span></strong>alities were noted at autopsy. Overall sensitivity and specificity (95% confidence interval) of CMR was 72.7% (58.2–83.7%) and 96.2% (93.5–97.8%) for detecting any cardiac pathology, with positive and negative predictive values of 72.7% (58.2–83.7%) and 96.2% (93.5–97.8%), respectively.

<i>Cryptosporidium parvum</i>-induced ileo-caecal adenocarcinoma and Wnt signaling in a mouse model
<p><i>Cryptosporidium</i> species are apicomplexan protozoans that are found worldwide. These parasites constitute a large risk to human and animal health. They cause self-limited diarrhea in immunocompetent hosts and a life-threatening disease in immunocompromised hosts. Interestingly, <i>Cryptosporidium parvum</i> has been related to digestive carcinogenesis in humans. Consistent with a potential tumorigenic role of this parasite, in an original reproducible animal model of chronic cryptosporidiosis based on dexamethasone-treated or untreated adult SCID mice, we formerly reported that <i>C. parvum</i> (strains of animal and human origin) is able to induce digestive adenocarcinoma even in infections induced with very low inoculum. The aim of this study was to further characterize this animal model and to explore metabolic pathways potentially involved in the development of <i>C. parvum</i>-induced ileo-caecal oncogenesis. We searched for alterations in genes or proteins commonly involved in cell cycle, differentiation or cell migration, such as β-catenin, <i>Apc</i>, E-cadherin, <i>Kras</i> and <i>p53</i>. After infection of animals with <i>C. parvum</i> we demonstrated immunohistochemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abnorm</span></strong>al localization of Wnt signaling pathway components and p53. Mutations in the selected loci of studied genes were not found after high-throughput sequencing. Furthermore, alterations in the ultrastructure of adherens junctions of the ileo-caecal neoplastic epithelia of <i>C. parvum</i>-infected mice were recorded using transmission electron microscopy. In conclusion, we found for the first time that the Wnt signaling pathway, and particularly the cytoskeleton network, seems to be pivotal for the development of the <i>C. parvum</i>-induced neoplastic process and cell migration of transformed cells. Furthermore, this model is a valuable tool in understanding the host-pathogen interactions associated with the intricate infection process of this parasite, which is able to modulate host cytoskeleton activities and several host-cell biological processes and remains a significant cause of infection worldwide.</p>

Absence of strong strain effects in behavioral analyses of <i>Shank3</i>-deficient mice
<p>Haploinsufficiency of <i>SHANK3</i>, caused by chromosomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abnorm</span></strong>alities or mutations that disrupt one copy of the gene, leads to a neurodevelopmental syndrome called Phelan-McDermid syndrome, symptoms of which can include absent or delayed speech, intellectual disability, neurological changes and autism spectrum disorders. The SHANK3 protein forms a key structural part of the post-synaptic density. We previously generated and characterized mice with a targeted disruption of <i>Shank3</i> in which exons coding for the ankyrin-repeat domain were deleted and expression of full-length Shank3 was disrupted. We documented specific deficits in synaptic function and plasticity, along with reduced reciprocal social interactions, in <i>Shank3</i> heterozygous mice. Changes in phenotype owing to a mutation at a single locus are quite frequently modulated by other loci, most dramatically when the entire genetic background is changed. In mice, each strain of laboratory mouse represents a distinct genetic background and alterations in phenotype owing to gene knockout or transgenesis are frequently different across strains, which can lead to the identification of important modifier loci. We have investigated the effect of genetic background on phenotypes of <i>Shank3</i> heterozygous, knockout and wild-type mice, using C57BL/6, 129SVE and FVB/Ntac strain backgrounds. We focused on observable behaviors with the goal of carrying out subsequent analyses to identify modifier loci. Surprisingly, there were very modest strain effects over a large battery of analyses. These results indicate that behavioral phenotypes associated with <i>Shank3</i> haploinsufficiency are largely strain-independent.</p>

From shape to cells: mouse models reveal mechanisms altering palate development in Apert syndrome
<p>Apert syndrome is a congenital disorder characterized by severe skull malformations and caused by one of two missense mutations, S252W and P253R, on fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2). The molecular bases underlying differential Apert syndrome phenotypes are still poorly understood and it is unclear why cleft palate is more frequent in patients carrying the S252W mutation. Taking advantage of Apert syndrome mouse models, we performed a novel combination of morphometric, histological and immunohistochemical analyses to precisely quantify distinct palatal phenotypes in <i>Fgfr2<sup>+/S252W</sup></i> and <i>Fgfr2<sup>+/P253R</sup></i> mice. We localized regions of differentially altered FGF signaling and assessed local cell patterns to establish a baseline for understanding the differential effects of these two <i>Fgfr2</i> mutations. Palatal suture scoring and comparative 3D shape analysis from high resolution μCT images of 120 newborn mouse skulls showed that <i>Fgfr2<sup>+/S252W</sup></i> mice display relatively more severe palate dysmorphologies, with contracted and more separated palatal shelves, a greater tendency to fuse the maxillary-palatine sutures and aberrant development of the inter-premaxillary suture. These palatal defects are associated with suture-specific patterns of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abnorm</span></strong>al cellular proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The posterior region of the developing palate emerges as a potential target for therapeutic strategies in clinical management of cleft palate in Apert syndrome patients.</p>

Functional and histopathological identification of the respiratory failure in a DMSXL transgenic mouse model of myotonic dystrophy
<p>Acute and chronic respiratory failure is one of the major and potentially life-threatening features in individuals with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). Despite several clinical demonstrations showing respiratory problems in DM1 patients, the mechanisms are still not completely understood. This study was designed to investigate whether the DMSXL transgenic mouse model for DM1 exhibits respiratory disorders and, if so, to identify the pathological changes underlying these respiratory problems. Using pressure plethysmography, we assessed the breathing function in control mice and DMSXL mice generated after large expansions of the CTG repeat in successive generations of DM1 transgenic mice. Statistical analysis of breathing function measurements revealed a significant decrease in the most relevant respiratory parameters in DMSXL mice, indicating impaired respiratory function. Histological and morphometric analysis showed pathological changes in diaphragmatic muscle of DMSXL mice, characterized by an increase in the percentage of type I muscle fibers, the presence of central nuclei, partial denervation of end-plates (EPs) and a significant reduction in their size, shape complexity and density of acetylcholine receptors, all of which reflect a possible breakdown in communication between the diaphragmatic muscles fibers and the nerve terminals. Diaphragm muscle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abnorm</span></strong>alities were accompanied by an accumulation of mutant DMPK RNA foci in muscle fiber nuclei. Moreover, in DMSXL mice, the unmyelinated phrenic afferents are significantly lower. Also in these mice, significant neuronopathy was not detected in either cervical phrenic motor neurons or brainstem respiratory neurons. Because EPs are involved in the transmission of action potentials and the unmyelinated phrenic afferents exert a modulating influence on the respiratory drive, the pathological alterations affecting these structures might underlie the respiratory impairment detected in DMSXL mice. Understanding mechanisms of respiratory deficiency should guide pharmaceutical and clinical research towards better therapy for the respiratory deficits associated with DM1.</p>

Bloomsbury report on mouse embryo phenotyping: recommendations from the IMPC workshop on embryonic lethal screening
<p>Identifying genes that are important for embryo development is a crucial first step towards understanding their many functions in driving the ordered growth, differentiation and organogenesis of embryos. It can also shed light on the origins of developmental disease and congenital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abnorm</span></strong>alities. Current international efforts to examine gene function in the mouse provide a unique opportunity to pinpoint genes that are involved in embryogenesis, owing to the emergence of embryonic lethal knockout mutants. Through internationally coordinated efforts, the International Knockout Mouse Consortium (IKMC) has generated a public resource of mouse knockout strains and, in April 2012, the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC), supported by the EU InfraCoMP programme, convened a workshop to discuss developing a phenotyping pipeline for the investigation of embryonic lethal knockout lines. This workshop brought together over 100 scientists, from 13 countries, who are working in the academic and commercial research sectors, including experts and opinion leaders in the fields of embryology, animal imaging, data capture, quality control and annotation, high-throughput mouse production, phenotyping, and reporter gene analysis. This article summarises the outcome of the workshop, including (1) the vital scientific importance of phenotyping embryonic lethal mouse strains for basic and translational research; (2) a common framework to harmonise international efforts within this context; (3) the types of phenotyping that are likely to be most appropriate for systematic use, with a focus on 3D embryo imaging; (4) the importance of centralising data in a standardised form to facilitate data mining; and (5) the development of online tools to allow open access to and dissemination of the phenotyping data.</p>

The RNA-binding protein Mex3b regulates the spatial organization of the Rap1 pathway
<p>The four related mammalian MEX-3 RNA-binding proteins are evolutionarily conserved molecules for which the <i>in vivo</i> functions have not yet been fully characterized. Here, we report that male mice deficient for the gene encoding Mex3b are subfertile. Seminiferous tubules of <i>Mex3b</i>-deficient mice are obstructed as a consequence of the disrupted phagocytic capacity of somatic Sertoli cells. In addition, both the formation and the integrity of the blood-testis barrier are compromised owing to mislocalization of N-cadherin and connexin 43 at the surface of Sertoli cells. We further establish that Mex3b acts to regulate the cortical level of activated Rap1, a small G protein controlling phagocytosis and cell-cell interaction, through the activation and transport of Rap1GAP. The active form of Rap1 (Rap1-GTP) is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abnorm</span></strong>ally increased at the membrane cortex and chemically restoring Rap1-GTP to physiological levels rescues the phagocytic and adhesion abilities of Sertoli cells. Overall, these findings implicate Mex3b in the spatial organization of the Rap1 pathway that orchestrates Sertoli cell functions.</p>

Dual regulation of <i>ETTIN</i> (<i>ARF3</i>) gene expression by AS1-AS2, which maintains the DNA methylation level, is involved in stabilization of leaf adaxial-abaxial partitioning in <i>Arabidopsis</i>
<p>Leaf primordia are generated at the periphery of the shoot apex, developing into flat symmetric organs with adaxial-abaxial polarity, in which the indeterminate state is repressed. Despite the crucial role of the ASYMMETRIC LEAVES1 (AS1)-AS2 nuclear-protein complex in leaf adaxial-abaxial polarity specification, information on mechanisms controlling their downstream genes has remained elusive. We systematically analyzed transcripts by microarray and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and performed genetic rescue of <i>as1</i> and <i>as2</i> phenotypic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abnorm</span></strong>alities, which identified a new target gene, <i>ETTIN</i> (<i>ETT</i>)/<i>AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR3</i> (<i>ARF3</i>), which encodes an abaxial factor acting downstream of the AS1-AS2 complex. While the AS1-AS2 complex represses <i>ETT</i> by direct binding of AS1 to the <i>ETT</i> promoter, it also indirectly activates miR390- and RDR6-dependent post-transcriptional gene silencing to negatively regulate both <i>ETT</i> and <i>ARF4</i> activities. Furthermore, AS1-AS2 maintains the status of DNA methylation in the <i>ETT</i> coding region. In agreement, filamentous leaves formed in <i>as1</i> and <i>as2</i> plants treated with a DNA methylation inhibitor were rescued by loss of <i>ETT</i> and <i>ARF4</i> activities. We suggest that negative transcriptional, post-transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of the ARFs by AS1-AS2 is important for stabilizing early leaf partitioning into abaxial and adaxial domains.</p>

Mental Stress–Induced-Myocardial Ischemia in Young Patients With Recent Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI) is frequent in patients with coronary artery disease and is associated with worse prognosis. Young women with a previous myocardial infarction (MI), a group with unexplained higher mortality than men of comparable age, have shown elevated rates of MSIMI, but the mechanisms are unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied 306 patients (150 women and 156 men) ≤61 years of age who were hospitalized for MI in the previous 8 months and 112 community controls (58 women and 54 men) frequency matched for sex and age to the patients with MI. Endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilation and microvascular reactivity (reactive hyperemia index) were measured at rest and 30 minutes after mental stress. The digital vasomotor response to mental stress was assessed using peripheral arterial tonometry. Patients received <sup>99m</sup>Tc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging at rest, with mental (speech task) and conventional (exercise/pharmacological) stress.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean age of the sample was 50 years (range, 22–61). In the MI group but not among controls, women had a more adverse socioeconomic and psychosocial profile than men. There were no sex differences in cardiovascular risk factors, and among patients with MI, clinical severity tended to be lower in women. Women in both groups showed a higher peripheral arterial tonometry ratio during mental stress but a lower reactive hyperemia index after mental stress, indicating enhanced microvascular dysfunction after stress. There were no sex differences in flow-mediated dilation changes with mental stress. The rate of MSIMI was twice as high in women as in men (22% versus 11%, <i>P</i>=0.009), and ischemia with conventional stress was similarly elevated (31% versus 16%, <i>P</i>=0.002). Psychosocial and clinical risk factors did not explain sex differences in inducible ischemia. Although vascular responses to mental stress (peripheral arterial tonometry ratio and reactive hyperemia index) also did not explain sex differences in MSIMI, they were predictive of MSIMI in women only.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Young women after MI have a 2-fold likelihood of developing MSIMI compared with men and a similar increase in conventional stress ischemia. Microvascular dysfunction and peripheral vasoconstriction with mental stress are implicated in MSIMI among women but not among men, perhaps reflecting women’s proclivity toward ischemia because of microcirculatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abnorm</span></strong>alities.</p></sec>

Duct Stenting Versus Modified Blalock-Taussig Shunt in Neonates With Duct-Dependent Pulmonary Blood Flow
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Infants born with cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abnorm</span></strong>alities causing dependence on the arterial duct for pulmonary blood flow are often palliated with a shunt usually between the subclavian artery and either pulmonary artery. A so-called modified Blalock-Taussig shunt allows progress through early life to an age and weight at which repair or further more stable palliation can be safely achieved. Modified Blalock-Taussig shunts continue to present concern for postprocedural instability and early mortality such that other alternatives continue to be explored. Duct stenting (DS) is emerging as one such alternative with potential for greater early stability and improved survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The purpose of this study was to compare postprocedural outcomes and survival to next-stage palliative or reparative surgery between patients undergoing a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt or a DS in infants with duct-dependent pulmonary blood flow. All patients undergoing cardiac surgery and congenital interventions in the United Kingdom are prospectively recruited to an externally validated national outcome audit. From this audit, participating UK centers identified infants <30 days of age undergoing either a Blalock-Taussig shunt or a DS for cardiac conditions with duct-dependent pulmonary blood flow between January 2012 and December 31, 2015. One hundred seventy-one patients underwent a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt, and in 83 patients, DS was attempted. Primary and secondary outcomes of survival and need for extracorporeal support were analyzed with multivariable logistic regression. Longer-term mortality before repair and reintervention were analyzed with Cox proportional hazards regression. All multivariable analyses accommodated a propensity score to balance patient characteristics between the groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>There was an early (to discharge) survival advantage for infants before next-stage surgery in the DS group (odds ratio, 4.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.37–13.14; <i>P</i>=0.012). There was also a difference in the need for postprocedural extracorporeal support in favor of the DS group (odds ratio, 0.22; 95% confidence interval, 0.05–1.05; <i>P</i>=0.058). Longer-term survival outcomes showed a reduced risk of death before repair in the DS group (hazard ratio, 0.25; 95% confidence interval, 0.07–0.85; <i>P</i>=0.026) but a slightly increased risk of reintervention (hazard ratio, 1.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.85–2.64; <i>P</i>=0.165).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>DS is emerging as a preferred alternative to a surgical shunt for neonatal palliation with evidence for greater postprocedural stability and improved patient survival to destination surgical treatment.</p></sec>

MicroRNA-195 Regulates Metabolism in Failing Myocardium Via Alterations in Sirtuin 3 Expression and Mitochondrial Protein Acetylation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Heart failure leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abnorm</span></strong>alities of the failing myocardium coupled with an energy-depleted state and cardiac remodeling. The mitochondrial deacetylase sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of mitochondrial function through regulating the mitochondrial acetylome. It is interesting to note that unique cardiac and systemic microRNAs have been shown to play an important role in cardiac remodeling by modulating key signaling elements in the myocardium.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Cellular signaling was analyzed in human cardiomyocyte-like AC16 cells, and acetylation levels in rodent models of SIRT3<sup>–/–</sup>and transgenic microRNA-195 (miR-195) overexpression were compared with wild type. Luciferase assays, Western blotting, immunoprecipitation assays, and echocardiographic analysis were performed. Enzymatic activities of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and ATP synthase were measured.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In failing human myocardium, we observed induction of miR-195 along with decreased expression of the mitochondrial deacetylase SIRT3 that was associated with increased global protein acetylation. We further investigated the role of miR-195 in SIRT3-mediated metabolic processes and its impact on regulating enzymes involved in deacetylation. Proteomic analysis of the total acetylome showed increased overall acetylation, and specific lysine acetylation of 2 central mitochondrial metabolic enzymes, PDH and ATP synthase, as well. miR-195 downregulates SIRT3 expression through direct 3′-untranslated region targeting. Treatments with either sirtuin inhibitor nicotinamide, small interfering RNA–mediated SIRT3 knockdown or miR-195 overexpression enhanced acetylation of PDH complex and ATP synthase. This effect diminished PDH and ATP synthase activity and impaired mitochondrial respiration.SIRT3<sup>–/–</sup> and miR-195 transgenic mice consistently showed enhanced global protein acetylation, including PDH complex and ATP synthase, associated with decreased enzymatic activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Altogether, these data suggest that increased levels of miR-195 in failing myocardium regulate a novel pathway that involves direct SIRT3 suppression and enzymatic inhibition via increased acetylation of PDH and ATP synthase that are essential for cardiac energy metabolism.</p></sec>

Recently, <i>DES</i> mutations were described in patients with inherited arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia, although their cellular and molecular pathomechanisms are not precisely known. Our aim is to describe clinically and functionally the novel <i>DES</i>-p.Glu401Asp mutation as a cause of inherited left ventricular arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy/dysplasia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We identified the novel <i>DES</i> mutation p.Glu401Asp in a large Spanish family with inherited left ventricular arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy/dysplasia and a high incidence of adverse cardiac events. A full clinical evaluation was performed on all mutation carriers and noncarriers to establish clinical and genetic cosegregation. In addition, desmin, and intercalar disc–related proteins expression were histologically analyzed in explanted cardiac tissue affected by the <i>DES</i> mutation. Furthermore, mesenchymal stem cells were isolated and cultured from 2 family members with the <i>DES</i> mutation (1 with mild and 1 with severe symptomatology) and a member without the mutation (control) and differentiated ex vivo to cardiomyocytes. Then, important genes related to cardiac differentiation and function were analyzed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction.

One hundred percent of genotype-positive patients presented data consistent with inherited arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy/dysplasia phenotype with variable disease severity expression, high-incidence of sudden cardiac death, and absence of skeletal myopathy or conduction system disorders. Immunohistochemistry was compatible with inherited arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy/dysplasia, and the functional study showed an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abnorm</span></strong>al growth pattern and cellular adhesion, reduced desmin RNA expression, and some other membrane proteins, as well, and desmin aggregates in transfected cells expressing the mutant desmin.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The <i>DES</i>-p.Glu401Asp mutation causes predominant inherited left ventricular arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy/dysplasia with a high incidence of adverse clinical events in the absence of skeletal myopathy or conduction system disorders.

Targeting Transmembrane BAX Inhibitor Motif Containing 1 Alleviates Pathological Cardiac Hypertrophy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac hypertrophy and its resultant heart failure are among the most common causes of mortality worldwide. Abnormal protein degradation, especially the impaired lysosomal degradation of large organelles and membrane proteins, is involved in the progression of cardiac hypertrophy. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We investigated cardiac transmembrane BAX inhibitor motif containing 1 (TMBIM1) mRNA and protein expression levels in samples from patients with heart failure and mice with aortic banding (AB)–induced cardiac hypertrophy. We generated cardiac-specific <i>Tmbim1</i> knockout mice and cardiac-specific <i>Tmbim1</i>-overexpressing transgenic mice and then challenged them with AB surgery. We used microarray, confocal image, and coimmunoprecipitation analyses to identify the downstream targets of TMBIM1 in cardiac hypertrophy. <i>Tmbim1</i>/<i>Tlr4</i> double-knockout mice were generated to investigate whether the effects of TMBIM1 on cardiac hypertrophy were Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) dependent. Finally, lentivirus-mediated <i>TMBIM1</i> overexpression in a monkey AB model was performed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of TMBIM1.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>TMBIM1 expression was significantly downregulated on hypertrophic stimuli in both human and mice heart samples. Silencing cardiac <i>Tmbim1</i> aggravated AB-induced cardiac hypertrophy. This effect was blunted by <i>Tmbim1</i> overexpression. Transcriptome profiling revealed that the TLR4 signaling pathway was disrupted dramatically by manipulation of <i>Tmbim1</i>. The effects of TMBIM1 on cardiac hypertrophy were shown to be dependent on TLR4 in double-knockout mice. Fluorescent staining indicated that TMBIM1 promoted the lysosome-mediated degradation of activated TLR4. Coimmunoprecipitation assays confirmed that TMBIM1 directly interacted with tumor susceptibility gene 101 via a PTAP motif and accelerated the formation of multivesicular bodies that delivered TLR4 to the lysosomes. Finally, lentivirus-mediated <i>TMBIM1</i> overexpression reversed AB-induced cardiac hypertrophy in monkeys.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>TMBIM1 protects against pathological cardiac hypertrophy through promoting the lysosomal degradation of activated TLR4. Our findings reveal the central role of TMBIM1 as a multivesicular body regulator in the progression of pathological cardiac hypertrophy, as well as the role of vesicle trafficking in signaling regulation during cardiac hypertrophy. Moreover, targeting TMBIM1 could be a novel therapeutic strategy for treating cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure.</p></sec>

The multivariable-adjusted association of serum potassium with mortality was assessed by using comprehensive state-of-the-art regression methods that can accommodate time-dependent exposure modeling.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The study sample included 2164 patients with a total of 16 116 potassium observations. Mean potassium at discharge was 4.3±0.48 mEq/L. Hypokalemia (<3.5 mEq/L), normokalemia (3.5–5.0 mEq/L), and hyperkalemia (>5 mEq/L) were observed at the index admission in 77 (3.6%), 1965 (90.8%), and 122 (5.6%) patients, respectively. At a median follow-up of 2.8 years (range, 0.03–12.8 years), 1090 patients died (50.4%).

Mice with deficiencies in both apolipoprotein e (Apoe) and IDO (Apoe<sup>–/–</sup>/IDO<sup>–/–</sup>) were generated by cross-breeding IDO<sup>–/–</sup> mice with Apoe<sup>–/–</sup> mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The acute infusion of angiotensin II markedly increased the incidence of AAA in Apoe<sup>–/–</sup> mice, but not in Apoe<sup>–/–</sup>/IDO<sup>–/–</sup> mice, which presented decreased elastic lamina degradation and aortic expansion. These features were not altered by the reconstitution of bone marrow cells from IDO<sup>+/+</sup> mice. Moreover, angiotensin II infusion instigated interferon-γ, which induced the expression of IDO and kynureninase and increased 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HAA) levels in the plasma and aortas of Apoe<sup>–/–</sup> mice, but not in IDO<sup>–/–</sup> mice. Both IDO and kynureninase controlled the production of 3-HAA in vascular smooth muscle cells. 3-HAA upregulated matrix metallopeptidase 2 via transcription factor nuclear factor-κB. Furthermore, kynureninase knockdown in mice restrained 3-HAA, matrix metallopeptidase 2, and resultant AAA formation by angiotensin II infusion. Intraperitoneal injections of 3-HAA into Apoe<sup>–/–</sup> and Apoe<sup>–/–</sup>/IDO<sup>–/–</sup> mice for 6 weeks increased the expression and activity of matrix metallopeptidase 2 in aortas without affecting metabolic parameters. Finally, human AAA samples had stronger staining with the antibodies against 3-HAA, IDO, and kynureninase than those in adjacent nonaneurysmal aortic sections of human AAA samples.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These data define a previously undescribed causative role for 3-HAA, which is a product of tryptophan metabolism, in AAA formation.

Upregulation of Human Endogenous Retrovirus-K Is Linked to Immunity and Inflammation in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension

One PAH antigen linked to immunity and inflammation was pursued and a link to PAH pathophysiology was investigated by next-generation sequencing, functional studies in cultured monocytes and endothelial cells, and hemodynamic and lung studies in a rat.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>SAM domain and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1), an innate immune factor that suppresses HIV replication, was identified and confirmed as highly expressed in immune complexes from 16 hereditary and idiopathic PAH versus 12 control lungs. Elevated SAMHD1 was localized to endothelial cells, perivascular dendritic cells, and macrophages, and SAMHD1 antibodies were prevalent in tertiary lymphoid tissue. An unbiased screen using metagenomic sequencing related SAMHD1 to increased expression of human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K) in PAH versus control lungs (n=4). HERV-K envelope and deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase mRNAs were elevated in PAH versus control lungs (n=10), and proteins were localized to macrophages. HERV-K deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase induced SAMHD1 and proinflammatory cytokines (eg, interleukin 6, interleukin 1β, and tumor necrosis factor α) in circulating monocytes, pulmonary arterial endothelial cells, and also activated B cells. Vulnerability of pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (PAEC) to apoptosis was increased by HERV-K deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase in an interleukin 6-independent manner.

We used polytomous logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for associations between offspring congenital heart defects and maternal hypertensive disorders of pregnancy overall and for specific heart defects.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Offspring congenital heart defects were strongly associated with early preterm preeclampsia (OR, 7.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.11–8.03) and late preterm preeclampsia (OR, 2.82; 95% CI, 2.38–3.34) in the same pregnancy and weakly associated with term preeclampsia (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.06–1.27), but they were not associated with gestational hypertension (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.92–1.25). Association strengths were consistent across heart defect types. Offspring congenital heart defects in a previous pregnancy were also strongly associated with preterm preeclampsia in subsequent pregnancies (early preterm preeclampsia: OR, 2.37; 95% CI, 1.68–3.34; late preterm preeclampsia: OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.52–2.75) but were only modestly associated with term preeclampsia and not associated with gestational hypertension. Similarly, preterm preeclampsia in a previous pregnancy, but not term preeclampsia or gestational hypertension, was associated with offspring congenital heart defects in later pregnancies (early preterm preeclampsia: OR, 7.91; 95% CI, 6.06–10.3; late preterm preeclampsia: OR, 2.83; 95% CI, 2.11–3.79; term preeclampsia: OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.88–1.10; gestational hypertension: OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.92–1.38).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Linked pathophysiological mechanisms may be involved in some congenital heart defects and preterm preeclampsia. The strong associations across pregnancies support a predominantly maternal origin of effect.</p></sec>

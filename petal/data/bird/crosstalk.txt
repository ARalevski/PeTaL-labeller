Prior experience with conspecific signals enhances auditory midbrain responsiveness to conspecific vocalizations
<p>There is a long history in neuroethology of investigating how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ation signals influence the brain and behavior. It has become increasingly clear that brain areas associated with sensory processing are plastic in adults and that this plasticity is related to reproductive condition. However, the role of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ation signal reception in adult auditory plasticity has received relatively little attention. Here, we investigated whether the reception of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ation signals (a frog chorus) could enhance the responsiveness of the auditory system to future reception of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ation signals (a single male call). We found that animals that had been exposed to 10 days of a male chorus had stronger auditory midbrain immediate early gene expression than animals that had been exposed to 10 days of random tones when tested with 30 min of male calls or 30 min of tones. Our results suggest that exposure to dynamic social stimuli, like frog choruses, may play an important role in shaping the neural and behavioral responses to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ation signals.</p>

Endothelial Dab1 signaling orchestrates neuro-glia-vessel communication in the central nervous system
<p>The architecture of the neurovascular unit (NVU) is controlled by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ation of neurons, glia, and vascular cells. We found that the neuronal guidance cue reelin possesses proangiogenic activities that ensure the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ation of endothelial cells (ECs) with the glia to control neuronal migration and the establishment of the blood-brain barrier in the mouse brain. Apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2) and Disabled1 (Dab1) expressed in ECs are required for vascularization of the retina and the cerebral cortex. Deletion of Dab1 in ECs leads to a reduced secretion of laminin-α4 and decreased activation of integrin-β1 in glial cells, which in turn control neuronal migration and barrier properties of the NVU. Thus, reelin signaling in the endothelium is an instructive and integrative cue essential for neuro-glia-vascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ation.</p>

Anti-coalescence of bosons on a lossy beam splitter
<p>Two-boson <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interfer</span></strong>ence, a fundamentally quantum effect, has been extensively studied with photons through the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect and observed with guided plasmons. Using two freely propagating surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interfer</span></strong>ing on a lossy beam splitter, we show that the presence of loss enables us to modify the reflection and transmission factors of the beam splitter, thus revealing quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interfer</span></strong>ence paths that do not exist in a lossless configuration. We investigate the two-plasmon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interfer</span></strong>ence on beam splitters with different sets of reflection and transmission factors. Through coincidence-detection measurements, we observe either coalescence or anti-coalescence of SPPs. The results show that losses can be viewed as a degree of freedom to control quantum processes.</p>

Intercellular communication and conjugation are mediated by ESX secretion systems in mycobacteria
<p>Communal bacterial processes require intercellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ation mediated by secretion systems to coordinate appropriate molecular responses. Intercellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ation has not been described previously in mycobacteria. Here we show that the ESX secretion-system family member ESX-4 is essential for conjugal recipient activity in <i>Mycobacterium smegmatis</i>. Transcription of <i>esx4</i> genes in the recipient requires coculture with a donor strain and a functional ESX-1 apparatus in the recipient. Conversely, mutation of the donor ESX-1 apparatus amplifies the <i>esx4</i> transcriptional response in the recipient. The effect of ESX-1 on <i>esx4</i> transcription correlates with conjugal DNA transfer efficiencies. Our data show that intercellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ation via ESX-1 controls the expression of its evolutionary progenitor, ESX-4, to promote conjugation between mycobacteria.</p>

Astrocyte-shed extracellular vesicles regulate the peripheral leukocyte response to inflammatory brain lesions
<p>Brain injury induces a peripheral acute cytokine response that directs the transmigration of leukocytes into the brain. Because this brain-to-peripheral immune <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ation affects patient recovery, understanding its regulation is important. Using a mouse model of inflammatory brain injury, we set out to find a soluble mediator for this phenomenon. We found that extracellular vesicles (EVs) shed from astrocytes in response to intracerebral injection of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) rapidly entered into peripheral circulation and promoted the transmigration of leukocytes through modulation of the peripheral acute cytokine response. Bioinformatic analysis of the protein and microRNA cargo of EVs identified peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor α (PPARα) as a primary molecular target of astrocyte-shed EVs. We confirmed in mice that astrocytic EVs promoted the transmigration of leukocytes into the brain by inhibiting PPARα, resulting in the increase of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activity that triggered the production of cytokines in liver. These findings expand our understanding of the mechanisms regulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ation between the brain and peripheral immune system and identify astrocytic EVs as a molecular regulator of the immunological response to inflammatory brain damage.</p>

Lipid-filled vesicles modulate macrophages
<p>Adipose (fat) tissue is a major site of energy storage that responds to fluctuations in nutrient availability to maintain systemic metabolic homeostasis (<i>1</i>). Adipocytes take up circulating free fatty acids (FFAs) from the blood and store them in lipid droplets in response to increased insulin concentrations (which occur after feeding); they then hydrolyze lipids to release FFAs under conditions of nutrient deprivation. A variety of other cell types are present within adipose tissue, including fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs). In addition to their roles in immune surveillance and clearance of cellular debris, ATMs are important for lipid buffering and regulate adipose tissue function in both healthy and diseased states (<i>2</i>). Owing to the rising global incidence of chronic obesity and associated health issues, there is renewed interest in understanding how adipose tissue functions in physiological and pathological settings. On page 989 of this issue, Flaherty <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) report that adipocytes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ate with ATMs by releasing a distinct class of extracellular vesicles (EVs) called adipocyte-derived exosomes (AdExos), which are loaded with fat and appear to be derived directly from adipocyte lipid droplets. The uptake of AdExos by resident ATMs allows for the direct transfer of lipids, revealing a form of intercellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ation and nutrient exchange with important implications for obesity-associated pathologies.</p>

Quantum metasurface for multiphoton interference and state reconstruction
<p>Metasurfaces based on resonant nanophotonic structures have enabled innovative types of flat-optics devices that often outperform the capabilities of bulk components, yet these advances remain largely unexplored for quantum applications. We show that nonclassical multiphoton <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interfer</span></strong>ences can be achieved at the subwavelength scale in all-dielectric metasurfaces. We simultaneously image multiple projections of quantum states with a single metasurface, enabling a robust reconstruction of amplitude, phase, coherence, and entanglement of multiphoton polarization-encoded states. One- and two-photon states are reconstructed through nonlocal photon correlation measurements with polarization-insensitive click detectors positioned after the metasurface, and the scalability to higher photon numbers is established theoretically. Our work illustrates the feasibility of ultrathin quantum metadevices for the manipulation and measurement of multiphoton quantum states, with applications in free-space quantum imaging and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ations.</p>

Photoperiodic control of seasonal growth is mediated by ABA acting on cell-cell communication
<p>In temperate and boreal ecosystems, seasonal cycles of growth and dormancy allow perennial plants to adapt to winter conditions. We show, in hybrid aspen trees, that photoperiodic regulation of dormancy is mechanistically distinct from autumnal growth cessation. Dormancy sets in when symplastic intercellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ation through plasmodesmata is blocked by a process dependent on the phytohormone abscisic acid. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ation blockage prevents growth-promoting signals from accessing the meristem. Thus, precocious growth is disallowed during dormancy. The dormant period, which supports robust survival of the aspen tree in winter, is due to loss of access to growth-promoting signals.</p>

RALF4/19 peptides interact with LRX proteins to control pollen tube growth in <i>Arabidopsis</i>
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ation of changes in the extracellular matrix to the interior of the cell is crucial for a cell’s function. The extracellular peptides of the RAPID ALKALINIZATION FACTOR (RALF) family have been identified as ligands of receptor-like kinases of the <i>Cr</i>RLK1L subclass, but the exact mechanism of their perception is unclear. We found that <i>Arabidopsis</i> RALF4 and RALF19 redundantly regulate pollen tube integrity and growth, and that their function depends on pollen-expressed proteins of the LEUCINE-RICH REPEAT EXTENSIN (LRX) family, which play a role in cell wall development but whose mode of action is not understood. The LRX proteins interact with RALFs, monitoring cell wall changes, which are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ated to the interior of the pollen tube via the <i>Cr</i>RLK1L pathway to sustain normal growth.</p>

Mind the gap: Neural coding of species identity in birdsong prosody

How species-specific learning emerges from the basic features of song prosody remains unknown. In the zebra finch auditory cortex, we discovered a class of neurons that register the silent temporal gaps between song syllables and are distinct from neurons encoding syllable morphology. Behavioral learning and neuronal coding of temporal gap structure resisted song tutoring from other species: Zebra finches fostered by Bengalese finch parents learned Bengalese finch song morphology transposed onto zebra finch temporal gaps. During the vocal learning period, temporal gap neurons fired selectively to zebra finch song. The innate temporal coding of intersyllable silent gaps suggests a neuronal barcode for conspecific vocal learning and social <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ation in acoustically diverse environments.</p>

ZEITLUPE in the Roots of Wild Tobacco Regulates Jasmonate-Mediated Nicotine Biosynthesis and Resistance to a Generalist Herbivore
<p>The jasmonate (JA) phytohormone signaling system is an important mediator of plant defense against herbivores. Plants deficient in JA signaling are more susceptible to herbivory as a result of deficiencies in defensive trait expression. Recent studies have implicated the circadian clock in regulating JA-mediated defenses, but the molecular mechanisms linking the clock to JA signaling are unclear. Here, we report that wild tobacco (<i>Nicotiana attenuata</i>) plants rendered deficient in the clock component ZEITLUPE (ZTL) by RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interfer</span></strong>ence have attenuated resistance to the generalist herbivore <i>Spodoptera littoralis</i>. This effect can be attributed in part to reduced concentrations of nicotine, an abundant JA-regulated toxin produced in <i>N. attenuata</i> roots and transported to shoots. RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interfer</span></strong>ence targeting ZTL dramatically affects the root circadian clock and reduces the expression of nicotine biosynthetic genes. Protein-protein interaction experiments demonstrate that ZTL regulates JA signaling by directly interacting with JASMONATE ZIM domain (JAZ) proteins in a CORONATINE-INSENSITIVE1- and jasmonoyl-isoleucine conjugate-independent manner, thereby regulating a JAZ-MYC2 module that is required for nicotine biosynthesis. Our study reveals new functions for ZTL and proposes a mechanism by which a clock component directly influences JA signaling to regulate plant defense against herbivory.</p>

The Tomato Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase SlMPK1 Is as a Negative Regulator of the High-Temperature Stress Response
<p>High-temperature (HT) stress is a major environmental stress that limits plant growth and development. MAPK cascades play key roles in plant growth and stress signaling, but their involvement in the HT stress response is poorly understood. Here, we describe a 47-kD MBP-phosphorylated protein (p47-MBPK) activated in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) leaves under HT and identify it as SlMPK1 by tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Silencing of <i>SlMPK1</i> in transgenic tomato plants resulted in enhanced tolerance to HT, while overexpression resulted in reduced tolerance. Proteomic analysis identified a set of proteins involved in antioxidant defense that are significantly more abundant in RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interfer</span></strong>ence-<i>SlMPK1</i> plants than nontransgenic plants under HT stress. RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interfer</span></strong>ence-<i>SlMPK1</i> plants also showed changes in membrane lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzyme activities. Furthermore, using yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified a serine-proline-rich protein homolog, SlSPRH1, which interacts with SlMPK1 in yeast, in plant cells, and in vitro. We demonstrate that SlMPK1 can directly phosphorylate SlSPRH1. Furthermore, the serine residue serine-44 of SlSPRH1 is a crucial phosphorylation site in the SlMPK1-mediated antioxidant defense mechanism activated during HT stress. We also demonstrate that heterologous expression of <i>SlSPRH1</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) led to a decrease in thermotolerance and lower antioxidant capacity. Taken together, our results suggest that SlMPK1 is a negative regulator of thermotolerance in tomato plants. SlMPK1 acts by regulating antioxidant defense, and its substrate SlSPRH1 is involved in this pathway.</p>

MILDEW RESISTANCE LOCUS O Function in Pollen Tube Reception Is Linked to Its Oligomerization and Subcellular Distribution
<p>Sexual reproduction in flowering plants requires <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ation between synergid cells and a tip-elongating pollen tube (PT) for the successful delivery of sperm cells to the embryo sac. The reception of the PT relies on signaling within the synergid cell that ultimately leads to the degeneration of the receptive synergid and PT rupture, releasing the sperm cells for double fertilization. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), NORTIA, a member of the MILDEW RESISTANCE LOCUS O (MLO) family of proteins, plays a critical role in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ation processes regulating PT reception. In this study, we determined that MLO function in PT reception is dependent on MLO protein localization into a Golgi-associated compartment before PT arrival, indicating that PT-triggered regulation of the synergid secretory system is important for synergid function during pollination. Additionally, a structure-function analysis revealed that MLO homooligomerization, mediated by the amino-terminal region of the protein, and carboxyl-terminal tail identity both contribute to MLO activity during PT reception.</p>

The MicroRNA390/TAS3 Pathway Mediates Symbiotic Nodulation and Lateral Root Growth
<p>Legume roots form two types of postembryonic organs, lateral roots and symbiotic nodules. Nodule formation is the result of the interaction of legumes with rhizobia and requires the mitotic activation and differentiation of root cells as well as an independent, but coordinated, program that allows infection by rhizobia. MicroRNA390 (miR390) is an evolutionarily conserved microRNA that targets the <i>Trans-Acting Short <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interfer</span></strong>ence RNA3</i> (<i>TAS3</i>) transcript. Cleavage of <i>TAS3</i> by ARGONAUTE7 results in the production of trans-acting small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interfer</span></strong>ence RNAs, which target mRNAs encoding AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR2 (ARF2), ARF3, and ARF4. Here, we show that activation of the miR390/<i>TAS3</i> regulatory module by overexpression of miR390 in <i>Medicago truncatula</i> promotes lateral root growth but prevents nodule organogenesis, rhizobial infection, and the induction of two key nodulation genes, <i>Nodulation Signaling Pathway1</i> (<i>NSP1</i>) and <i>NSP2</i>. Accordingly, inactivation of the miR390/<i>TAS3</i> module, either by expression of a miR390 target mimicry construct or mutations in <i>ARGONAUTE7</i>, enhances nodulation and rhizobial infection, alters the spatial distribution of the nodules, and increases the percentage of nodules with multiple meristems. Our results revealed a key role of the miR390/<i>TAS3</i> pathway in legumes as a modulator of lateral root organs, playing opposite roles in lateral root and nodule development.</p>

Similarities between Reproductive and Immune Pistil Transcriptomes of <i>Arabidopsis</i> Species
<p>Independent lines of evidence suggest that members from ancient and polymorphic gene families such as defensins and receptor-like kinases mediate intercellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ation during both the immune response and reproduction. Here, we report a large-scale analysis to investigate the extent of overlap between these processes by comparing differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the pistil transcriptomes of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> and <i>Arabidopsis halleri</i> during self-pollination and interspecific pollination and during infection with <i>Fusarium graminearum</i>. In both <i>Arabidopsis</i> species, the largest number of DEGs was identified in infected pistils, where genes encoding regulators of cell division and development were most frequently down-regulated. Comparison of DEGs between infection and various pollination conditions showed that up to 79% of down-regulated genes are shared between conditions and include especially defensin-like genes. Interspecific pollination of <i>A.</i> <i>thaliana</i> significantly up-regulated thionins and defensins. The significant overrepresentation of similar groups of DEGs in the transcriptomes of reproductive and immune responses of the pistil makes it a prime system in which to study the consequences of plant-pathogen interactions on fertility and the evolution of intercellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ation in pollination.</p>

Mitochondrial ABC Transporter ATM3 Is Essential for Cytosolic Iron-Sulfur Cluster Assembly
<p>The mitochondrial ATP-binding cassette transporter ATM3 has been studied in Arabidopsis. Its function, however, is poorly understood in other model plant species. This study reports that the ATM3 is required for cytosolic iron-sulfur cluster assembly and is essential for meristem maintenance in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). The loss of function of <i>OsATM3</i> is lethal in rice at the four-leaf stage. In the <i>osatm3</i> T-DNA insertion mutant, the fourth leaf fails to develop and the lateral roots are short. Cytosolic iron-sulfur protein activities were significantly reduced in both <i>osatm3</i> and RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interfer</span></strong>ence transgenic lines. The expression profiles of many iron metabolism genes were altered in the <i>osatm3</i> and RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interfer</span></strong>ence lines. Glutathione metabolism was impaired and reactive oxygen species, particularly superoxide, accumulated in <i>osatm3</i>. Promoter-β-glucuronidase staining of the transgenic line indicated that <i>OsATM3</i> is highly expressed in lateral root primordia, root tip meristem zones, and shoot apical meristem regions. The average cell size was significantly greater in <i>osatm3</i> than in the wild type. Massive cell death occurred in the <i>osatm3</i> root tip meristem zone. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed transcriptional reprogramming of the genes in the <i>osatm3</i> and RNAi lines involved in DNA repair and cell cycle arrest. Our results suggest that the mitochondrial ATM3 is essential for iron homeostasis in rice.</p>

Transcription Factors PvERF15 and PvMTF-1 Form a Cadmium Stress Transcriptional Pathway
<p>In plants, cadmium (Cd)-responsive transcription factors are key downstream effectors of Cd stress transcriptional pathways, which are capable of converging Cd stress signals through triggering the expression of Cd detoxification genes. However, the upstream transcriptional regulatory pathways that modulate their responses to Cd are less clear. Previously, we identified the bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) METAL RESPONSE ELEMENT-BINDING TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR1 (PvMTF-1) that responds to Cd and confers Cd tolerance in planta. Here, we demonstrate an upstream transcriptional regulation of the <i>PvMTF-1</i> response to Cd. Using a yeast one-hybrid system, we cloned the bean ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR15 (PvERF15) that binds to the <i>PvMTF-1</i> promoter. <i>PvERF15</i> was strongly induced by Cd stress, and its overexpression resulted in the up-regulation of <i>PvMTF-1</i>. DNA-protein interaction assays further revealed that PvERF15 binds directly to a 19-bp AC-rich element in the <i>PvMTF-1</i> promoter. The AC-rich element serves as a positive element bound by PvERF15 to activate gene expression. More importantly, knockdown of <i>PvERF15</i> by RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interfer</span></strong>ence resulted in reduced Cd-induced expression of <i>PvMTF-1</i>. <i>PvERF15</i> seems to be involved in Cd tolerance, since knockdown of <i>PvERF15</i> by RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interfer</span></strong>ence in bean leaf discs decreased Cd tolerance in a transient assay. Since PvERF15 is a component of the Cd stress transcriptional pathway in beans and <i>PvMTF-1</i> is one of its downstream targets, our findings provide a PvERF15/PvMTF-1 transcriptional pathway and thereby contribute to the understanding of Cd stress transcriptional regulatory pathways in plants.</p>

The metabolic cost of communicative sound production in bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>)
<p>Bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>) produce various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ative sounds that are important for social behavior, maintaining group cohesion and coordinating foraging. For example, whistle production increases during disturbances, such as separations of mother–calf pairs and vessel approaches. It is clear that acoustic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ation is important to the survival of these marine mammals, yet the metabolic cost of producing whistles and other socials sounds and the energetic consequences of modifying these sounds in response to both natural and anthropogenic disturbance are unknown. We used flow-through respirometry to determine whether the metabolic cost of sound production could be quantified in two captive dolphins producing social sounds (whistles and squawks). On average, we found that metabolic rates measured during 2 min periods of sound production were 1.2 times resting values. Up to 7 min were required for metabolism to return to resting values following vocal periods. The total metabolic cost (over resting values) of the 2 min vocal period plus the required recovery period (163.3 to 2995.9 ml O<sub>2</sub> or 3279.6 to 60,166.7 J) varied by individual as well as by mean duration of sounds produced within the vocal period. Observed variation in received cumulative sound energy levels of vocalizations was not related to total metabolic costs. Furthermore, our empirical findings did not agree with previous theoretical estimates of the metabolic cost of whistles. This study provides the first empirical data on the metabolic cost of sound production in dolphins, which can be used to estimate metabolic costs of vocal responses to environmental perturbations in wild dolphins.</p>

Discovery and Characterization of the 3-Hydroxyacyl-ACP Dehydratase Component of the Plant Mitochondrial Fatty Acid Synthase System
<p>We report the characterization of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) 3-hydroxyacyl-acyl carrier protein dehydratase (mtHD) component of the mitochondrial fatty acid synthase (mtFAS) system, encoded by AT5G60335. The mitochondrial localization and catalytic capability of mtHD were demonstrated with a green fluorescent protein transgenesis experiment and by in vivo complementation and in vitro enzymatic assays. RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interfer</span></strong>ence (RNAi) knockdown lines with reduced <i>mtHD</i> expression exhibit traits typically associated with mtFAS mutants, namely a miniaturized morphological appearance, reduced lipoylation of lipoylated proteins, and altered metabolomes consistent with the reduced catalytic activity of lipoylated enzymes. These alterations are reversed when <i>mthd-rnai</i> mutant plants are grown in a 1% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere, indicating the link between mtFAS and photorespiratory deficiency due to the reduced lipoylation of glycine decarboxylase. In vivo biochemical feeding experiments illustrate that sucrose and glycolate are the metabolic modulators that mediate the alterations in morphology and lipid accumulation. In addition, both <i>mthd-rnai</i> and <i>mtkas</i> mutants exhibit reduced accumulation of 3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid (i.e. a hallmark of lipid A-like molecules) and abnormal chloroplastic starch granules; these changes are not reversible by the 1% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere, demonstrating two novel mtFAS functions that are independent of photorespiration. Finally, RNA sequencing analysis revealed that <i>mthd-rnai</i> and <i>mtkas</i> mutants are nearly equivalent to each other in altering the transcriptome, and these analyses further identified genes whose expression is affected by a functional mtFAS system but independent of photorespiratory deficiency. These data demonstrate the nonredundant nature of the mtFAS system, which contributes unique lipid components needed to support plant cell structure and metabolism.</p>

Molecular Regulation of Temperature-Dependent Floral Induction in <i>Tulipa gesneriana</i>
<p>The vegetative-to-reproductive phase change in tulip (<i>Tulipa gesneriana</i>) is promoted by increasing temperatures during spring. The warm winters of recent years <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interfer</span></strong>e with this process and are calling for new adapted cultivars. A better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms would be of help, but unlike the model plant Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), very little is known about floral induction in tulip. To shed light on the gene regulatory network controlling flowering in tulip, RNA sequencing was performed on meristem-enriched tissue collected under two contrasting temperature conditions, low and high. The start of reproductive development correlated with rounding of the shoot apical meristem and induction of <i>TGSQA</i> expression, a tulip gene with a high similarity to Arabidopsis <i>APETALA1</i>. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes showed the overrepresentation of genes potentially involved in floral induction, bulb maturation, and dormancy establishment. Expression analysis revealed that <i>TERMINAL FLOWER1</i> (<i>TgTFL1</i>) and <i>SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS1-like1</i> (<i>TgSOC1-like1</i>) might be repressors, whereas <i>TgSOC1-like2</i> likely is an activator, of flowering. Subsequently, the flowering time-associated expression of eight potential flowering time genes was confirmed in three tulip cultivars grown in the field. Additionally, heterologous functional analyses in Arabidopsis resulted in flowering time phenotypes in line with <i>TgTFL1</i> being a floral repressor and <i>TgSOC1-like2</i> being a floral activator in tulip. Taken together, we have shown that long before morphological changes occur in the shoot apical meristem, the expression of floral repressors in tulip is suppressed by increased ambient temperatures, leading either directly or indirectly to the activation of potential flowering activators shortly before the commencement of the phase change.</p>

Validating Genome-Wide Association Candidates Controlling Quantitative Variation in Nodulation
<p>Genome-wide association (GWA) studies offer the opportunity to identify genes that contribute to naturally occurring variation in quantitative traits. However, GWA relies exclusively on statistical association, so functional validation is necessary to make strong claims about gene function. We used a combination of gene-disruption platforms (Tnt1 retrotransposons, hairpin RNA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interfer</span></strong>ence constructs, and CRISPR/Cas9 nucleases) together with randomized, well-replicated experiments to evaluate the function of genes that an earlier GWA study in <i>Medicago truncatula</i> had identified as candidates contributing to variation in the symbiosis between legumes and rhizobia. We evaluated ten candidate genes found in six clusters of strongly associated single nucleotide polymorphisms, selected on the basis of their strength of statistical association, proximity to annotated gene models, and root or nodule expression. We found statistically significant effects on nodule production for three candidate genes, each validated in two independent mutants. Annotated functions of these three genes suggest their contributions to quantitative variation in nodule production occur through processes not previously connected to nodulation, including phosphorous supply and salicylic acid-related defense response. These results demonstrate the utility of GWA combined with reverse mutagenesis technologies to discover and validate genes contributing to naturally occurring variation in quantitative traits. The results highlight the potential for GWA to complement forward genetics in identifying the genetic basis of ecologically and economically important traits.</p>

Rice Leaf Angle and Grain Size Are Affected by the OsBUL1 Transcriptional Activator Complex<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Rice atypical HLH protein <i>Oryza sativa BRASSINOSTEROID UPREGULATED 1</i>-<i>LIKE1</i> (<i>OsBUL1</i>) is preferentially expressed in the lamina joint where it controls cell elongation and positively affects leaf angles. <i>OsBUL1</i> knockout mutant (<i>osbul1</i>) and transgenic rice for double-stranded RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interfer</span></strong>ence (dsRNAi) of <i>OsBUL1</i> produced erect leaves with smaller grains, whereas <i>OsBUL1</i> overexpressors and an activation tagging line of <i>OsBUL1</i> exhibited increased lamina inclination and grain size. Moreover, <i>OsBUL1</i> expression was induced by brassinolide (BL) and <i>osbul1</i> did not respond to BL treatment. To understand the molecular network of OsBUL1 function in rice, we isolated a novel OsBUL1-interacting protein, LO9-177, an uncharacterized protein containing a KxDL motif, and functionally studied it with respect to the lamina inclination and grain size of rice. OsBUL1 COMPLEX1 (OsBC1) is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcriptional activator that interacts with OsBUL1 only in the presence of LO9-177 forming a possible trimeric complex for cell elongation in the lamina joint of rice. Expression of <i>OsBC1</i> is also upregulated by BL and has a similar pattern to that of <i>OsBUL1</i>. Transgenic rice plants expressing <i>OsBC1</i> under the control of <i>OsBUL1</i> promoter showed increased grain size as well as leaf bending, while transgenic lines for dsRNAi and/or expressing a dominant repressor form of <i>OsBC1</i> displayed reduced plant height and grain size. Together, these results demonstrated that a novel protein complex consisting of OsBUL1, LO9-177, and OsBC1 is associated with the HLH-bHLH system, providing new insight into the molecular functional network based on HLH-bHLH proteins for cell elongation.</p>

cis-Cinnamic Acid Is a Novel, Natural Auxin Efflux Inhibitor That Promotes Lateral Root Formation
<p>Auxin steers numerous physiological processes in plants, making the tight control of its endogenous levels and spatiotemporal distribution a necessity. This regulation is achieved by different mechanisms, including auxin biosynthesis, metabolic conversions, degradation, and transport. Here, we introduce cis-cinnamic acid (<i>c</i>-CA) as a novel and unique addition to a small group of endogenous molecules affecting in planta auxin concentrations. <i>c-CA</i> is the photo-isomerization product of the phenylpropanoid pathway intermediate trans-CA (<i>t</i>-CA). When grown on <i>c</i>-CA-containing medium, an evolutionary diverse set of plant species were shown to exhibit phenotypes characteristic for high auxin levels, including inhibition of primary root growth, induction of root hairs, and promotion of adventitious and lateral rooting. By molecular docking and receptor binding assays, we showed that <i>c</i>-CA itself is neither an auxin nor an anti-auxin, and auxin profiling data revealed that <i>c</i>-CA does not significantly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interfer</span></strong>e with auxin biosynthesis. Single cell-based auxin accumulation assays showed that <i>c</i>-CA, and not <i>t</i>-CA, is a potent inhibitor of auxin efflux. Auxin signaling reporters detected changes in spatiotemporal distribution of the auxin response along the root of <i>c</i>-CA-treated plants, and long-distance auxin transport assays showed no inhibition of rootward auxin transport. Overall, these results suggest that the phenotypes of <i>c</i>-CA-treated plants are the consequence of a local change in auxin accumulation, induced by the inhibition of auxin efflux. This work reveals a novel mechanism how plants may regulate auxin levels and adds a novel, naturally occurring molecule to the chemical toolbox for the studies of auxin homeostasis.</p>

A Tomato Vacuolar Invertase Inhibitor Mediates Sucrose Metabolism and Influences Fruit Ripening
<p>Fruit ripening is a complex process that involves a series of physiological and biochemical changes that ultimately influence fruit quality traits, such as color and flavor. Sugar metabolism is an important factor in ripening, and there is evidence that it influences various aspects of ripening, although the associated mechanism is not well understood. In this study, we identified and analyzed the expression of 36 genes involved in Suc metabolism in ripening tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) fruit. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and gel mobility shift assays indicated that <i>SlVIF</i>, which encodes a vacuolar invertase inhibitor, and <i>SlVI</i>, encoding a vacuolar invertase, are directly regulated by the global fruit ripening regulator RIPENING INHIBITOR (RIN). Moreover, we showed that SlVIF physically interacts with SlVI to control Suc metabolism. Repression of <i>SlVIF</i> by RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interfer</span></strong>ence delayed tomato fruit ripening, while overexpression of <i>SlVIF</i> accelerated ripening, with concomitant changes in lycopene production and ethylene biosynthesis. An isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification-based quantitative proteomic analysis further indicated that the abundance of a set of proteins involved in fruit ripening was altered by suppressing <i>SlVIF</i> expression, including proteins associated with lycopene generation and ethylene synthesis. These findings provide evidence for the role of Suc in promoting fruit ripening and establish that <i>SlVIF</i> contributes to fruit quality and the RIN-mediated ripening regulatory mechanisms, which are of significant agricultural value.</p>

A Legume TOR Protein Kinase Regulates <i>Rhizobium</i> Symbiosis and Is Essential for Infection and Nodule Development
<p>The target of rapamycin (<i>TOR</i>) protein kinase regulates metabolism, growth, and life span in yeast, animals, and plants in coordination with nutrient status and environmental conditions. The nutrient-dependent nature of <i>TOR</i> functionality makes this kinase a putative regulator of symbiotic associations involving nutrient acquisition. However, <i>TOR</i>’s role in these processes remains to be understood. Here, we uncovered the role of <i>TOR</i> during the bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>)-<i>Rhizobium tropici</i> (<i>Rhizobium</i>) symbiotic interaction. <i>TOR</i> was expressed in all tested bean tissues, with higher transcript levels in the root meristems and senesced nodules. We showed <i>TOR</i> promoter expression along the progressing infection thread and in the infected cells of mature nodules. Posttranscriptional gene silencing of <i>TOR</i> using RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interfer</span></strong>ence (RNAi) showed that this gene is involved in lateral root elongation and root cell organization and also alters the density, size, and number of root hairs. The suppression of <i>TOR</i> transcripts also affected infection thread progression and associated cortical cell divisions, resulting in a drastic reduction of nodule numbers. <i>TOR</i>-RNAi resulted in reduced reactive oxygen species accumulation and altered <i>CyclinD1</i> and <i>CyclinD3</i> expression, which are crucial factors for infection thread progression and nodule organogenesis. Enhanced expression of <i>TOR</i>-regulated <i>ATG</i> genes in <i>TOR</i>-RNAi roots suggested that <i>TOR</i> plays a role in the recognition of <i>Rhizobium</i> as a symbiont. Together, these data suggest that <i>TOR</i> plays a vital role in the establishment of root nodule symbiosis in the common bean.</p>

The Proteasome Acts as a Hub for Plant Immunity and Is Targeted by <i>Pseudomonas</i> Type III Effectors
<p>Recent evidence suggests that the ubiquitin-proteasome system is involved in several aspects of plant immunity and that a range of plant pathogens subvert the ubiquitin-proteasome system to enhance their virulence. Here, we show that proteasome activity is strongly induced during basal defense in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Mutant lines of the proteasome subunits <i>RPT2a</i> and <i>RPN12a</i> support increased bacterial growth of virulent <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> DC3000 (<i>Pst</i>) and <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>maculicola</i> ES4326. Both proteasome subunits are required for pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity responses. Analysis of bacterial growth after a secondary infection of systemic leaves revealed that the establishment of systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is impaired in proteasome mutants, suggesting that the proteasome also plays an important role in defense priming and SAR. In addition, we show that <i>Pst</i> inhibits proteasome activity in a type III secretion-dependent manner. A screen for type III effector proteins from <i>Pst</i> for their ability to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interfer</span></strong>e with proteasome activity revealed HopM1, HopAO1, HopA1, and HopG1 as putative proteasome inhibitors. Biochemical characterization of HopM1 by mass spectrometry indicates that HopM1 interacts with several E3 ubiquitin ligases and proteasome subunits. This supports the hypothesis that HopM1 associates with the proteasome, leading to its inhibition. Thus, the proteasome is an essential component of pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity and SAR, which is targeted by multiple bacterial effectors.</p>

Moving without a purpose: an experimental study of swarm guidance in the Western honey bee, <i>Apis mellifera</i>
<p>During reproductive swarming, honey bee scouts perform two very important functions. Firstly, they find new nesting locations and return to the swarm cluster to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ate their discoveries. Secondly, once the swarm is ready to depart, informed scout bees act as guides, leading the swarm to its final destination. We have previously hypothesised that the two processes, selecting a new nest site and swarm guidance, are tightly linked in honey bees. When swarms can be <i>laissez faire</i> about where they nest, reaching directional consensus prior to lift off seems unnecessary. If, in contrast, it is essential that the swarm reaches a precise location, either directional consensus must be near unanimous prior to swarm departure or only a select subgroup of the scouts guide the swarm. Here, we tested experimentally whether directional consensus is necessary for the successful guidance of swarms of the Western honey bee <i>Apis mellifera</i> by forcing swarms into the air prior to the completion of the decision-making process. Our results show that swarms were unable to guide themselves prior to the swarm reaching the pre-flight buzzing phase of the decision-making process, even when directional consensus was high. We therefore suggest that not all scouts involved in the decision-making process attempt to guide the swarm.</p>

Vocal production complexity correlates with neural instructions in the oyster toadfish (<i>Opsanus tau</i>)
<p>Sound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ation is fundamental to many social interactions and essential to courtship and agonistic behaviours in many vertebrates. The swimbladder and associated muscles in batrachoidid fishes (midshipman and toadfish) is a unique vertebrate sound production system, wherein fundamental frequencies are determined directly by the firing rate of a vocal-acoustic neural network that drives the contraction frequency of superfast swimbladder muscles. The oyster toadfish boatwhistle call starts with an irregular sound waveform that could be an emergent property of the peripheral nonlinear sound-producing system or reflect complex encoding in the central nervous system. Here, we demonstrate that the start of the boatwhistle is indicative of a chaotic strange attractor, and tested whether its origin lies in the peripheral sound-producing system or in the vocal motor network. We recorded sound and swimbladder muscle activity in awake, freely behaving toadfish during motor nerve stimulation, and recorded sound, motor nerve and muscle activity during spontaneous grunts. The results show that rhythmic motor volleys do not cause complex sound signals. However, arrhythmic recruitment of swimbladder muscle during spontaneous grunts correlates with complex sounds. This supports the hypothesis that the irregular start of the boatwhistle is encoded in the vocal pre-motor neural network, and not caused by peripheral interactions with the sound-producing system. We suggest that sound production system demands across vocal tetrapods have selected for muscles and motorneurons adapted for speed, which can execute complex neural instructions into equivalently complex vocalisations.</p>

Artemin, a diapause-specific chaperone, contributes to the stress tolerance of <i>Artemia franciscana</i> cysts and influences their release from females
<p>Females of the crustacean <i>Artemia franciscana</i> produce either motile nauplii or gastrula stage embryos enclosed in a shell impermeable to nonvolatile compounds and known as cysts. The encysted embryos enter diapause, a state of greatly reduced metabolism and profound stress tolerance. Artemin, a diapause-specific ferritin homolog in cysts has molecular chaperone activity <i>in vitro</i>. Artemin represents 7.2% of soluble protein in cysts, approximately equal to the amount of p26, a small heat shock protein. However, there is almost twice as much artemin mRNA in cysts as compared with p26 mRNA, suggesting that artemin mRNA is translated less efficiently. RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interfer</span></strong>ence employing the injection of artemin double-stranded RNA into the egg sacs of <i>A. franciscana</i> females substantially reduced artemin mRNA and protein in cysts. Decreasing artemin diminished desiccation and freezing tolerance of cysts, demonstrating a role for this protein in stress resistance. Knockdown of artemin increased the time required for complete discharge of a brood of cysts carried within a female from a few hours up to 4 days, an effect weakened in successive broods. Artemin, an abundant molecular chaperone, contributes to stress tolerance of <i>A. franciscana</i> cysts while influencing their development and/or exit from females.</p>

A murine <i>Zic3</i> transcript with a premature termination codon evades nonsense-mediated decay during axis formation
<p>The ZIC transcription factors are key mediators of embryonic development and <i>ZIC3</i> is the gene most commonly associated with <i>situs</i> defects (heterotaxy) in humans. Half of patient <i>ZIC3</i> mutations introduce a premature termination codon (PTC). <i>In vivo</i>, PTC-containing transcripts might be targeted for nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). NMD efficiency is known to vary greatly between transcripts, tissues and individuals and it is possible that differences in survival of PTC-containing transcripts partially explain the striking phenotypic variability that characterizes ZIC3-associated congenital defects. For example, the PTC-containing transcripts might encode a C-terminally truncated protein that retains partial function or that dominantly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interfer</span></strong>es with other ZIC family members. Here we describe the katun (<i>Ka</i>) mouse mutant, which harbours a mutation in the <i>Zic3</i> gene that results in a PTC. At the time of axis formation there is no discernible decrease in this PTC-containing transcript <i>in vivo</i>, indicating that the mammalian <i>Zic3</i> transcript is relatively insensitive to NMD, prompting the need to re-examine the molecular function of the truncated proteins predicted from human studies and to determine whether the N-terminal portion of ZIC3 possesses dominant-negative capabilities. A combination of <i>in vitro</i> studies and analysis of the <i>Ka</i> phenotype indicate that it is a null allele of <i>Zic3</i> and that the N-terminal portion of ZIC3 does not encode a dominant-negative molecule. Heterotaxy in patients with PTC-containing <i>ZIC3</i> transcripts probably arises due to loss of ZIC3 function alone.</p>

Elevated expression of the V-ATPase C subunit triggers JNK-dependent cell invasion and overgrowth in a <i>Drosophila</i> epithelium
<p>The C subunit of the vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase or V-ATPase regulates the activity and assembly of the proton pump at cellular membranes. It has been shown to be strongly upregulated in oral squamous cell carcinoma, a highly metastatic epithelial cancer. In addition, increased V-ATPase activity appears to correlate with invasiveness of cancer cells, but the underlying mechanism is largely unknown. Using the <i>Drosophila</i> wing imaginal epithelium as an <i>in vivo</i> model system, we demonstrate that overexpression of Vha44, the <i>Drosophila</i> orthologue of the C subunit, causes a tumor-like tissue transformation in cells of the wing epithelium. Overexpressing cells are excluded from the epithelium and acquire invasive properties while displaying high apoptotic rates. Blocking apoptosis in these cells unmasks a strong proliferation stimulus, leading to overgrowth. Furthermore, we show that excess Vha44 greatly increases acidification of endocytic compartments and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interfer</span></strong>es with endosomal trafficking. As a result, cargoes such as GFP-Lamp1 and Notch accumulate in highly acidified enlarged endolysosomal compartments. Consistent with previous reports on the endocytic activation of Eiger/JNK signaling, we find that V-ATPase stimulation by Vha44 causes JNK signaling activation whereas downmodulation of JNK signaling rescues the invasive phenotypes. In summary, our <i>in vivo-</i>findings demonstrate that increased levels of V-ATPase C subunit induce a Eiger/JNK-dependent cell transformation within an epithelial organ that recapitulates early carcinoma stages.</p>

Functional and histopathological identification of the respiratory failure in a DMSXL transgenic mouse model of myotonic dystrophy
<p>Acute and chronic respiratory failure is one of the major and potentially life-threatening features in individuals with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). Despite several clinical demonstrations showing respiratory problems in DM1 patients, the mechanisms are still not completely understood. This study was designed to investigate whether the DMSXL transgenic mouse model for DM1 exhibits respiratory disorders and, if so, to identify the pathological changes underlying these respiratory problems. Using pressure plethysmography, we assessed the breathing function in control mice and DMSXL mice generated after large expansions of the CTG repeat in successive generations of DM1 transgenic mice. Statistical analysis of breathing function measurements revealed a significant decrease in the most relevant respiratory parameters in DMSXL mice, indicating impaired respiratory function. Histological and morphometric analysis showed pathological changes in diaphragmatic muscle of DMSXL mice, characterized by an increase in the percentage of type I muscle fibers, the presence of central nuclei, partial denervation of end-plates (EPs) and a significant reduction in their size, shape complexity and density of acetylcholine receptors, all of which reflect a possible breakdown in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communic</span></strong>ation between the diaphragmatic muscles fibers and the nerve terminals. Diaphragm muscle abnormalities were accompanied by an accumulation of mutant DMPK RNA foci in muscle fiber nuclei. Moreover, in DMSXL mice, the unmyelinated phrenic afferents are significantly lower. Also in these mice, significant neuronopathy was not detected in either cervical phrenic motor neurons or brainstem respiratory neurons. Because EPs are involved in the transmission of action potentials and the unmyelinated phrenic afferents exert a modulating influence on the respiratory drive, the pathological alterations affecting these structures might underlie the respiratory impairment detected in DMSXL mice. Understanding mechanisms of respiratory deficiency should guide pharmaceutical and clinical research towards better therapy for the respiratory deficits associated with DM1.</p>

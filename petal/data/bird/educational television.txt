Solving the Towers of Hanoi – how an amoeboid organism efficiently constructs transport networks
<p>Many biological systems require extensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s to transport resources and information. Biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s must trade-off <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> efficiency with the risk of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> failure. Yet, biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s develop in the absence of centralised control from the interactions of many components. Moreover, many biological systems need to be able to adapt when conditions change and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> requires modification. We used the slime mould <i>Physarum polycephalum</i> (Schwein) to study how the organism adapts its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> after disruption. To allow us to determine the efficiency of the constructed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s, we used a well-known shortest-path problem: the Towers of Hanoi maze. We first show that while <i>P. polycephalum</i> is capable of building <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s with minimal length paths through the maze, most solutions are sub-optimal. We then disrupted the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> by severing the main connecting path while opening a new path in the maze. In response to dynamic changes to the environment, <i>P. polycephalum</i> reconstructed more efficient solutions, with all replicates building <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s with minimal length paths through the maze after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> disruption. While <i>P. polycephalum</i> altered some of its existing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> to accommodate changes in the environment, it also reconstructed large sections of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> from scratch. We compared the results obtained from <i>P. polycephalum</i> with those obtained using another distributed biological system: ant colonies. We hypothesise that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> construction in ants hinges upon stronger positive feedback than for slime mould, ensuring that ants converge more accurately upon the shortest path but are more constrained by the history of their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s in dynamic environments.</p>

β-Arrestin–biased β-adrenergic signaling promotes extinction learning of cocaine reward memory
<p>Extinction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing of cocaine-associated contextual cues can help prevent cocaine addicts from relapsing. Pharmacological manipulation of β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) during extinction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing is being developed as a potential strategy to treat drug addiction. We demonstrated that the extinction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing of cocaine-associated memory was mediated by β-arrestin2–biased but not heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide–binding protein (G protein)–dependent β-adrenergic signaling. We found that administration of the nonbiased β-AR antagonist propranolol, but not the G protein–biased β-AR antagonist carvedilol, blocked extinction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing of cocaine-conditioned place preference and the associated ERK activation in the infralimbic prefrontal cortex. Overexpression of β-arrestin2 in the infralimbic prefrontal cortex promoted extinction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing, which was blocked by propranolol. Knockout of β-arrestin2 in the infralimbic prefrontal cortex, specifically in excitatory neurons, impaired extinction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing of cocaine-conditioned place preference, which was not rescued by carvedilol. β-Arrestin2 signaling in infralimbic excitatory neurons was also required for the extinction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing in the cocaine self-administration model. Our results suggest that β-arrestin–biased β-adrenergic signaling in the infralimbic prefrontal cortex regulates extinction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing of cocaine-associated memories and could be therapeutically targeted to treat addiction.</p>

The fundamental advantages of temporal networks
<p>Most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>ed systems of scientific interest are characterized by temporal links, meaning the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>’s structure changes over time. Link temporality has been shown to hinder many dynamical processes, from information spreading to accessibility, by disrupting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> paths. Considering the ubiquity of temporal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s in nature, we ask: Are there any advantages of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s’ temporality? We use an analytical framework to show that temporal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s can, compared to their static counterparts, reach controllability faster, demand orders of magnitude less control energy, and have control trajectories, that are considerably more compact than those characterizing static <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s. Thus, temporality ensures a degree of flexibility that would be unattainable in static <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s, enhancing our ability to control them.</p>

Mind the gap: Neural coding of species identity in birdsong prosody
<p>Juvenile songbirds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong> vocal communication from adult tutors of the same species but not from adults of other species. How species-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing emerges from the basic features of song prosody remains unknown. In the zebra finch auditory cortex, we discovered a class of neurons that register the silent temporal gaps between song syllables and are distinct from neurons encoding syllable morphology. Behavioral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing and neuronal coding of temporal gap structure resisted song tutoring from other species: Zebra finches fostered by Bengalese finch parents <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ed Bengalese finch song morphology transposed onto zebra finch temporal gaps. During the vocal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing period, temporal gap neurons fired selectively to zebra finch song. The innate temporal coding of intersyllable silent gaps suggests a neuronal barcode for conspecific vocal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing and social communication in acoustically diverse environments.</p>

Network Modeling Unravels Mechanisms of Crosstalk between Ethylene and Salicylate Signaling in Potato
<p>To develop novel crop breeding strategies, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms underlying the interaction between plants and their pathogens. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> modeling represents a powerful tool that can unravel properties of complex biological systems. In this study, we aimed to use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> modeling to better understand immune signaling in potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>). For this, we first built on a reliable Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) immune signaling model, extending it with the information from diverse publicly available resources. Next, we translated the resulting prior knowledge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> (20,012 nodes and 70,091 connections) to potato and superimposed it with an ensemble <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> inferred from time-resolved transcriptomics data for potato. We used different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> modeling approaches to generate specific hypotheses of potato immune signaling mechanisms. An interesting finding was the identification of a string of molecular events illuminating the ethylene pathway modulation of the salicylic acid pathway through Nonexpressor of PR Genes1 gene expression. Functional validations confirmed this modulation, thus supporting the potential of our integrative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> modeling approach for unraveling molecular mechanisms in complex systems. In addition, this approach can ultimately result in improved breeding strategies for potato and other sensitive crops.</p>

Construction and Optimization of a Large Gene Coexpression Network in Maize Using RNA-Seq Data
<p>With the emergence of massively parallel sequencing, genomewide expression data production has reached an unprecedented level. This abundance of data has greatly facilitated maize research, but may not be amenable to traditional analysis techniques that were optimized for other data types. Using publicly available data, a gene coexpression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> (GCN) can be constructed and used for gene function prediction, candidate gene selection, and improving understanding of regulatory pathways. Several GCN studies have been done in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), mostly using microarray datasets. To build an optimal GCN from plant materials RNA-Seq data, parameters for expression data normalization and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> inference were evaluated. A comprehensive evaluation of these two parameters and a ranked aggregation strategy on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> performance, using libraries from 1266 maize samples, were conducted. Three normalization methods and 10 inference methods, including six correlation and four mutual information methods, were tested. The three normalization methods had very similar performance. For <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> inference, correlation methods performed better than mutual information methods at some genes. Increasing sample size also had a positive effect on GCN. Aggregating single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s together resulted in improved performance compared to single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Quartet-Net: A Quartet-Based Method to Reconstruct Phylogenetic Networks
<p>Phylogenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s can model reticulate evolutionary events such as hybridization, recombination, and horizontal gene transfer. However, reconstructing such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s is not trivial. Popular character-based methods are computationally inefficient, whereas distance-based methods cannot guarantee reconstruction accuracy because pairwise genetic distances only reflect partial information about a reticulate phylogeny. To balance accuracy and computational efficiency, here we introduce a quartet-based method to construct a phylogenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> from a multiple sequence alignment. Unlike distances that only reflect the relationship between a pair of taxa, quartets contain information on the relationships among four taxa; these quartets provide adequate capacity to infer a more accurate phylogenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>. In applications to simulated and biological data sets, we demonstrate that this novel method is robust and effective in reconstructing reticulate evolutionary events and it has the potential to infer more accurate phylogenetic distances than other conventional phylogenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> construction methods such as Neighbor-Joining, Neighbor-Net, and Split Decomposition. This method can be used in constructing phylogenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s from simple evolutionary events involving a few reticulate events to complex evolutionary histories involving a large number of reticulate events. A software called “Quartet-Net” is implemented and available at <ext-link>http://sysbio.cvm.msstate.edu/QuartetNet/</ext-link>.</p>

Role of insulin signaling impairment, adiponectin and dyslipidemia in peripheral and central neuropathy in mice
<p>One of the tissues or organs affected by diabetes is the nervous system, predominantly the peripheral system (peripheral polyneuropathy and/or painful peripheral neuropathy) but also the central system with impaired <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing, memory and mental flexibility. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the pre-diabetic or diabetic condition caused by a high-fat diet (HFD) can damage both the peripheral and central nervous systems. Groups of C57BL6 and Swiss Webster mice were fed a diet containing 60% fat for 8 months and compared to control and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic groups that were fed a standard diet containing 10% fat. Aspects of peripheral nerve function (conduction velocity, thermal sensitivity) and central nervous system function (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing ability, memory) were measured at assorted times during the study. Both strains of mice on HFD developed impaired glucose tolerance, indicative of insulin resistance, but only the C57BL6 mice showed statistically significant hyperglycemia. STZ-diabetic C57BL6 mice developed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing deficits in the Barnes maze after 8 weeks of diabetes, whereas neither C57BL6 nor Swiss Webster mice fed a HFD showed signs of defects at that time point. By 6 months on HFD, Swiss Webster mice developed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing and memory deficits in the Barnes maze test, whereas their peripheral nervous system remained normal. In contrast, C57BL6 mice fed the HFD developed peripheral nerve dysfunction, as indicated by nerve conduction slowing and thermal hyperalgesia, but showed normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing and memory functions. Our data indicate that STZ-induced diabetes or a HFD can damage both peripheral and central nervous systems, but <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing deficits develop more rapidly in insulin-deficient than in insulin-resistant conditions and only in Swiss Webster mice. In addition to insulin impairment, dyslipidemia or adiponectinemia might determine the neuropathy phenotype.</p>

Structure, spatial dynamics, and stability of novel seed dispersal mutualistic networks in Hawai<bold></bold>i
<p>Increasing rates of human-caused species invasions and extinctions may reshape communities and modify the structure, dynamics, and stability of species interactions. To investigate how such changes affect communities, we performed multiscale analyses of seed dispersal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s on Oahu, Hawaii. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s consisted exclusively of novel interactions, were largely dominated by introduced species, and exhibited specialized and modular structure at local and regional scales, despite high interaction dissimilarity across communities. Furthermore, the structure and stability of the novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s were similar to native-dominated communities worldwide. Our findings suggest that shared evolutionary history is not a necessary process for the emergence of complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> structure, and interaction patterns may be highly conserved, regardless of species identity and environment. Introduced species can quickly become well integrated into novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s, making restoration of native ecosystems more challenging than previously thought.</p>

Neural scene representation and rendering
<p>Scene representation—the process of converting visual sensory data into concise descriptions—is a requirement for intelligent behavior.

Consensus Coexpression Network Analysis Identifies Key Regulators of Flower and Fruit Development in Wild Strawberry
<p>The diploid strawberry, <i>Fragaria vesca</i>, is a developing model system for the economically important Rosaceae family. Strawberry fleshy fruit develops from the floral receptacle and its ripening is nonclimacteric. The external seed configuration of strawberry fruit facilitates the study of seed-to-fruit cross tissue communication, particularly phytohormone biosynthesis and transport. To investigate strawberry fruit development, we previously generated spatial and temporal transcriptome data profiling <i>F. vesca</i> flower and fruit development pre- and postfertilization. In this study, we combined 46 of our existing RNA-seq libraries to generate coexpression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s using the Weighted Gene Co-Expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> Analysis package in R. We then applied a post-hoc consensus clustering approach and used bootstrapping to demonstrate consensus clustering’s ability to produce robust and reproducible clusters. Further, we experimentally tested hypotheses based on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s, including increased iron transport from the receptacle to the seed postfertilization and characterized a <i>F. vesca</i> floral mutant and its candidate gene. To increase their utility, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s are presented in a web interface (<ext-link>www.fv.rosaceaefruits.org</ext-link>) for easy exploration and identification of coexpressed genes. Together, the work reported here illustrates ways to generate robust <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s optimized for the mining of large transcriptome data sets, thereby providing a useful resource for hypothesis generation and experimental design in strawberry and related Rosaceae fruit crops.</p>

ChloroKB: A Web Application for the Integration of Knowledge Related to Chloroplast Metabolic Network
<p>Higher plants, as autotrophic organisms, are effective sources of molecules. They hold great promise for metabolic engineering, but the behavior of plant metabolism at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> level is still incompletely described. Although structural models (stoichiometry matrices) and pathway databases are extremely useful, they cannot describe the complexity of the metabolic context, and new tools are required to visually represent integrated biocurated knowledge for use by both humans and computers. Here, we describe ChloroKB, a Web application (<ext-link>http://chlorokb.fr/</ext-link>) for visual exploration and analysis of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> in the chloroplast and related cellular pathways. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> was manually reconstructed through extensive biocuration to provide transparent traceability of experimental data. Proteins and metabolites were placed in their biological context (spatial distribution within cells, connectivity in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>, participation in supramolecular complexes, and regulatory interactions) using CellDesigner software. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> contains 1,147 reviewed proteins (559 localized exclusively in plastids, 68 in at least one additional compartment, and 520 outside the plastid), 122 proteins awaiting biochemical/genetic characterization, and 228 proteins for which genes have not yet been identified. The visual presentation is intuitive and browsing is fluid, providing instant access to the graphical representation of integrated processes and to a wealth of refined qualitative and quantitative data. ChloroKB will be a significant support for structural and quantitative kinetic modeling, for biological reasoning, when comparing novel data with established knowledge, for computer analyses, and for educational purposes. ChloroKB will be enhanced by continuous updates following contributions from plant researchers.</p>

Insular cortex processes aversive somatosensory information and is crucial for threat learning
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing about threats is essential for survival. During threat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing, an innocuous sensory percept such as a tone acquires an emotional meaning when paired with an aversive stimulus such as a mild footshock. The amygdala is critical for threat memory formation, but little is known about upstream brain areas that process aversive somatosensory information. Using optogenetic techniques in mice, we found that silencing of the posterior insula during footshock reduced acute fear behavior and impaired 1-day threat memory. Insular cortex neurons respond to footshocks, acquire responses to tones during threat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing, and project to distinct amygdala divisions to drive acute fear versus threat memory formation. Thus, the posterior insula conveys aversive footshock information to the amygdala and is crucial for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing about potential dangers in the environment.</p>

Human-level performance in 3D multiplayer games with population-based reinforcement learning

However, the real world contains multiple agents, each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing and acting independently to cooperate and compete with other agents. We used a tournament-style evaluation to demonstrate that an agent can achieve human-level performance in a three-dimensional multiplayer first-person video game, <i>Quake III Arena</i> in Capture the Flag mode, using only pixels and game points scored as input. We used a two-tier optimization process in which a population of independent RL agents are trained concurrently from thousands of parallel matches on randomly generated environments.

Structural topology defines protective CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell epitopes in the HIV proteome
<p>Mutationally constrained epitopes of variable pathogens represent promising targets for vaccine design but are not reliably identified by sequence conservation. In this study, we employed structure-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> analysis, which applies <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> theory to HIV protein structure data to quantitate the topological importance of individual amino acid residues. Mutation of residues at important <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> positions disproportionately impaired viral replication and occurred with high frequency in epitopes presented by protective human leukocyte antigen (<i>HLA</i>) class I alleles. Moreover, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell targeting of highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>ed epitopes distinguished individuals who naturally control HIV, even in the absence of protective <i>HLA</i> alleles. This approach thereby provides a mechanistic basis for immune control and a means to identify CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell epitopes of topological importance for rational immunogen design, including a T cell–based HIV vaccine.</p>

Social network plasticity decreases disease transmission in a eusocial insect
<p>Animal social <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s are shaped by multiple selection pressures, including the need to ensure efficient communication and functioning while simultaneously limiting disease transmission. Social animals could potentially further reduce epidemic risk by altering their social <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s in the presence of pathogens, yet there is currently no evidence for such pathogen-triggered responses. We tested this hypothesis experimentally in the ant <i>Lasius niger</i> using a combination of automated tracking, controlled pathogen exposure, transmission quantification, and temporally explicit simulations. Pathogen exposure induced behavioral changes in both exposed ants and their nestmates, which helped contain the disease by reinforcing key transmission-inhibitory properties of the colony’s contact <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>. This suggests that social <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> plasticity in response to pathogens is an effective strategy for mitigating the effects of disease in social groups.</p>

Quantifying reputation and success in art
<p>In areas of human activity where performance is difficult to quantify in an objective fashion, reputation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s of influence play a key role in determining access to resources and rewards. To understand the role of these factors, we reconstructed the exhibition history of half a million artists, mapping out the coexhibition <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> that captures the movement of art between institutions. Centrality within this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> captured institutional prestige, allowing us to explore the career trajectory of individual artists in terms of access to coveted institutions. Early access to prestigious central institutions offered life-long access to high-prestige venues and reduced dropout rate. By contrast, starting at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> periphery resulted in a high dropout rate, limiting access to central institutions. A Markov model predicts the career trajectory of individual artists and documents the strong path and history dependence of valuation in art.</p>

Systematic analysis of complex genetic interactions
<p>To systematically explore complex genetic interactions, we constructed ~200,000 yeast triple mutants and scored negative trigenic interactions. We selected double-mutant query genes across a broad spectrum of biological processes, spanning a range of quantitative features of the global digenic interaction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> and tested for a genetic interaction with a third mutation. Trigenic interactions often occurred among functionally related genes, and essential genes were hubs on the trigenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>. Despite their functional enrichment, trigenic interactions tended to link genes in distant bioprocesses and displayed a weaker magnitude than digenic interactions.

Entanglement distillation between solid-state quantum network nodes
<p>The impact of future quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s hinges on high-quality quantum entanglement shared between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> nodes. Unavoidable imperfections necessitate a means to improve remote entanglement by local quantum operations. We realize entanglement distillation on a quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> primitive of distant electron-nuclear two-qubit nodes. The heralded generation of two copies of a remote entangled state is demonstrated through single-photon–mediated entangling of the electrons and robust storage in the nuclear spins. After applying local two-qubit gates, single-shot measurements herald the distillation of an entangled state with increased fidelity that is available for further use. The key combination of generating, storing, and processing entangled states should enable the exploration of multiparticle entanglement on an extended quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>.</p>

Ring attractor dynamics in the <i>Drosophila</i> central brain
<p>Ring attractors are a class of recurrent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s hypothesized to underlie the representation of heading direction. Such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> structures, schematized as a ring of neurons whose connectivity depends on their heading preferences, can sustain a bump-like activity pattern whose location can be updated by continuous shifts along either turn direction. We recently reported that a population of fly neurons represents the animal’s heading via bump-like activity dynamics. We combined two-photon calcium imaging in head-fixed flying flies with optogenetics to overwrite the existing population representation with an artificial one, which was then maintained by the circuit with naturalistic dynamics. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> with local excitation and global inhibition enforces this unique and persistent heading representation. Ring attractor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s have long been invoked in theoretical work; our study provides physiological evidence of their existence and functional architecture.</p>

Epigenetics and the evolution of instincts

Retrieval practice protects memory against acute stress

We aimed to determine whether a highly effective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing technique could strengthen memory against the negative effects of stress. To bolster memory, we used retrieval practice, or the act of taking practice tests. Participants first <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ed stimuli by either restudying or engaging in retrieval practice. Twenty-four hours later, we induced stress in half of the participants and assessed subsequent memory performance. Participants who <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ed by restudying demonstrated the typical stress-related memory impairment, whereas those who <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ed by retrieval practice were immune to the deleterious effects of stress.

Optimizing a Drone Network to Deliver Automated External Defibrillators
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Public access defibrillation programs can improve survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, but automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are rarely available for bystander use at the scene. Drones are an emerging technology that can deliver an AED to the scene of an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest for bystander use.

Dynamic salience processing in paraventricular thalamus gates associative learning

Monitoring such changes is critical for effective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing and flexible behavior, but the neuronal substrate for tracking the dynamics of stimulus salience is obscure. We found that neurons in the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) are robustly activated by a variety of behaviorally relevant events, including novel (“unfamiliar”) stimuli, reinforcing stimuli and their predicting cues, as well as omission of the expected reward. PVT responses are scaled with stimulus intensity and modulated by changes in homeostatic state or behavioral context. Inhibition of the PVT responses suppresses appetitive or aversive associative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing and reward extinction.

Crystallizing a memory
<p>What is the physical basis of memory? What does it take to retrieve a memory in the brain? What would it take to activate or erase memories? In the early 20th century, the German zoologist Richard Semon coined the term “engram” to denote the physical manifestation of a memory in the brain (<i>1</i>). Two decades later, Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb posited a physiological correlate for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing and recollection: The process of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing strengthens the connections, or synapses, between neurons, which leads to the development of brain-wide cell assemblies that undergo changes in their structural and functional connectivity (<i>2</i>). The coordinated activity of these assemblies—called ensembles, traces, or engrams—that occurs during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing (memory formation) is thought to be reengaged during recall and thereby forms a stable neuronal correlate of memory (<i>2</i>). As subsequent memories are formed, the dynamics of these assemblies evolve and provide preexisting scaffolds to influence how the brain processes the variety of memories an organism forms. Studies by Abdou <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) on page 1227 of this issue and by Choi <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) develop new technologies to visualize discrete engrams in the brain and modulate them in a synapse-specific manner to understand memory strength and memory restoration from an amnestic state. This improved understanding could eventually be translated to modulate memories to alleviate maladaptive memory states.</p>

Small vulnerable sets determine large network cascades in power grids

Toughening elastomers using mussel-inspired iron-catechol complexes
<p>Materials often exhibit a trade-off between stiffness and extensibility; for example, strengthening elastomers by increasing their cross-link density leads to embrittlement and decreased toughness. Inspired by cuticles of marine mussel byssi, we circumvent this inherent trade-off by incorporating sacrificial, reversible iron-catechol cross-links into a dry, loosely cross-linked epoxy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>. The iron-containing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> exhibits two to three orders of magnitude increases in stiffness, tensile strength, and tensile toughness compared to its iron-free precursor while gaining recoverable hysteretic energy dissipation and maintaining its original extensibility. Compared to previous realizations of this chemistry in hydrogels, the dry nature of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> enables larger property enhancement owing to the cooperative effects of both the increased cross-link density given by the reversible iron-catecholate complexes and the chain-restricting ionomeric nanodomains that they form.</p>

Wire together, fire apart
<p>The ability to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong> and remember new experiences lies at the heart of our existence. After all, we are our memories. It has been widely accepted that memories are formed and stored via strengthening of neural connections due to the correlated activities of neurons, where presumably one neuron is causing or at least contributing to the activity of another connecting neuron and hence becomes associated with it. This principle is known as the Hebbian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing rule (<i>1</i>): i.e., if interconnected neurons become active very close in time during a particular event, their connection strengthens and “a memory” of this event is formed (<i>1</i>). In other words, “neurons wire together, if they fire together” (<i>2</i>). Thus, neural connection must show some sort of plasticity—i.e., an ability to be modified based on the mutual firing patterns of interconnected neurons—in order to form memories and associations. Indeed, it has been shown that brief (hundreds of milliseconds) stimulations of interconnected neurons significantly improve signal transmission between the two, a phenomenon known as long-term potentiation (LTP). On page 1033 of this issue, Bittner <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) describe a different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing mechanism called behavioral time scale synaptic plasticity (BTSP), which spans a considerably longer time course of several seconds, implying that no causal relationship of interconnected neurons may be necessary to form long-lasting associations between them.</p>

Conversion of object identity to object-general semantic value in the primate temporal cortex

Two areas for familiar face recognition in the primate brain

Familiar faces also recruited two hitherto unknown face areas at anatomically conserved locations within the perirhinal cortex and the temporal pole. These two areas, but not the core face-processing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>, responded to familiar faces emerging from a blur with a characteristic nonlinear surge, akin to the abruptness of familiar face recognition. In contrast, responses to unfamiliar faces and objects remained linear.

Our data provide new insights into the functional reorganization of engrams and circuits underlying systems consolidation of memory.</p>

Dopamine neurons encode performance error in singing birds
<p>Many behaviors are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ed through trial and error by matching performance to internal goals. Yet neural mechanisms of performance evaluation remain poorly understood. We recorded basal ganglia–projecting dopamine neurons in singing zebra finches as we controlled perceived song quality with distorted auditory feedback. Dopamine activity was phasically suppressed after distorted syllables, consistent with a worse-than-predicted outcome, and was phasically activated at the precise moment of the song when a predicted distortion did not occur, consistent with a better-than-predicted outcome. Error response magnitude depended on distortion probability. Thus, dopaminergic error signals can evaluate behaviors that are not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ed for reward and are instead <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ed by matching performance outcomes to internal goals.</p>

On page 1273 of this issue, Soares <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) closely examine the role of dopamine in mice performing a task in which they keep track of the time between two events and make decisions about this temporal duration. The results suggest the need to reassess the leading theory of dopamine function in timing—the dopamine clock hypothesis (<i>3</i>). They may also help explain empirical phenomena that challenge the reinforcement <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing account of dopamine function.</p>

A transcription factor hierarchy defines an environmental stress response network
<p>Environmental stresses are universally encountered by microbes, plants, and animals. Yet systematic studies of stress-responsive transcription factor (TF) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s in multicellular organisms have been limited. The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) influences the expression of thousands of genes, allowing us to characterize complex stress-responsive regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, we identified genome-wide targets of 21 ABA-related TFs to construct a comprehensive regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. Determinants of dynamic TF binding and a hierarchy among TFs were defined, illuminating the relationship between differential gene expression patterns and ABA pathway feedback regulation. By extrapolating regulatory characteristics of observed canonical ABA pathway components, we identified a new family of transcriptional regulators modulating ABA and salt responsiveness and demonstrated their utility to modulate plant resilience to osmotic stress.</p>

A global genetic interaction network maps a wiring diagram of cellular function
<p>We generated a global genetic interaction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> for <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, constructing more than 23 million double mutants, identifying about 550,000 negative and about 350,000 positive genetic interactions. This comprehensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> maps genetic interactions for essential gene pairs, highlighting essential genes as densely connected hubs. Genetic interaction profiles enabled assembly of a hierarchical model of cell function, including modules corresponding to protein complexes and pathways, biological processes, and cellular compartments. Negative interactions connected functionally related genes, mapped core bioprocesses, and identified pleiotropic genes, whereas positive interactions often mapped general regulatory connections among gene pairs, rather than shared functionality. The global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong> illustrates how coherent sets of genetic interactions connect protein complex and pathway modules to map a functional wiring diagram of the cell.</p>

A Price to Pay for Adult Neurogenesis
<p>We tend to believe that plasticity is what makes brain circuits adaptable to continuous changes in environmental demands and that greater brain plasticity should result in a better ability to cope with the surrounding world. To adapt to everyday life, animals explore, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>, and remember, and these tasks make use of various cortical structures, including the hippocampus. The dentate gyrus, part of the hippocampus, is a remarkable structure in that it is one of two areas of the adult mammalian brain, including the human brain, that continue to generate new neurons throughout postnatal life (<i>1</i>). It is well established that adult-born neurons integrate into preexisting neuronal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s and participate in information processing (<i>2</i>). Much evidence accumulated over the past decade supports the hypothesis that adult neurogenesis itself is a type of circuit plasticity required for hippocampus-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing and memory recall. The work by Akers <i>et al.</i> on page 598 of this issue (<i>3</i>) now shows that adult hippocampal neurogenesis may also promote forgetting.</p>

A New Wrap for Neuronal Activity?
<p>As we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong> and experience the world around us, our brains are remodeling neuronal pathways. Is this remodeling only a property of neurons, or are other brain cell types also adapting and contributing to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">learn</span></strong>ing? A substantial proportion of cells in the mammalian brain are oligodendrocytes and their precursors (collectively called oligodendroglia). Oligodendrocytes generate multiple myelin sheaths, lipid-rich extensions of specialized plasma membrane that spirally coat condensed layers around neurons. This insulation facilitates rapid nerve conduction, increasing velocities of neuron signals 10-fold (<i>1</i>) by restricting current flow to the small gaps between sheaths—the nodes of Ranvier. More than half of the human brain is composed of myelinated nerves (“white matter”). With such extensive myelinated neural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>s, it raises the questions: Do the myelin-producing oligodendrocytes in the brain also adapt as neural circuits are modified in response to activity, and does adaptation of oligodendrocytes then affect the underlying neural circuits? On page 487 of this issue, Gibson <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) provide new evidence to address how neuron activity may promote oligodendroglia changes.</p>

K<sup>+</sup> Efflux Antiporters 4, 5, and 6 Mediate pH and K<sup>+</sup> Homeostasis in Endomembrane Compartments
<p>KEA4, KEA5, and KEA6 are members of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) K<sup>+</sup> efflux antiporter (KEA) family that share high sequence similarity but whose function remains unknown. Here, we show their gene expression pattern, subcellular localization, and physiological function in Arabidopsis. <i>KEA4</i>, <i>KEA5</i>, and <i>KEA6</i> had similar tissue expression patterns, and the three KEA proteins localized to the Golgi, the trans-Golgi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>, and the prevacuolar compartment/multivesicular bodies, suggesting overlapping roles of these proteins in the endomembrane system. Phenotypic analyses of single, double, and triple mutants confirmed functional redundancy. The triple mutant <i>kea4 kea5 kea6</i> had small rosettes, short seedlings, and was sensitive to low K<sup>+</sup> availability and to the sodicity imposed by high salinity. Also, the <i>kea4 kea5 kea6</i> mutant plants had a reduced luminal pH in the Golgi, trans-Golgi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>, prevacuolar compartment, and vacuole, in accordance with the K/H exchange activity of KEA proteins. Genetic analysis indicated that KEA4, KEA5, and KEA6 as well as endosomal Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup>exchanger5 (NHX5) and NHX6 acted coordinately to facilitate endosomal pH homeostasis and salt tolerance. Neither cancelling nor overexpressing the vacuolar antiporters <i>NHX1</i> and <i>NHX2</i> in the <i>kea4 kea5 kea6</i> mutant background altered the salt-sensitive phenotype. The NHX1 and NHX2 proteins in the <i>kea4 kea5 kea6</i> mutant background could not suppress the acidity of the endomembrane system but brought the vacuolar pH close to wild-type values. Together, these data signify that KEA4, KEA5, and KEA6 are endosomal K<sup>+</sup> transporters functioning in maintaining pH and ion homeostasis in the endomembrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">network</span></strong>.</p>

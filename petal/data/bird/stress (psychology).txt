Are hormones a “female problem” for animal research?
<p>One of the most deep-seated misconceptions about the human psyche is that men are simple and women are complicated (<i>1</i>). Gender <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">psycholog</span></strong>y scholars trace this belief back to at least the 19th century, when the long-standing view that women were inferior versions of men started to fall out of favor (<i>2</i>). In response, biological theories on the sexes were restructured into a narrative that characterized the emergent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">psycholog</span></strong>ical properties of the female brain—“sensitivity, perceptual acumen, and emotionality”—as not lesser than, but complementary to, those of men's brains (<i>1</i>). This framed women as a disordered, unstable yin to men's rational, orderly yang, thus preserving the patriarchy. So-called scientific explanations of why women's mental proclivities deviated from men's relied heavily on the purported influence of reproductive physiology on the female mind (<i>3</i>). More than 100 years later, this idea still shapes not just how society perceives women but also how biomedical scientists approach animal research.</p>

RasGRP1 promotes amphetamine-induced motor behavior through a Rhes interaction network (“Rhesactome”) in the striatum
<p>The striatum of the brain coordinates motor function. Dopamine-related drugs may be therapeutic to patients with striatal neurodegeneration, such as Huntington’s disease (HD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD), but these drugs have unwanted side effects. In addition to stimulating the release of norepinephrine, amphetamines, which are used for narcolepsy and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), trigger dopamine release in the striatum. The guanosine triphosphatase Ras homolog enriched in the striatum (Rhes) inhibits dopaminergic signaling in the striatum, is implicated in HD and L-dopa–induced dyskinesia, and has a role in striatal motor control. We found that the guanine nucleotide exchange factor RasGRP1 inhibited Rhes-mediated control of striatal motor activity in mice. RasGRP1 stabilized Rhes, increasing its synaptic accumulation in the striatum. Whereas partially Rhes-deficient (<i>Rhes</i><sup><i>+/−</i></sup>) mice had an enhanced locomotor response to amphetamine, this phenotype was attenuated by coincident depletion of RasGRP1. By proteomic analysis of striatal lysates from <i>Rhes</i>-heterozygous mice with wild-type or partial or complete knockout of <i>Rasgrp1</i>, we identified a diverse set of Rhes-interacting proteins, the “Rhesactome,” and determined that RasGRP1 affected the composition of the amphetamine-induced Rhesactome, which included PDE2A (phosphodiesterase 2A; a protein associated with major depressive disorder), LRRC7 (leucine-rich repeat–containing 7; a protein associated with bipolar disorder and ADHD), and DLG2 (discs large homolog 2; a protein associated with chronic pain). Thus, this Rhes network provides insight into striatal effects of amphetamine and may aid the development of strategies to treat various neurological and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">psycholog</span></strong>ical disorders associated with the striatal dysfunction.</p>

Opioid prescribing decreases after learning of a patient’s fatal overdose
<p>Most opioid prescription deaths occur among people with common conditions for which prescribing risks outweigh benefits. General <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">psycholog</span></strong>ical insights offer an explanation: People may judge risk to be low without available personal experiences, may be less careful than expected when not observed, and may falter without an injunction from authority. To test these hypotheses, we conducted a randomized trial of 861 clinicians prescribing to 170 persons who subsequently suffered fatal overdoses. Clinicians in the intervention group received notification of their patients’ deaths and a safe prescribing injunction from their county’s medical examiner, whereas physicians in the control group did not. Milligram morphine equivalents in prescriptions filled by patients of letter recipients versus controls decreased by 9.7% (95% confidence interval: 6.2 to 13.2%; <i>P</i> < 0.001) over 3 months after intervention. We also observed both fewer opioid initiates and fewer high-dose opioid prescriptions by letter recipients.</p>

Shouldering responsibility
<p>A key element of leadership is the decision to shoulder responsibility for the welfare of others, whether they are one's family, a political party, or, as with heads of state, the entire country. In animal groups such as fish shoals or bird flocks, leadership may passively result from simple coordination principles (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). By contrast, human leaders often actively make decisions on behalf of others. Although previous work has identified factors that predict those who will end up as leaders (<i>3</i>), it remains unclear how leaders decide to shoulder responsibility. On page 467 of this issue, Edelson <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) provide further understanding on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">psycholog</span></strong>ical and neural processes engaged when someone decides to lead. They show that such decisions are intimately linked to our confidence in making decisions for others.</p>

Reactivation of recall-induced neurons contributes to remote fear memory attenuation
<p>Whether fear attenuation is mediated by inhibition of the original memory trace of fear with a new memory trace of safety or by updating of the original fear trace toward safety has been a long-standing question in neuroscience and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">psycholog</span></strong>y alike. In particular, which of the two scenarios underlies the attenuation of remote (month-old) fear memories is completely unknown, despite the impetus to better understand this process against the backdrop of enduring traumata. We found—chemogenetically and in an engram-specific manner—that effective remote fear attenuation is accompanied by the reactivation of memory recall–induced neurons in the dentate gyrus and that the continued activity of these neurons is critical for fear reduction. This suggests that the original memory trace of fear actively contributes to remote fear attenuation.</p>

Efficient coding explains the universal law of generalization in human perception
<p>Perceptual generalization and discrimination are fundamental cognitive abilities. For example, if a bird eats a poisonous butterfly, it will learn to avoid preying on that species again by generalizing its past experience to new perceptual stimuli. In cognitive science, the “universal law of generalization” seeks to explain this ability and states that generalization between stimuli will follow an exponential function of their distance in “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">psycholog</span></strong>ical space.” Here, I challenge existing theoretical explanations for the universal law and offer an alternative account based on the principle of efficient coding. I show that the universal law emerges inevitably from any information processing system (whether biological or artificial) that minimizes the cost of perceptual error subject to constraints on the ability to process or transmit information.</p>

Watching the teen brain grow
<p>Adolescence is a time of extraordinarily important brain changes. And thanks to an unprecedented study now being launched, scientists will be able to examine those changes in depth, using MRI to define what normal growth looks like—and helping clarify what can go awry in teenage brains. The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study—or ABCD Study—is a $300 million effort funded by the National Institutes of Health that will scan the brains of some 10,000 U.S. youths, beginning when they are 9 and 10 years old and imaging them every 2 years for 10 years. In addition to collecting scans of brain structure and function, the research teams at 21 study sites around the country will regularly gather a trove of other information from each youngster, from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">psycholog</span></strong>ical, cognitive, and environmental data to biological specimens such as DNA. The hope is that by enrolling children young, before influences like substance use and sports injuries kick in, scientists will be able to untangle chicken-and-egg questions that correlational studies can't—questions about everything from mental illness to the impact of marijuana on the developing brain. The response so far has been encouraging: Two-thirds of the way through a 2-year enrollment period that ends in September, the researchers have signed up more than 6800 children. And anonymized data from the first 4500 of them are due to be deposited in a publicly accessible database later this month.</p>

Teaching personal initiative beats traditional training in boosting small business in West Africa
<p>Standard business training programs aim to boost the incomes of the millions of self-employed business owners in developing countries by teaching basic financial and marketing practices, yet the impacts of such programs are mixed. We tested whether a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">psycholog</span></strong>y-based personal initiative training approach, which teaches a proactive mindset and focuses on entrepreneurial behaviors, could have more success. A randomized controlled trial in Togo assigned microenterprise owners to a control group (<i>n</i> = 500), a leading business training program (<i>n</i> = 500), or a personal initiative training program (<i>n</i> = 500). Four follow-up surveys tracked outcomes for firms over 2 years and showed that personal initiative training increased firm profits by 30%, compared with a statistically insignificant 11% for traditional training. The training is cost-effective, paying for itself within 1 year.</p>

Cognition-mediated evolution of low-quality floral nectars
<p>Plants pollinated by hummingbirds or bats produce dilute nectars even though these animals prefer more concentrated sugar solutions. This mismatch is an unsolved evolutionary paradox. Here we show that lower quality, or more dilute, nectars evolve when the strength of preferring larger quantities or higher qualities of nectar diminishes as magnitudes of the physical stimuli increase. In a virtual evolution experiment conducted in the tropical rainforest, bats visited computer-automated flowers with simulated genomes that evolved relatively dilute nectars. Simulations replicated this evolution only when value functions, which relate the physical stimuli to subjective sensations, were nonlinear. Selection also depended on the supply/demand ratio; bats selected for more dilute nectar when competition for food was higher. We predict such a pattern to generally occur when decision-makers consider multiple value dimensions simultaneously, and increases of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">psycholog</span></strong>ical value are not fully proportional to increases in physical magnitude.</p>

Parsing reward from aversion
<p>Starting from the moment we hear our alarms in the morning, our emotions guide the thousands of decisions we make every day. More specifically, it is the valence of our emotions that determines our subsequent behavior. Valence is a concept that was originally defined in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">psycholog</span></strong>y and corresponds to the value we assign to the perceptions of our external and internal environments (<i>1</i>). Valence varies from negative, when we are afraid or anxious, to positive, when we are happy or peaceful. In the case of the morning alarm, if your emotional state has a positive valence you might jump out of bed, eager to engage with whatever is motivating you. Conversely, if your emotional state has a negative valence, you might choose to stay in bed to Avoid the causes of your negative emotions.</p>

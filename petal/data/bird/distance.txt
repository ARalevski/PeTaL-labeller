Minimising aseptic loosening in extreme bone resections
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Following the resection of an extensive amount of bone in the   treatment of a tumour, the residual segment may be insufficient   to accept a standard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">length</span></strong> intramedullary cemented stem. Short-stemmed   endoprostheses conceivably have an increased risk of aseptic loosening.   Extra-cortical plates have been added to minimise this risk by supplementing   fixation. The aim of this study was to investigate the survivorship   of short-stemmed endoprostheses and extra-cortical plates.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The study involved 37 patients who underwent limb salvage surgery   for a primary neoplasm of bone between 1998 and 2013. Endoprosthetic   replacement involved the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>al humerus in nine, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>al   femur in nine, the distal femur in 13 and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>al tibia in   six patients. There were 12 primary (32%) and 25 revision procedures (68%).   Implant survivorship was compared with matched controls. The amount   of bone that was resected was > 70% of its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">length</span></strong> and statistically   greater than the standard control group at each anatomical site.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean follow-up was seven years (one to 17). The mean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">length</span></strong>   of the stem was 33 mm (20 to 60) in the humerus and 79 mm (34 to   100) in the lower limb. Kaplan-Meier analysis of survival of the   implant according to anatomical site confirmed that there was no   statistically significant difference between the short-stemmed endoprostheses and   the standard stemmed controls at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>al humeral (p = 0.84),   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>al femoral (p = 0.57), distal femoral (p = 0.21) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>al   tibial (p = 0.61) sites.</p><p>In the short-stemmed group, no implants with extra-cortical plate   osseointegration suffered loosening at a mean of 8.5 years (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rang</span></strong>e   2 to 16 years).

Prediction of the pre-morbid 3D anatomy of the proximal humerus based on statistical shape modelling
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Restoring the pre-morbid anatomy of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>al humerus is a   goal of anatomical shoulder arthroplasty, but reliance is placed   on the surgeon’s experience and on anatomical estimations. The purpose   of this study was to present a novel method, ‘Statistical Shape   Modelling’, which accurately predicts the pre-morbid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>al humeral anatomy   and calculates the 3D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geometri</span></strong>c parameters needed to restore normal   anatomy in patients with severe degenerative osteoarthritis or a   fracture of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>al humerus.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>From a database of 57 humeral CT scans 3D humeral reconstructions   were manually created. The reconstructions were used to construct   a statistical shape model (SSM), which was then tested on a second   set of 52 scans. For each humerus in the second set, 3D reconstructions   of four diaphyseal segments of varying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">length</span></strong>s were created. These   reconstructions were chosen to mimic severe osteoarthritis, a fracture   of the surgical neck of the humerus and a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>al humeral fracture   with diaphyseal extension. The SSM was then applied to the diaphyseal   segments to see how well it predicted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>al morphology, using   the actual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>al humeral morphology for comparison.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>With the metaphysis included, mimicking osteoarthritis, the errors   of prediction for retroversion, inclination, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">height</span></strong>, radius of curvature   and posterior and medial offset of the head of the humerus were   2.9° (± 2.3°), 4.0° (± 3.3°), 1.0 mm (± 0.8 mm), 0.8 mm (± 0.6 mm),   0.7 mm (± 0.5 mm) and 1.0 mm (± 0.7 mm), respectively.

High-Target Versus Low-Target Blood Pressure Management During Cardiopulmonary Bypass to Prevent Cerebral Injury in Cardiac Surgery Patients
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cerebral injury is an important complication after cardiac surgery with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. The rate of overt stroke after cardiac surgery is 1% to 2%, whereas silent strokes, detected by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, are found in up to 50% of patients. It is unclear whether a higher versus a lower blood pressure during cardiopulmonary bypass reduces cerebral infarction in these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a patient- and assessor-blinded randomized trial, we allocated patients to a higher (70–80 mm Hg) or lower (40–50 mm Hg) target for mean arterial pressure by the titration of norepinephrine during cardiopulmonary bypass. Pump flow was fixed at 2.4 L·min<sup>−1</sup>·m<sup>−2</sup>. The primary outcome was the total volume of new ischemic cerebral lesions (summed in millimeters cubed), expressed as the difference between diffusion-weighted imaging conducted preoperatively and again postoperatively between days 3 and 6. Secondary outcomes included diffusion-weighted imaging–evaluated total number of new ischemic lesions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among the 197 enrolled patients, mean (SD) age was 65.0 (10.7) years in the low-target group (n=99) and 69.4 (8.9) years in the high-target group (n=98). Procedural risk scores were comparable between groups. Overall, diffusion-weighted imaging revealed new cerebral lesions in 52.8% of patients in the low-target group versus 55.7% in the high-target group (<i>P</i>=0.76). The primary outcome of volume of new cerebral lesions was comparable between groups, 25 mm<sup>3</sup> (interquartile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rang</span></strong>e, 0–118 mm<sup>3</sup>; <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rang</span></strong>e, 0–25 261 mm<sup>3</sup>) in the low-target group versus 29 mm<sup>3</sup> (interquartile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rang</span></strong>e, 0–143 mm<sup>3</sup>; <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rang</span></strong>e, 0–22 116 mm<sup>3</sup>) in the high-target group (median difference estimate, 0; 95% confidence interval, −25 to 0.028; <i>P</i>=0.99), as was the secondary outcome of number of new lesions (1 [interquartile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rang</span></strong>e, 0–2; <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rang</span></strong>e, 0–24] versus 1 [interquartile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rang</span></strong>e, 0–2; <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rang</span></strong>e, 0–29] respectively; median difference estimate, 0; 95% confidence interval, 0–0; <i>P</i>=0.71). No significant difference was observed in frequency of severe adverse events.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among patients undergoing on-pump cardiac surgery, targeting a higher versus a lower mean arterial pressure during cardiopulmonary bypass did not seem to affect the volume or number of new cerebral infarcts.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Ultrafast optical ranging using microresonator soliton frequency combs
<p>Light detection and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rang</span></strong>ing is widely used in science and industry. Over the past decade, optical frequency combs were shown to offer advantages in optical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rang</span></strong>ing, enabling fast distance acquisition with high accuracy. Driven by emerging high-volume applications such as industrial sensing, drone navigation, or autonomous driving, there is now a growing demand for compact <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rang</span></strong>ing systems. Here, we show that soliton Kerr comb generation in integrated silicon nitride microresonators provides a route to high-performance chip-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rang</span></strong>ing systems. We demonstrate dual-comb distance measurements with Allan deviations down to 12 nanometers at averaging times of 13 microseconds along with ultrafast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rang</span></strong>ing at acquisition rates of 100 megahertz, allowing for in-flight sampling of gun projectiles moving at 150 meters per second. Combining integrated soliton-comb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rang</span></strong>ing systems with chip-scale nanophotonic phased arrays could enable compact ultrafast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rang</span></strong>ing systems for emerging mass applications.</p>

Aortic Cross-Sectional Area/Height Ratio and Outcomes in Patients With a Trileaflet Aortic Valve and a Dilated Aorta
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In patients with a dilated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>al ascending aorta and trileaflet aortic valve, we aimed to assess (1) factors independently associated with increased long-term mortality and (2) the incremental prognostic utility of indexing aortic root to patient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">height</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied consecutive patients with a dilated aortic root (≥4 cm) that underwent echocardiography and gated contrast-enhanced thoracic aortic computed tomography or magnetic resonance angiography between 2003 and 2007. A ratio of aortic root area over <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">height</span></strong> was calculated (cm<sup>2</sup>/m) on tomography, and a cutoff of 10 cm<sup>2</sup>/m was chosen as abnormal, on the basis of previous reports. All-cause death was recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The cohort comprised 771 patients (63 years [interquartile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rang</span></strong>e, 53–71], 87% men, 85% hypertension, 51% hyperlipidemia, 56% smokers). Inherited aortopathies, moderate to severe aortic regurgitation, and severe aortic stenosis were seen in 7%, 18%, and 2%, whereas 91% and 54% were on β-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, respectively. Aortic root area/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">height</span></strong> ratio was ≥10 cm<sup>2</sup>/m in 24%. The Society of Thoracic Surgeons score and right ventricular systolic pressure were 3.3±3 and 31±7 mm Hg, respectively. At 7.8 years (interquartile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rang</span></strong>e, 6.6–8.9), 280 (36%) patients underwent aortic surgery (76% within 1 year) and 130 (17%) died (1% in-hospital postoperative mortality). A lower proportion of patients in the surgical (versus nonsurgical) group died (13% versus 19%, <i>P</i><0.01). On multivariable Cox proportional hazard analysis, aortic root area/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">height</span></strong> ratio (hazard ratio, 4.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.69–6.231) was associated with death, whereas aortic surgery (hazard ratio, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.27–0.81) was associated with improved survival (both <i>P</i><0.01). For longer-term mortality, the addition of aortic root area/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">height</span></strong> ratio ≥10 cm<sup>2</sup>/m to a clinical model (Society of Thoracic Surgeons score, inherited aortopathies, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, medications, aortic regurgitation, and right ventricular systolic pressure), increased the c-statistic from 0.57 (95% CI, 0.35–0.77) to 0.65 (95% CI, 0.52–0.73) and net reclassification index from 0.17 (95% CI, 0.02–0.31) to 0.23 (95% CI, 0.04–0.34), both <i>P</i><0.01. Of the 327 patients with aortic root diameter between 4.5 and 5.5 cm, 44% had an abnormal aortic root area/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">height</span></strong> ratio, of which 78% died.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In patients with dilated aortic root and trileaflet aortic valve, a ratio of aortic root area to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">height</span></strong> provides independent and improved stratification for prediction of death.</p></sec>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Large Crown Root Number Improves Topsoil Foraging and Phosphorus Acquisition
<p>Suboptimal phosphorus (P) availability is a primary constraint to plant growth on Earth. We tested the hypothesis that maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) genotypes with large crown root number (CN) will have shallower rooting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">depth</span></strong> and improved P acquisition from low-P soils. Maize recombinant inbred lines with contrasting CN were evaluated under suboptimal P availability in greenhouse mesocosms and the field. Under P stress in mesocosms, the large-CN phenotype had 48% greater root respiration, 24% shallower rooting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">depth</span></strong>, 32% greater root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">length</span></strong> density in the topsoil, 37% greater leaf P concentration, 48% greater leaf photosynthesis, 33% greater stomatal conductance, and 44% greater shoot biomass than the small-CN phenotype. Under P stress in the field, the large-CN phenotype had 32% shallower rooting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">depth</span></strong>, 51% greater root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">length</span></strong> density in the topsoil, 44% greater leaf P concentration, 18% greater leaf photosynthesis, 21% greater stomatal conductance, 23% greater shoot biomass at anthesis, and 28% greater yield than the small-CN phenotype. These results support the hypothesis that large CN improves plant P acquisition from low-P soils by reducing rooting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">depth</span></strong> and increasing topsoil foraging. The large-CN phenotype merits consideration as a selection target to improve P capture in maize and possibly other cereal crops.</p>

The direct anterior approach in total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The most effective surgical approach for total hip arthroplasty   (THA) remains controversial. The direct anterior approach may be   associated with a reduced risk of dislocation, faster recovery,   reduced pain and fewer surgical complications. This systematic review   aims to evaluate the current evidence for the use of this approach   in THA.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Following the Cochrane collaboration, an extensive literature   search of PubMed, Medline, Embase and OvidSP was conducted. Randomised   controlled trials, comparative studies, and cohort studies were   included. Outcomes included the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">length</span></strong> of the incision, blood loss,   operating time, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">length</span></strong> of stay, complications, and gait analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 42 studies met the inclusion criteria. Most were of   medium to low quality. There was no difference between the direct   anterior, anterolateral or posterior approaches with regards to   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">length</span></strong> of stay and gait analysis.</p><p>Papers comparing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">length</span></strong> of the incision found similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">length</span></strong>s   compared with the lateral approach, and conflicting results when   comparing the direct anterior and posterior approaches. </p><p>Most studies found the mean operating time to be significantly   longer when the direct anterior approach was used, with a steep   learning curve reported by many.</p><p>Many authors used validated scores including the Harris hip score,   and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index.   These mean scores were better following the use of the direct anterior   approach for the first six weeks post-operatively. Subsequently   there was no difference between these scores and those for the posterior   approach.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion </title><p>There is little evidence for improved kinematics or better long-term   outcomes following the use of the direct anterior approach for THA.

Do varus or valgus outliers have higher forces in the medial or lateral compartments than those which are in-range after a kinematically aligned total knee arthroplasty?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of this study were to determine the proportion of patients   with outlier varus or valgus alignment in kinematically aligned   total knee arthroplasty (TKA), whether those with outlier varus   or valgus alignment have higher forces in the medial or lateral   compartments of the knee than those with in-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rang</span></strong>e alignment and   whether measurements of the alignment of the limb, knee and components   predict compartment forces.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The intra-operative forces in the medial and lateral compartments   were measured with an instrumented tibial insert in 67 patients   who underwent a kinematically aligned TKA during passive movement.

ICare-ACS (Improving Care Processes for Patients With Suspected Acute Coronary Syndrome)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Efforts to safely reduce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">length</span></strong> of stay for emergency department patients with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) have had mixed success.

Isoscapes resolve species-specific spatial patterns in plant–plant interactions in an invaded Mediterranean dune ecosystem
<p>Environmental heterogeneity and plant–plant interactions are key factors shaping plant communities. However, the spatial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</span></strong>ion of plant–plant interactions has seldom been addressed in field studies. This is at least partially rooted in a lack of methods that can accurately resolve functional processes in a spatially explicit manner. Isoscapes, that is, spatially explicit representations of stable isotope data, provide a versatile means to trace functional changes on spatial scales, for example, related to N-cycling (foliar δ<sup>15</sup>N) and water use efficiency (WUE<sub>i</sub>, foliar δ<sup>13</sup>C). In a case study in a nutrient-depleted Mediterranean dune ecosystem, we analysed the spatial impact of the invasive N<sub>2</sub>-fixing <i>Acacia longifolia</i> on three native species of different functional types using δ<sup>15</sup>N and δ<sup>13</sup>C isoscapes and spatial autocorrelation analyses. Isoscapes revealed strong spatial patterns in δ<sup>15</sup>N and δ<sup>13</sup>C with pronounced species-specific differences, demonstrating distinct spatial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rang</span></strong>es of plant–plant interactions. A coniferous tree and an ericaceous dwarf shrub showed significant enrichment in δ<sup>15</sup>N within a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rang</span></strong>e of 5–8 m surrounding the canopy of <i>A. longifolia</i>, indicating input of N originating from symbiotic N<sub>2</sub>-fixation by the invader. In the dwarf shrub, which was most responsive to invader influence, enrichment in δ<sup>13</sup>C additionally demonstrated spatially explicit changes to WUE<sub>i</sub>, while a native N<sub>2</sub>-fixer was unresponsive to the presence of the invader. Furthermore, δ<sup>15</sup>N and δ<sup>13</sup>C isoscapes yielded different patterns, indicating that plant–plant interactions can have distinct spatial distributions and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rang</span></strong>es based on the process measured. Additionally, the magnitude of the effect differed between field situations with high and low invasion pressure. This study highlights that the spatial scale must be accounted for when assessing the effects and outcome of species interactions. Functional tracers such as stable isotopes enable us to quantify spatial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rang</span></strong>es of plant–plant interactions, providing empirical data that can help to better understand and predict complex species interactions in multifaceted natural environments.</p>

Quantum reference beacon–guided superresolution optical focusing in complex media
<p>Optical scattering is generally considered to be a nuisance of microscopy that limits imaging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">depth</span></strong> and spatial resolution. Wavefront shaping techniques enable optical imaging at unprecedented <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">depth</span></strong>, but attaining superresolution within complex media remains a challenge. We used a quantum reference beacon (QRB), consisting of solid-state quantum emitters with spin-dependent fluorescence, to provide subwave<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">length</span></strong> guidestar feedback for wavefront shaping to achieve a superresolution optical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">focus</span></strong>. We implemented the QRB-guided imaging with nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond nanocrystals, which enable optical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">focus</span></strong>ing with a subdiffraction resolution below 186 nanometers (less than half the wave<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">length</span></strong>). QRB-assisted wavefront-shaping should find use in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rang</span></strong>e of applications, including deep-tissue quantum enhanced sensing and individual optical excitation of magnetically coupled spin ensembles for applications in quantum information processing.</p>

Soliton microcomb range measurement
<p>Laser-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rang</span></strong>e measurement systems are important in many application areas, including autonomous vehicles, robotics, manufacturing, formation flying of satellites, and basic science. Coherent laser <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rang</span></strong>ing systems using dual-frequency combs provide an unprecedented combination of long <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rang</span></strong>e, high precision, and fast update rate. We report dual-comb distance measurement using chip-based soliton microcombs.

Measurements at distances up to 25 meters with much lower precision were also performed.

Drag, but not buoyancy, affects swim speed in captive Steller sea lions
<p>Swimming at an optimal speed is critical for breath-hold divers seeking to maximize the time they can spend foraging underwater. Theoretical studies have predicted that the optimal swim speed for an animal while transiting to and from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">depth</span></strong> is independent of buoyancy, but is dependent on drag and metabolic rate. However, this prediction has never been experimentally tested. Our study assessed the effects of buoyancy and drag on the swim speed of three captive Steller sea lions (<i>Eumetopias jubatus</i>) that made 186 dives. Our study animals were trained to dive to feed at fixed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">depth</span></strong>s (10–50 m) under artificially controlled buoyancy and drag conditions. Buoyancy and drag were manipulated using a pair of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tubes attached to harnesses worn by the sea lions, and buoyancy conditions were designed to fall within the natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rang</span></strong>e of wild animals (∼12–26% subcutaneous fat). Drag conditions were changed with and without the PVC tubes, and swim speeds were recorded and compared during descent and ascent phases using an accelerometer attached to the harnesses. Generalized linear mixed-effect models with the animal as the random variable and five explanatory variables (body mass, buoyancy, dive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">depth</span></strong>, dive phase, and drag) showed that swim speed was best predicted by two variables, drag and dive phase (AIC = −139). Consistent with a previous theoretical prediction, the results of our study suggest that the optimal swim speed of Steller sea lions is a function of drag, and is independent of dive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">depth</span></strong> and buoyancy.</p>

Size-dependent enhancement of water relations during post-fire resprouting
<p>In resprouting species, fire-induced topkill causes a reduction in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">height</span></strong> and leaf area without a comparable reduction in the size of the root system, which should lead to an increase in the efficiency of water transport after fire. However, large plants undergo a greater relative reduction in size, compared with small plants, so we hypothesized that this enhancement in hydraulic efficiency would be greatest among large growth forms. In the ecotone between long-leaf pine (<i>Pinus palustris</i> Mill.) savannas and wetlands, we measured stomatal conductance (<i>g</i><sub>s</sub>), mid-day leaf water potential (<i>Ψ</i><sub>leaf</sub>), leaf-specific whole-plant hydraulic conductance (<i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub>), leaf area and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">height</span></strong> of 10 species covering a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rang</span></strong>e of growth forms in burned and unburned sites. As predicted, <i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub> was higher in post-fire resprouts than in unburned plants, and the post-fire increase in <i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub> was positively related to plant size. Specifically, large-statured species tended to undergo the greatest relative reductions in leaf area and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">height</span></strong>, and correspondingly experienced the greatest increases in <i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub>. The post-fire increase in <i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub> was smaller than expected, however, due to a decrease in absolute root hydraulic conductance (i.e., not scaled to leaf area). The higher <i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub> in burned sites was manifested as an increase in <i>g</i><sub>s</sub> rather than an increase in <i>Ψ</i><sub>leaf</sub>. Post-fire increases in <i>g</i><sub>s</sub> should promote high rates of photosynthesis for recovery of carbohydrate reserves and aboveground biomass, which is particularly important for large-statured species that require more time to recover their pre-fire size.</p>

Evolution of human, chicken, alligator, frog, and zebrafish mineralocorticoid receptors: Allosteric influence on steroid specificity
<p>Although multiple steroid ligands of the glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid, and progestin families bind to and regulate the activity of mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs), the responses to these ligands differ across species. To understand how the different domains of MRs contribute to the ligand-induced activation or inhibition of MR activity, we studied the response to eight steroids (aldosterone, 11-deoxycorticosterone, 11-deoxycortisol, cortisol, corticosterone, progesterone, 19-norprogesterone, and spironolactone) of human, chicken, alligator, frog, and zebrafish full-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">length</span></strong> MRs and truncated MRs, which lacked the N-terminal domain (NTD) and DNA binding domain (DBD). Compared to full-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">length</span></strong> MRs, some truncated MRs were not activated by the steroids, and others required higher steroid concentrations for activation. Progesterone, 19-norprogesterone, and spironolactone did not activate full-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">length</span></strong> or truncated human, alligator, or frog MRs. However, at 10 nM, these steroids activated full-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">length</span></strong> chicken and zebrafish MRs, whereas at 100 nM, these steroids had little activity for truncated chicken MRs, but they retained activity for truncated zebrafish MRs. This suggests that regulation of the activation of the chicken MR by progestin resides in the NTD-DBD and that of the zebrafish MR resides in the hinge-LBD. Zebrafish and chicken MRs contain a serine corresponding to Ser<sup>810</sup> in human MR, which is required for the antagonist activity of progesterone for human MR, suggesting a previously uncharacterized mechanism of regulation of progestin activation of chicken and zebrafish MRs. These findings suggest that progesterone may be a physiological activator of chicken and zebrafish MRs.</p>

Oklahoma's induced seismicity strongly linked to wastewater injection depth
<p>The sharp rise in Oklahoma seismicity since 2009 is due to wastewater injection. The role of injection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">depth</span></strong> is an open, complex issue, yet critical for hazard assessment and regulation. We developed an advanced Bayesian network to model joint conditional dependencies between spatial, operational, and seismicity parameters. We found that injection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">depth</span></strong> relative to crystalline basement most strongly correlates with seismic moment release. The joint effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">depth</span></strong> and volume are critical, as injection rate becomes more influential near the basement interface. Restricting injection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">depth</span></strong>s to 200 to 500 meters above basement could reduce annual seismic moment release by a factor of 1.4 to 2.8. Our approach enables identification of subregions where targeted regulation may mitigate effects of induced earthquakes, aiding operators and regulators in wastewater disposal regions.</p>

Observation of mean path length invariance in light-scattering media
<p>The microstructure of a medium strongly influences how light propagates through it. The amount of disorder it contains determines whether the medium is transparent or opaque. Theory predicts that exciting such a medium homogeneously and isotropically makes some of its optical properties depend only on the medium’s outer geometry. Here, we report an optical experiment demonstrating that the mean path <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">length</span></strong> of light is invariant with respect to the microstructure of the medium it scatters through. Using colloidal solutions with varying concentration and particle size, the invariance of the mean path <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">length</span></strong> is observed over nearly two orders of magnitude in scattering strength. Our results can be extended to a wide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rang</span></strong>e of systems—however ordered, correlated, or disordered—and apply to all wave-scattering problems.</p>

A unified continental thickness from seismology and diamonds suggests a melt-defined plate
<p>Thick, rigid continents move over the weaker underlying mantle, although geophysical and geochemical constraints on the exact thickness and defining mechanism of the continental plates are widely discrepant. Xenoliths suggest a chemical continental lithosphere ~175 kilometers thick, whereas seismic tomography supports a much thicker root (>250 kilometers) and a gradual lithosphere-asthenosphere transition, consistent with a thermal definition. We modeled <i>SS</i> precursor waveforms from continental interiors and found a 7 to 9% velocity drop at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">depth</span></strong>s of 130 to 190 kilometers. The discontinuity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">depth</span></strong> is well correlated with the origin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">depth</span></strong>s of diamond-bearing xenoliths and corresponds to the transition from coarse to deformed xenoliths. At this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">depth</span></strong>, the xenolith-derived geotherm also intersects the carbonate-silicate solidus, suggesting that partial melt defines the plate boundaries beneath the continental interior.</p>

Consequently, bacteria have evolved elegant and robust regulatory mechanisms to ensure that flagellar morphogenesis follows a defined path, with each component self-assembling to predetermined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</span></strong>ions. The flagellar rod acts as a driveshaft to transmit torque from the cytoplasmic rotor to the external filament. The rod self-assembles to a defined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">length</span></strong> of ~25 nanometers. Here, we provide evidence that rod <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">length</span></strong> is limited by the width of the periplasmic space between the inner and outer membranes. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">length</span></strong> of Braun's lipoprotein determines periplasmic width by tethering the outer membrane to the peptidoglycan layer.</p>

<i>Rht18</i> Semidwarfism in Wheat Is Due to Increased <i>GA 2-oxidaseA9</i> Expression and Reduced GA Content
<p>Semidwarfing genes have improved crop yield by reducing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">height</span></strong>, improving lodging resistance, and allowing plants to allocate more assimilates to grain growth. In wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>), the <i>Rht18</i> semidwarfing gene was identified and deployed in durum wheat before it was transferred into bread wheat, where it was shown to have agronomic potential. <i>Rht18</i>, a dominant and gibberellin (GA) responsive mutant, is genetically and functionally distinct from the widely used GA-insensitive semidwarfing genes <i>Rht-B1b</i> and <i>Rht-D1b</i>. In this study, the <i>Rht18</i> gene was identified by mutagenizing the semidwarf durum cultivar Icaro (<i>Rht18</i>) and generating mutants with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rang</span></strong>e of tall phenotypes. Isolating and sequencing chromosome 6A of these “overgrowth” mutants showed that they contained independent mutations in the coding region of <i>GA2oxA9</i>. <i>GA2oxA9</i> is predicted to encode a GA 2-oxidase that metabolizes GA biosynthetic intermediates into inactive products, effectively reducing the amount of bioactive GA (GA<sub>1</sub>). Functional analysis of the GA2oxA9 protein demonstrated that GA2oxA9 converts the intermediate GA<sub>12</sub> to the inactive metabolite GA<sub>110</sub>. Furthermore, <i>Rht18</i> showed higher expression of <i>GA2oxA9</i> and lower GA content compared with its tall parent. These data indicate that the increased expression of <i>GA2oxA9</i> in <i>Rht18</i> results in a reduction of both bioactive GA content and plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">height</span></strong>. This study describes a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">height</span></strong>-reducing mechanism that can generate new genetic diversity for semidwarfism in wheat by combining increased expression with mutations of specific amino acid residues in <i>GA2oxA9</i>.</p>

Root Tip Shape Governs Root Elongation Rate under Increased Soil Strength
<p>Increased soil strength due to soil compaction or soil drying is a major limitation to root growth and crop productivity. Roots need to exert higher penetration force, resulting in increased penetration stress when elongating in soils of greater strength. This study aimed to quantify how the genotypic diversity of root tip geometry and root diameter influences root elongation under different levels of soil strength and to determine the extent to which roots adjust to increased soil strength. Fourteen wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) varieties were grown in soil columns packed to three bulk densities representing low, moderate, and high soil strength. Under moderate and high soil strength, smaller root tip radius-to-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">length</span></strong> ratio was correlated with higher genotypic root elongation rate, whereas root diameter was not related to genotypic root elongation. Based on cavity expansion theory, it was found that smaller root tip radius-to-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">length</span></strong> ratio reduced penetration stress, thus enabling higher root elongation rates in soils with greater strength. Furthermore, it was observed that roots could only partially adjust to increased soil strength. Root thickening was bounded by a maximum diameter, and root tips did not become more acute in response to increased soil strength. The obtained results demonstrated that root tip geometry is a pivotal trait governing root penetration stress and root elongation rate in soils of greater strength. Hence, root tip shape needs to be taken into account when selecting for crop varieties that may tolerate high soil strength.</p>

A High-Throughput, Field-Based Phenotyping Technology for Tall Biomass Crops
<p>Recent advances in omics technologies have not been accompanied by equally efficient, cost-effective, and accurate phenotyping methods required to dissect the genetic architecture of complex traits. Even though high-throughput phenotyping platforms have been developed for controlled environments, field-based aerial and ground technologies have only been designed and deployed for short-stature crops. Therefore, we developed and tested Phenobot 1.0, an auto-steered and self-propelled field-based high-throughput phenotyping platform for tall dense canopy crops, such as sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>). Phenobot 1.0 was equipped with laterally positioned and vertically stacked stereo RGB cameras. Images collected from 307 diverse sorghum lines were reconstructed in 3D for feature extraction. User interfaces were developed, and multiple algorithms were evaluated for their accuracy in estimating plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">height</span></strong> and stem diameter. Tested feature extraction methods included the following: (1) User-interactive Individual Plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">height</span></strong> Extraction (UsIn-PHe) based on dense stereo three-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</span></strong>ional reconstruction; (2) Automatic Hedge-based Plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">height</span></strong> Extraction (Auto-PHe) based on dense stereo 3D reconstruction; (3) User-interactive Dense Stereo Matching Stem Diameter Extraction; and (4) User-interactive Image Patch Stereo Matching Stem Diameter Extraction (IPaS-Di). Comparative genome-wide association analysis and ground-truth validation demonstrated that both UsIn-PHe and Auto-PHe were accurate methods to estimate plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">height</span></strong>, while Auto-PHe had the additional advantage of being a completely automated process. For stem diameter, IPaS-Di generated the most accurate estimates of this biomass-related architectural trait. In summary, our technology was proven robust to obtain ground-based high-throughput plant architecture parameters of sorghum, a tall and densely planted crop species.</p>

Intertidal sea stars (<i>Pisaster ochraceus</i>) alter body shape in response to wave action
<p>Sea stars are some of the largest mobile animals able to live in the harsh flow environment of wave-exposed, rocky intertidal shores. In addition, some species, such as the northeastern Pacific <i>Pisaster ochraceus</i>, are ecologically significant predators in a broad <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rang</span></strong>e of environments, from sheltered lagoons to the most wave-exposed shorelines. How they function and survive under such an extreme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rang</span></strong>e of wave exposures remains a puzzle. Here we examine the ability of <i>P. ochraceus</i> to alter body form in response to variation in flow conditions. We found that sea stars in wave-exposed sites had narrower arms and were lighter per unit arm <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">length</span></strong> than those from sheltered sites. Body form was tightly correlated with maximum velocity of breaking waves across four sites and also varied over time. In addition, field transplant experiments showed that these differences in shape were due primarily to phenotypic plasticity. Sea stars transplanted from a sheltered site to a more wave-exposed site became lighter per unit arm <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">length</span></strong>, and developed narrower arms, after 3 months. The tight correlation between water flow and morphology suggests that wave force must be a significant selective factor acting on body shape. On exposed shores, narrower arms probably reduce both lift and drag in breaking waves. On protected shores, fatter arms may provide more thermal inertia to resist overheating, or more body volume for gametes. Such plastic changes in body shape represent a unique method by which sea stars adapt to spatial, seasonal and possibly short-term variation in flow conditions.</p>

Quantification of the ossification of the lateral cuneiform in the feet of young children with unilateral congenital talipes equinovarus
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>After the initial correction of congenital talipes equinovarus   (CTEV) using the Ponseti method, a subsequent dynamic deformity   is often managed by transfer of the tendon of tibialis anterior   (TATT) to the lateral cuneiform.

PI(4,5)P2 regulates myoblast fusion through Arp2/3 regulator localization at the fusion site
<p>Cell-cell fusion is a regulated process that requires merging of the opposing membranes and underlying cytoskeletons. However, the integration between membrane and cytoskeleton signaling during fusion is not known. Using <i>Drosophila</i>, we demonstrate that the membrane phosphoinositide PI(4,5)P2 is a crucial regulator of F-actin dynamics during myoblast fusion. PI(4,5)P2 is locally enriched and colocalizes spatially and temporally with the F-actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">focus</span></strong> that defines the fusion site. PI(4,5)P2 enrichment depends on receptor engagement but is upstream or parallel to actin remodeling. Regulators of actin branching via Arp2/3 colocalize with PI(4,5)P2 <i>in vivo</i> and bind PI(4,5)P2 <i>in vitro</i>. Manipulation of PI(4,5)P2 availability leads to impaired fusion, with a reduction in the F-actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">focus</span></strong> size and altered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">focus</span></strong> morphology. Mechanistically, the changes in the actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">focus</span></strong> are due to a failure in the enrichment of actin regulators at the fusion site. Moreover, improper localization of these regulators hinders expansion of the fusion interface. Thus, PI(4,5)P2 enrichment at the fusion site encodes spatial and temporal information that regulates fusion progression through the localization of activators of actin polymerization.</p>

Simultaneous high-resolution pH and spectrophotometric recordings of oxygen binding in blood microvolumes
<p>Oxygen equilibrium curves have been widely used to understand oxygen transport in numerous organisms. A major challenge has been to monitor oxygen binding characteristics and concomitant pH changes as they occur <i>in vivo</i>, in limited sample volumes. Here we report a technique allowing highly resolved and simultaneous monitoring of pH and blood pigment saturation in minute blood volumes. We equipped a gas diffusion chamber with a broad-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rang</span></strong>e fibre-optic spectrophotometer and a micro-pH optode and recorded changes of pigment oxygenation along oxygen partial pressure (<i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) and pH gradients to test the setup. Oxygen binding parameters derived from measurements in only 15 μl of haemolymph from the cephalopod <i>Octopus vulgaris</i> showed low instrumental error (0.93%) and good agreement with published data. Broad-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rang</span></strong>e spectra, each resolving 2048 data points, provided detailed insight into the complex absorbance characteristics of diverse blood types. After consideration of photobleaching and intrinsic fluorescence, pH optodes yielded accurate recordings and resolved a sigmoidal shift of 0.03 pH units in response to changing <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> from 0 to 21 kPa. Highly resolved continuous recordings along pH gradients conformed to stepwise measurements at low rates of pH changes. In this study we showed that a diffusion chamber upgraded with a broad-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rang</span></strong>e spectrophotometer and an optical pH sensor accurately characterizes oxygen binding with minimal sample consumption and manipulation. We conclude that the modified diffusion chamber is highly suitable for experimental biologists who demand high flexibility, detailed insight into oxygen binding as well as experimental and biological accuracy combined in a single setup.</p>

Load-induced changes in bone stiffness and cancellous and cortical bone mass following tibial compression diminish with age in female mice
<p>The vertebrate skeleton is an adaptive structure that responds to mechanical stimuli by increasing bone mass under increased mechanical loads. Although experimental animal models have shown the anabolic cortical bone response to applied load decreases with age, no consensus exists regarding whether this adaptive mechanism is affected by age in cancellous bone, the tissue most impacted by age-related bone loss. We used an established murine <i>in vivo</i> tibial loading model to characterize the load-induced cancellous, cortical and whole-bone responses to mechanical stimuli in growing and mature female mice at 6, 10 and 16 weeks of age. The effects of applied load on tibial morphology and stiffness were determined using microcomputed tomography and <i>in vivo</i> bone strains measured at the medial tibial midshaft during applied loading. At all ages, 2 weeks of applied load produced larger midshaft cortical cross-sectional properties (+13–72%) and greater cancellous bone volume (+21–107%) and thicker trabeculae (+31–68%) in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>al metaphyses of the loaded tibiae. The relative anabolic response decreased from 6 to 16 weeks of age in both the cancellous and cortical envelopes. Load-induced tibial stresses decreased more in 6-week-old mice following loading, which corresponded to increased <i>in vivo</i> tibial stiffness. Stiffness in the loaded tibiae of 16-week-old mice decreased despite moderately increased cortical cross-sectional geometry, suggesting load-induced changes in bone material properties. This study shows that the cancellous and cortical anabolic responses to mechanical stimuli decline with age into adulthood and that cortical cross-sectional geometry alone does not necessarily predict whole-bone functional stiffness.</p>

Baseline hearing abilities and variability in wild beluga whales (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>)
<p>While hearing is the primary sensory modality for odontocetes, there are few data addressing variation within a natural population. This work describes the hearing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rang</span></strong>es (4–150 kHz) and sensitivities of seven apparently healthy, wild beluga whales (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>) during a population health assessment project that captured and released belugas in Bristol Bay, Alaska. The baseline hearing abilities and subsequent variations were addressed. Hearing was measured using auditory evoked potentials (AEPs). All audiograms showed a typical cetacean U-shape; substantial variation (>30 dB) was found between most and least sensitive thresholds. All animals heard well, up to at least 128 kHz. Two heard up to 150 kHz. Lowest auditory thresholds (35–45 dB) were identified in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rang</span></strong>e 45–80 kHz. Greatest differences in hearing abilities occurred at both the high end of the auditory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rang</span></strong>e and at frequencies of maximum sensitivity. In general, wild beluga hearing was quite sensitive. Hearing abilities were similar to those of belugas measured in zoological settings, reinforcing the comparative importance of both settings. The relative degree of variability across the wild belugas suggests that audiograms from multiple individuals are needed to properly describe the maximum sensitivity and population variance for odontocetes. Hearing measures were easily incorporated into field-based settings. This detailed examination of hearing abilities in wild Bristol Bay belugas provides a basis for a better understanding of the potential impact of anthropogenic noise on a noise-sensitive species. Such information may help design noise-limiting mitigation measures that could be applied to areas heavily influenced and inhabited by endangered belugas.</p>

An increase in minimum metabolic rate and not activity explains field metabolic rate changes in a breeding seabird
<p>The field metabolic rate (FMR) of a free-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rang</span></strong>ing animal can be considered as the sum of its maintenance costs (minimum metabolic rate, MMR) and additional costs associated with thermoregulation, digestion, production and activity. However, the relationships between FMR and BMR and how they relate to behaviour and extrinsic influences is not clear. In seabirds, FMR has been shown to increase during the breeding season. This is presumed to be the result of an increase in foraging activity, stimulated by increased food demands from growing chicks, but few studies have investigated in detail the factors that underlie these increases. We studied free-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rang</span></strong>ing Australasian gannets (<i>Morus serrator</i>) throughout their 5 month breeding season, and evaluated FMR, MMR and activity-related metabolic costs on a daily basis using the heart rate method. In addition, we simultaneously recorded behaviour (flying and diving) in the same individuals. FMR increased steadily throughout the breeding season, increasing by 11% from the incubation period to the long chick-brooding period. However, this was not accompanied by either an increase in flying or diving behaviour, or an increase in the energetic costs of activity. Instead, the changes in FMR could be explained exclusively by a progressive increase in MMR. Seasonal changes in MMR could be due to a change in body composition or a decrease in body condition associated with changing the allocation of resources between provisioning adults and growing chicks. Our study highlights the importance of measuring physiological parameters continuously in free-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rang</span></strong>ing animals in order to understand fully the mechanisms underpinning seasonal changes in physiology and behaviour.</p>

Hearing threshold shifts and recovery after noise exposure in beluga whales, <i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>
<p>Temporary threshold shift (TTS) after loud noise exposure was investigated in a male and a female beluga whale (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>). The thresholds were evaluated using the evoked-potential technique, which allowed for threshold tracing with a resolution of ~1 min. The fatiguing noise had a 0.5 octave bandwidth, with center frequencies <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rang</span></strong>ing from 11.2 to 90 kHz, a level of 165 dB re. 1 μPa and exposure durations from 1 to 30 min. The effects of the noise were tested at probe frequencies <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rang</span></strong>ing from −0.5 to +1.5 octaves relative to the noise center frequency. The effect was estimated in terms of both immediate (1.5 min) post-exposure TTS and recovery duration. The highest TTS with the longest recovery duration was produced by noises of lower frequencies (11.2 and 22.5 kHz) and appeared at a test frequency of +0.5 octave. At higher noise frequencies (45 and 90 kHz), the TTS decreased. The TTS effect gradually increased with prolonged exposures <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rang</span></strong>ing from 1 to 30 min. There was a considerable TTS difference between the two subjects.</p>

Is it safe to preserve the deltoid when resecting the proximal humerus for a primary malignant bone tumour?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Resection of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>al humerus for the primary malignant bone   tumour sometimes requires <i>en bloc</i> resection of the   deltoid. However, there is no information in the literature which   helps a surgeon decide whether to preserve the deltoid or not. The   aim of this study was to determine whether retaining the deltoid   at the time of resection would increase the rate of local recurrence.   We also sought to identify the variables that persuade expert surgeons   to choose a deltoid sparing rather than deltoid resecting procedure.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We reviewed 45 patients who had undergone resection of a primary   malignant tumour of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>al humerus. There were 29 in the deltoid   sparing group and 16 in the deltoid resecting group. Imaging studies   were reviewed to assess tumour extension and soft-tissue involvement.   The presence of a fat rim separating the tumour from the deltoid   on MRI was particularly noted. The cumulative probability of local   recurrence was calculated in a competing risk scenario.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was no significant difference (adjusted p = 0.89) in the   cumulative probability of local recurrence between the deltoid sparing   (7%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1 to 20) and the deltoid resecting   group (26%, 95% CI 8 to 50). Patients were more likely to be selected   for a deltoid sparing procedure if they presented with a small tumour   (p = 0.0064) with less bone involvement (p = 0.032) and a continuous   fat rim on MRI (p = 0.002) and if the axillary nerve could be identified   (p = 0.037).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>A deltoid sparing procedure can provide good local control after   resection of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proxim</span></strong>al humerus for a primary malignant bone tumour.   A smaller tumour, the presence of a continuous fat rim and the identification   of the axillary nerve on pre-operative MRI will persuade surgeons   to opt for a deltoid resecting procedure.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1244–9.</p></sec>

Factors affecting the potential for posterior bony impingement after total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Our aim was to evaluate the radiographic characteristics of patients   undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA) for the potential of posterior   bony impingement using CT simulations.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Virtual CT data from 112 patients who underwent THA were analysed.   There were 40 men and 72 women. Their mean age was 59.1 years (41   to 76). Associations between radiographic characteristics and posterior   bony impingement and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rang</span></strong>e of external rotation of the hip were   evaluated. In addition, we investigated the effects of pelvic tilt   and the neck/shaft angle and femoral offset on posterior bony impingement.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rang</span></strong>e of external rotation and the ischiofemoral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">length</span></strong> were   significantly lower, while femoral anteversion, the ischial ratio,   and ischial angle were significantly higher in patients with posterior   bony impingement compared with those who had implant impingement   (p < 0.05). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rang</span></strong>e of external rotation positively correlated   with ischiofemoral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">length</span></strong> (r = 0.49, p < 0.05), and negatively   correlated with ischial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">length</span></strong> (r = -0.49, p < 0.05), ischial   ratio (r =- 0.49, p < 0.05) and ischial angle (r = -0.55, p <   0.05). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rang</span></strong>e of external rotation was lower in patients with posterior   pelvic tilt (p < 0.05) and in those with a high offset femoral   component (p < 0.05) due to posterior bony impingement.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Posterior bony impingement after THA is more likely in patients   with a wider ischium and a narrow ischiofemoral space. A high femoral   offset and posterior pelvic tilt are also risk factors for this   type of impingement.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1140–6.</p></sec>

Quality of life after resection of a chordoma of the mobile spine
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of the study was to compare measures of the quality of   life (QOL) after resection of a chordoma of the mobile spine with   the national averages in the United States and to assess which factors   influenced the QOL, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and coping   with pain post-operatively in these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 48 consecutive patients who underwent resection of   a primary or recurrent chordoma of the mobile spine between 2000   and 2015 were included. A total of 34 patients completed a survey   at least 12 months post-operatively. The primary outcome was the   EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D-3L) questionnaire. Secondary outcomes were   the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS)   anxiety, depression and pain interference questionnaires. Data which   were recorded included the indication for surgery, the region of   the tumour, the number of levels resected, the status of the surgical   margins, re-operations, complications, neurological deficit, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">length</span></strong>   of stay in hospital and rate of re-admission.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The median EQ-5D-3L score was 0.71 (interquartile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rang</span></strong>e (IQR)   0.44 to 0.79) which is worse than the national average in the United   States of 0.85 (p < 0.001). Anxiety (median: 55 (IQR 49 to 61),   p = 0.031) and pain (median: 61 (IQR 56 to 68), p < 0.001) were   also worse than the national average in the United States (50),   while depression was not (median: 52 (IQR 38 to 57), p = 0.513).   Patients who underwent a primary resection had better QOL and less anxiety,   depression and pain compared with those who underwent resection   for recurrent or residual disease. The one- and five-year probabilities   were 0.96 and 0.74 for survival, 0.07 and 0.25 for tumour recurrence,   and 0.02 and 0.16 for developing distant metastasis. A total of   25 local complications occurred in 20 patients (42%), and there were   50 systemic and other complications in 25 patients (52%) within   90 days.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These patient reported outcomes and oncological and surgical   outcomes can be used when counselling patients and to aid decision-making   when planning surgery.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:979–86.</p></sec>

External rotation of the femoral component increases asymmetry of the posterior condyles
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The morphometry of the distal femur was largely studied to improve   bone-implant fit in total knee arthroplasty (TKA), but little is   known about the asymmetry of the posterior condyles. This study   aimed to investigate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</span></strong>ions of the posterior condyles and   the influence of externally rotating the femoral component on potential prosthetic   overhang or under-coverage.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We analysed the shape of 110 arthritic knees at the time of primary   TKA using pre-operative CT scans. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">height</span></strong> and width of each condyle   were measured at the posterior femoral cut in neutral position,   and in 3º and 5º of external rotation, using both central and medial   referencing systems. We compared the morphological characteristics   with those of 14 TKA models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In the neutral position, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</span></strong>ions of the condyles were   nearly equal. Externally rotating the femoral cut by 3º and 5º with   ‘central referencing’ induced width asymmetry > 3 mm in 23 (21%)   and 33 (30%) knees respectively, while with ‘medial referencing’   it induced width asymmetry > 3 mm in 43 (39%) and 75 (68%) knees   respectively. The asymmetries induced by rotations were not associated   with gender, aetiology or varus-valgus alignment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>External rotation may amplify the asymmetry between the medial   and lateral condyles, and exacerbate prosthetic overhang, particularly   in the superolateral zone. ‘Central referencing’ guides result in   less potential prosthetic overhang than ‘medial referencing’ guides.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:894–903</p></sec>

Promising early results for trabecular metal acetabular components used at revision total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of aseptic   loosening after the use of a cemented acetabular component and a   Trabecular Metal (TM) acetabular component (Zimmer Inc., Warsaw,   Indiana) at acetabular revision with bone impaction grafting.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 42 patients were included in the study. Patients were   randomised to receive an all- polyethylene cemented acetabular component   (n = 19) or a TM component (n = 23).

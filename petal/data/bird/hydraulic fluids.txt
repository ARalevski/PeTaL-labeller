Selection for a Zinc-Finger Protein Contributes to Seed Oil Increase during Soybean Domestication
<p>Seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> is a momentous agronomical trait of soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) targeted by domestication in breeding. Although multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong>-related genes have been uncovered, knowledge of the regulatory mechanism of seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> biosynthesis is currently limited. We demonstrate that the seed-preferred gene <i>GmZF351</i>, encoding a tandem CCCH zinc finger protein, is selected during domestication. Further analysis shows that <i>GmZF351</i> facilitates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> accumulation by directly activating <i>WRINKLED1</i>, <i>BIOTIN CARBOXYL CARRIER PROTEIN2</i>, <i>3-KETOACYL-ACYL CARRIER PROTEIN SYNTHASE III</i>, <i>DIACYLGLYCEROL O-ACYLTRANSFERASE1</i>, and <i>OLEOSIN2</i> in transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seeds. Overexpression of <i>GmZF351</i> in transgenic soybean also activates lipid biosynthesis genes, thereby accelerating seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> accumulation. The <i>ZF351</i> haplotype from the cultivated soybean group and the wild soybean (<i>Glycine soja</i>) subgroup III correlates well with high gene expression level, seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> contents and promoter activity, suggesting that selection of <i>GmZF351</i> expression leads to increased seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> content in cultivated soybean. Our study provides novel insights into the regulatory mechanism for seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> accumulation, and the manipulation of <i>GmZF351</i> may have great potential in the improvement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> production in soybean and other related crops.</p>

MYB89 Transcription Factor Represses Seed Oil Accumulation
<p>In many higher plants, seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> accumulation is precisely controlled by intricate multilevel regulatory networks, among which transcriptional regulation mainly influences <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> biosynthesis. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the master positive transcription factors, <i>WRINKLED1</i> (<i>WRI1</i>) and <i>LEAFY COTYLEDON1-LIKE</i> (<i>L1L</i>), are important for seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> accumulation. We found that an R2R3-MYB transcription factor, MYB89, was expressed predominantly in developing seeds during maturation. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> and major fatty acid biosynthesis in seeds was significantly promoted by <i>myb89-1</i> mutation and <i>MYB89</i> knockdown; thus, MYB89 was an important repressor during seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> accumulation. RNA sequencing revealed remarkable up-regulation of numerous genes involved in seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> accumulation in <i>myb89</i> seeds at 12 d after pollination. Posttranslational activation of a MYB89-glucocorticoid receptor fusion protein and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that MYB89 inhibited seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> accumulation by directly repressing <i>WRI1</i> and five key genes and by indirectly suppressing <i>L1L</i> and 11 key genes involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> biosynthesis during seed maturation. These results help us to understand the novel function of MYB89 and provide new insights into the regulatory network of transcriptional factors controlling seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> accumulation in Arabidopsis.</p>

Experimental analysis of the liquid-feeding mechanism of the butterfly <i>Pieris rapae</i>
<p>The butterfly <i>Pieirs rapae</i> drinks <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> using a long proboscis. A high pressure gradient is induced in the proboscis when cibarial pump muscles contract. However, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> feeding through the long proboscis poses a disadvantage of high flow resistance. Hence, butterflies may possess special features to compensate for this disadvantage and succeed in foraging. The main objective of this study is to analyze the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong>-feeding mechanism of butterflies. The systaltic motion of the cibarial pump organ was visualized using the synchrotron X-ray imaging technique. In addition, an ellipsoidal pump model was established based on synchrotron X-ray micro-computed tomography. To determine the relationship between the cyclic variation of the pump volume and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong>-feeding flow, velocity fields of the intake flow at the tip of the proboscis were measured using micro-particle image velocimetry. Reynolds and Womersley numbers of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong>-feeding flow in the proboscis were ~1.40 and 0.129, respectively. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong>-feeding flow could be characterized as a quasi-steady state laminar flow. Considering these results, we analyzed the dimensions of the feeding apparatus on the basis of minimum energy consumption during the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong>-feeding process. The relationship between the proboscis and the cibarial pump was determined when minimum energy consumption occurs. As a result, the volume of the cibarial pump is proportional to the cube of the radius of the proboscis. It seems that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong>-feeding system of butterflies and other long-proboscid insects follow the cube relationship. The present results provide insights into the feeding strategies of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong>-feeding butterflies.</p>

Draft genome sequence of an elite <i>Dura</i> palm and whole-genome patterns of DNA variation in oil palm
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> palm is the worldâ€™s leading source of vegetable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> and fat. <i>Dura, Pisifera</i> and <i>Tenera</i> are three forms of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> palm. The genome sequence of <i>Pisifera</i> is available whereas the <i>Dura</i> form has not been sequenced yet. We sequenced the genome of one elite <i>Dura</i> palm, and re-sequenced 17 palm genomes. The assemble genome sequence of the elite <i>Dura</i> tree contained 10,971 scaffolds and was 1.701 Gb in length, covering 94.49% of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> palm genome. 36,105 genes were predicted. Re-sequencing of 17 additional palm trees identified 18.1 million SNPs. We found high genetic variation among palms from different geographical regions, but lower variation among Southeast Asian <i>Dura</i> and <i>Pisifera</i> palms. We mapped 10,000 SNPs on the linkage map of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> palm. In addition, high linkage disequilibrium (LD) was detected in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> palms used in breeding populations of Southeast Asia, suggesting that LD mapping is likely to be practical in this important <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> crop. Our data provide a valuable resource for accelerating genetic improvement and studying the mechanism underlying phenotypic variations of important <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> palm traits.</p>

Fluid-induced aseismic fault slip outpaces pore-fluid migration
<p>Earthquake swarms attributed to subsurface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> injection are usually assumed to occur on faults destabilized by increased pore-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> pressur</span></strong>es. However, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> injection could also activate aseismic slip, which might outpace pore-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> migration and transmit earthquake-triggering stress changes beyond the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>-pressurized region. We tested this theoretical prediction against data derived from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>-injection experiments that activated and measured slow, aseismic slip on preexisting, shallow faults. We found that the pore pressure and slip history imply a fault whose strength is the product of a slip-weakening friction coefficient and the local effective normal stress. Using a coupled shear-rupture model, we derived constraints on the hydromechanical parameters of the actively deforming fault. The inferred aseismic rupture front propagates faster and to larger distances than the diffusion of pressurized pore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>.</p>

Wrapping with a splash: High-speed encapsulation with ultrathin sheets
<p>Many complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>s rely on surfactants to contain, protect, or isolate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> drops in an immiscible continuous phase. Thin elastic sheets can wrap <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> drops in a spontaneous process driven by capillary forces. For encapsulation by sheets to be practically viable, a rapid, continuous, and scalable process is essential. We exploit the fast dynamics of droplet impact to achieve wrapping of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> droplets by ultrathin polymer films in a water phase. Despite the violence of splashing events, the process robustly yields wrappings that are optimally shaped to maximize the enclosed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> volume and have near-perfect seams. We achieve wrappings of targeted three-dimensional (3D) shapes by tailoring the 2D boundary of the films and show the generality of the technique by producing both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong>-in-water and water-in-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> wrappings.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Xylem Sap Surface Tension May Be Crucial for Hydraulic Safety
<p>The surface tension (Î³) of xylem sap plays a key role in stabilizing air-water interfaces at the pits between water- and gas-filled conduits to avoid air seeding at low water potentials. We studied seasonal changes in xylem sap Î³ in <i>Picea abies</i> and <i>Pinus mugo</i> growing at the alpine timberline. We analyzed their vulnerability to drought-induced embolism using solutions of different Î³ and estimated the potential effect of seasonal changes in Î³ on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic vulnerability. In both species, xylem sap Î³ showed distinct seasonal courses between about 50 and 68 m<sc>n</sc> m<sup>âˆ’1</sup>. Solutions with low Î³ caused higher vulnerability to drought-induced xylem embolism. The water potential at 50% loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductivity in <i>P. abies</i> and <i>P. mugo</i> was âˆ’3.35 and âˆ’3.86 MPa at Î³ of 74 m<sc>n</sc> m<sup>âˆ’1</sup> but âˆ’2.11 and âˆ’2.09 MPa at 45 m<sc>n</sc> m<sup>âˆ’1</sup>. This indicates up to about 1 MPa seasonal variation in 50% loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductivity. The results revealed pronounced effects of changes in xylem sap Î³ on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic safety of trees in situ. These effects also are relevant in vulnerability analyses, where the use of standard solutions with high Î³ overestimates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic safety. Thus, Î³ should be considered carefully in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic studies.</p>

Evidence for Hydraulic Vulnerability Segmentation and Lack of Xylem Refilling under Tension
<p>The vascular system of grapevine (<i>Vitis</i> spp.) has been reported as being highly vulnerable, even though grapevine regularly experiences seasonal drought. Consequently, stomata would remain open below water potentials that would generate a high loss of stem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductivity via xylem embolism. This situation would necessitate daily cycles of embolism repair to restore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic function. However, a more parsimonious explanation is that some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic techniques are prone to artifacts in species with long vessels, leading to the overestimation of vulnerability. The aim of this study was to provide an unbiased assessment of (1) the vulnerability to drought-induced embolism in perennial and annual organs and (2) the ability to refill embolized vessels in two <i>Vitis</i> species X-ray micro-computed tomography observations of intact plants indicated that both <i>Vitis</i> <i>vinifera</i> and <i>Vitis</i> <i>riparia</i> were relatively vulnerable, with the pressure inducing 50% loss of stem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductivity = âˆ’1.7 and âˆ’1.3 MPa, respectively. In <i>V. vinifera</i>, both the stem and petiole had similar sigmoidal vulnerability curves but differed in pressure inducing 50% loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductivity (âˆ’1.7 and âˆ’1 MPa for stem and petiole, respectively). Refilling was not observed as long as bulk xylem pressure remained negative (e.g. at the apical part of the plants; âˆ’0.11 Â± 0.02 MPa) and change in percentage loss of conductivity was 0.02% Â± 0.01%. However, positive xylem pressure was observed at the basal part of the plant (0.04 Â± 0.01 MPa), leading to a recovery of conductance (change in percentage loss of conductivity = âˆ’0.24% Â± 0.12%). Our findings provide evidence that grapevine is unable to repair embolized xylem vessels under negative pressure, but its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic vulnerability segmentation provides significant protection of the perennial stem.</p>

Effect of source/sink ratios on yield components, growth dynamics and structural characteristics of oil palm (<i>Elaeis guineensis</i>) bunches
<p>Source/sink ratios are known to be one of the main determinants of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> palm growth and development. A long-term experiment (9 years) was conducted in Indonesia on mature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> palms subjected to continuous bunch ablation and partial defoliation treatments to artificially modify source/sink ratios. During the experiment, all harvested bunches were dissected and phenological measurements were carried out to analyse the effect of source/sink ratios on yield components explaining variations in bunch number, the number of fruits per bunch and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> dry weight per fruit. An integrative variable (supply/demand ratio) describing the ratio between the assimilate supply from sources and the growing organ demand for carbohydrate was computed for each plant on a daily basis from observations of the number of developing organs and their sink strength, and of climate variables. Defoliation and bunch ablation affected the bunch number and the fruit number per bunch. Variations in bunch number per month were mainly due to variations in the fraction of aborted inflorescence and in the ratio between female and male inflorescences. Under fluctuating trophic conditions, variations in fruit number per bunch resulted both from changes in fruit-set and in the number of branches (rachillae) per inflorescence. For defoliated plants, the decrease in the number of developing reproductive sinks appeared to be sufficient to maintain fruit weight and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> concentration at the control level, without any major decrease in the concentration of non-structural carbohydrate reserves. Computation of the supply/demand ratio revealed that each yield component had a specific phase of sensitivity to supply/demand ratios during inflorescence development. Establishing quantitative relationships between supply/demand ratios, competition and yield components is the first step towards a functional model for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> palm.</p>

mRNA structure determines specificity of a polyQ-driven phase separation
<p>RNA promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> phase separation (LLPS) to build membraneless compartments in cells. How distinct molecular compositions are established and maintained in these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> compartments is unknown. Here, we report that secondary structure allows messenger RNAs (mRNAs) to self-associate and determines whether an mRNA is recruited to or excluded from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> compartments. The polyQ-protein Whi3 induces conformational changes in RNA structure and generates distinct molecular fluctuations depending on the RNA sequence. These data support a model in which structure-based, RNA-RNA interactions promote assembly of distinct droplets and protein-driven, conformational dynamics of the RNA maintain this identity. Thus, the shape of RNA can promote the formation and coexistence of the diverse array of RNA-rich <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> compartments found in a single cell.</p>

Outside-Xylem Vulnerability, Not Xylem Embolism, Controls Leaf Hydraulic Decline during Dehydration<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[CC-BY]</sup></xref>
<p>Leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic supply is crucial to maintaining open stomata for CO<sub>2</sub> capture and plant growth. During drought-induced dehydration, the leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductance (<i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub>) declines, which contributes to stomatal closure and, eventually, to leaf death. Previous studies have tended to attribute the decline of <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> to embolism in the leaf vein xylem. We visualized at high resolution and quantified experimentally the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic vulnerability of xylem and outside-xylem pathways and modeled their respective influences on plant water transport. Evidence from all approaches indicated that the decline of <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> during dehydration arose first and foremost due to the vulnerability of outside-xylem tissues. In vivo x-ray microcomputed tomography of dehydrating leaves of four diverse angiosperm species showed that, at the turgor loss point, only small fractions of leaf vein xylem conduits were embolized, and substantial xylem embolism arose only under severe dehydration. Experiments on an expanded set of eight angiosperm species showed that outside-xylem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic vulnerability explained 75% to 100% of <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> decline across the range of dehydration from mild water stress to beyond turgor loss point. Spatially explicit modeling of leaf water transport pointed to a role for reduced membrane conductivity consistent with published data for cells and tissues. Plant-scale modeling suggested that outside-xylem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic vulnerability can protect the xylem from tensions that would induce embolism and disruption of water transport under mild to moderate s<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> and atmospheric droughts. These findings pinpoint outside-xylem tissues as a central locus for the control of leaf and plant water transport during progressive drought.</p>

Antifreeze proteins in the primary urine of larvae of the beetle <i>Dendroides canadensis</i>
<p>To avoid freezing while overwintering beneath the bark of fallen trees, <i>Dendroides canadensis</i> (Coleoptera: Pyrochroidae) larvae produce a family of antifreeze proteins (DAFPs) that are transcribed in specific tissues and have specific compartmental fates. DAFPs and associated thermal hysteresis activity (THA) have been shown previously in hemolymph and midgut <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>, but the presence of DAFPs has not been explored in primary urine, a potentially important site that can contain endogenous ice-nucleating compounds that could induce freezing. A maximum mean THA of 2.65Â±0.33Â°C was observed in primary urine of winter-collected <i>D. canadensis</i> larvae. THA in primary urine increased significantly through autumn, peaked in the winter and decreased through spring to levels of 0.2â€“0.3Â°C in summer, in a pattern similar to that of hemolymph and midgut <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>. THA was also found in hindgut <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> and excreted rectal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>, suggesting that these larvae not only concentrate AFPs in the hindgut, but also excrete AFPs from the rectal cavity. Based on <i>dafp</i> transcripts isolated from Malpighian tubule epithelia, cDNAs were cloned and sequenced, identifying the presence of transcripts encoding 24 DAFP isoforms. Six of these Malpighian tubule DAFPs were known previously, but 18 are new. We also provide functional evidence that DAFPs can inhibit ice nucleators present in insect primary urine. This is potentially critical because <i>D. canadensis</i> larvae die if frozen, and therefore ice formation in any body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>, including the urine, would be lethal.</p>

Recovery performance in xylem hydraulic conductivity is correlated with cavitation resistance for temperate deciduous tree species
<p>Woody species <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ically vulnerable to xylem cavitation may experience daily xylem embolism. How such species cope with the possibility of accumulated embolism is unclear. In this study, we examined seven temperate woody species to assess the hypothesis that low cavitation resistance (high vulnerability to cavitation) is compensated by high recovery performance via vessel refilling. We also evaluated leaf functional and xylem structural traits. The xylem recovery index (XRI), defined as the ratio of xylem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductivity in plants rewatered after s<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> drought to that in plants under moist conditions, varied among species. The xylem water potential causing 50% loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductivity (Î¨<sub>50</sub>) varied among the species studied, whereas only a slight difference was detected with respect to midday xylem water potential (Î¨<sub>min</sub>), indicating smaller <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic safety margins (Î¨<sub>min</sub>â€‰âˆ’â€‰Î¨<sub>50</sub>) for species more vulnerable to cavitation. Cavitation resistance (|Î¨<sub>50</sub>|) was negatively correlated with XRI across species, with cavitation-vulnerable species showing a higher performance in xylem recovery. Wood density was positively correlated with cavitation resistance and was negatively correlated with XRI. These novel results reveal that coordination exists between cavitation resistance and xylem recovery performance, in association with wood functional traits such as denser wood for cavitation-resistant xylem and less-dense but water-storable wood for refillable xylem. These findings provide insights into long-term maintenance of water transport in tree species growing under variable environmental conditions.</p>

Microtubules tune mechanotransduction through NOX2 and TRPV4 to decrease sclerostin abundance in osteocytes
<p>The adaptation of the skeleton to its mechanical environment is orchestrated by mechanosensitive osteocytes, largely by regulating the abundance of sclerostin, a secreted inhibitor of bone formation. We defined a microtubule-dependent mechanotransduction pathway that linked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> shear stress to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) signals that led to a reduction in sclerostin abundance in cultured osteocytes. We demonstrated that microtubules stabilized by detyrosination, a reversible posttranslational modification of polymerized Î±-tubulin, determined the stiffness of the cytoskeleton, which set the mechanoresponsive range of cultured osteocytes to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> shear stress. We showed that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> shear stress through the microtubule network activated NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2)â€“generated ROS that target the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel TRPV4 to elicit Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Furthermore, tuning the abundance of detyrosinated tubulin affected cytoskeletal stiffness to define the mechanoresponsive range of cultured osteocytes to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> shear stress. Finally, we demonstrated that NOX2-ROS elicited Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals that activated the kinase CaMKII to decrease the abundance of sclerostin protein. Together, these discoveries may identify potentially druggable targets for regulating osteocyte mechanotransduction to affect bone quality.</p>

The turbulent cascade in five dimensions
<p>To the naked eye, turbulent flows exhibit whirls of many different sizes. To each size, or scale, corresponds a fraction of the total energy resulting from a cascade in five dimensions: scale, time, and three-dimensional space. Understanding this process is critical to strategies for modeling geophysical and industrial flows. By tracking the flow regions containing energy in different scales, we have detected the statistical predominance of a cross-scale link whereby <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> lumps of energy at scale Î” appear within lumps of scale 2Î” and die within those of scale Î”/2. Our approach uncovers the energy cascade in a simple water-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>, offering insights for turbulence models while paving the way for similar analyses in conducting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>s, quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>s, and plasmas.</p>

Complete measurement of helicity and its dynamics in vortex tubes
<p>Helicity, a topological measure of the intertwining of vortices in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> flow, is a conserved quantity in inviscid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>s but can be dissipated by viscosity in real flows. Despite its relevance across a range of flows, helicity in real <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>s remains poorly understood because the entire quantity is challenging to measure. We measured the total helicity of thin-core vortex tubes in water. For helical vortices that are stretched or compressed by a second vortex, we found conservation of total helicity. For an isolated helical vortex, we observed evolution toward and maintenance of a constant helicity state after the dissipation of twist helicity by viscosity. Our results show that helicity can remain constant even in a viscous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> and provide an improved basis for understanding and manipulating helicity in real flows.</p>

Transition from turbulent to coherent flows in confined three-dimensional active fluids
<p>Transport of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> through a pipe is essential for the operation of macroscale machines and micro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>ic devices. Conventional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>s only flow in response to external pressure. We demonstrate that an active isotropic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>, composed of microtubules and molecular motors, autonomously flows through meter-long three-dimensional channels. We establish control over the magnitude, velocity profile, and direction of the self-organized flows and correlate these to the structure of the extensile microtubule bundles. The inherently three-dimensional transition from bulk-turbulent to confined-coherent flows occurs concomitantly with a transition in the bundle orientational order near the surface and is controlled by a scale-invariant criterion related to the channel profile. The nonequilibrium transition of confined isotropic active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>s can be used to engineer self-organized soft machines.</p>

Tri-Hydroxy-Triacylglycerol Is Efficiently Produced by Position-Specific Castor Acyltransferases
<p>Understanding the biochemistry of triacylglycerol (TAG) assembly is critical in tailoring seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong>s to produce high-value products. Hydroxy-fatty acid (HFA) is one such valuable modified fatty acid, which can be produced at low levels in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed through transgenic expression of the castor (<i>Ricinus communis</i>) hydroxylase. The resulting plants have low seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> content and poor seedling establishment, indicating that Arabidopsis lacks efficient metabolic networks for biosynthesis and catabolism of hydroxy-containing TAG. To improve utilization of such substrates, we expressed three castor acyltransferase enzymes that incorporate HFA at each stereochemical position during TAG synthesis. This produced abundant tri-HFA TAG and concentrated 44% of seed HFA moieties into this one TAG species. Ricinoleic acid was more abundant than any other fatty acid in these seeds, which had 3-fold more HFA by weight than that in seeds following simple hydroxylase expression, the highest yet measured in a nonnative plant. Efficient utilization of hydroxy-containing lipid substrates increased the rate of TAG synthesis 2-fold, leading to complete relief of the low-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> phenotype. Partition of HFA into specific TAG molecules increased the storage lipid available for mobilization during seedling development, resulting in a 1.9-fold increase in seedling establishment. Expression of a complete acyltransferase pathway to efficiently process HFA establishes a benchmark in the quest to successfully produce modified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong>s in plants.</p>

Going with the Flow: Multiscale Insights into the Composite Nature of Water Transport in Roots
<p>As water often limits crop production, a more complete understanding of plant water capture and transport is necessary. Here, we developed MECHA, a mathematical model that computes the flow of water across the root at the scale of walls, membranes, and plasmodesmata of individual cells, and used it to test hypotheses related to root water transport in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). The model uses detailed root anatomical descriptions and a minimal set of experimental cell properties, including the conductivity of plasma membranes, cell walls, and plasmodesmata, which yield quantitative and scale-consistent estimations of water pathways and root radial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductivity (<i>k</i><sub>r</sub>). MECHA revealed that the mainstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic theories derived independently at the cell and root segment scales are compatible only if osmotic potentials within the apoplastic domains are uniform. The results suggested that the convection-diffusion of apoplastic solutes explained most of the offset between estimated <i>k</i><sub>r</sub> in pressure clamp and osmotic experiments, while the contribution of water-filled intercellular spaces was limited. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses quantified the relative impact of cortex and endodermis cell conductivity of plasma membranes on root <i>k</i><sub>r</sub> and suggested that only the latter contributed substantially to <i>k</i><sub>r</sub> due to the composite nature of water flow across roots. The explicit root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic anatomy framework brings insights into contradictory interpretations of experiments from the literature and suggests experiments to efficiently address questions pertaining to root water relations. Its scale consistency opens avenues for cross-scale communication in the world of root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ics.</p>

The Causes of Leaf Hydraulic Vulnerability and Its Influence on Gas Exchange in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>The influence of the dynamics of leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductance (<i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub>) diurnally and during dehydration on stomatal conductance and photosynthesis remains unclear. Using the model species Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> ecotype Columbia-0), we applied a multitiered approach including physiological measurements, high-resolution x-ray microcomputed tomography, and modeling at a range of scales to characterize (1) <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> decline during dehydration; (2) its basis in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductances of leaf xylem and outside-xylem pathways (<i>K</i><sub>ox</sub>); (3) the dependence of its dynamics on irradiance; (4) its impact on diurnal patterns of stomatal conductance and photosynthetic rate; and (5) its influence on gas exchange and survival under simulated drought regimes. Arabidopsis leaves showed strong vulnerability to dehydration diurnally in both gas exchange and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductance, despite lack of xylem embolism or conduit collapse above the turgor loss point, indicating a pronounced sensitivity of <i>K</i><sub>ox</sub> to dehydration. <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> increased under higher irradiance in well-hydrated leaves across the full range of water potential, but no shift in <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> vulnerability was observed. Modeling indicated that responses to dehydration and irradiance are likely attributable to changes in membrane permeability and that a dynamic <i>K</i><sub>ox</sub> would contribute strongly to stomatal closure, improving performance, survival, and efficient water use during drought. These findings for Columbia-0 provide a baseline for assessing variation across genotypes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic traits and their influence on gas exchange during dehydration.</p>

Mechanical Failure of Fine Root Cortical Cells Initiates Plant Hydraulic Decline during Drought
<p>Root systems perform the crucial task of absorbing water from the s<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> to meet the demands of a transpiring canopy. Roots are thought to operate like electrical fuses, which break when carrying an excessive load under conditions of drought stress. Yet the exact site and sequence of this dysfunction in roots remain elusive. Using in vivo x-ray computed microtomography, we found that drought-induced mechanical failure (i.e. lacunae formation) in fine root cortical cells is the initial and primary driver of reduced fine root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductivity (Lp<sub>r</sub>) under mild to moderate drought stress. Cortical lacunae started forming under mild drought stress (âˆ’0.6 MPa Î¨<sub>stem</sub>), coincided with a dramatic reduction in Lp<sub>r</sub>, and preceded root shrinkage or significant xylem embolism. Only under increased drought stress was embolism formation observed in the root xylem, and it appeared first in the fine roots (50% loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductivity [P<sub>50</sub>] reached at âˆ’1.8 MPa) and then in older, coarse roots (P<sub>50</sub> = âˆ’3.5 MPa). These results suggest that cortical cells in fine roots function like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic fuses that decouple plants from drying s<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong>, thus preserving the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic integrity of the plantâ€™s vascular system under early stages of drought stress. Cortical lacunae formation led to permanent structural damage of the root cortex and nonrecoverable Lp<sub>r</sub>, pointing to a role in fine root mortality and turnover under drought stress.</p>

Osmotic and hydraulic adjustment of mangrove saplings to extreme salinity
<p>Salinity tolerance in plant species varies widely due to adaptation and acclimation processes at the cellular and whole-plant scales. In mangroves, extreme substrate salinity induces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic failure and ion excess toxicity and reduces growth and survival, thus suggesting a potentially critical role for physiological acclimation to salinity. We tested the hypothesis that osmotic adjustment, a key type of plasticity that mitigates salinity shock, would take place in coordination with declines in whole-plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductance in a common garden experiment using saplings of three mangrove species withÂ different salinity tolerances (<i>Avicennia germinans</i> L., <i>Rhizophora mangle</i> L. and <i>Laguncularia racemosa</i> (L.) C.F. Gaertn., ordered from higher to lower salinity tolerance). For each mangrove species, four salinity treatments (1, 10, 30 and 50 practical salinity units) were established and the time trajectories were determined for leaf osmotic potential (Î¨<sub>s</sub>), stomatal conductance (<i>g</i><sub>s</sub>), whole-plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductance (<i>K</i><sub>plant</sub>) and predawn disequilibrium between xylem and substrate water potentials (Î¨<sub>pdd</sub>). We expected that, for all three species, salinity increments would result in coordinated declines in Î¨<sub>s</sub>, <i>g</i><sub>s</sub> and <i>K</i><sub>plant</sub>, and that the Î¨<sub>pdd</sub> would increase with substrate salinity and time of exposure. In concordance with our predictions, reductions in substrate water potential promoted a coordinated decline in Î¨<sub>s</sub>, <i>g</i><sub>s</sub> and <i>K</i><sub>plant</sub>, whereas the Î¨<sub>pdd</sub> increased substantially during the first 4 days but dissipated after 7 days, indicating a time lag for equilibration after a change in substratum salinity. Our results show that mangroves confront and partially ameliorate acute salinity stress via simultaneous reductions in Î¨<sub>s</sub>, <i>g</i><sub>s</sub> and <i>K</i><sub>plant</sub>, thus developing synergistic physiological responses at the cell and whole-plant scales.</p>

Interplay of growth rate and xylem plasticity for optimal coordination of carbon and hydraulic economies in <i>Fraxinus ornus</i> trees
<p>Efficient leaf water supply is fundamental for assimilation processes and tree growth. Renovating the architecture of the xylem transport system requires an increasing carbon investment while growing taller, and any deficiency of carbon availability may result in increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic constraints to water flow. Therefore, plants need to coordinate carbon assimilation and biomass allocation to guarantee an efficient and safe long-distance transport system. We tested the hypothesis that reduced branch elongation rates together withÂ carbon-saving adjustments of xylem anatomy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ically compensate for the reduction in biomass allocation to xylem. We measured leaf biomass, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic and anatomical properties of wood segments along the main axis of branches in 10 slow growing (SG) and 10 fast growing (FG) <i>Fraxinus ornus</i> L. trees. Branches of SG trees had five times slower branch elongation rate (7 vs 35  cm year<sup>â€“1</sup>), and produced a higher leaf biomass (<i>P</i>Â <Â 0.0001) and thinner xylem rings with fewer but larger vessels (<i>P</i>Â <Â 0.0001). On the contrary, we found no differences between SG and FG trees in terms of leaf-specific conductivity (<i>P</i> >Â 0.05) and xylem safety (Î¨<sub>50</sub> â‰ˆ âˆ’3.2  MPa). Slower elongation rate coupled with thinner annual rings and larger vessels allows the reduction of carbon costs associated with growth, while maintaining similar leaf-specific conductivity and xylem safety.</p>

Size-dependent enhancement of water relations during post-fire resprouting
<p>In resprouting species, fire-induced topkill causes a reduction in height and leaf area without a comparable reduction in the size of the root system, which should lead to an increase in the efficiency of water transport after fire. However, large plants undergo a greater relative reduction in size, compared with small plants, so we hypothesized that this enhancement in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic efficiency would be greatest among large growth forms. In the ecotone between long-leaf pine (<i>Pinus palustris</i> Mill.) savannas and wetlands, we measured stomatal conductance (<i>g</i><sub>s</sub>), mid-day leaf water potential (<i>Î¨</i><sub>leaf</sub>), leaf-specific whole-plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductance (<i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub>), leaf area and height of 10 species covering a range of growth forms in burned and unburned sites. As predicted, <i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub> was higher in post-fire resprouts than in unburned plants, and the post-fire increase in <i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub> was positively related to plant size. Specifically, large-statured species tended to undergo the greatest relative reductions in leaf area and height, and correspondingly experienced the greatest increases in <i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub>. The post-fire increase in <i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub> was smaller than expected, however, due to a decrease in absolute root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductance (i.e., not scaled to leaf area). The higher <i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub> in burned sites was manifested as an increase in <i>g</i><sub>s</sub> rather than an increase in <i>Î¨</i><sub>leaf</sub>. Post-fire increases in <i>g</i><sub>s</sub> should promote high rates of photosynthesis for recovery of carbohydrate reserves and aboveground biomass, which is particularly important for large-statured species that require more time to recover their pre-fire size.</p>

Templated nanofiber synthesis via chemical vapor polymerization into liquid crystalline films

Suppressing corrosion in primary aluminumâ€“air batteries via oil displacement

High power and energy density are enabled by displacing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> with electrolyte for battery discharge.

Here we found that synapsin can form a distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> phase in an aqueous environment. Other scaffolding proteins could coassemble into this condensate but were not necessary for its formation. Importantly, the synapsin phase could capture small lipid vesicles. The synapsin phase rapidly disassembled upon phosphorylation by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, mimicking the dispersion of synapsin 1 that occurs at presynaptic sites upon stimulation. Thus, principles of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> phase separation may apply to the clustering of SVs at synapses.</p>

The Role of GÎ² Protein in Controlling Cell Expansion via Potential Interaction with Lipid Metabolic Pathways
<p>Heterotrimeric G-proteins influence almost all aspects of plant growth, development, and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses in plants, likely via their interaction with specific effectors. However, the identity of such effectors and their mechanism of action are mostly unknown. While investigating the roles of different G-protein subunits in modulating the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> content in Camelina (<i>Camelina sativa</i>), an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> seed crop, we uncovered a role of GÎ² proteins in controlling anisotropic cell expansion. Knockdown of <i>GÎ²</i> genes causes reduced longitudinal and enhanced transverse expansion, resulting in altered cell, tissue, and organ shapes in transgenic plants during vegetative and reproductive development. These plants also exhibited substantial changes in their fatty acid and phospholipid profiles, which possibly leads to the increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> content of the transgenic seeds. This increase is potentially caused by the direct interaction of GÎ² proteins with a specific patatin-like phospholipase, pPLAIIIÎ´. Camelina plants with suppressed <i>GÎ²</i> expression exhibit higher lipase activity, and show phenotypes similar to plants overexpressing <i>pPLAIIIÎ´</i>, suggesting that the GÎ² proteins are negative regulators of pPLAIIIÎ´. These results reveal interactions between the G-proteinâ€“mediated and lipid signaling/metabolic pathways, where specific phospholipases may act as effectors that control key developmental and environmental responses of plants.</p>

Hydraulics Regulate Stomatal Responses to Changes in Leaf Water Status in the Fern <i>Athyrium filix</i>-<i>femina</i>
<p>Stomatal responses to changes in leaf water status are important for the diurnal regulation of gas exchange and the survival of plants during drought. These stomatal responses in angiosperm species are well characterized, yet in species of nonseed plants, an ongoing debate surrounds the role of metabolism, particularly the role of the hormone abscisic acid (ABA), in functionally regulating stomatal responses to changes in leaf water status. Here, we measured the stomatal response to changes in vapor pressure difference (VPD) in two natural forms of the fern species <i>Athyrium filix</i>-<i>femina</i>, recently suggested to have stomata that are regulated by ABA. The two forms measured had considerable differences in key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic traits, including leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductance and capacitance, as well as the kinetics of stomatal response to changes in VPD. In both forms, the stomatal responses to VPD could be accurately predicted by a dynamic, mechanistic model that assumes guard cell turgor changes in concert with leaf turgor in the light, and not via metabolic processes including the level of ABA. During drought, endogenous ABA did not play a role in stomatal closure, and exogenous ABA applied to live, intact leaves did not induce stomatal closure. Our results indicate that functional stomatal responses to changes in leaf water status in ferns are regulated by leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ics and not metabolism. With ferns being sister to seed plants, this result has implications for the evolutionary reconstruction of functional stomatal responses across vascular land plant lineages.</p>

Identification and Metabolite Profiling of Chemical Activators of Lipid Accumulation in Green Algae
<p>Microalgae are proposed as feedstock organisms useful for producing biofuels and coproducts. However, several limitations must be overcome before algae-based production is economically feasible. Among these is the ability to induce lipid accumulation and storage without affecting biomass yield. To overcome this barrier, a chemical genetics approach was employed in which 43,783 compounds were screened against <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, and 243 compounds were identified that increase triacylglyceride (TAG) accumulation without terminating growth. Identified compounds were classified by structural similarity, and 15 were selected for secondary analyses addressing impacts on growth fitness, photosynthetic pigments, and total cellular protein and starch concentrations. TAG accumulation was verified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry quantification of total fatty acids, and targeted TAG and galactolipid measurements were performed using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> chromatography-multiple reaction monitoring/mass spectrometry. These results demonstrated that TAG accumulation does not necessarily proceed at the expense of galactolipid. Untargeted metabolite profiling provided important insights into pathway shifts due to five different compound treatments and verified the anabolic state of the cells with regard to the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, Calvin cycle, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and amino acid biosynthetic pathways. Metabolite patterns were distinct from nitrogen starvation and other abiotic stresses commonly used to induce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> accumulation in algae. The efficacy of these compounds also was demonstrated in three other algal species. These lipid-inducing compounds offer a valuable set of tools for delving into the biochemical mechanisms of lipid accumulation in algae and a direct means to improve algal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> content independent of the severe growth limitations associated with nutrient deprivation.</p>

A Specialized Diacylglycerol Acyltransferase Contributes to the Extreme Medium-Chain Fatty Acid Content of <i>Cuphea</i> Seed Oil
<p>Seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong>s of many <i>Cuphea</i> sp. contain >90% of medium-chain fatty acids, such as decanoic acid (10:0). These seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong>s, which are among the most compositionally variant in the plant kingdom, arise from specialized fatty acid biosynthetic enzymes and specialized acyltransferases. These include lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferases (LPAT) and diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGAT) that are required for successive acylation of medium-chain fatty acids in the <i>sn</i>-2 and <i>sn</i>-3 positions of seed triacylglycerols (TAGs). Here we report the identification of a cDNA for a DGAT1-type enzyme, designated CpuDGAT1, from the transcriptome of <i>C. avigera</i> var <i>pulcherrima</i> developing seeds. Microsomes of camelina (<i>Camelina sativa</i>) seeds engineered for CpuDGAT1 expression displayed DGAT activity with 10:0-CoA and the diacylglycerol didecanoyl, that was approximately 4-fold higher than that in camelina seed microsomes lacking CpuDGAT1. In addition, coexpression in camelina seeds of CpuDGAT1 with a <i>C. viscosissima</i> FatB thioesterase (CvFatB1) that generates 10:0 resulted in TAGs with nearly 15 mol % of 10:0. More strikingly, expression of CpuDGAT1 and CvFatB1 with the previously described CvLPAT2, a 10:0-CoA-specific <i>Cuphea</i> LPAT, increased 10:0 amounts to 25 mol % in camelina seed TAG. These TAGs contained up to 40 mol % 10:0 in the <i>sn</i>-2 position, nearly double the amounts obtained from coexpression of CvFatB1 and CvLPAT2 alone. Although enriched in diacylglycerol, 10:0 was not detected in phosphatidylcholine in these seeds. These findings are consistent with channeling of 10:0 into TAG through the combined activities of specialized LPAT and DGAT activities and demonstrate the biotechnological use of these enzymes to generate 10:0-rich seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong>s.</p>

The Sites of Evaporation within Leaves
<p>The sites of evaporation within leaves are unknown, but they have drawn attention for decades due to their perceived implications for many factors, including patterns of leaf isotopic enrichment, the maintenance of mesophyll water status, stomatal regulation, and the interpretation of measured stomatal and leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductances. We used a spatially explicit model of coupled water and heat transport outside the xylem, MOFLO 2.0, to map the distribution of net evaporation across leaf tissues in relation to anatomy and environmental parameters. Our results corroborate earlier predictions that most evaporation occurs from the epidermis at low light and moderate humidity but that the mesophyll contributes substantially when the leaf center is warmed by light absorption, and more so under high humidity. We also found that the bundle sheath provides a significant minority of evaporation (15% in darkness and 18% in high light), that the vertical center of amphistomatous leaves supports net condensation, and that vertical temperature gradients caused by light absorption vary over 10-fold across species, reaching 0.3Â°C. We show that several hypotheses that depend on the evaporating sites require revision in light of our findings, including that experimental measurements of stomatal and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductances should be affected directly by changes in the location of the evaporating sites. We propose a new conceptual model that accounts for mixed-phase water transport outside the xylem. These conclusions have far-reaching implications for inferences in leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ics, gas exchange, water use, and isotope physiology.</p>

Apparent Overinvestment in Leaf Venation Relaxes Leaf Morphological Constraints on Photosynthesis in Arid Habitats
<p>Leaf veins supply the mesophyll with water that evaporates when stomata are open to allow CO<sub>2</sub> uptake for photosynthesis. Theoretical analyses suggest that water is optimally distributed in the mesophyll when the lateral distance between veins (<i>d</i><sub>x</sub>) is equal to the distance from these veins to the epidermis (<i>d</i><sub>y</sub>), expressed as <i>d</i><sub>x</sub>:<i>d</i><sub>y</sub> â‰ˆ 1. Although this theory is supported by observations of many derived angiosperms, we hypothesize that plants in arid environments may reduce <i>d</i><sub>x</sub>:<i>d</i><sub>y</sub> below unity owing to climate-specific functional adaptations of increased leaf thickness and increased vein density. To test our hypothesis, we assembled leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic, morphological, and photosynthetic traits of 68 species from the <i>Eucalyptus</i> and <i>Corymbia</i> genera (termed eucalypts) along an aridity gradient in southwestern Australia. We inferred the potential gas-exchange advantage of reducing <i>d</i><sub>x</sub> beyond <i>d</i><sub>y</sub> using a model that links leaf morphology and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ics to photosynthesis. Our observations reveal that eucalypts in arid environments have thick amphistomatous leaves with high vein densities, resulting in <i>d</i><sub>x</sub>:<i>d</i><sub>y</sub> ratios that range from 1.6 to 0.15 along the aridity gradient. Our model suggests that, as leaves become thicker, the effect of reducing <i>d</i><sub>x</sub> beyond <i>d</i><sub>y</sub> is to offset the reduction in leaf gas exchange that would result from maintaining <i>d</i><sub>x</sub>:<i>d</i><sub>y</sub> at unity. This apparent overinvestment in leaf venation may be explained from the selective pressure of aridity, under which traits associated with long leaf life span, high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic and thermal capacitances, and high potential rates of leaf water transport confer a competitive advantage.</p>

Comparison of the elution properties of commercially available gentamicin and bone cement containing vancomycin with â€˜home-madeâ€™ preparations

Control and local measurement of the spin chemical potential in a magnetic insulator
<p>The spin chemical potential characterizes the tendency of spins to diffuse. Probing this quantity could provide insight into materials such as magnetic insulators and spin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong>s and aid optimization of spintronic devices. Here we introduce single-spin magnetometry as a generic platform for nonperturbative, nanoscale characterization of spin chemical potentials. We experimentally realize this platform using diamond nitrogen-vacancy centers and use it to investigate magnons in a magnetic insulator, finding that the magnon chemical potential can be controlled by driving the systemâ€™s ferromagnetic resonance. We introduce a symmetry-based two-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> theory describing the underlying magnon processes, measure the local thermomagnonic torque, and illustrate the detection sensitivity using electrically controlled spin injection. Our results pave the way for nanoscale control and imaging of spin transport in mesoscopic systems.</p>

ATP controls the crowd
<p>Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the canonical energy carrier that powers cellular machines, drives metabolic reactions, and serves as a precursor to nucleic acids. On page 753 of this issue, Patel <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) propose a previously unknown function for ATP in maintaining protein solubility and preventing macromolecular aggregation. They show that at physiologic concentrations (2 to 8 mM), the physical properties of ATP alone enable it to dissolve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> phase-separated droplets and amyloid fibers.

Large gem diamonds from metallic liquid in Earthâ€™s deep mantle
<p>The redox state of Earthâ€™s convecting mantle, masked by the lithospheric plates and basaltic magmatism of plate tectonics, is a key unknown in the evolutionary history of our planet. Here we report that large, exceptional gem diamonds like the Cullinan, Constellation, and Koh-i-Noor carry direct evidence of crystallization from a redox-sensitive metallic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> phase in the deep mantle. These sublithospheric diamonds contain inclusions of solidified iron-nickel-carbon-sulfur melt, accompanied by a thin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> layer of methane Â± hydrogen, and sometimes majoritic garnet or former calcium silicate perovskite. The metal-dominated mineral assemblages and reduced volatiles in large gem diamonds indicate formation under metal-saturated conditions. We verify previous predictions that Earth has highly reducing deep mantle regions capable of precipitating a metallic iron phase that contains dissolved carbon and hydrogen.</p>

Command of active matter by topological defects and patterns
<p>Self-propelled bacteria are marvels of nature with a potential to power dynamic materials and microsystems of the future. The challenge lies in commanding their chaotic behavior. By dispersing swimming <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> crystalline environment with spatially varying orientation of the anisotropy axis, we demonstrate control over the distribution of bacterial concentration, as well as the geometry and polarity of their trajectories. Bacteria recognize subtle differences in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> crystal deformations, engaging in bipolar swimming in regions of pure splay and bend but switching to unipolar swimming in mixed splay-bend regions. They differentiate topological defects, heading toward defects of positive topological charge and avoiding negative charges.

Low Vulnerability to Xylem Embolism in Leaves and Stems of North American Oaks
<p>Although recent findings suggest that xylem embolism represents a significant, drought-induced damaging process in land plants, substantial debate surrounds the capacity of long-vesseled, ring-porous species to resist embolism. We investigated whether recent methodological developments could help resolve this controversy within <i>Quercus</i>, a long-vesseled, ring-porous temperate angiosperm genus, and shed further light on the importance of xylem vulnerability to embolism as an indicator of drought tolerance. We used the optical technique to quantify leaf and stem xylem vulnerability to embolism of eight <i>Quercus</i> species from the Mediterranean-type climate region of California to examine absolute measures of resistance to embolism as well as any potential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic segmentation between tissue types. We demonstrated that our optical assessment reflected flow impairment for a subset of our sample species by quantifying changes in leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductance in dehydrating branches. Air-entry water potential varied 2-fold in leaves, ranging from âˆ’1.7 Â± 0.25 MPa to âˆ’3.74 Â± 0.23 MPa, and 4-fold in stems, ranging from âˆ’1.17 Â± 0.04 MPa to âˆ’4.91 Â± 0.3 MPa. Embolism occurred earlier in leaves than in stems in only one out of eight sample species, and plants always lost turgor before experiencing stem embolism. Our results show that long-vesseled North American <i>Quercus</i> species are more resistant to embolism than previously thought and support the hypothesis that avoiding stem embolism is a critical component of drought tolerance in woody trees. Accurately quantifying xylem vulnerability to embolism is essential for understanding species distributions along aridity gradients and predicting plant mortality during drought.</p>

Development Defects of Hydroxy-Fatty Acid-Accumulating Seeds Are Reduced by Castor Acyltransferases
<p>Researchers have long endeavored to produce modified fatty acids in easily managed crop plants where they are not natively found. An important step toward this goal has been the biosynthesis of these valuable products in model <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong>seeds. The successful production of such fatty acids has revealed barriers to the broad application of this technology, including low seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> and low proportion of the introduced fatty acid and reduced seed vigor. Here, we analyze the impact of producing hydroxy-fatty acids on seedling development. We show that germinating seeds of a hydroxy-fatty acid-accumulating Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) line produce chlorotic cotyledons and suffer reduced photosynthetic capacity. These seedlings retain hydroxy-fatty acids in polar lipids, including chloroplast lipids, and exhibit decreased fatty acid synthesis. Triacylglycerol mobilization in seedling development also is reduced, especially for lipids that include hydroxy-fatty acid moieties. These developmental defects are ameliorated by increased flux of hydroxy-fatty acids into seed triacylglycerol created through the expression of either castor (<i>Ricinus communis</i>) acyltransferase enzyme ACYL-COA:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE2 or PHOSPHOLIPID:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1A. Such expression increases both the level of total stored triacylglycerol and the rate at which it is mobilized, fueling fatty acid synthesis and restoring photosynthetic capacity. Our results suggest that further improvements in seedling development may require the specific mobilization of triacylglycerol-containing hydroxy-fatty acids. Understanding the defects in early development caused by the accumulation of modified fatty acids and providing mechanisms to circumvent these defects are vital steps in the development of tailored <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> crops.</p>

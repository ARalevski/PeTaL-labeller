Avian egg shape: Form, function, and evolution
<p>Avian egg <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong> is generally explained as an adaptation to life history, yet we currently lack a global synthesis of how egg-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong> differences arise and evolve. Here, we apply morphometric, mechanistic, and macroevolutionary analyses to the egg <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong>s of 1400 bird species. We characterize egg-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong> diversity in terms of two biologically relevant variables, asymmetry and ellipticity, allowing us to quantify the observed morphologies in a two-dimensional morphospace. We then propose a simple mechanical model that explains the observed egg-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong> diversity based on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geometri</span></strong>c and material properties of the egg membrane. Finally, using phylogenetic models, we show that egg <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong> correlates with flight ability on broad taxonomic scales, suggesting that adaptations for flight may have been critical drivers of egg-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong> variation in birds.</p>

Nematic-to-columnar mesophase transition by in situ supramolecular polymerization
<p>Disk- and rod-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong>d molecules are incompatible in coassembly, as the former tend to stack one-dimensionally whereas the latter tend to align in parallel. Because this type of incompatibility can be more pronounced in condensed phases, different-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong>d molecules generally exclude one another. We report that supramolecular polymerization of a disk-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong>d chiral monomer in nematic liquid crystals comprising rod-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong>d molecules results in order-increasing mesophase transition into a single mesophase with a core-shell columnar geometry. This liquid crystalline material responds quickly to an applied electric field, resulting in unidirectional columnar ordering. Moreover, it can be modularly customized to be optoelectrically responsive simply by using a photoisomerizable rod-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong>d module. The modular strategy allows for cooperative integration of different functions into elaborate dynamic architectures.</p>

PaCeQuant: A Tool for High-Throughput Quantification of Pavement Cell Shape Characteristics
<p>Pavement cells (PCs) are the most frequently occurring cell type in the leaf epidermis and play important roles in leaf growth and function. In many plant species, PCs form highly complex jigsaw-puzzle-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong>d cells with interlocking lobes. Understanding of their development is of high interest for plant science research because of their importance for leaf growth and hence for plant fitness and crop yield. Studies of PC development, however, are limited, because robust methods are lacking that enable automatic segmentation and quantification of PC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong> parameters suitable to reflect their cellular complexity. Here, we present our new ImageJ-based tool, PaCeQuant, which provides a fully automatic image analysis workflow for PC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong> quantification. PaCeQuant automatically detects cell boundaries of PCs from confocal input images and enables manual correction of automatic segmentation results or direct import of manually segmented cells. PaCeQuant simultaneously extracts 27 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong> features that include global, contour-based, skeleton-based, and PC-specific object descriptors. In addition, we included a method for classification and analysis of lobes at two-cell junctions and three-cell junctions, respectively. We provide an R script for graphical visualization and statistical analysis. We validated PaCeQuant by extensive comparative analysis to manual segmentation and existing quantification tools and demonstrated its usability to analyze PC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong> characteristics during development and between different genotypes. PaCeQuant thus provides a platform for robust, efficient, and reproducible quantitative analysis of PC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong> characteristics that can easily be applied to study PC development in large data sets.</p>

Arabidopsis Leaf Flatness Is Regulated by PPD2 and NINJA through Repression of <i>CYCLIN D3</i> Genes
<p>In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), reduced expression of the transcriptional regulator <i>PEAPOD2</i> (<i>PPD2</i>) results in propeller-like rosettes with enlarged and dome-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong>d leaves. However, the molecular and cellular processes underlying this peculiar phenotype remain elusive. Here, we studied the interaction between PPD2 and NOVEL INTERACTOR OF JAZ (NINJA) and demonstrated that <i>ninja</i> loss-of-function plants produce rosettes with dome-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong>d leaves similar to those of <i>ppd</i> mutants but without the increase in size. We showed that <i>ninja</i> mutants have a convex-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong>d primary cell cycle arrest front, putatively leading to excessive cell division in the central leaf blade region. Furthermore, <i>ppd</i> and <i>ninja</i> mutants have a similar increase in the expression of <i>CYCLIN D3;2</i> (<i>CYCD3;2</i>), and ectopic overexpression of <i>CYCD3;2</i> phenocopies the <i>ppd</i> and <i>ninja</i> rosette and leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong> phenotypes without affecting the size. Our results reveal a pivotal contribution of NINJA in leaf development, in addition to its well-studied function in jasmonate signaling, and imply a new function for D3-type cyclins in, at least partially, uncoupling the size and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong> phenotypes of <i>ppd</i> leaves.</p>

Evidence for a neural law of effect
<p>Thorndike’s law of effect states that actions that lead to reinforcements tend to be repeated more often. Accordingly, neural activity patterns leading to reinforcement are also reentered more frequently. Reinforcement relies on dopaminergic activity in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), and animals <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong> their behavior to receive dopaminergic stimulation. Seeking evidence for a neural law of effect, we found that mice learn to reenter more frequently motor cortical activity patterns that trigger optogenetic VTA self-stimulation. Learning was accompanied by gradual shaping of these patterns, with participating neurons progressively increasing and aligning their covariance to that of the target pattern. Motor cortex patterns that lead to phasic dopaminergic VTA activity are progressively reinforced and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong>d, suggesting a mechanism by which animals select and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong> actions to reliably achieve reinforcement.</p>

DNA sequence–directed shape change of photopatterned hydrogels via high-degree swelling
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong>-changing hydrogels that can bend, twist, or actuate in response to external stimuli are critical to soft robots, programmable matter, and smart medicine. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong> change in hydrogels has been induced by global cues, including temperature, light, or pH.

We photopattern up to centimeter-sized gels containing multiple domains that undergo different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong> changes in response to different DNA sequences. Experiments and simulations suggest a simple design rule for controlled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong> change.

Mosaic Morphology in the Thorax of <i>Australopithecus sediba</i>
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong> of the thorax of early hominins has been a point of contention for more than 30 years.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Reassessing the Roles of PIN Proteins and Anticlinal Microtubules during Pavement Cell Morphogenesis
<p>The leaf epidermis is a biomechanical shell that influences the size and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong> of the organ. Its morphogenesis is a multiscale process in which nanometer-scale cytoskeletal protein complexes, individual cells, and groups of cells pattern growth and define macroscopic leaf traits. Interdigitated growth of neighboring cells is an evolutionarily conserved developmental strategy. Understanding how signaling pathways and cytoskeletal proteins pattern cell walls during this form of tissue morphogenesis is an important research challenge. The cellular and molecular control of a lobed cell morphology is currently thought to involve PIN-FORMED (PIN)-type plasma membrane efflux carriers that generate subcellular auxin gradients. Auxin gradients were proposed to function across cell boundaries to encode stable offset patterns of cortical microtubules and actin filaments between adjacent cells. Many models suggest that long-lived microtubules along the anticlinal cell wall generate local cell wall heterogeneities that restrict local growth and specify the timing and location of lobe formation. Here, we used Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) reverse genetics and multivariate long-term time-lapse imaging to test current cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong> control models. We found that neither PIN proteins nor long-lived microtubules along the anticlinal wall predict the patterns of lobe formation. In fields of lobing cells, anticlinal microtubules are not correlated with cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong> and are unstable at the time scales of cell expansion. Our analyses indicate that anticlinal microtubules have multiple functions in pavement cells and that lobe initiation is likely controlled by complex interactions among cell geometry, cell wall stress patterns, and transient microtubule networks that span the anticlinal and periclinal walls.</p>

Geometric Morphometric Character Suites as Phylogenetic Data: Extracting Phylogenetic Signal from Gastropod Shells
<p>Despite being the objects of numerous macroevolutionary studies, many of the best represented constituents of the fossil record—including diverse examples such as foraminifera, brachiopods, and mollusks—have mineralized skeletons with limited discrete characteristics, making morphological phylogenies difficult to construct. In contrast to their paucity of phylogenetic characters, the mineralized structures (tests and shells) of these fossil groups frequently have distinctive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong>s that have long proved useful for their classification. The recent introduction of methodologies for including continuous data directly in a phylogenetic analysis has increased the number of available characters, making it possible to produce phylogenies based, in whole or part, on continuous character data collected from such taxa. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geometri</span></strong>c morphometric methods provide tools for accurately characterizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong> variation and can produce quantitative data that can therefore now be included in a phylogenetic matrix in a nonarbitrary manner. Here, the marine gastropod genus <i>Conus</i> is used to evaluate the ability of continuous characters—generated from a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geometri</span></strong>c morphometric analysis of shell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong>—to contribute to a total evidence phylogenetic hypothesis constructed using molecular and morphological data. Furthermore, the ability of continuous characters derived from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geometri</span></strong>c morphometric analyses to place fossil taxa with limited discrete characters into a phylogeny with their extant relatives was tested by simulating the inclusion of fossil taxa. This was done by removing the molecular partition of individual extant species to produce a “cladistic pseudofossil” with only the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geometri</span></strong>c morphometric derived characters coded. The phylogenetic position of each cladistic pseudofossil taxon was then compared with its placement in the total evidence tree and a symmetric resampling tree to evaluate the degree to which morphometric characters alone can correctly place simulated fossil species. In 33–45% of the test cases (depending upon the approach used for measuring success), it was possible to place the pseudofossil taxon into the correct regions of the phylogeny using only the morphometric characters. This suggests that the incorporation of extinct <i>Conus</i> taxa into phylogenetic hypotheses will be possible, permitting a wide range of macroevolutionary questions to be addressed within this genus. This methodology also has potential to contribute to phylogenetic reconstructions for other major components of the fossil record that lack numerous discrete characters.

Hayabusa2 arrives at the carbonaceous asteroid 162173 Ryugu—A spinning top–shaped rubble pile

Quantum reference beacon–guided superresolution optical focusing in complex media
<p>Optical scattering is generally considered to be a nuisance of microscopy that limits imaging depth and spatial resolution. Wavefront shaping techniques enable optical imaging at unprecedented depth, but attaining superresolution within complex media remains a challenge. We used a quantum reference beacon (QRB), consisting of solid-state quantum emitters with spin-dependent fluorescence, to provide subwavelength guidestar feedback for wavefront shaping to achieve a superresolution optical focus. We implemented the QRB-guided imaging with nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond nanocrystals, which enable optical focusing with a subdiffraction resolution below 186 nanometers (less than half the wavelength). QRB-assisted wavefront-shaping should find use in a range of applications, including deep-tissue quantum enhanced sensing and individual optical excitation of magnetically coupled spin ensembles for applications in quantum information processing.</p>

Nonreciprocal lasing in topological cavities of arbitrary geometries
<p>Resonant cavities are essential building blocks governing many wave-based phenomena, but their geometry and reciprocity fundamentally limit the integration of optical devices. We report, at telecommunication wavelengths, geometry-independent and integrated nonreciprocal topological cavities that couple stimulated emission from one-way photonic edge states to a selected waveguide output with an isolation ratio in excess of 10 decibels. Nonreciprocity originates from unidirectional edge states at the boundary between photonic structures with distinct topological invariants. Our experimental demonstration of lasing from topological cavities provides the opportunity to develop complex topological circuitry of arbitrary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geometri</span></strong>es for the integrated and robust generation and transport of photons in classical and quantum regimes.</p>

Stretchable surfaces with programmable 3D texture morphing for synthetic camouflaging skins
<p>Technologies that use stretchable materials are increasingly important, yet we are unable to control how they stretch with much more sophistication than inflating balloons. Nature, however, demonstrates remarkable control of stretchable surfaces; for example, cephalopods can project hierarchical structures from their skin in milliseconds for a wide range of textural camouflage. Inspired by cephalopod muscular morphology, we developed synthetic tissue groupings that allowed programmable transformation of two-dimensional (2D) stretchable surfaces into target 3D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong>s. The synthetic tissue groupings consisted of elastomeric membranes embedded with inextensible textile mesh that inflated to within 10% of their target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong>s by using a simple fabrication method and modeling approach.

The Microtubule-Associated Protein IQ67 DOMAIN5 Modulates Microtubule Dynamics and Pavement Cell Shape
<p>The dynamic arrangement of cortical microtubules (MTs) plays a pivotal role in controlling cell growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong> formation in plants, but the mechanisms by which cortical MTs are organized to regulate these processes are not well characterized. In particular, the dynamic behavior of cortical MTs is critical for their spatial organization, yet the molecular mechanisms controlling MT dynamics remain poorly understood. In this study, we used the puzzle piece-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong>d pavement cells of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves as a model system in which to study cortical MT organization. We isolated an ethyl methanesulfonate mutant with reduced interdigitation of pavement cells in cotyledons. This line carried a mutation in <i>IQ67 DOMAIN5</i> (<i>IQD5</i>), which encodes a member of the plant-specific IQ motif protein family. Live-cell imaging and biochemical analyses demonstrated that IQD5 binds to MTs and promotes MT assembly. MT-depolymerizing drug treatment and in vivo MT dynamics assays suggested that IQD5 functions to stabilize MTs. Hence, our findings provide genetic, cell biological, and biochemical evidence that IQD5 regulates MT dynamics that affect MT organization and subsequent cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong> formation.</p>

Root Tip Shape Governs Root Elongation Rate under Increased Soil Strength
<p>Increased soil strength due to soil compaction or soil drying is a major limitation to root growth and crop productivity. Roots need to exert higher penetration force, resulting in increased penetration stress when elongating in soils of greater strength. This study aimed to quantify how the genotypic diversity of root tip geometry and root diameter influences root elongation under different levels of soil strength and to determine the extent to which roots adjust to increased soil strength. Fourteen wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) varieties were grown in soil columns packed to three bulk densities representing low, moderate, and high soil strength. Under moderate and high soil strength, smaller root tip radius-to-length ratio was correlated with higher genotypic root elongation rate, whereas root diameter was not related to genotypic root elongation. Based on cavity expansion theory, it was found that smaller root tip radius-to-length ratio reduced penetration stress, thus enabling higher root elongation rates in soils with greater strength. Furthermore, it was observed that roots could only partially adjust to increased soil strength. Root thickening was bounded by a maximum diameter, and root tips did not become more acute in response to increased soil strength. The obtained results demonstrated that root tip geometry is a pivotal trait governing root penetration stress and root elongation rate in soils of greater strength. Hence, root tip <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong> needs to be taken into account when selecting for crop varieties that may tolerate high soil strength.</p>

The IQD Family of Calmodulin-Binding Proteins Links Calcium Signaling to Microtubules, Membrane Subdomains, and the Nucleus
<p>Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) signaling and dynamic reorganization of the cytoskeleton are essential processes for the coordination and control of plant cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong> and cell growth. Calmodulin (CaM) and closely related calmodulin-like (CML) polypeptides are principal sensors of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. CaM/CMLs decode and relay information encrypted by the second messenger via differential interactions with a wide spectrum of targets to modulate their diverse biochemical activities. The plant-specific IQ67 DOMAIN (IQD) family emerged as possibly the largest class of CaM-interacting proteins with undefined molecular functions and biological roles. Here, we show that the 33 members of the IQD family in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) differentially localize, using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged proteins, to multiple and distinct subcellular sites, including microtubule (MT) arrays, plasma membrane subdomains, and nuclear compartments. Intriguingly, the various IQD-specific localization patterns coincide with the subcellular patterns of IQD-dependent recruitment of CaM, suggesting that the diverse IQD members sequester Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM signaling modules to specific subcellular sites for precise regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent processes. Because MT localization is a hallmark of most IQD family members, we quantitatively analyzed GFP-labeled MT arrays in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> cells transiently expressing GFP-IQD fusions and observed IQD-specific MT patterns, which point to a role of IQDs in MT organization and dynamics. Indeed, stable overexpression of select IQD proteins in Arabidopsis altered cellular MT orientation, cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong>, and organ morphology. Because IQDs share biochemical properties with scaffold proteins, we propose that IQD families provide an assortment of platform proteins for integrating CaM-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling at multiple cellular sites to regulate cell function, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong>, and growth.</p>

Intertidal sea stars (<i>Pisaster ochraceus</i>) alter body shape in response to wave action
<p>Sea stars are some of the largest mobile animals able to live in the harsh flow environment of wave-exposed, rocky intertidal shores. In addition, some species, such as the northeastern Pacific <i>Pisaster ochraceus</i>, are ecologically significant predators in a broad range of environments, from sheltered lagoons to the most wave-exposed shorelines. How they function and survive under such an extreme range of wave exposures remains a puzzle. Here we examine the ability of <i>P. ochraceus</i> to alter body form in response to variation in flow conditions. We found that sea stars in wave-exposed sites had narrower arms and were lighter per unit arm length than those from sheltered sites. Body form was tightly correlated with maximum velocity of breaking waves across four sites and also varied over time. In addition, field transplant experiments showed that these differences in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong> were due primarily to phenotypic plasticity. Sea stars transplanted from a sheltered site to a more wave-exposed site became lighter per unit arm length, and developed narrower arms, after 3 months. The tight correlation between water flow and morphology suggests that wave force must be a significant selective factor acting on body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong>. On exposed shores, narrower arms probably reduce both lift and drag in breaking waves. On protected shores, fatter arms may provide more thermal inertia to resist overheating, or more body volume for gametes. Such plastic changes in body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong> represent a unique method by which sea stars adapt to spatial, seasonal and possibly short-term variation in flow conditions.</p>

Dynamic clonal analysis based on chronic <i>in vivo</i> imaging allows multiscale quantification of growth in the <i>Drosophila</i> wing disc
<p>In the course of morphogenesis, tissues change <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong> and grow. How this is orchestrated is largely unknown, partly owing to the lack of experimental methods to visualize and quantify growth. Here, we describe a novel experimental approach to investigate the growth of tissues <i>in vivo</i> on a time-scale of days, as employed to study the <i>Drosophila</i> larval imaginal wing disc, the precursor of the adult wing. We developed a protocol to image wing discs at regular intervals in living anesthetized larvae so as to follow the growth of the tissue over extended periods of time. This approach can be used to image cells at high resolution <i>in vivo</i>. At intermediate scale, we tracked the increase in cell number within clones as well as the changes in clone area and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong>. At scales extending to the tissue level, clones can be used as landmarks for measuring strain, as a proxy for growth. We developed general computational tools to extract strain maps from clonal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong>s and landmark displacements in individual tissues, and to combine multiple datasets into a mean strain. In the disc, we use these to compare properties of growth at the scale of clones (a few cells) and at larger regional scales.</p>

We demonstrate how dielectric metasurfaces can be leveraged to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong> the temporal profile of a near-infrared femtosecond pulse. Finely tailored pulse-shaping operations, including splitting, compression, chirping, and higher-order distortion, are achieved using a Fourier-transform setup embedding metasurfaces able to manipulate, simultaneously and independently, the amplitude and phase of the constituent frequency components of the pulse. Exploiting metasurfaces to manipulate the temporal characteristics of light expands their impact and opens new vistas in the field of ultrafast science and technology.</p>

Structures and operating principles of the replisome
<p>Visualization in atomic detail of the replisome that performs concerted leading– and lagging–DNA strand synthesis at a replication fork has not been reported. Using bacteriophage T7 as a model system, we determined cryo–electron microscopy structures up to 3.2-angstroms resolution of helicase translocating along DNA and of helicase-polymerase-primase complexes engaging in synthesis of both DNA strands. Each domain of the spiral-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong>d hexameric helicase translocates sequentially hand-over-hand along a single-stranded DNA coil, akin to the way AAA+ ATPases (adenosine triphosphatases) unfold peptides. Two lagging-strand polymerases are attached to the primase, ready for Okazaki fragment synthesis in tandem. A β hairpin from the leading-strand polymerase separates two parental DNA strands into a T-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong>d fork, thus enabling the closely coupled helicase to advance perpendicular to the downstream DNA duplex. These structures reveal the molecular organization and operating principles of a replisome.</p>

3D nanofabrication by volumetric deposition and controlled shrinkage of patterned scaffolds
<p>Lithographic nanofabrication is often limited to successive fabrication of two-dimensional (2D) layers. We present a strategy for the direct assembly of 3D nanomaterials consisting of metals, semiconductors, and biomolecules arranged in virtually any 3D geometry. We used hydrogels as scaffolds for volumetric deposition of materials at defined points in space. We then optically patterned these scaffolds in three dimensions, attached one or more functional materials, and then shrank and dehydrated them in a controlled way to achieve nanoscale feature sizes in a solid substrate. We demonstrate that our process, Implosion Fabrication (ImpFab), can directly write highly conductive, 3D silver nanostructures within an acrylic scaffold via volumetric silver deposition. Using ImpFab, we achieve resolutions in the tens of nanometers and complex, non–self-supporting 3D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geometri</span></strong>es of interest for optical metamaterials.</p>

Structural insight into precursor tRNA processing by yeast ribonuclease P
<p>Ribonuclease P (RNase P) is a universal ribozyme responsible for processing the 5′-leader of pre–transfer RNA (pre-tRNA). Here, we report the 3.5-angstrom cryo–electron microscopy structures of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> RNase P alone and in complex with pre-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup>. The protein components form a hook-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong>d architecture that wraps around the RNA and stabilizes RNase P into a “measuring device” with two fixed anchors that recognize the L-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong>d pre-tRNA. A universally conserved uridine nucleobase and phosphate backbone in the catalytic center together with the scissile phosphate and the O3′ leaving group of pre-tRNA jointly coordinate two catalytic magnesium ions. Binding of pre-tRNA induces a conformational change in the catalytic center that is required for catalysis. Moreover, simulation analysis suggests a two-metal-ion S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction pathway of pre-tRNA cleavage. These results not only reveal the architecture of yeast RNase P but also provide a molecular basis of how the 5′-leader of pre-tRNA is processed by eukaryotic RNase P.</p>

Slab2, a comprehensive subduction zone geometry model
<p>Subduction zones are home to the most seismically active faults on the planet. The shallow megathrust interfaces of subduction zones host Earth’s largest earthquakes and are likely the only faults capable of magnitude 9+ ruptures. Despite these facts, our knowledge of subduction zone geometry—which likely plays a key role in determining the spatial extent and ultimately the size of subduction zone earthquakes—is incomplete. We calculated the three-dimensional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geometri</span></strong>es of all seismically active global subduction zones.

Nanofluidic rocking Brownian motors
<p>Control and transport of nanoscale objects in fluids is challenging because of the unfavorable scaling of most interaction mechanisms to small length scales. We designed energy landscapes for nanoparticles by accurately shaping the geometry of a nanofluidic slit and exploiting the electrostatic interaction between like-charged particles and walls. Directed transport was performed by combining asymmetric potentials with an oscillating electric field to achieve a rocking Brownian motor. Using gold spheres 60 nanometers in diameter, we investigated the physics of the motor with high spatiotemporal resolution, enabling a parameter-free comparison with theory. We fabricated a sorting device that separates 60- and 100-nanometer particles in opposing directions within seconds. Modeling suggests that the device separates particles with a radial difference of 1 nanometer.</p>

Wrapping with a splash: High-speed encapsulation with ultrathin sheets
<p>Many complex fluids rely on surfactants to contain, protect, or isolate liquid drops in an immiscible continuous phase. Thin elastic sheets can wrap liquid drops in a spontaneous process driven by capillary forces. For encapsulation by sheets to be practically viable, a rapid, continuous, and scalable process is essential. We exploit the fast dynamics of droplet impact to achieve wrapping of oil droplets by ultrathin polymer films in a water phase. Despite the violence of splashing events, the process robustly yields wrappings that are optimally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong>d to maximize the enclosed fluid volume and have near-perfect seams. We achieve wrappings of targeted three-dimensional (3D) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong>s by tailoring the 2D boundary of the films and show the generality of the technique by producing both oil-in-water and water-in-oil wrappings.</p>

Large-amplitude transfer motion of hydrated excess protons mapped by ultrafast 2D IR spectroscopy
<p>Solvation and transport of excess protons in aqueous systems play a fundamental role in acid-base chemistry and biochemical processes. We mapped ultrafast proton excursions along the proton transfer coordinate by means of two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy, both in bulk water and in a Zundel cation (H<sub>5</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)<sup>+</sup> motif selectively prepared in acetonitrile. Electric fields from the environment and stochastic hydrogen bond motions induce fluctuations of the proton double-minimum potential. Within the lifetime of a particular hydration geometry, the proton explores a multitude of positions on a sub-100-femtosecond time scale. The proton transfer vibration is strongly damped by its 20- to 40-femtosecond population decay. Our results suggest a central role of Zundel-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geometri</span></strong>es in aqueous proton solvation and transport.</p>

The structure and flexibility of conical HIV-1 capsids determined within intact virions
<p>HIV-1 contains a cone-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong>d capsid encasing the viral genome. This capsid is thought to follow fullerene geometry—a curved hexameric lattice of the capsid protein, CA, closed by incorporating 12 CA pentamers. Current models for core structure are based on crystallography of hexameric and cross-linked pentameric CA, electron microscopy of tubular CA arrays, and simulations. Here, we report subnanometer-resolution cryo–electron tomography structures of hexameric and pentameric CA within intact HIV-1 particles. Whereas the hexamer structure is compatible with crystallography studies, the pentamer forms using different interfaces. Determining multiple structures revealed how CA flexes to form the variably curved core shell. We show that HIV-1 CA assembles both aberrant and perfect fullerene cones, supporting models in which conical cores assemble de novo after maturation.</p>

Digital Imaging Combined with Genome-Wide Association Mapping Links Loci to Plant-Pathogen Interaction Traits
<p>Plant resistance to generalist pathogens with broad host ranges, such as <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> (<i>Botrytis</i>), is typically quantitative and highly polygenic. Recent studies have begun to elucidate the molecular genetic basis of plant-pathogen interactions using commonly measured traits, including lesion size and/or pathogen biomass. However, with the advent of digital imaging and high-throughput phenomics, there are a large number of additional traits available to study quantitative resistance. In this study, we used high-throughput digital imaging analysis to investigate previously poorly characterized visual traits of plant-pathogen interactions related to disease resistance using the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>)/<i>Botrytis</i> pathosystem. From a large collection of visual lesion trait measurements, we focused on color, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong>, and size to test how these aspects of the Arabidopsis/<i>Botrytis</i> interaction are genetically related. Through genome-wide association mapping in Arabidopsis, we show that lesion color and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong> are genetically separable traits associated with plant disease resistance. Moreover, by employing defined mutants in 23 candidate genes identified from the genome-wide association mapping, we demonstrate links between loci and each of the different plant-pathogen interaction traits. These results expand our understanding of the functional mechanisms driving plant disease resistance.</p>

Genetic Architecture and Molecular Networks Underlying Leaf Thickness in Desert-Adapted Tomato <i>Solanum pennellii</i>
<p>Thicker leaves allow plants to grow in water-limited conditions. However, our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of this highly functional leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong> trait is poor. We used a custom-built confocal profilometer to directly measure leaf thickness in a set of introgression lines (ILs) derived from the desert tomato <i>Solanum pennellii</i> and identified quantitative trait loci. We report evidence of a complex genetic architecture of this trait and roles for both genetic and environmental factors. Several ILs with thick leaves have dramatically elongated palisade mesophyll cells and, in some cases, increased leaf ploidy. We characterized the thick IL2-5 and IL4-3 in detail and found increased mesophyll cell size and leaf ploidy levels, suggesting that endoreduplication underpins leaf thickness in tomato. Next, we queried the transcriptomes and inferred dynamic Bayesian networks of gene expression across early leaf ontogeny in these lines to compare the molecular networks that pattern leaf thickness. We show that thick ILs share <i>S. pennellii</i>-like expression profiles for putative regulators of cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong> and meristem determinacy as well as a general signature of cell cycle-related gene expression. However, our network data suggest that leaf thickness in these two lines is patterned at least partially by distinct mechanisms. Consistent with this hypothesis, double homozygote lines combining introgression segments from these two ILs show additive phenotypes, including thick leaves, higher ploidy levels, and larger palisade mesophyll cells. Collectively, these data establish a framework of genetic, anatomical, and molecular mechanisms that pattern leaf thickness in desert-adapted tomato.</p>

Gibberellins Regulate Ovule Integument Development by Interfering with the Transcription Factor ATS
<p>Gibberellins (GAs) are plant hormones that regulate most plant life cycle aspects, including flowering and fruit development. Here, we demonstrate the implication of GAs in ovule development. DELLA proteins, negative GA response regulators, act as positive factors for ovule integument development in a mechanism that involves transcription factor ABERRANT TESTA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong> (ATS). The seeds of the <i>della global</i> mutant, a complete loss-of-function of DELLA, and the <i>ats-1</i> mutant are remarkably similar, with a round <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong>, a disorganized testa, and viviparism. These defects are the result of an alteration in integuments that fail to fully develop and are shorter than in wild-type plants. <i>ats-1</i> also shows some GA-related phenotypes, for example, higher germination rates and early flowering. In fact, <i>ats-1</i> has elevated GA levels due to the activation of GA biosynthesis genes, which indicates that ATS inhibits GA biosynthesis. Moreover, DELLAs and ATS proteins interact, which suggests the formation of a transcriptional complex that regulates the expression of genes involved in integument growth. Therefore, the repression of GA biosynthesis by ATS would result in the stabilization of DELLAs to ensure correct ATS-DELLA complex formation. The requirement of both activities to coordinate proper ovule development strongly argues that the ATS-DELLA complex acts as a key molecular factor. This work provides the first evidence for a role of GAs in ovule and seed development.</p>

The Genotype–Phenotype Map of Yeast Complex Traits: Basic Parameters and the Role of Natural Selection
<p>Most phenotypic traits are controlled by many genes, but a global picture of the genotype–phenotype map (GPM) is lacking. For example, in no species do we know generally how many genes affect a trait and how large these effects are. It is also unclear to what extent GPMs are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong>d by natural selection. Here we address these fundamental questions using the reverse genetic data of 220 morphological traits in 4,718 budding yeast strains, each of which lacks a nonessential gene. We show that 1) the proportion of genes affecting a trait varies from <1% to >30%, averaging 6%, 2) most traits are impacted by many more small-effect genes than large-effect genes, and 3) the mean effect of all nonessential genes on a trait decreases precipitously as the estimated importance of the trait to fitness increases. An analysis of 3,116 yeast gene expression traits in 754 gene-deletion strains reveals a similar pattern. These findings illustrate the power of genome-wide reverse genetics in genotype–phenotype mapping, uncover an enormous range of genetic complexity of phenotypic traits, and suggest that the GPM of cellular organisms has been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong>d by natural selection for mutational robustness.</p>

Load-induced changes in bone stiffness and cancellous and cortical bone mass following tibial compression diminish with age in female mice
<p>The vertebrate skeleton is an adaptive structure that responds to mechanical stimuli by increasing bone mass under increased mechanical loads. Although experimental animal models have shown the anabolic cortical bone response to applied load decreases with age, no consensus exists regarding whether this adaptive mechanism is affected by age in cancellous bone, the tissue most impacted by age-related bone loss. We used an established murine <i>in vivo</i> tibial loading model to characterize the load-induced cancellous, cortical and whole-bone responses to mechanical stimuli in growing and mature female mice at 6, 10 and 16 weeks of age. The effects of applied load on tibial morphology and stiffness were determined using microcomputed tomography and <i>in vivo</i> bone strains measured at the medial tibial midshaft during applied loading. At all ages, 2 weeks of applied load produced larger midshaft cortical cross-sectional properties (+13–72%) and greater cancellous bone volume (+21–107%) and thicker trabeculae (+31–68%) in the proximal metaphyses of the loaded tibiae. The relative anabolic response decreased from 6 to 16 weeks of age in both the cancellous and cortical envelopes. Load-induced tibial stresses decreased more in 6-week-old mice following loading, which corresponded to increased <i>in vivo</i> tibial stiffness. Stiffness in the loaded tibiae of 16-week-old mice decreased despite moderately increased cortical cross-sectional geometry, suggesting load-induced changes in bone material properties. This study shows that the cancellous and cortical anabolic responses to mechanical stimuli decline with age into adulthood and that cortical cross-sectional geometry alone does not necessarily predict whole-bone functional stiffness.</p>

The functional role of caudal and anal/dorsal fins during the C-start of a bluegill sunfish
<p>Fast starts are crucial in the survival of aquatic swimmers to capture prey or avoid predators. Currently, it is widely accepted that during C-starts: (1) the caudal fin generates a considerable hydrodynamic force; and (2) anal/dorsal fins are erected to significantly increase the hydrodynamic force. In this work, the above hypotheses on the role of fins during C-starts are studied using experimentally guided numerical simulations of four bluegill sunfish, whose fins are removed or erected. The amount of force created by the body and fins at each time instant was not constant and varied during the C-start. Nevertheless, in agreement with hypothesis (1), up to 70% of the instantaneous hydrodynamic force was generated by the tail during Stage 2 of the C-start, when the sunfish rapidly bends out of the C-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong>. Additionally, the contribution in Stage 1, when the sunfish bends into a C-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong>, is less than 20% at each instant. Most of the force in Stage 1 was produced by the body of the sunfish. In contrast to hypothesis (2), the effect of erection/removal of the fins was less than 5% of the instantaneous force in both Stages 1 and 2, except for a short period of time (2 ms) just before Stage 2. However, it is known that the anal/dorsal fins are actively controlled during the C-start from muscle activity measurements. Based on the results presented here, it is suggested that the active control of the anal/dorsal fins can be related to retaining the stability of the sunfish against roll and pitch movements during the C-start. Furthermore, the erection of the fins increases the moment of inertia to make the roll and pitch movements more difficult.</p>

Patients on anticoagulation were excluded. SAPIEN 3 and CoreValve/Evolut R patients with and without hypoattenuated leaflet thickening were included to study differences between groups. Patients were classified as having THV thrombosis if there was any evidence of hypoattenuated leaflet thickening. Anatomic and THV deployment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geometri</span></strong>es were analyzed, and thrombus volumes were computed through manual 3-dimensional reconstruction. We aimed to identify and evaluate risk factors that contribute to THV thrombosis through the combination of retrospective clinical data analysis and in vitro imaging in the space between the native and THV leaflets (neosinus).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>SAPIEN 3 valves with leaflet thrombosis were on average 10% further expanded (by diameter) than those without (95.5±5.2% versus 85.4±3.9%; <i>P</i><0.001). However, this relationship was not evident with the CoreValve/Evolut R. In CoreValve/Evolut Rs with thrombosis, the thrombus volume increased linearly with implant depth (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>=0.7, <i>P</i><0.001). This finding was not seen in the SAPIEN 3. The in vitro analysis showed that a supraannular THV deployment resulted in a nearly 7-fold decrease in stagnation zone size (velocities <0.1 m/s) when compared with an intraannular deployment. In addition, the in vitro model indicated that the size of the stagnation zone increased as cardiac output decreased.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Although transcatheter aortic valve replacement thrombosis is a multifactorial process involving foreign materials, patient-specific blood chemistry, and complex flow patterns, our study indicates that deployed THV geometry may have implications on the occurrence of thrombosis. In addition, a supraannular neosinus may reduce thrombosis risk because of reduced flow stasis. Although additional prospective studies are needed to further develop strategies for minimizing thrombus burden, these results may help identify patients at higher thrombosis risk and aid in the development of next-generation devices with reduced thrombosis risk.</p></sec>

A parallel systematic review and meta-analysis (MEDLINE, Embase, SCOPUS, Cochrane Library) through June 2015 were also accomplished. Exposure of interest was body mass index categorized into 6 groups according to the World Health Organization classification.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 401 227 adult patients in the cohort study and 557 720 patients in the systematic review were included. A U-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong>d association between mortality and body mass index classes was observed in both studies, with lower mortality in overweight (adjusted odds ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.76–0.83) and obese class I and II (odds ratio, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.76–0.86; and odds ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.74–0.94) patients relative to normal-weight patients and increased mortality in underweight individuals (odds ratio, 1.51; 95% confidence interval, 1.41–1.62). In the cohort study, a U-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong>d relationship was observed for stroke and low cardiac output syndrome but not for renal replacement therapy or deep sternal wound infection. Counter to the reverse epidemiology hypotheses, the protective effects of obesity were less in patients with severe chronic renal, lung, or cardiac disease and greater in older patients and in those with complications of obesity, including the metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis. Adjustments for important confounders did not alter our results.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Obesity is associated with lower risks after cardiac surgery, with consistent effects noted in multiple analyses attempting to address residual confounding and reverse causation.</p></sec>

Aging and its modulation in a long-lived worker caste of the honey bee
<p>Highly social animals provide alternative aging models in which vastly different lifespan patterns are flexible, and linked to social caste. Research in these species aims to reveal how environment, including social cues, can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong> the transition between short-lived and extremely long-lived phenotypes with negligible senescence. Among honey bee workers, short to intermediate lifespans are typical for summer castes, while the winter caste can live up to 10 times longer. For summer castes, experimental interventions could predictably accelerate, slow or revert functional senescence. In contrast, little is known about the partic ular conditions under which periods of negligible senescence in winter castes can be disrupted or sustained. We asked how manipulation of social environment in colonies with long-lived winter bees might alter the pace of functional senescence, measured as learning performance, as well as of cellular senescence, measured as lipofuscin accumulation. We show that behavioral senescence becomes rapidly detectable when the winter state is disrupted, and changes in social task behaviors and social environment (brood) are induced. Likewise, we found that cellular senescence was induced by such social intervention. However, cellular senescence showed marked regional differences, suggesting that particular brain regions age slower than others. Finally, by preventing post-winter colonies from brood rearing, behavioral senescence became undetectable, even after transition to the usually short-lived phenotypes had occurred. We envision that social regulation of negligible functional senescence and highly dynamic accumulation of a universal symptom of cellular aging (lipofuscin) offers rewarding perspectives to target proximate mechanisms of slowed aging.</p>

Flexible strategies for flight control: an active role for the abdomen
<p>Moving animals orchestrate myriad motor systems in response to multimodal sensory inputs. Coordinating movement is particularly challenging in flight control, where animals deal with potential instability and multiple degrees of freedom of movement. Prior studies have focused on wings as the primary flight control structures, for which changes in angle of attack or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong> are used to modulate lift and drag forces. However, other actuators that may impact flight performance are reflexively activated during flight. We investigated the visual–abdominal reflex displayed by the hawkmoth <i>Manduca sexta</i> to determine its role in flight control. We measured the open-loop stimulus–response characteristics (measured as a transfer function) between the visual stimulus and abdominal response in tethered moths. The transfer function reveals a 41 ms delay and a high-pass filter behavior with a pass band starting at ~0.5 Hz. We also developed a simplified mathematical model of hovering flight wherein articulation of the thoracic–abdominal joint redirects an average lift force provided by the wings. We show that control of the joint, subject to a high-pass filter, is sufficient to maintain stable hovering, but with a slim stability margin. Our experiments and models suggest a novel mechanism by which articulation of the body or ‘airframe’ of an animal can be used to redirect lift forces for effective flight control. Furthermore, the small stability margin may increase flight agility by easing the transition from stable flight to a more maneuverable, unstable regime.</p>

External rotation of the femoral component increases asymmetry of the posterior condyles
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The morphometry of the distal femur was largely studied to improve   bone-implant fit in total knee arthroplasty (TKA), but little is   known about the asymmetry of the posterior condyles. This study   aimed to investigate the dimensions of the posterior condyles and   the influence of externally rotating the femoral component on potential prosthetic   overhang or under-coverage.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We analysed the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong> of 110 arthritic knees at the time of primary   TKA using pre-operative CT scans. The height and width of each condyle   were measured at the posterior femoral cut in neutral position,   and in 3º and 5º of external rotation, using both central and medial   referencing systems. We compared the morphological characteristics   with those of 14 TKA models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In the neutral position, the dimensions of the condyles were   nearly equal. Externally rotating the femoral cut by 3º and 5º with   ‘central referencing’ induced width asymmetry > 3 mm in 23 (21%)   and 33 (30%) knees respectively, while with ‘medial referencing’   it induced width asymmetry > 3 mm in 43 (39%) and 75 (68%) knees   respectively. The asymmetries induced by rotations were not associated   with gender, aetiology or varus-valgus alignment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>External rotation may amplify the asymmetry between the medial   and lateral condyles, and exacerbate prosthetic overhang, particularly   in the superolateral zone. ‘Central referencing’ guides result in   less potential prosthetic overhang than ‘medial referencing’ guides.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:894–903</p></sec>

Periprosthetic femoral fractures and trying to avoid them
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Periprosthetic femoral fractures (PFF) following total hip arthroplasty   (THA) are devastating complications that are associated with functional   limitations and increased overall mortality. Although cementless   implants have been associated with an increased risk of PFF, the   precise contribution of implant geometry and design on the risk   of both intra-operative and post-operative PFF remains poorly investigated.   A systematic review was performed to aggregate all of the PFF literature   with specific attention to the femoral implant used.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A systematic search strategy of several journal databases and   recent proceedings from the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons   was performed. Clinical articles were included for analysis if sufficient   implant description was provided. All articles were reviewed by   two reviewers. A review of fundamental investigations of implant   load-to-failure was performed, with the intent of identifying similar   conclusions from the clinical and fundamental literature.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In total 596 articles were initially identified, with 34 being   eligible for analysis. Aggregate analysis of 1691 PFFs in 342 719   primary THAs revealed a significantly higher number of PFFs with   cementless femoral implants (p < 0.001). Single-wedge and double-wedge   (fit-and-fill) femoral implants were associated with a threefold   increase in PFF rates (p < 0.001) compared with anatomical, fully   coated and tapered/rounded stems. Within cemented stems, loaded-taper   (Exeter) stems were associated with more PFFs than composite-beam   (Charnley) stems (p = 0.004). Review of the fundamental literature   revealed very few studies comparing cementless component designs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Very few studies within the PFF literature provide detailed implant   information. Cementless implants, specifically those of single-wedge   and double-wedge, have the highest PFF rates in the literature,   with most investigations recommending against their use in older   patients with osteoporotic bone. This review illustrates the need   for registries and future PFF studies to record implant name and   information for future analysis. Furthermore, future biomechanical   investigations comparing modern implants are needed to clarify the   precise contribution of implant design to PFF risk.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B(1 Supple   A):50–9.</p></sec>

Instability of the hip after anatomical  re-alignment in patients with a slipped capital femoral epiphysis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Several studies have reported the safety and efficacy of subcapital   re-alignment for patients with slipped capital femoral epiphysis   (SCFE) using surgical dislocation of the hip and an extended retinacular   flap. Instability of the hip and dislocation as a consequence of   this surgery has only recently gained attention. We discuss this   problem with some illustrative cases.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We explored the literature on the possible pathophysiological   causes and surgical steps associated with the risk of post-operative   instability and articular damage. In addition, we describe supplementary   steps that could be used to avoid these problems.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The causes of instability may be divided into three main groups:   the first includes causes directly related to SCFE (acetabular labral   damage, severe abrasion of the acetabular cartilage, flattening   of the acetabular roof and a bell-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">shape</span></strong>d deformity of the epiphysis);   the second, causes not related to the SCFE (acetabular orientation   and poor quality of the soft tissues); the third, causes directly   related to the surgery (capsulotomy, division of the ligamentum teres,   shortening of the femoral neck, pelvi-trochanteric impingement,   previous proximal femoral osteotomy and post-operative positioning   of the leg).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We present examples drawn from our clinical practice, as well   as possible ways of reducing the risks of these complications, and   of correcting them if they happen.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:16–21.</p></sec>

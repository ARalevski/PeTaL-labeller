Female Sex Is a Risk Modifier Rather Than a Risk Factor for Stroke in Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Stroke risk in atrial fibrillation is assessed by using the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score. Sex category (Sc, ie, female sex) confers 1 point on CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc. We hypothesized that female sex is a stroke risk modifier, rather than an overall risk factor, when added to a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA (sex-independent thromboembolism risk) score scale.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using 3 nationwide registries, we identified patients with incident nonvalvular atrial fibrillation from January 1, 1997, through December 31, 2015. Patients receiving oral anticoagulant treatment at baseline were excluded, and person-time was censored at the time of treatment initiation (if any). CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA scores were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcul</span></strong></span></strong>ated for men and women, and were followed for up to 1 year in the Danish National Patient Registry. The primary outcome was a primary hospital code for ischemic stroke or systemic embolism (thromboembolism). We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcul</span></strong></span></strong>ated crude event rates for risk strata as events per 100 person-years. For quantifying absolute risk of stroke, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcul</span></strong></span></strong>ated risks based on the pseudovalue method. Female sex as a prognostic factor was investigated by inclusion as an interaction term on the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA score to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcul</span></strong></span></strong>ate the thromboembolic risk ratio for different score points.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 239 671 patients with atrial fibrillation (48.7% women) contributed to the analyses. The mean ages for women and men were 76.6 years and 70.3 years, respectively; the mean CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA scores were 2.7 for women and 2.3 for men. The overall 1-year thromboembolic rate per 100 person-years for women was 7.3 and 5.7 for men. The 1-year absolute risk of thromboembolism was 0.5% among men and women with a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA score of 0 and increased up to >7% among very comorbid patients (score >5). The risk ratio (male as reference) across points >1 indicated that women exhibit a higher stroke risk. The interaction was statistically significant (<i>P</i><0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Female sex is a risk modifier for stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Initial decisions on oral anticoagulant treatment could be guided by a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA score (ie, excluding the sex category criterion), but the Sc risk component modifies and accentuates stroke risk in women who would have been eligible for oral anticoagulant treatment on the basis of ≥2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional stroke risk factors.</p></sec>

Heart rate as a predictor of metabolic rate in heterothermic bats
<p>While heart rate (<i>f</i><sub>H</sub>) has been used as an indicator of energy expenditure, quantitative data showing the relationship between these variables are only available for normothermic animals. To determine whether <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> also predicts oxygen con<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sum</span></strong>ption ([Formula]) during torpor, we simultaneously measured [Formula], <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> and subcutaneous body temperature (<i>T</i><sub>sub</sub>) of a hibernator, Gould's long-eared bats (<i>Nyctophilus gouldi</i>, 9 g, <i>N</i>=18), at ambient temperatures (<i>T</i><sub>a</sub>) between 0 and 25°C. At rest, <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> of normothermic resting bats was negatively correlated with <i>T</i><sub>a</sub>, with maximum <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> of 803 beats min<sup>−1</sup> (<i>T</i><sub>a</sub>=5°C). During torpor, the relationship between <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> and <i>T</i><sub>a</sub> was curvilinear, and at low <i>T</i><sub>sub</sub> (~6°C), <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> fell to a minimum average of 8 beats min<sup>−1</sup>. The minimum average values for both [Formula] and <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> in torpor reported here were among the lowest recorded for bats. The relationship between <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> and [Formula] was significant for both resting (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>=0.64, <i>P</i><0.001) and torpid bats (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>=0.84, <i>P</i><0.001), with no overlap between the two states. These variables were also significantly correlated (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>=0.44, <i>P</i><0.001) for entire torpor bouts. Moreover, estimates of [Formula] from <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> did not differ significantly from measured values during the different physiological states. Our study is the first to investigate the accuracy of <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> as a predictor of [Formula] during torpor and indicates the reliability of this method as a potential measure of energy expenditure in the field. Nevertheless, <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> should only be used to predict [Formula] within the range of activities for which robust correlations have been established.</p>

Using neuroscience to develop artificial intelligence
<p>When the mathematician Alan Turing posed the question “Can machines think?” in the first line of his seminal 1950 paper that ushered in the quest for artificial intelligence (AI) (<i>1</i>), the only known systems carrying out complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ations were biological nervous systems. It is not surprising, therefore, that scientists in the nascent field of AI turned to brain circuits as a source for guidance. One path that was taken since the early attempts to perform intelligent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ation by brain-like circuits (<i>2</i>), and which led recently to remarkable successes, can be described as a highly reductionist approach to model cortical circuitry. In its basic current form, known as a “deep network” (or deep net) architecture, this brain-inspired model is built from successive layers of neuron-like elements, connected by adjustable weights, called “synapses” after their biological counterparts (<i>3</i>). The application of deep nets and related methods to AI systems has been transformative. They proved superior to previously known methods in central areas of AI research, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>er vision, speech recognition and production, and playing complex games. Practical applications are already in broad use, in areas such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>er vision and speech and text translation, and large-scale efforts are under way in many other areas. Here, I discuss how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional aspects of brain circuitry could supply cues for guiding network models toward broader aspects of cognition and general AI.</p>

Mechanistic origin and prediction of enhanced ductility in magnesium alloys
<p>Pure magnesium exhibits poor ductility owing to pyramidal [Formula] dislocation transformations to immobile structures, making this lowest-density structural metal unusable for many applications where it could enhance energy efficiency. We show why magnesium can be made ductile by specific dilute solute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ions, which increase the [Formula] cross-slip and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">multipl</span></strong>ication rates to levels much faster than the deleterious [Formula] transformation, enabling both favorable texture during processing and continued plastic straining during deformation. A quantitative theory establishes the conditions for ductility as a function of alloy composition in very good agreement with experiments on many existing magnesium alloys, and the solute-enhanced cross-slip mechanism is confirmed by transmission electron microscopy observations in magnesium-yttrium. The mechanistic theory can quickly screen for alloy compositions favoring conditions for high ductility and may help in the development of high-formability magnesium alloys.</p>

An excess of massive stars in the local 30 Doradus starburst
<p>The 30 Doradus star-forming region in the Large Magellanic Cloud is a nearby analog of large star-formation events in the distant universe. We determined the recent formation history and the initial mass function (IMF) of massive stars in 30 Doradus on the basis of spectroscopic observations of 247 stars more massive than 15 solar masses ([Formula]). The main episode of massive star formation began about 8 million years (My) ago, and the star-formation rate seems to have declined in the last 1 My. The IMF is densely sampled up to 200 [Formula] and contains 32 ± 12% more stars above 30 [Formula] than predicted by a standard Salpeter IMF. In the mass range of 15 to 200 [Formula], the IMF power-law exponent is [Formula], shallower than the Salpeter value of 2.35.</p>

A neural algorithm for a fundamental computing problem
<p>Similarity search—for example, identifying similar images in a database or similar documents on the web—is a fundamental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ing problem faced by large-scale information retrieval systems. We discovered that the fruit fly olfactory circuit solves this problem with a variant of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>er science algorithm (called locality-sensitive hashing). The fly circuit assigns similar neural activity patterns to similar odors, so that behaviors learned from one odor can be applied when a similar odor is experienced. The fly algorithm, however, uses three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ational strategies that depart from traditional approaches. These strategies can be translated to improve the performance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ational similarity searches. This perspective helps illuminate the logic supporting an important sensory function and provides a conceptually new algorithm for solving a fundamental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ational problem.</p>

Partitioning of vessel resistivity in three liana species
<p>Vessels with simple perforation plates, found in the majority of angiosperms, are considered the evolutionarily most advanced conduits, least impeding the xylem sap flow. Nevertheless, when measured, their hydraulic resistivity (<i>R</i>, i.e., inverse value of hydraulic conductivity) is significantly higher than resistivity predicted using Hagen–Poiseuille equation (<i>R</i><sub>HP</sub>). In our study we aimed (i) to quantify two basic components of the total vessel resistivity – vessel lumen resistivity and end wall resistivity, and (ii) to analyze how the variable inner diameter of the vessel along its longitudinal axis affects resistivity. We measured flow rates through progressively shortened stems of hop (<i>Humulus lupulus</i> L.), grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i> L.), and clematis (<i>Clematis vitalba</i> L.) and used elastomer injection for identification of open vessels and for measurement of changing vessel inner diameters along its axis. The relative contribution of end wall resistivity to total vessel resistivity was 0.46 for hop, 0.55 for grapevine, and 0.30 for clematis. Vessel lumen resistivity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcul</span></strong></span></strong>ated from our measurements was substantially higher than theoretical resistivity – about 43% for hop, 58% for grapevine, and 52% for clematis. We identified variation in the vessel inner diameter as an important source of vessel resistivity. The coefficient of variation of vessel inner diameter was a good predictor for the increase of the ratio of integral <i>R</i><sub>HP</sub> to <i>R</i><sub>HP</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcul</span></strong></span></strong>ated from the mean value of inner vessel diameter. We discuss the fact that we dealt with the longest vessels in a given stem sample, which may lead to the overestimation of vessel lumen resistivity, which consequently precludes decision whether the variable vessel inner diameter explains fully the difference between vessel lumen resistivity and <i>R</i><sub>HP</sub> we observed.</p>

Spatially structured cell populations process multiple sensory signals in parallel in intact vascular endothelium
<p>Blood flow, blood clotting, angiogenesis, vascular permeability, and vascular remodeling are each controlled by a large number of variable, noisy, and interacting chemical inputs to the vascular endothelium. The endothelium processes the entirety of the chemical composition to which the cardiovascular system is exposed, carrying out sophisticated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ations that determine physiological output. Processing this enormous quantity of information is a major challenge facing the endothelium. We analyzed the responses of hundreds of endothelial cells to carbachol (CCh) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and found that the endothelium segregates the responses to these two distinct components of the chemical environment into separate streams of complementary information that are processed in parallel. Sensitivities to CCh and ATP mapped to different clusters of cells, and each agonist generated distinct signal patterns. The distinct signals were features of agonist activation rather than properties of the cells themselves. When there was more than one stimulus present, the cells communicated and combined inputs to generate new distinct signals that were nonlinear combinations of the inputs. Our results demonstrate that the endothelium is a structured, collaborative sensory network that simplifies the complex environment using separate cell clusters that are sensitive to distinct aspects of the overall biochemical environment and interactively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>e signals from diverse but interrelated chemical inputs. These features enable the endothelium to selectively process separate signals and perform <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">multipl</span></strong>e <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ations in an environment that is noisy and variable.</p>

Ethane/ethylene separation in a metal-organic framework with iron-peroxo sites
<p>The separation of ethane from its corresponding ethylene is an important, challenging, and energy-intensive process in the chemical industry. Here we report a microporous metal-organic framework, iron(III) peroxide 2,5-dioxido-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate [Fe<sub>2</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>)(dobdc) (dobdc<sup>4−</sup>: 2,5-dioxido-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate)], with iron (Fe)–peroxo sites for the preferential binding of ethane over ethylene and thus highly selective separation of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>/C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>. Neutron powder diffraction studies and theoretical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcul</span></strong></span></strong>ations demonstrate the key role of Fe-peroxo sites for the recognition of ethane. The high performance of Fe<sub>2</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>)(dobdc) for the ethane/ethylene separation has been validated by gas sorption isotherms, ideal adsorbed solution theory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcul</span></strong></span></strong>ations, and simulated and experimental breakthrough curves. Through a fixed-bed column packed with this porous material, polymer-grade ethylene (99.99% pure) can be straightforwardly produced from ethane/ethylene mixtures during the first adsorption cycle, demonstrating the potential of Fe<sub>2</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>)(dobdc) for this important industrial separation with a low energy cost under ambient conditions.</p>

Buffer-gas cooling of antiprotonic helium to 1.5 to 1.7 K, and antiproton-to–electron mass ratio
<p>Charge, parity, and time reversal (CPT) symmetry implies that a particle and its antiparticle have the same mass. The antiproton-to-electron mass ratio [Formula] can be precisely determined from the single-photon transition frequencies of antiprotonic helium. We measured 13 such frequencies with laser spectroscopy to a fractional precision of 2.5 × 10<sup>−9</sup> to 16 × 10<sup>−9</sup>. About 2 × 10<sup>9</sup> antiprotonic helium atoms were cooled to temperatures between 1.5 and 1.7 kelvin by using buffer-gas cooling in cryogenic low-pressure helium gas; the narrow thermal distribution led to the observation of sharp spectral lines of small thermal Doppler width. The deviation between the experimental frequencies and the results of three-body quantum electrodynamics <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcul</span></strong></span></strong>ations was reduced by a factor of 1.4 to 10 compared with previous single-photon experiments. From this, [Formula] was determined as 1836.1526734(15), which agrees with a recent proton-to-electron experimental value within 8 × 10<sup>−10</sup>.</p>

A Simple Method for Measuring Apoplast Hydration and Collecting Apoplast Contents
<p>The plant leaf apoplast is a dynamic environment subject to a variety of both internal and external stimuli. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion to being a conduit for water vapor and gas exchange involved in transpiration and photosynthesis, the apoplast also accumulates many nutrients transported from the soil as well as those produced through photosynthesis. The internal leaf also provides a protective environment for endophytic and pathogenic microbes alike. Given the diverse array of physiological processes occurring in the apoplast, it is expedient to develop methods to study its contents. Many established methods rely on vacuum infiltration of an apoplast wash solution followed by centrifugation. In this study, we describe a refined method optimized for maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) seedling leaves, which not only provides a simple procedure for obtaining apoplast fluid, but also allows direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcul</span></strong></span></strong>ation of apoplast hydration at the time of harvest for every sample. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, we describe an abbreviated method for estimating apoplast hydration if the full apoplast extraction is not necessary. Finally, we show the applicability of this optimized apoplast extraction procedure for plants infected with the maize pathogen <i>Pantoea stewartii</i> ssp <i>stewartii</i>, including the efficient isolation of bacteria previously residing in the apoplast. The approaches to establishing this method should make it generally applicable to other types of plants.</p>

Diffusion of CO<sub>2</sub> across the Mesophyll-Bundle Sheath Cell Interface in a C<sub>4</sub> Plant with Genetically Reduced PEP Carboxylase Activity
<p>Phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), localized to the cytosol of the mesophyll cell, catalyzes the first carboxylation step of the C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic pathway. Here, we used RNA interference to target the cytosolic photosynthetic PEPC isoform in <i>Setaria viridis</i> and isolated independent transformants with very low PEPC activities. These plants required high ambient CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations for growth, consistent with the essential role of PEPC in C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. The combination of estimating direct CO<sub>2</sub> fixation by the bundle sheath using gas-exchange measurements and modeling C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis with low PEPC activity allowed the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcul</span></strong></span></strong>ation of bundle sheath conductance to CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion (<i>g<sub>bs</sub></i>) in the progeny of these plants. Measurements made at a range of temperatures suggested no or negligible effect of temperature on <i>g<sub>bs</sub></i> depending on the technique used to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcul</span></strong></span></strong>ate <i>g<sub>bs</sub></i>. Anatomical measurements revealed that plants with reduced PEPC activity had reduced cell wall thickness and increased plasmodesmata (PD) density at the mesophyll-bundle sheath (M-BS) cell interface, whereas we observed little difference in these parameters at the mesophyll-mesophyll cell interface. The increased PD density at the M-BS interface was largely driven by an increase in the number of PD pit fields (cluster of PDs) rather than an increase in PD per pit field or the size of pit fields. The correlation of <i>g<sub>bs</sub></i> with bundle sheath surface area per leaf area and PD area per M-BS area showed that these parameters and cell wall thickness are important determinants of <i>g<sub>bs</sub></i>. It is intriguing to speculate that PD development is responsive to changes in C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic flux.</p>

EZ-Root-VIS: A Software Pipeline for the Rapid Analysis and Visual Reconstruction of Root System Architecture
<p>If we want to understand how the environment has shaped the appearance and behavior of living creatures, we need to compare groups of individuals that differ in genetic makeup and environment experience. For complex phenotypic features, such as body posture or facial expression in humans, comparison is not straightforward because some of the contributing factors cannot easily be quantified or averaged across individuals. Therefore, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ational methods are used to reconstruct representative prototypes using a range of algorithms for filling in missing information and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcul</span></strong></span></strong>ating means. The same problem applies to the root system architecture (RSA) of plants. Several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>er programs are available for extracting numerical data from root images, but they usually do not offer customized data analysis or visual reconstruction of RSA. We developed Root-VIS, a free software tool that facilitates the determination of means and variance of many different RSA features across user-selected sets of root images. Furthermore, Root-VIS offers several options to generate visual reconstructions of root systems from the averaged data to enable screening and modeling. We confirmed the suitability of Root-VIS, combined with a new version of EZ-Rhizo, for the rapid characterization of genotype-environment interactions and gene discovery through genome-wide association studies in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>).</p>

Transcriptional Analysis of <i>serk1</i> and <i>serk3</i> Coreceptor Mutants
<p>Somatic embryogenesis receptor kinases (SERKs) are ligand-binding coreceptors that are able to combine with different ligand-perceiving receptors such as BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1 (BRI1) and FLAGELLIN-SENSITIVE2. Phenotypical analysis of <i>serk</i> single mutants is not straightforward because <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">multipl</span></strong>e pathways can be affected, while redundancy is observed for a single phenotype. For example, <i>serk1serk3</i> double mutant roots are insensitive toward brassinosteroids but have a phenotype different from <i>bri1</i> mutant roots. To decipher these effects, 4-d-old Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) roots were studied using microarray analysis. A total of 698 genes, involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">multipl</span></strong>e biological processes, were found to be differentially regulated in <i>serk1-3serk3-2</i> double mutants. About half of these are related to brassinosteroid signaling. The remainder appear to be unlinked to brassinosteroids and related to primary and secondary metabolism. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, methionine-derived glucosinolate biosynthesis genes are up-regulated, which was verified by metabolite profiling. The results also show that the gene expression pattern in <i>serk3-2</i> mutant roots is similar to that of the <i>serk1-3serk3-2</i> double mutant roots. This confirms the existence of partial redundancy between SERK3 and SERK1 as well as the promoting or repressive activity of a single coreceptor in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">multipl</span></strong>e simultaneously active pathways.</p>

The effect of intravenous tranexamic acid on blood loss and early post-operative pain in total shoulder arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the impact of   intravenous tranexamic acid on the reduction of blood loss, transfusion   rate, and early post-operative clinical outcome in total shoulder   arthroplasty.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A randomised, placebo-controlled trial which included 54 patients   undergoing unilateral primary stemless anatomical or stemmed reverse   total shoulder arthroplasty was undertaken. Patients received either   100 ml saline (placebo, n = 27), or 100 ml saline together with   1000 mg of tranexamic acid (TXA, n = 27) intravenously prior to   skin incision and during wound closure.

A total of 55 patients met inclusion criteria of the receipt of   sufficient synovial fluid, tissue samples and removed implants for   analysis.</p><p>The diagnosis of PJI followed the definition from a recent International   Consensus Meeting to create two groups of patients; septic and aseptic.   Using receiver operating characteristic curves we determined the   cutoff values and diagnostic accuracy for each marker.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were 23 PJIs and 32 patients with aseptic loosening. The   levels of total leucocyte count, proportion of polymorphonuclear   leucocytes (PMNs), CRP, ADA and α2M in the synovial fluid were all   significantly higher in those with a PJI than in those with aseptic   loosening. The levels of procalcitonin were comparable in the two   groups.</p><p>Cutoff values for the optimal performance in the diagnosis of   infection were: total leucocyte count > 1463 cells/μL (sensitivity   (Sens) 100%, specificity (Spec) 71.9%, positive predictive value   (PPV) 71.9%, negative predictive value (NPV) 100%); proportion of   PMNs > 81% (Sens 78.3%, Spec 75.0%, PPV 69.2%, NPV 82.8%); CRP >   6.7mg/L (Sens 78.3%, Spec 93.8%, PPV 90.0%, NPV 85.7%); ADA > 61U/L   (Sens 78.3%, Spec 96.9%, PPV 94.7%, NPV 86.1%) and α2M > 958 mg/L   (Sens 47.8%, Spec 96.9%, PPV 91.7%, NPV 72.1%).</p><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion of a raised level of CRP or ADA to the total leukocyte   count increased the specificity: total leukocyte count > 1463 cells/μL   and CRP > 6.7mg/L (Sens 78.3%, Spec 100%, PPV 100%, NPV 86.5%) or   with ADA > 61U/L (Sens 78.3%, Spec 96.9%, PPV 94.7%, NPV 86.1%). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The total leucocyte count in the synovial fluid offers great   negative predictive value in the diagnosis of PJI and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion   of more specific markers such as CRP and ADA improves the positive   predictive value.

Exercise Intolerance in Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a common syndrome with a pressing shortage of therapies. Exercise intolerance is a cardinal symptom of HFpEF, yet its pathophysiology remains uncertain.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We investigated the mechanism of exercise intolerance in 134 patients referred for cardiopulmonary exercise testing: 79 with HFpEF and 55 controls. We performed cardiopulmonary exercise testing with invasive monitoring to measure hemodynamics, blood gases, and gas exchange during exercise. We used these measurements to quantify 6 steps of oxygen transport and utilization (the O<sub>2</sub> pathway) in each patient with HFpEF, identifying the defective steps that impair each one’s exercise capacity (peak Vo<sub>2</sub>). We then quantified the functional significance of each O<sub>2</sub> pathway defect by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcul</span></strong></span></strong>ating the improvement in exercise capacity a patient could expect from correcting the defect.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Peak Vo<sub>2</sub> was reduced by 34±2% (mean±SEM, <i>P</i><0.001) in HFpEF compared with controls of similar age, sex, and body mass index. The vast majority (97%) of patients with HFpEF harbored defects at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">multipl</span></strong>e steps of the O<sub>2</sub> pathway, the identity and magnitude of which varied widely. Two of these steps, cardiac output and skeletal muscle O<sub>2</sub> diffusion, were impaired relative to controls by an average of 27±3% and 36±2%, respectively (<i>P</i><0.001 for both). Due to interactions between a given patient’s defects, the predicted benefit of correcting any single one was often minor; on average, correcting a patient’s cardiac output led to a 7±0.5% predicted improvement in exercise intolerance, whereas correcting a patient’s muscle diffusion capacity led to a 27±1% improvement. At the individual level, the impact of any given O<sub>2</sub> pathway defect on a patient’s exercise capacity was strongly influenced by comorbid defects.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Systematic analysis of the O<sub>2</sub> pathway in HFpEF showed that exercise capacity was undermined by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">multipl</span></strong>e defects, including reductions in cardiac output and skeletal muscle diffusion capacity. An important source of disease heterogeneity stemmed from variation in each patient’s personal profile of defects. Personalized O<sub>2</sub> pathway analysis could identify patients most likely to benefit from treating a specific defect; however, the system properties of O<sub>2</sub> transport favor treating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">multipl</span></strong>e defects at once, as with exercise training.</p></sec>

Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor Type I Controls Cardiomyocyte Transforming Growth Factor-β and Cardiac Fibrosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Fibrosis is the pathological consequence of stress-induced tissue remodeling and matrix accumulation. Increased levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor type I (PAI-1) have been shown to promote fibrosis in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">multipl</span></strong>e organ systems. Paradoxically, homozygous genetic deficiency of PAI-1 is associated with spontaneous age-dependent, cardiac-selective fibrosis in mice. We have identified a novel PAI-1-dependent mechanism that regulates cardiomyocyte-derived fibrogenic signals and cardiac transcriptional pathways during injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Cardiac fibrosis in subjects with homozygous mutation in <i>SERPINE-1</i> was evaluated with late gadolinium-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. A murine cardiac injury model was performed by subcutaneous infusion of either saline or Angiotensin II by osmotic minipumps. We evaluated blood pressure, cardiac function (by echocardiography), fibrosis (with Masson Trichrome staining), and apoptosis (with TUNEL staining), and we performed transcriptome analysis (with RNA sequencing). We further evaluated fibrotic signaling in isolated murine primary ventricular myocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Cardiac fibrosis was detected in 2 otherwise healthy humans with complete PAI-1 deficiency because of a homozygous frameshift mutation in <i>SERPINE-1</i>. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion to its suppressive role during spontaneous cardiac fibrosis in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">multipl</span></strong>e species, we hypothesized that PAI-1 also regulates fibrosis during cardiac injury. Treatment of young PAI-1<sup>−/−</sup> mice with Angiotensin II induced extensive hypertrophy and fibrotic cardiomyopathy, with increased cardiac apoptosis and both reactive and replacement fibrosis. Although Angiotensin II-induced hypertension was blunted in PAI-1<sup>−/−</sup> mice, cardiac hypertrophy was accelerated. Furthermore, ventricular myocytes were found to be an important source of cardiac transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and PAI-1 regulated TGF-β synthesis by cardiomyocytes in vitro as well as in vivo during cardiac injury. Transcriptome analysis of ventricular RNA after Angiotensin II treatment confirmed that PAI-1 deficiency significantly enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">multipl</span></strong>e TGF-β signaling elements and transcriptional targets, including genes for extracellular matrix components, mediators of extracellular matrix remodeling, matricellular proteins, and cardiac integrins compared with wild-type mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>PAI-1 is an essential repressor of cardiac fibrosis in mammals. We define a novel cardiomyocyte-specific regulatory mechanism for TGF-β production by PAI-1, which explains the paradoxical effect of PAI-1 deficiency in promoting cardiac-selective fibrosis. Thus, PAI-1 is a molecular switch that controls the cardiac TGF-β axis and its early transcriptional effects that lead to myocardial fibrosis.</p></sec>

Nitrite and <i>S</i>-Nitrosohemoglobin Exchange Across the Human Cerebral and Femoral Circulation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The mechanisms underlying red blood cell (RBC)–mediated hypoxic vasodilation remain controversial, with separate roles for nitrite ([Formula]) and <i>S</i>-nitrosohemoglobin (SNO-Hb) widely contested given their ability to transduce nitric oxide bioactivity within the microcirculation. To establish their relative contribution in vivo, we quantified arterial-venous concentration gradients across the human cerebral and femoral circulation at rest and during exercise, an ideal model system characterized by physiological extremes of O<sub>2</sub> tension and blood flow.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Ten healthy participants (5 men, 5 women) aged 24±4 (mean±SD) years old were randomly assigned to a normoxic (21% O<sub>2</sub>) and hypoxic (10% O<sub>2</sub>) trial with measurements performed at rest and after 30 minutes of cycling at 70% of maximal power output in hypoxia and equivalent relative and absolute intensities in normoxia. Blood was sampled simultaneously from the brachial artery and internal jugular and femoral veins with plasma and RBC nitric oxide metabolites measured by tri-iodide reductive chemiluminescence. Blood flow was determined by transcranial Doppler ultrasound (cerebral blood flow) and constant infusion thermodilution (femoral blood flow) with net exchange <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcul</span></strong></span></strong>ated via the Fick principle.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Hypoxia was associated with a mild increase in both cerebral blood flow and femoral blood flow (<i>P</i><0.05 versus normoxia) with further, more pronounced increases observed in femoral blood flow during exercise (<i>P</i><0.05 versus rest) in proportion to the reduction in RBC oxygenation (<i>r</i>=0.680–0.769, <i>P</i><0.001). Plasma [Formula] gradients reflecting con<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sum</span></strong>ption (arterial>venous; <i>P</i><0.05) were accompanied by RBC iron nitrosylhemoglobin formation (venous>arterial; <i>P</i><0.05) at rest in normoxia, during hypoxia (<i>P</i><0.05 versus normoxia), and especially during exercise (<i>P</i><0.05 versus rest), with the most pronounced gradients observed across the bioenergetically more active, hypoxemic, and acidotic femoral circulation (<i>P</i><0.05 versus cerebral).

Plasma Ceramides, Mediterranean Diet, and Incident Cardiovascular Disease in the PREDIMED Trial (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although in vitro studies and investigations in animal models and small clinical populations have suggested that ceramides may represent an intermediate link between overnutrition and certain pathological mechanisms underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD), no prospective studies have investigated the association between plasma ceramides and risk of CVD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The study population consisted of 980 participants from the PREDIMED trial (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea), including 230 incident cases of CVD and 787 randomly selected participants at baseline (including 37 overlapping cases) followed for ≤7.4 years. Participants were randomized to a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra virgin olive oil, a Mediterranean diet supplemented with nuts, or a control diet. Plasma ceramide concentrations were measured on a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry metabolomics platform. The primary outcome was a composite of nonfatal acute myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death. Hazard ratios were estimated with weighted Cox regression models using Barlow weights to account for the case-cohort design.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The multivariable hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) comparing the extreme quartiles of plasma concentrations of C16:0, C22:0, C24:0, and C24:1 ceramides were 2.39 (1.49–3.83, <i>P</i><sub>trend</sub><0.001), 1.91 (1.21–3.01, <i>P</i><sub>trend</sub>=0.003), 1.97 (1.21–3.20, <i>P</i><sub>trend</sub>=0.004), and 1.73 (1.09–2.74, <i>P</i><sub>trend</sub>=0.011), respectively. The ceramide score, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcul</span></strong></span></strong>ated as a weighted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sum</span></strong> of concentrations of four ceramides, was associated with a 2.18-fold higher risk of CVD across extreme quartiles (HR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.36–3.49; <i>P</i><sub>trend</sub><0.001). The association between baseline ceramide score and incident CVD varied significantly by treatment groups (<i>P</i><sub>interaction</sub>=0.010). Participants with a higher ceramide score and assigned to either of the 2 active intervention arms of the trial showed similar CVD risk to those with a lower ceramide score, whereas participants with a higher ceramide score and assigned to the control arm presented significantly higher CVD risk.

In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, functional outcome, defined as changes in New York Heart Assocation class and 6-minute walking distance, were assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We included 64 consecutive patients (mean age 76.6±10 years) deemed unsuitable for surgery who underwent MitraClip treatment for chronic, severe TR for compassionate use. Functional TR was present in 88%; in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, 22 patients were also treated with the MitraClip system for mitral regurgitation as a combined procedure. The degree of TR was severe or massive in 88% of patients before the procedure. The MitraClip device was successfully implanted in the tricuspid valve in 97% of the cases. After the procedure, TR was reduced by at least 1 grade in 91% of the patients, thereof 4% that were reduced from massive to severe. In 13% of patients, TR remained severe after the procedure. Significant reductions in effective regurgitant orifice area (0.9±0.3cm<sup>2</sup> versus 0.4±0.2cm<sup>2</sup>; <i>P</i><0.001), vena contracta width (1.1±0.5 cm versus 0.6±0.3 cm; <i>P</i>=0.001), and regurgitant volume (57.2±12.8 mL/beat versus 30.8±6.9 mL/beat; <i>P</i><0.001) were observed.

Risk of Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction in Older Women After Contemporary Radiotherapy for Breast Cancer
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiomyocytes are resistant to radiation. However, cardiac radiation exposure causes coronary microvascular endothelial inflammation, a perturbation implicated in the pathogenesis of heart failure (HF) and particularly HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Radiotherapy for breast cancer results in variable cardiac radiation exposure and may increase the risk of HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a population-based case-control study of incident HF in 170 female residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota (59 cases and 111 controls), who underwent contemporary (1998–2013) radiotherapy for breast cancer with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ed tomography–assisted radiotherapy planning. Controls were matched to cases for age, tumor side, chemotherapy use, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. Mean cardiac radiation dose (MCRD) in each patient was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcul</span></strong></span></strong>ated from the patient’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ed tomography images and radiotherapy plan.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Mean age at radiotherapy was 69±9 years. Of HF cases, 38 (64%) had EF≥50% (HFpEF), 18 (31%) had EF<50% (HF with reduced EF), and 3 (5%) did not have EF measured. The EF was ≥40% in 50 of the 56 HF cases (89%) with an EF measurement. The mean interval from radiotherapy to HF was 5.8±3.4 years. The odds of HF was higher in patients with a history of ischemic heart disease or atrial fibrillation. The MCRD was 2.5 Gy (range, 0.2–13.1 Gy) and higher in cases (3.3±2.7 Gy) than controls (2.1±2.0 Gy; <i>P</i>=0.004). The odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for HF per log MCRD was 9.1 (3.4–24.4) for any HF, 16.9 (3.9–73.7) for HFpEF, and 3.17 (0.8–13.0) for HF with reduced EF. The increased odds of any HF or HFpEF with increasing MCRD remained significant after adjustment for HF risk factors and in sensitivity analyses matching by cancer stage rather than tumor side. Only 18.6% of patients experienced new or recurrent ischemic events between radiotherapy and the onset of HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The relative risk of HFpEF increases with increasing cardiac radiation exposure during contemporary conformal breast cancer radiotherapy. These data emphasize the importance of radiotherapy techniques that limit MCRD during breast cancer treatment. Moreover, these data provide further support for the importance of coronary microvascular compromise in the pathophysiology of HFpEF.</p></sec>

Plasma Lipidomic Profiles Improve on Traditional Risk Factors for the Prediction of Cardiovascular Events in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Clinical lipid measurements do not show the full complexity of the altered lipid metabolism associated with diabetes mellitus or cardiovascular disease. Lipidomics enables the assessment of hundreds of lipid species as potential markers for disease risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Plasma lipid species (310) were measured by a targeted lipidomic analysis with liquid chromatography electrospray ionization–tandem mass spectrometry on a case-cohort (n=3779) subset from the ADVANCE trial (Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron-MR Controlled Evaluation).

Engineering Artificial MicroRNAs for Multiplex Gene Silencing and Simplified Transgenic Screen
<p>Artificial microRNA (amiRNA) technology offers reversible and flexible gene inactivation and complements genome-editing technologies. However, obtaining transgenic plants with maximal gene silencing remains a major technical challenge in current amiRNA applications. Here, we incorporated an empirically determined feature of effective amiRNAs to the amiRNA design and in silico generated a database containing 533,429 gene-specific amiRNAs for silencing 27,136 genes in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), with a genome coverage of 98.87%. In both single-gene and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">multipl</span></strong>e-gene silencing, we observed an overall improvement in performance by amiRNAs designed using our strategy in Arabidopsis protoplasts and transgenic plants. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, the endogenous tRNA-processing system was used to generate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">multipl</span></strong>e amiRNAs from tRNA-pre-amiRNA tandem repeats for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">multipl</span></strong>ex gene silencing. An intronic amiRNA-producing fluorescent reporter was explored as a visual screening strategy for transgenic Arabidopsis and rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) plants with maximal whole-plant or cell type-specific gene silencing. These improvements enable the amiRNA technology to be a functional gene knockout tool for basic and applied plant research.</p>

MKK6 Functions in Two Parallel MAP Kinase Cascades in Immune Signaling
<p>Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) MAP KINASE (MPK) proteins can function in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">multipl</span></strong>e MAP kinase cascades and physiological processes. For instance, MPK4 functions in regulating development as well as in plant defense by participating in two independent MAP kinase cascades: the MEKK1-MKK1/MKK2-MPK4 cascade promotes basal resistance against pathogens and is guarded by the NB-LRR protein SUMM2, whereas the ANPs-MKK6-MPK4 cascade plays an essential role in cytokinesis. Here, we report a novel role for MKK6 in regulating plant immune responses. We found that MKK6 functions similarly to MKK1/MKK2 and works together with MEKK1 and MPK4 to prevent autoactivation of SUMM2-mediated defense responses. Interestingly, loss of MKK6 or ANP2/ANP3 results in constitutive activation of plant defense responses. The autoimmune phenotypes of <i>mkk6</i> and <i>anp2 anp3</i> mutant plants can be largely suppressed by a constitutively active <i>mpk4</i> mutant. Further analysis showed that the constitutive defense response in <i>anp2 anp3</i> is dependent on the defense regulators PAD4 and EDS1, but not on SUMM2, suggesting that the ANP2/ANP3-MKK6-MPK4 cascade may be guarded by a TIR-NB-LRR protein. Our study shows that MKK6 has <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">multipl</span></strong>e functions in plant defense responses in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion to cytokinesis.</p>

Metabolome Analysis of Multi-Connected Biparental Chromosome Segment Substitution Line Populations
<p>Metabolomic analysis coupled with advanced genetic populations represents a powerful tool with which to investigate the plant metabolome. However, genetic analyses of the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) metabolome have been conducted mainly using natural accessions or a single biparental population. Here, the flag leaves from three interconnected chromosome segment substitution line populations with a common recurrent genetic background were used to dissect rice metabolic diversity. We effectively used <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">multipl</span></strong>e interconnected biparental populations, constructed by introducing genomic segments into Zhenshan 97 from ACC10 (A/Z), Minghui 63 (M/Z), and Nipponbare (N/Z), to map metabolic quantitative trait loci (mQTL). A total of 1,587 mQTL were generated, of which 684, 479, and 722 were obtained from the A/Z, M/Z, and N/Z chromosome segment substitution line populations, respectively, and we designated 99 candidate genes for 367 mQTL. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, 1,001 mQTL were generated specifically from joint linkage analysis with 25 candidate genes assigned. Several of these candidates were validated, such as <i>LOC_Os07g01020</i> for the in vivo content of pyridoxine and its derivative and <i>LOC_Os04g25980</i> for cis-zeatin glucosyltransferase activity. We propose a novel biosynthetic pathway for <i>O</i>-methylapigenin <i>C</i>-pentoside and demonstrated that <i>LOC_Os04g11970</i> encodes a component of this pathway through fine-mapping. We postulate that the methylated apigenin may confer plant disease resistance. This study demonstrates the power of using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">multipl</span></strong>e interconnected populations to generate a large number of veritable mQTL. The combined results are discussed in the context of functional metabolomics and the possible features of assigned candidates underlying respective metabolites.</p>

Extracellular ATP Acts on Jasmonate Signaling to Reinforce Plant Defense
<p>Damaged cells send various signals to stimulate defense responses. Recent identification and genetic studies of the plant purinoceptor, P2K1 (also known as DORN1), have demonstrated that extracellular ATP is a signal involved in plant stress responses, including wounding, perhaps to evoke plant defense. However, it remains largely unknown how extracellular ATP induces plant defense responses. Here, we demonstrate that extracellular ATP induces plant defense mediated through activation of the intracellular signaling of jasmonate (JA), a well-characterized defense hormone. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves, ATP pretreatment induced resistance against the necrotrophic fungus, <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>. The induced resistance was enhanced in the P2K1 receptor overexpression line, but reduced in the receptor mutant, <i>dorn1</i>-<i>3</i>. Mining the transcriptome data revealed that ATP induces a set of JA-induced genes. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, the P2K1-associated coexpression network contains defense-related genes, including those encoding jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins, which play key roles as repressors of JA signaling. We examined whether extracellular ATP impacts the stability of JAZ1 in Arabidopsis. The results showed that the JAZ1 stability decreased in response to ATP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion in a proteasome-dependent manner. This reduction required intracellular signaling via second messengers—cytosolic calcium, reactive oxygen species, and nitric oxide. Interestingly, the ATP-induced JAZ1 degradation was attenuated in the JA receptor mutant, <i>coi1</i>, but not in the JA biosynthesis mutant, <i>aos</i>, or upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion of JA biosynthesis inhibitors. Immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that ATP increases the interaction between COI1 and JAZ1, suggesting direct cross talk between extracellular ATP and JA in intracellular signaling events. Taken together, these results suggest that extracellular ATP signaling directly impacts the JA signaling pathway to maximize plant defense responses.</p>

Multifunctional RNA Binding Protein OsTudor-SN in Storage Protein mRNA Transport and Localization
<p>The multifunctional RNA-binding protein Tudor-SN plays <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">multipl</span></strong>e roles in transcriptional and posttranscriptional processes due to its modular domain structure, consisting of four tandem <i>Staphylococcus</i> nuclease (SN)-like domains (4SN), followed by a carboxyl-terminal Tudor domain, followed by a fifth partial SN sequence (Tsn). In plants, it confers stress tolerance, is a component of stress granules and P-bodies, and may participate in stabilizing and localizing RNAs to specific subdomains of the cortical-endoplasmic reticulum in developing rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) endosperm. Here, we show that, in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion to the intact rice OsTudor-SN protein, the 4SN and Tsn modules exist as independent polypeptides, which collectively may coassemble to form a complex population of homodimer and heteroduplex species. The 4SN and Tsn modules exhibit different roles in RNA binding and as a protein scaffold for stress-associated proteins and RNA-binding proteins. Despite their distinct individual properties, mutations in both the 4SN and Tsn modules mislocalize storage protein mRNAs to the cortical endoplasmic reticulum. These results indicate that the two modular peptide regions of OsTudor-SN confer different cellular properties but cooperate in mRNA localization, a process linking its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">multipl</span></strong>e functions in the nucleus and cytoplasm.</p>

Phospholipid:Diacylglycerol Acyltransferase-Mediated Triacylglyerol Synthesis Augments Basal Thermotolerance
<p>High temperatures rapidly induce a genetically programmed heat-shock response (HSR) that is essential to establish short-term acquired thermotolerance. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, an immediate HSR-independent metabolic response is triggered, resulting in an accumulation of unsaturated triacylglycerols (TAGs) in the cytosol. The metabolic processes involved in heat-induced TAG formation in plants and their physiological significance remain to be clarified. Lipidomic analyses of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings indicated that during heat stress, polyunsaturated fatty acids from thylakoid galactolipids are incorporated into cytosolic TAGs. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, rapid conversion of plastidic monogalactosyl diacylglycerols (MGDGs) into oligogalactolipids, acylated MGDGs, and diacylglycerols (DAGs), the direct precursor of TAGs, was observed. For TAG synthesis, DAG requires a fatty acid from the acyl-CoA pool or phosphatidylcholine. Since seedlings deficient in PHOSPHOLIPID:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1 (PDAT1) were unable to accumulate TAGs after heat stress, phosphatidylcholine appears to be the major fatty acid donor. Results suggest that rapid plastid lipid metabolism drives TAG accumulation during heat stress. PDAT1-mediated TAG accumulation was found to increase heat resistance, since nonacclimated <i>pdat1</i> mutant seedlings were more sensitive to severe heat stress, as indicated by a more dramatic decline of the maximum efficiency of PSII and lower seedling survival compared to wild-type seedlings. In contrast, nonacclimated <i>trigalactosyldiacylglycerol1</i> (<i>tgd1</i>) mutants overaccumulating TAGs and oligogalactolipids were more resistant to heat stress. Hence, thylakoid lipid metabolism and TAG formation increases thermotolerance in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion to the genetically encoded HSR.</p>

ChloroKB: A Web Application for the Integration of Knowledge Related to Chloroplast Metabolic Network
<p>Higher plants, as autotrophic organisms, are effective sources of molecules. They hold great promise for metabolic engineering, but the behavior of plant metabolism at the network level is still incompletely described. Although structural models (stoichiometry matrices) and pathway databases are extremely useful, they cannot describe the complexity of the metabolic context, and new tools are required to visually represent integrated biocurated knowledge for use by both humans and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ers. Here, we describe ChloroKB, a Web application (<ext-link>http://chlorokb.fr/</ext-link>) for visual exploration and analysis of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) metabolic network in the chloroplast and related cellular pathways. The network was manually reconstructed through extensive biocuration to provide transparent traceability of experimental data. Proteins and metabolites were placed in their biological context (spatial distribution within cells, connectivity in the network, participation in supramolecular complexes, and regulatory interactions) using CellDesigner software. The network contains 1,147 reviewed proteins (559 localized exclusively in plastids, 68 in at least one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional compartment, and 520 outside the plastid), 122 proteins awaiting biochemical/genetic characterization, and 228 proteins for which genes have not yet been identified. The visual presentation is intuitive and browsing is fluid, providing instant access to the graphical representation of integrated processes and to a wealth of refined qualitative and quantitative data. ChloroKB will be a significant support for structural and quantitative kinetic modeling, for biological reasoning, when comparing novel data with established knowledge, for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>er analyses, and for educational purposes. ChloroKB will be enhanced by continuous updates following contributions from plant researchers.</p>

Sucrose Transporter <i>ZmSut1</i> Expression and Localization Uncover New Insights into Sucrose Phloem Loading
<p>Sucrose transporters (SUTs) translocate sucrose (Suc) across cellular membranes, and in eudicots, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">multipl</span></strong>e SUTs are known to function in Suc phloem loading in leaves. In maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), the <i>Sucrose Transporter1</i> (<i>ZmSut1</i>) gene has been implicated in Suc phloem loading based upon RNA expression in leaves, electrophysiological experiments, and phenotypic analysis of <i>zmsut1</i> mutant plants. However, no previous studies have examined the cellular expression of <i>ZmSut1</i> RNA or the subcellular localization of the ZmSUT1 protein to assess the gene’s hypothesized function in Suc phloem loading or to evaluate its potential roles, such as phloem unloading, in nonphotosynthetic tissues. To this end, we performed RNA in situ hybridization experiments, promoter-reporter gene analyses, and ZmSUT1 localization studies to elucidate the cellular expression pattern of the <i>ZmSut1</i> transcript and protein. These data showed that <i>ZmSut1</i> was expressed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">multipl</span></strong>e cell types throughout the plant and indicated that it functions in phloem companion cells to load Suc and also in other cell types to retrieve Suc from the apoplasm to prevent its accumulation and loss to the transpiration stream. Additionally, by comparing a phloem-mobile tracer with <i>ZmSut1</i> expression, we determined that developing maize leaves dynamically switch from symplasmic to apoplasmic phloem unloading, reconciling previously conflicting reports, and suggest that <i>ZmSut1</i> does not have an apparent function in either unloading process. A model for the dual roles for <i>ZmSut1</i> function (phloem loading and apoplasmic recycling), <i>Sut1</i> evolution, and its possible use to enhance Suc export from leaves in engineering C<sub>3</sub> grasses for C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis is discussed.</p>

Population Parameters Underlying an Ongoing Soft Sweep in Southeast Asian Malaria Parasites
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">multipl</span></strong>e <i>kelch13</i> alleles conferring artemisinin resistance (ART-R) are currently spreading through Southeast Asian malaria parasite populations, providing a unique opportunity to observe an ongoing soft selective sweep, investigate why resistance alleles have evolved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">multipl</span></strong>e times and determine fundamental population genetic parameters for <i>Plasmodium</i>. We sequenced <i>kelch13</i> (<i>n</i> = 1,876), genotyped 75 flanking SNPs, and measured clearance rate (<i>n</i> = 3,552) in parasite infections from Western Thailand (2001–2014). We describe 32 independent coding mutations including common mutations outside the <i>kelch13</i> propeller associated with significant reductions in clearance rate. Mutations were first observed in 2003 and rose to 90% by 2014, consistent with a selection coefficient of ∼0.079. ART-R allele diversity rose until 2012 and then dropped as one allele (C580Y) spread to high frequency. The frequency with which adaptive alleles arise is determined by the rate of mutation and the population size. Two factors drive this soft sweep: (1) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">multipl</span></strong>e <i>kelch13</i> amino-acid mutations confer resistance providing a large mutational target—we estimate the target is 87–163 bp. (2) The population mutation parameter (<i>Θ</i> = 2<i>N</i><sub>e</sub><i>μ</i>) can be estimated from the frequency distribution of ART-R alleles and is ∼5.69, suggesting that short term effective population size is 88 thousand to 1.2 million. This is 52–705 times greater than <i>N</i><sub>e</sub> estimated from fluctuation in allele frequencies, suggesting that we have previously underestimated the capacity for adaptive evolution in <i>Plasmodium</i>. Our central conclusions are that retrospective studies may underestimate the complexity of selective events and the <i>N</i><sub>e</sub> relevant for adaptation for malaria is considerably higher than previously estimated.</p>

Connecting the Sequence-Space of Bacterial Signaling Proteins to Phenotypes Using Coevolutionary Landscapes
<p>Two-component signaling (TCS) is the primary means by which bacteria sense and respond to the environment. TCS involves two partner proteins working in tandem, which interact to perform cellular functions whereas limiting interactions with non-partners (i.e., cross-talk). We construct a Potts model for TCS that can quantitatively predict how mutating amino acid identities affect the interaction between TCS partners and non-partners. The parameters of this model are inferred directly from protein sequence data. This approach drastically reduces the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ational complexity of exploring the sequence-space of TCS proteins. As a stringent test, we compare its predictions to a recent comprehensive mutational study, which characterized the functionality of 20<sup>4</sup> mutational variants of the PhoQ kinase in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. We find that our best predictions accurately reproduce the amino acid combinations found in experiment, which enable functional signaling with its partner PhoP. These predictions demonstrate the evolutionary pressure to preserve the interaction between TCS partners as well as prevent unwanted cross-talk. Further, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcul</span></strong></span></strong>ate the mutational change in the binding affinity between PhoQ and PhoP, providing an estimate to the amount of destabilization needed to disrupt TCS.</p>

Efficient Inference of Recombination Hot Regions in Bacterial Genomes
<p>In eukaryotes, detailed surveys of recombination rates have shown variation at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">multipl</span></strong>e genomic scales and the presence of “hotspots” of highly elevated recombination. In bacteria, studies of recombination rate variation are less developed, in part because there are few analysis methods that take into account the clonal context within which bacterial evolution occurs. Here, we focus in particular on identifying “hot regions” of the genome where DNA is transferred frequently between isolates. We present a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ationally efficient algorithm based on the recently developed “chromosome painting” algorithm, which characterizes patterns of haplotype sharing across a genome. We compare the average genome wide painting, which principally reflects clonal descent, with the painting for each site which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ionally reflects the specific deviations at the site due to recombination. Using simulated data, we show that hot regions have consistently higher deviations from the genome wide average than normal regions. We applied our approach to previously analyzed <i>Escherichia coli</i> genomes and revealed that the new method is highly correlated with the number of recombination events affecting each site inferred by ClonalOrigin, a method that is only applicable to small numbers of genomes. Furthermore, we analyzed recombination hot regions in <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> by using 200 genomes. We identified three recombination hot regions, which are enriched for genes related to membrane proteins. Our approach and its implementation, which is downloadable from <ext-link>https://github.com/bioprojects/orderedPainting</ext-link>, will help to develop a new phase of population genomic studies of recombination in prokaryotes.</p>

Quartet-Net: A Quartet-Based Method to Reconstruct Phylogenetic Networks
<p>Phylogenetic networks can model reticulate evolutionary events such as hybridization, recombination, and horizontal gene transfer. However, reconstructing such networks is not trivial. Popular character-based methods are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ationally inefficient, whereas distance-based methods cannot guarantee reconstruction accuracy because pairwise genetic distances only reflect partial information about a reticulate phylogeny. To balance accuracy and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ational efficiency, here we introduce a quartet-based method to construct a phylogenetic network from a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">multipl</span></strong>e sequence alignment. Unlike distances that only reflect the relationship between a pair of taxa, quartets contain information on the relationships among four taxa; these quartets provide adequate capacity to infer a more accurate phylogenetic network. In applications to simulated and biological data sets, we demonstrate that this novel method is robust and effective in reconstructing reticulate evolutionary events and it has the potential to infer more accurate phylogenetic distances than other conventional phylogenetic network construction methods such as Neighbor-Joining, Neighbor-Net, and Split Decomposition. This method can be used in constructing phylogenetic networks from simple evolutionary events involving a few reticulate events to complex evolutionary histories involving a large number of reticulate events. A software called “Quartet-Net” is implemented and available at <ext-link>http://sysbio.cvm.msstate.edu/QuartetNet/</ext-link>.</p>

Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Frequencies of Known Haplotypes from Pooled Sequence Data

Glycolysis plays an important role in energy transfer from the base to the distal end of the flagellum in mouse sperm
<p>Many studies have been conducted to elucidate the relationship between energy metabolic pathways (glycolysis and respiration) and flagellar motility in mammalian sperm, but the contribution of glycolysis to sperm motility has not yet been fully elucidated. In the present study, we performed detailed analysis of mouse sperm flagellar motility for further understanding of the contribution of glycolysis to mammalian sperm motility. Mouse sperm maintained vigorous motility in the presence of substrates either for glycolysis or for respiration. By contrast, inhibition of glycolysis by alpha-chlorohydrine caused a significant decrease in the bend angle of the flagellar bending wave, sliding velocity of outer doublet microtubules and ATP content even in the presence of respiratory substrates (pyruvate or β-hydroxybutyrate). The decrease of flagellar bend angle and sliding velocity are prominent in the distal part of the flagellum, indicating that glycolysis inhibition caused the decrease in ATP concentration threrein. These results suggest that glycolysis potentially acts as a spatial ATP buffering system, transferring energy (ATP) synthesized by respiration at the mitochondria located in the basal part of the flagellum to the distal part. In order to validate that glycolytic enzymes can transfer high energy phosphoryls, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcul</span></strong></span></strong>ated intraflagellar concentration profiles of adenine nucleotides along the flagellum by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>er simulation analysis. The result demonstrated the involvement of glycolysis for maintaining the ATP concentration at the tip of the flagellum. It is likely that glycolysis plays a key role in energy homeostasis in mouse sperm not only through ATP production but also through energy transfer.</p>

An increase in minimum metabolic rate and not activity explains field metabolic rate changes in a breeding seabird
<p>The field metabolic rate (FMR) of a free-ranging animal can be considered as the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sum</span></strong> of its maintenance costs (minimum metabolic rate, MMR) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional costs associated with thermoregulation, digestion, production and activity. However, the relationships between FMR and BMR and how they relate to behaviour and extrinsic influences is not clear. In seabirds, FMR has been shown to increase during the breeding season. This is pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sum</span></strong>ed to be the result of an increase in foraging activity, stimulated by increased food demands from growing chicks, but few studies have investigated in detail the factors that underlie these increases. We studied free-ranging Australasian gannets (<i>Morus serrator</i>) throughout their 5 month breeding season, and evaluated FMR, MMR and activity-related metabolic costs on a daily basis using the heart rate method. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, we simultaneously recorded behaviour (flying and diving) in the same individuals. FMR increased steadily throughout the breeding season, increasing by 11% from the incubation period to the long chick-brooding period. However, this was not accompanied by either an increase in flying or diving behaviour, or an increase in the energetic costs of activity. Instead, the changes in FMR could be explained exclusively by a progressive increase in MMR. Seasonal changes in MMR could be due to a change in body composition or a decrease in body condition associated with changing the allocation of resources between provisioning adults and growing chicks. Our study highlights the importance of measuring physiological parameters continuously in free-ranging animals in order to understand fully the mechanisms underpinning seasonal changes in physiology and behaviour.</p>

Mild or moderate renal insufficiency does not increase circulating levels of cobalt and chromium in patients with metal-on-metal hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To determine whether there is any association between glomerular   filtration rate (GFR) and blood cobalt (Co) and chromium (Cr) levels   in patients with metal-on-metal (MoM) hip arthroplasty.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We identified 179 patients with a unilateral 36 mm diameter head   as part of a stemmed Summit-Pinnacle MoM hip arthroplasty. GFR was   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcul</span></strong></span></strong>ated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">formula</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Normal renal function (GFR ≥ 90 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) was   seen in 74 patients.

Cost effectiveness of patellofemoral <i>versus</i> total knee arthroplasty in younger patients
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Patellofemoral arthroplasty (PFA) has experienced significant   improvements in implant survivorship with second generation designs.   This has renewed interest in PFA as an alternative to total knee   arthroplasty (TKA) for younger active patients with isolated patellofemoral   osteoarthritis (PF OA). We analysed the cost-effectiveness of PFA <i>versus</i> TKA   for the management of isolated PF OA in the United States-based   population.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We used a Markov transition state model to compare cost-effectiveness   between PFA and TKA. Simulated patients were aged 60 (base case)   and 50 years. Lifetime costs (2015 United States dollars), quality-adjusted   life year (QALY) gains and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio   (ICER) were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcul</span></strong></span></strong>ated from a healthcare payer perspective. Annual rates   of revision were derived from the National Joint Registry for England,   Wales, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man. Deterministic and probabilistic   sensitivity analysis was performed for all parameters against a   $50 000/QALY willingness to pay. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>PFA was more expensive ($49 811 <i>versus</i> $46 632)   but more effective (14.3 QALYs <i>versus</i> 13.3 QALYs)   over a lifetime horizon. The ICER associated with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional   effectiveness of PFA was $3097. The model was mainly sensitive to utility   values, with PFA remaining cost-effective when its utility exceeded   that of TKA by at least 1.0%. PFA provided incremental benefits   at no increased cost when annual rates of revision decreased by   24.5%. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Recent improvements in rates of implant of survival have made   PFA an economically beneficial joint-preserving procedure in younger   patients, delaying TKA until implant failure or tibiofemoral OA   progression. The present study quantified the minimum required marginal   benefit for PFA to be cost-effective compared with TKA and identified survivorship   targets for PFA to become both less expensive and more effective.   These benchmarks might be used to assess clinical outcomes of PFA   from an economic standpoint within the United States healthcare   system.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1028–36.</p></sec>

Measuring the migration of the components and polyethylene wear after total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>This paper describes the methodology, validation and reliability   of a new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>er-assisted method which uses models of the patient’s   bones and the components to measure their migration and polyethylene   wear from radiographs after total hip arthroplasty (THA).</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Models of the patient’s acetabular and femoral component obtained   from the manufacturer and models of the patient’s pelvis and femur   built from a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>ed tomography (CT) scan, are used by a   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comput</span></strong>er program to measure the migration of the components and   the penetration of the femoral head from anteroposterior and lateral radiographs   taken at follow-up visits. The program simulates the radiographic   setup and matches the position and orientation of the models to   outlines of the pelvis, the acetabular and femoral component, and   femur on radiographs. Changes in position and orientation reflect   the migration of the components and the penetration of the femoral   head. Validation was performed using radiographs of phantoms simulating   known migration and penetration, and the clinical feasibility of   measuring migration was assessed in two patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Migration of the acetabular and femoral components can be measured   with limits of agreement (LOA) of 0.37 mm and 0.33 mm, respectively.   Penetration of the femoral head can be measured with LOA of 0.161   mm.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The migration of components and polyethylene wear can be measured   without needing specialised radiographs. Accurate measurement may   allow earlier prediction of failure after THA.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1290–7.</p></sec>

The use of ultra-low-dose CT scans for the evaluation of limb fractures
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To evaluate whether an ultra-low-dose CT protocol can diagnose   selected limb fractures as well as conventional CT (C-CT).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We prospectively studied 40 consecutive patients with a limb   fracture in whom a CT scan was indicated. These were scanned using   an ultra-low-dose CT Reduced Effective Dose Using Computed Tomography   In Orthopaedic Injury (REDUCTION) protocol. Studies from 16 selected   cases were compared with 16 C-CT scans matched for age, gender and   type of fracture. Studies were assessed for diagnosis and image   quality. Descriptive and reliability statistics were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcul</span></strong></span></strong>ated.   The total effective radiation dose for each scanned site was compared.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean estimated effective dose (ED) for the REDUCTION protocol   was 0.03 milliSieverts (mSv) and 0.43 mSv (p < 0.005) for C-CT.   The sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value   (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the REDUCTION protocol   to detect fractures were 0.98, 0.89, 0.98 and 0.89 respectively   when two occult fractures were excluded. Inter- and intra-observer   reliability for diagnosis using the REDUCTION protocol (κ = 0.75, κ =   0.71) were similar to those of C-CT (κ = 0.85, κ = 0.82). Using   the REDUCTION protocol, 3D CT reconstructions were equivalent in   quality and diagnostic information to those generated by C-CT (κ =   0.87, κ = 0.94).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>With a near 14-fold reduction in estimated ED compared with C-CT,   the REDUCTION protocol reduces the amount of CT radiation substantially   without significant diagnostic decay. It produces images that appear   to be comparable with those of C-CT for evaluating fractures of   the limbs.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2016;98-B:1668-73.</p></sec>

The development of a quantitative scoring system to predict whether a large-to-massive rotator cuff tear can be arthroscopically repaired
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of the study was to develop a quantitative scoring system   to predict whether a large-to-massive rotator cuff tear was arthroscopically   reparable prior to surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We conducted a retrospective review of the pre-operative MR imaging   and surgical records of 87 patients (87 shoulders) who underwent   arthroscopic repair of a large-to-massive rotator cuff tear.

WT1 regulates the development of the posterior taste field
<p>Despite the importance of taste in determining nutrient intake, our understanding of the processes that control the development of the peripheral taste system is lacking. Several early regulators of taste development have been identified, including sonic hedgehog, bone morphogenetic protein 4 and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">multipl</span></strong>e members of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. However, the regulation of these factors, including their induction, remains poorly understood. Here, we identify a crucial role for the Wilms' tumor 1 protein (WT1) in circumvallate (CV) papillae development. WT1 is a transcription factor that is important in the normal development of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">multipl</span></strong>e tissues, including both the olfactory and visual systems. In mice, WT1 expression is detectable by E12.5, when the CV taste placode begins to form. In mice lacking WT1, the CV fails to develop normally and markers of early taste development are dysregulated compared with wild type. We demonstrate that expression of the WT1 target genes <i>Lef1</i>, <i>Ptch1</i> and <i>Bmp4</i> is significantly reduced in developing tongue tissue derived from <i>Wt1</i> knockout mice and that, in normal tongue, WT1 is bound to the promoter regions of these genes. Moreover, siRNA knockdown of WT1 in cultured taste cells leads to a reduction in the expression of <i>Lef1</i> and <i>Ptch1</i>. Our data identify WT1 as a crucial transcription factor in the development of the CV through the regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">multipl</span></strong>e signaling pathways that have established roles in the formation and patterning of taste placodes.</p>

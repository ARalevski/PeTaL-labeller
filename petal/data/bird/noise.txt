The RhoGAP HUM-7/Myo9 integrates signals to modulate RHO-1/RhoA during embryonic morphogenesis in <i>Caenorhabditis</i> <i>elegans</i>
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Here, we describe how the conserved RhoGAP HUM-7/MYO9 integrates signals from SAX-3/ROBO to regulate cell migrations by attenuating RHO-1 GTPase activity, identifying new roles for RHO-1 during epidermal cell migration.</p>

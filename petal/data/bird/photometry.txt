Improving Assessment of Drug Safety Through Proteomics
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Early detection of adverse effects of novel therapies and understanding of their mechanisms could improve the safety and efficiency of drug development. We have retrospectively applied large-scale proteomics to blood samples from ILLUMINATE (Investigation of Lipid Level Management to Understand its Impact in Atherosclerotic Events), a trial of torcetrapib (a cholesterol ester transfer protein inhibitor), that involved 15 067 participants at high cardiovascular risk. ILLUMINATE was terminated at a median of 550 days because of significant absolute increases of 1.2% in cardiovascular events and 0.4% in mortality with torcetrapib. The aims of our analysis were to determine whether a proteomic analysis might reveal biological mechanisms responsible for these harmful effects and whether harmful effects of torcetrapib could have been detected early in the ILLUMINATE trial with proteomics.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A nested case-control analysis of paired plasma samples at baseline and at 3 months was performed in 249 participants assigned to torcetrapib plus atorvastatin and 223 participants assigned to atorvastatin only. Within each treatment arm, cases with events were matched to controls 1:1. Main outcomes were a survey of 1129 proteins for discovery of biological pathways altered by torcetrapib and a 9-protein risk score validated to predict myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, or death.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Plasma concentrations of 200 proteins changed significantly with torcetrapib. Their pathway analysis revealed unexpected and widespread changes in immune and inflammatory functions, as well as changes in endocrine systems, including in aldosterone function and glycemic control. At baseline, 9-protein risk scores were similar in the 2 treatment arms and higher in participants with subsequent events. At 3 months, the absolute 9-protein derived risk increased in the torcetrapib plus atorvastatin arm compared with the atorvastatin-only arm by 1.08% (<i>P</i>=0.0004). Thirty-seven proteins changed in the direction of increased risk of 49 proteins previously associated with cardiovascular and mortality risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Heretofore unknown effects of torcetrapib were revealed in immune and inflammatory functions. A protein-based risk score predicted harm from torcetrapib within just 3 months. A protein-based risk assessment embedded within a large proteomic survey may prove to be useful in the evaluation of therapies to prevent harm to patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Dual-comb spectroscopy of water vapor with a free-running semiconductor disk laser
<p>Dual-comb spectroscopy offers the potential for high accuracy combined with fast data acquisition. Applications are often limited, however, by the complexity of optical comb systems. Here we present dual-comb spectroscopy of water vapor using a substantially simplified single-laser system. Very good spectroscopy measurements with fast sampling rates are achieved with a free-running dual-comb mode-locked semiconductor disk laser. The absolute stability of the optical comb modes is characterized both for free-running operation and with simple microwave stabilization. This approach drastically reduces the complexity for dual-comb spectroscopy. Band-gap engineering to tune the center wavelength from the ultraviolet to the mid-infrared could optimize frequency combs for specific gas targets, further enabling dual-comb spectroscopy for a wider range of industrial applications.</p>

Light-induced lattice expansion leads to high-efficiency perovskite solar cells
<p>Light-induced structural dynamics plays a vital role in the physical properties, device performance, and stability of hybrid perovskite–based optoelectronic devices. We report that continuous light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">il<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lumin</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ation leads to a uniform lattice expansion in hybrid perovskite thin films, which is critical for obtaining high-efficiency photovoltaic devices. Correlated, in situ structural and device characterizations reveal that light-induced lattice expansion benefits the performances of a mixed-cation pure-halide planar device, boosting the power conversion efficiency from 18.5 to 20.5%. The lattice expansion leads to the relaxation of local lattice strain, which lowers the energetic barriers at the perovskite-contact interfaces, thus improving the open circuit voltage and fill factor. The light-induced lattice expansion did not compromise the stability of these high-efficiency photovoltaic devices under continuous operation at full-spectrum 1-sun (100 milliwatts per square centimeter) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">il<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lumin</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ation for more than 1500 hours.</p>

Colloidally prepared La-doped BaSnO<sub>3</sub> electrodes for efficient, photostable perovskite solar cells
<p>Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) exceeding a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20% have mainly been demonstrated by using mesoporous titanium dioxide (mp-TiO<sub>2</sub>) as an electron-transporting layer. However, TiO<sub>2</sub> can reduce the stability of PSCs under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">il<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lumin</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ation (including ultraviolet light). Lanthanum (La)–doped BaSnO<sub>3</sub> (LBSO) perovskite would be an ideal replacement given its electron mobility and electronic structure, but LBSO cannot be synthesized as well-dispersible fine particles or crystallized below 500°C. We report a superoxide colloidal solution route for preparing a LBSO electrode under very mild conditions (below 300°C). The PSCs fabricated with LBSO and methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI<sub>3</sub>) show a steady-state power conversion efficiency of 21.2%, versus 19.7% for a mp-TiO<sub>2</sub> device. The LBSO-based PSCs could retain 93% of their initial performance after 1000 hours of full-Sun <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">il<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lumin</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ation.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
High-Throughput Phenotyping of Maize Leaf Physiological and Biochemical Traits Using Hyperspectral Reflectance
<p>High-throughput, noninvasive field phenotyping has revealed genetic variation in crop morphological, developmental, and agronomic traits, but rapid measurements of the underlying physiological and biochemical traits are needed to fully understand genetic variation in plant-environment interactions. This study tested the application of leaf hyperspectral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ance (λ = 500–2,400 nm) as a high-throughput phenotyping approach for rapid and accurate assessment of leaf photosynthetic and biochemical traits in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). Leaf traits were measured with standard wet-laboratory and gas-exchange approaches alongside measurements of leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ance. Partial least-squares regression was used to develop a measure of leaf chlorophyll content, nitrogen content, sucrose content, specific leaf area, maximum rate of phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate carboxylation, [CO<sub>2</sub>]-saturated rate of photosynthesis, and leaf oxygen radical absorbance capacity from leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ance spectra. Partial least-squares regression models accurately predicted five out of seven traits and were more accurate than previously used simple spectral indices for leaf chlorophyll, nitrogen content, and specific leaf area. Correlations among leaf traits and statistical inferences about differences among genotypes and treatments were similar for measured and modeled data. The hyperspectral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ance approach to phenotyping was dramatically faster than traditional measurements, enabling over 1,000 rows to be phenotyped during midday hours over just 2 to 4 d, and offers a nondestructive method to accurately assess physiological and biochemical trait responses to environmental stress.</p>

Mechanism of allosteric modulation of P-glycoprotein by transport substrates and inhibitors
<p>The ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1) multidrug transporter P-glycoprotein plays a central role in clearance of xenobiotics in humans and is implicated in cancer resistance to chemotherapy. We used double electron electron resonance spectroscopy to uncover the basis of stimulation of P-glycoprotein adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis by multiple substrates and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">il<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lumin</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ate how substrates and inhibitors differentially affect its transport function. Our results reveal that substrate-induced acceleration of ATP hydrolysis correlates with stabilization of a high-energy, post-ATP hydrolysis state characterized by structurally asymmetric nucleotide-binding sites. By contrast, this state is destabilized in the substrate-free cycle and by high-affinity inhibitors in favor of structurally symmetric nucleotide binding sites. Together with previous data, our findings lead to a general model of substrate and inhibitor coupling to P-glycoprotein.</p>

Rovibrational quantum state resolution of the C<sub>60</sub> fullerene
<p>The unique physical properties of buckminsterfullerene, C<sub>60</sub>, have attracted intense research activity since its original discovery. Total quantum state–resolved spectroscopy of isolated C<sub>60</sub> molecules has been of particularly long-standing interest. Such observations have, to date, been unsuccessful owing to the difficulty in preparing cold, gas-phase C<sub>60</sub> in sufficiently high densities. Here we report high-resolution infrared absorption spectroscopy of C<sub>60</sub> in the 8.5-micron spectral region (1180 to 1190 wave number). A combination of cryogenic buffer-gas cooling and cavity-enhanced direct frequency comb spectroscopy has enabled the observation of quantum state–resolved rovibrational transitions. Characteristic nuclear spin statistical intensity patterns confirm the indistinguishability of the 60 carbon-12 atoms, while rovibrational fine structure encodes further details of the molecule’s rare icosahedral symmetry.</p>

Seismic evidence for partial melting at the root of major hot spot plumes

Nanoscale nuclear magnetic resonance with chemical resolution
<p>Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a key analytical technique in chemistry, biology, and medicine. However, conventional NMR spectroscopy requires an at least nanoliter-sized sample volume to achieve sufficient signal. We combined the use of a quantum memory and high magnetic fields with a dedicated quantum sensor based on nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond to achieve chemical shift resolution in <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>19</sup>F NMR spectroscopy of 20-zeptoliter sample volumes. We demonstrate the application of NMR pulse sequences to achieve homonuclear decoupling and spin diffusion measurements. The best measured NMR linewidth of a liquid sample was ~1 part per million, mainly limited by molecular diffusion. To mitigate the influence of diffusion, we performed high-resolution solid-state NMR by applying homonuclear decoupling and achieved a 20-fold narrowing of the NMR linewidth.</p>

Microresonator soliton dual-comb spectroscopy
<p>Measurement of optical and vibrational spectra with high resolution provides a way to identify chemical species in cluttered environments and is of general importance in many fields. Dual-comb spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful approach for acquiring nearly instantaneous Raman and optical spectra with unprecedented resolution. Spectra are generated directly in the electrical domain, without the need for bulky mechanical spectrometers. We demonstrate a miniature soliton-based dual-comb system that can potentially transfer the approach to a chip platform. These devices achieve high-coherence pulsed mode locking. They also feature broad, reproducible spectral envelopes, an essential feature for dual-comb spectroscopy. Our work shows the potential for integrated spectroscopy with high signal-to-noise ratios and fast acquisition rates.</p>

Observation of Anderson localization in disordered nanophotonic structures
<p>Anderson localization is an interference effect crucial to the understanding of waves in disordered media. However, localization is expected to become negligible when the features of the disordered structure are much smaller than the wavelength. Here we experimentally demonstrate the localization of light in a disordered dielectric multilayer with an average layer thickness of 15 nanometers, deep into the subwavelength regime. We observe strong disorder-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ions that show that the interplay of localization and evanescence can lead to a substantial decrease in transmission, or the opposite feature of enhanced transmission. This deep-subwavelength Anderson localization exhibits extreme sensitivity: Varying the thickness of a single layer by 2 nanometers changes the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ion appreciably. This sensitivity, approaching the atomic scale, holds the promise of extreme subwavelength sensing.</p>

Bloch oscillations in the absence of a lattice
<p>The interplay of strong quantum correlations and far-from-equilibrium conditions can give rise to striking dynamical phenomena.

We found that the momentum distribution of the impurity exhibits characteristic Bragg <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ions at the edge of an emergent Brillouin zone. Although Bragg <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ions are typically associated with lattice structures, in our strongly correlated quantum liquid they result from the interplay of short-range crystalline order and kinematic constraints on the many-body scattering processes in the one-dimensional system. As a consequence, the impurity exhibits periodic dynamics, reminiscent of Bloch oscillations, although the quantum liquid is translationally invariant. Our observations are supported by large-scale numerical simulations.</p>

Restored iron transport by a small molecule promotes absorption and hemoglobinization in animals

We present a direct stepwise method for converting methane into methanol with high selectivity (~97%) over a copper-containing zeolite, based on partial oxidation with water. The activation in helium at 673 kelvin (K), followed by consecutive catalyst exposures to 7 bars of methane and then water at 473 K, consistently produced 0.204 mole of CH<sub>3</sub>OH per mole of copper in zeolite. Isotopic labeling confirmed water as the source of oxygen to regenerate the zeolite active centers and renders methanol desorption energetically favorable. On the basis of in situ x-ray absorption spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations, we propose a mechanism involving methane oxidation at Cu<sup>II</sup> oxide active centers, followed by Cu<sup>I</sup> reoxidation by water with concurrent formation of hydrogen.</p>

Localized seismic deformation in the upper mantle revealed by dense seismic arrays
<p>Seismicity along continental transform faults is usually confined to the upper half of the crust, but the Newport-Inglewood fault (NIF), a major fault traversing the Los Angeles basin, is seismically active down to the upper mantle.

Deep earthquakes, which are spatially correlated with geochemical evidence of a fluid pathway from the mantle, as well as with a sharp vertical offset in the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary, exhibit narrow size distribution and weak temporal clustering. We attribute these characteristics to a transition from strong to weak interaction regimes in a system of seismic asperities embedded in a ductile fault zone matrix.</p>

The Hydrogen Isotope Composition δ<sup>2</sup>H Reflects Plant Performance

However, the nature of hydrogen isotope composition (δ<sup>2</sup>H) and what it <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>s of plant performance is poorly understood. Using durum wheat (<i>Triticum turgidum</i> var <i>durum</i>), this study evaluated the effect of different water and nitrogen growing field conditions on transpiration and how this effect influenced the performance of δ<sup>2</sup>H in autotrophic (flag leaf), mixotrophic (ears), and heterotrophic (grains and roots) organs. Moreover, δ<sup>2</sup>H was compared with the δ<sup>13</sup>C and δ<sup>18</sup>O in the same organs. Isotope compositions were analyzed in dry matter, the water-soluble fraction, and in water from different tissues of a set of genotypes. Similar to δ<sup>13</sup>C, the δ<sup>2</sup>H correlated negatively with stomatal conductance, whereas no correlation was observed for δ<sup>18</sup>O. Moreover, δ<sup>2</sup>H was not only affected by changes in transpiration but also by photosynthetic reactions, probably as a consequence of NADPH formation in autotrophic organs. Compared with the δ<sup>2</sup>H of stem water, plant δ<sup>2</sup>H was strongly diminished in photosynthetic organs such as the flag leaves, whereas it strongly increased in heterotrophic organs such as grains and roots. In heterotrophic organs, δ<sup>2</sup>H was associated with postphotosynthetic effects because there are several processes that lead to <sup>2</sup>H-enrichment of carbohydrates. In summary, δ<sup>2</sup>H exhibited specific features that inform about the water conditions of the wheat crop, together with the photosynthetic characteristics of the plant part considered. Moreover, correlations of δ<sup>2</sup>H with grain yield illustrate that this isotope can be used to assess plant performance under different growing conditions.</p>

What Quantity of Photosystem I Is Optimum for Safe Photosynthesis?
<p>PSI has the potential to generate reactive oxygen species and be oxidatively inactivated by the reactive oxygen species. The photo-oxidative damage of PSI (also called PSI photoinhibition) causes the inhibition of the plant growth and is a lethal event for plants. It has been reported that PSI photoinhibition does not occur as long as the reaction-center chlorophyll (P700) remains oxidized, even in excess light conditions. This process is termed P700 oxidation and is supported by various regulatory mechanisms and likely also by the stoichiometric quantities of photosynthetic apparatus. In this study, we assessed how decreased photochemically active PSI in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) affected a variety of photosynthetic parameters, including P700 oxidation. Inactivation of PSI was rapidly and selectively induced by repetitive short-pulse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">il<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lumin</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ation. PSI photoinhibition correlated linearly with decreases in effective quantum yield of PSII and nonphotochemical quenching; however, the photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate was less affected, as exemplified by ∼50% of the normal CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate maintained with an 80% loss in PSI photochemical activity. In contrast, effective quantum yield of PSI was enhanced following PSI photoinhibition, mainly owing to a decrease in the electron donor-side limitation of PSI. Based on these results, we propose that the stoichiometric quantity of PSI is optimized to induce P700 oxidation for dissipating excess light energy in PSI, thus avoiding inhibition of photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation caused by PSI photoinhibition.</p>

Inhibition of TOR Represses Nutrient Consumption, Which Improves Greening after Extended Periods of Etiolation
<p>Upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">il<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lumin</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ation, etiolated seedlings experience a transition from heterotrophic to photoautotrophic growth. During this process, the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway provides chlorophyll for photosynthesis. This pathway has to be tightly controlled to prevent the accumulation of photoreactive metabolites and to provide stoichiometric amounts of chlorophyll for its incorporation into photosynthetic protein complexes. Therefore, plants have evolved regulatory mechanisms to synchronize the biosynthesis of chlorophyll and chlorophyll-binding proteins. Two phytochrome-interacting factors (PIF1 and PIF3) and the DELLA proteins, which are controlled by the gibberellin pathway, are key regulators of this process. Here, we show that impairment of TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (TOR) activity in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), either by mutation of the TOR complex component <i>RAPTOR1B</i> or by treatment with TOR inhibitors, leads to a significantly reduced accumulation of the photoreactive chlorophyll precursor protochlorophyllide in darkness but an increased greening rate of etiolated seedlings after exposure to light. Detailed profiling of metabolic, transcriptomic, and physiological parameters revealed that the TOR-repressed lines not only grow slower, they grow in a nutrient-saving mode, which allows them to resist longer periods of low nutrient availability. Our results also indicated that <i>RAPTOR1B</i> acts upstream of the gibberellin-DELLA pathway and its mutation complements the repressed greening phenotype of <i>pif1</i> and <i>pif3</i> after etiolation.</p>

Network Modeling Unravels Mechanisms of Crosstalk between Ethylene and Salicylate Signaling in Potato
<p>To develop novel crop breeding strategies, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms underlying the interaction between plants and their pathogens. Network modeling represents a powerful tool that can unravel properties of complex biological systems. In this study, we aimed to use network modeling to better understand immune signaling in potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>). For this, we first built on a reliable Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) immune signaling model, extending it with the information from diverse publicly available resources. Next, we translated the resulting prior knowledge network (20,012 nodes and 70,091 connections) to potato and superimposed it with an ensemble network inferred from time-resolved transcriptomics data for potato. We used different network modeling approaches to generate specific hypotheses of potato immune signaling mechanisms. An interesting finding was the identification of a string of molecular events <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">il<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lumin</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ating the ethylene pathway modulation of the salicylic acid pathway through Nonexpressor of PR Genes1 gene expression. Functional validations confirmed this modulation, thus supporting the potential of our integrative network modeling approach for unraveling molecular mechanisms in complex systems. In addition, this approach can ultimately result in improved breeding strategies for potato and other sensitive crops.</p>

Subcellular Compartmentation of Alternatively Spliced Transcripts Defines <i>SERINE/ARGININE-RICH PROTEIN30</i> Expression<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Alternative splicing (AS) is prevalent in higher eukaryotes, and generation of different AS variants is tightly regulated. Widespread AS occurs in response to altered light conditions and plays a critical role in seedling photomorphogenesis, but despite its frequency and effect on plant development, the functional role of AS remains unknown for most splicing variants. Here, we characterized the light-dependent AS variants of the gene encoding the splicing regulator Ser/Arg-rich protein SR30 in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We demonstrated that the splicing variant <i>SR30.2</i>, which is predominantly produced in darkness, is enriched within the nucleus and strongly depleted from ribosomes. Light-induced AS from a downstream 3′ splice site gives rise to <i>SR30.1</i>, which is exported to the cytosol and translated, coinciding with SR30 protein accumulation upon seedling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">il<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lumin</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ation. Constitutive expression of SR30.1 and SR30.2 fused to fluorescent proteins revealed their identical subcellular localization in the nucleoplasm and nuclear speckles. Furthermore, expression of either variant shifted splicing of a genomic <i>SR30</i> reporter toward <i>SR30.2</i>, suggesting that an autoregulatory feedback loop affects <i>SR30</i> splicing. We provide evidence that <i>SR30.2</i> can be further spliced and, unlike <i>SR30.2</i>, the resulting cassette exon variant <i>SR30.3</i> is sensitive to nonsense-mediated decay. Our work delivers insight into the complex and compartmentalized RNA processing mechanisms that control the expression of the splicing regulator SR30 in a light-dependent manner.</p>

Mitochondria Affect Photosynthetic Electron Transport and Photosensitivity in a Green Alga
<p>Photosynthetic organisms use sunlight as the primary source of energy to support their metabolism. In eukaryotes, reactions responsible of the conversion of light into chemical energy occur in specific organelles, the chloroplasts. In this study, we showed that mitochondria also have a seminal influence on cells’ energy metabolism and on photosynthetic reactions. This is illustrated by the observation that the strong photosensitivity of <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> cells depleted of the chloroplast protein PGRL1 was rescued by the introduction of a mitochondrial mutation affecting respiratory complex I. Functional analysis showed that such a reduced respiratory activity influenced chloroplast electron transport with consequent overreduction of plastoquinone and donor-side limitation of photosystem I (PSI). As a consequence, damage due to excess light affected more photosystem II (PSII) rather than PSI. Double mutant cells are able to grow under excess <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">il<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lumin</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ation, while single <i>pgrl1</i> are not, thanks to the presence of an efficient repair mechanism of PSII. These results also underline the seminal biological relevance of the regulation of electron transport reactions within the photosynthetic complexes. Photosynthetic organisms evolved a strategy to respond to excess light where damage is targeting preferentially to a specific complex, PSII. Cells are able to endure extensive damage targeting this complex thanks to an efficient repair mechanisms, while if PSI is affected, there are drastic consequences on growth.</p>

Glucose-Induced Trophic Shift in an Endosymbiont Dinoflagellate with Physiological and Molecular Consequences<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>Interactions between the dinoflagellate endosymbiont <i>Symbiodinium</i> and its cnidarian hosts (e.g. corals, sea anemones) are the foundation of coral-reef ecosystems. Carbon flow between the partners is a hallmark of this mutualism, but the mechanisms governing this flow and its impact on symbiosis remain poorly understood. We showed previously that although <i>Symbiodinium</i> strain SSB01 can grow photoautotrophically, it can grow mixotrophically or heterotrophically when supplied with Glc, a metabolite normally transferred from the alga to its host. Here we show that Glc supplementation of SSB01 cultures causes a loss of pigmentation and photosynthetic activity, disorganization of thylakoid membranes, accumulation of lipid bodies, and alterations of cell-surface morphology. We used global transcriptome analyses to determine if these physiological changes were correlated with changes in gene expression. Glc-supplemented cells exhibited a marked reduction in levels of plastid transcripts encoding photosynthetic proteins, although most nuclear-encoded transcripts (including those for proteins involved in lipid synthesis and formation of the extracellular matrix) exhibited little change in their abundances. However, the altered carbon metabolism in Glc-supplemented cells was correlated with modest alterations (approximately 2x) in the levels of some nuclear-encoded transcripts for sugar transporters. Finally, Glc-bleached SSB01 cells appeared unable to efficiently populate anemone larvae. Together, these results suggest links between energy metabolism and cellular physiology, morphology, and symbiotic interactions. However, the results also show that in contrast to many other organisms, <i>Symbiodinium</i> can undergo dramatic physiological changes that are not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ed by major changes in the abundances of nuclear-encoded transcripts and thus presumably <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong> posttranscriptional regulatory processes.</p>

Chlorophyll Can Be Reduced in Crop Canopies with Little Penalty to Photosynthesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The hypothesis that reducing chlorophyll content (Chl) can increase canopy photosynthesis in soybeans was tested using an advanced model of canopy photosynthesis. The relationship among leaf Chl, leaf optical properties, and photosynthetic biochemical capacity was measured in 67 soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) accessions showing large variation in leaf Chl. These relationships were integrated into a biophysical model of canopy-scale photosynthesis to simulate the intercanopy light environment and carbon assimilation capacity of canopies with wild type, a Chl-deficient mutant (<i>Y11y11</i>), and 67 other mutants spanning the extremes of Chl to quantify the impact of variation in leaf-level Chl on canopy-scale photosynthetic assimilation and identify possible opportunities for improving canopy photosynthesis through Chl reduction. These simulations demonstrate that canopy photosynthesis should not increase with Chl reduction due to increases in leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ance and nonoptimal distribution of canopy nitrogen. However, similar rates of canopy photosynthesis can be maintained with a 9% savings in leaf nitrogen resulting from decreased Chl. Additionally, analysis of these simulations indicate that the inability of Chl reductions to increase photosynthesis arises primarily from the connection between Chl and leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ance and secondarily from the mismatch between the vertical distribution of leaf nitrogen and the light absorption profile. These simulations suggest that future work should explore the possibility of using reduced Chl to improve canopy performance by adapting the distribution of the “saved” nitrogen within the canopy to take greater advantage of the more deeply penetrating light.</p>

Light Signaling-Dependent Regulation of Photoinhibition and Photoprotection in Tomato<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Photoreceptor-mediated light signaling plays a critical role in plant growth, development, and stress responses but its contribution to the spatial regulation of photoinhibition and photoprotection within the canopy remains unclear. Here, we show that low-red/far-red (<i>L</i>-<i>R</i>/<i>FR</i>) ratio light conditions significantly alleviate PSII and PSI photoinhibition in the shade leaves of tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) plants. This protection is accompanied by a phytochrome A-dependent induction of LONG HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5). HY5 binds to the promoter of <i>ABA INSENSITIVE</i>5 (<i>ABI5</i>), triggering <i>RESPIRATORY BURST OXIDASE HOMOLOG1</i> (<i>RBOH1</i>)-dependent H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production in the apoplast. Decreased levels of <i>HY5</i>, <i>ABI5</i>, and <i>RBOH1</i> transcripts increased cold-induced photoinhibition and abolished <i>L</i>-<i>R</i>/<i>FR</i>-induced alleviation of photoinhibition. <i>L</i>-<i>R</i>/<i>FR</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">il<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lumin</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ation induced nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) of chlorophyll <i>a</i> fluorescence and increased the activities of Foyer-Halliwell-Asada cycle enzymes and cyclic electron flux (CEF) around PSI. In contrast, decreased <i>HY5</i>, <i>ABI5</i>, and <i>RBOH1</i> transcript levels abolished the positive effect of <i>L</i>-<i>R</i>/<i>FR</i> on photoprotection. Loss of <i>PROTON GRADIENT REGULATION5</i>-dependent CEF led to increased photoinhibition and attenuated <i>L</i>-<i>R</i>/<i>FR</i>-dependent NPQ. These data demonstrate that HY5 is an important hub in the cross talk between light and cold response pathways, integrating ABA and reactive oxygen species signaling, leading to the attenuation of photoinhibition by enhanced induction of photoprotection in shade leaves.</p>

Light Sheet Microscopy Imaging of Light Absorption and Photosynthesis Distribution in Plant Tissue
<p>In vivo variable chlorophyll fluorescence measurements of photosystem II (PSII) quantum yields in optically dense systems are complicated by steep tissue light gradients due to scattering and absorption. Consequently, externally measured effective PSII quantum yields may be composed of signals derived from cells differentially exposed to actinic light, where cells located deeper inside tissues receive lower irradiance than cells closer to the surface and can display distinct photophysiological status. We demonstrate how measured distributions of PSII quantum yields in plant tissue change under natural tissue light gradients as compared with conventionally measured quantum yields with even exposure to actinic light. This was achieved by applying actinic irradiance perpendicular to one side of thallus cross sections of the aquatic macrophyte <i>Fucus vesiculosus</i> with laser light sheets of defined spectral composition, while imaging variable chlorophyll fluorescence from cross sections with a microscope-mounted pulse amplitude-modulated imaging system. We show that quantum yields are highly affected by light gradients and that traditional surface-based variable chlorophyll fluorescence measurements result in substantial underestimations and/or overestimations, depending on incident actinic irradiance. We present a method for using chlorophyll fluorescence profiles in combination with integrating sphere measurements of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ance and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmitt</span></strong>ance to calculate depth-resolved photon absorption profiles, which can be used to correct apparent PSII electron transport rates to photons absorbed by PSII.

A Dynamic Hydro-Mechanical and Biochemical Model of Stomatal Conductance for C<sub>4</sub> Photosynthesis
<p>C<sub>4</sub> plants are major grain (maize [<i>Zea mays</i>] and sorghum [<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>]), sugar (sugarcane [<i>Saccharum officinarum</i>]), and biofuel (<i>Miscanthus</i> spp.) producers and contribute ∼20% to global productivity. Plants lose water through stomatal pores in order to acquire CO<sub>2</sub> (assimilation [<i>A</i>]) and control their carbon-for-water balance by regulating stomatal conductance (<i>g</i><sub>S</sub>). The ability to mechanistically predict <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> and <i>A</i> in response to atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, water availability, and time is critical for simulating stomatal control of plant-atmospheric carbon and water exchange under current, past, or future environmental conditions. Yet, dynamic mechanistic models for <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> are lacking, especially for C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. We developed and coupled a hydromechanical model of stomatal behavior with a biochemical model of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis, calibrated using gas-exchange measurements in maize, and extended the coupled model with time-explicit functions to predict dynamic responses. We demonstrated the wider applicability of the model with three additional C<sub>4</sub> grass species in which interspecific differences in stomatal behavior could be accounted for by fitting a single parameter. The model accurately predicted steady-state responses of <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> to light, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and oxygen, soil drying, and evaporative demand as well as dynamic responses to light intensity. Further analyses suggest that the effect of variable leaf hydraulic conductance is negligible. Based on the model, we derived a set of equations suitable for incorporation in land surface models.

Although recent studies have investigated the dynamic transcriptome during berry development, most have focused on a single grapevine variety, so there is a lack of comparative data representing different cultivars. Here, we report, to our knowledge, the first genome-wide transcriptional analysis of 120 RNA samples corresponding to 10 Italian grapevine varieties collected at four growth stages. The 10 varieties, representing five red-skinned and five white-skinned berries, were all cultivated in the same experimental vineyard to reduce environmental variability. The comparison of transcriptional changes during berry formation and ripening allowed us to determine the transcriptomic traits common to all varieties, thus defining the core transcriptome of berry development, as well as the transcriptional dynamics underlying differences between red and white berry varieties. A greater variation among the red cultivars than between red and white cultivars at the transcriptome level was revealed, suggesting that anthocyanin accumulation during berry maturation has a direct impact on the transcriptomic regulation of multiple biological processes. The expression of genes related to phenylpropanoid/flavonoid biosynthesis clearly distinguished the behavior of red and white berry genotypes during ripening but also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ed the differential accumulation of anthocyanins in the red berries, indicating some form of cross talk between the activation of stilbene biosynthesis and the accumulation of anthocyanins in ripening berries.</p>

Monogalactosyldiacylglycerol Facilitates Synthesis of Photoactive Protochlorophyllide in Etioplasts
<p>Cotyledon cells of dark-germinated angiosperms develop etioplasts that are plastids containing unique internal membranes called prolamellar bodies (PLBs). Protochlorophyllide (Pchlide), a precursor of chlorophyll, accumulates in PLBs and forms a ternary complex with NADPH and light-dependent NADPH:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (LPOR), which allows for the rapid formation of chlorophyll after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">il<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lumin</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ation while avoiding photodamage. PLBs are 3D lattice structures formed by the lipid bilayer rich in monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG). Although MGDG was found to be required for the formation and function of the thylakoid membrane in chloroplasts in various plants, the roles of MGDG in PLB formation and etioplast development are largely unknown. To analyze the roles of MGDG in etioplast development, we suppressed <i>MGD1</i> encoding the major isoform of MGDG synthase by using a dexamethasone-inducible artificial microRNA in etiolated Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings. Strong <i>MGD1</i> suppression caused a 36% loss of MGDG in etiolated seedlings, together with a 41% decrease in total Pchlide content. The loss of MGDG perturbed etioplast membrane structures and impaired the formation of the photoactive Pchlide-LPOR-NADPH complex and its oligomerization, without affecting LPOR accumulation. The <i>MGD1</i> suppression also impaired the formation of Pchlide from protoporphyrin IX via multiple enzymatic reactions in etioplast membranes, which suggests that MGDG is required for the membrane-associated processes in the Pchlide biosynthesis pathway. Suppressing <i>MGD1</i> at several germination stages revealed that MGDG biosynthesis at an early germination stage is particularly important for Pchlide accumulation. MGDG biosynthesis may provide a lipid matrix for Pchlide biosynthesis and the formation of Pchlide-LPOR complexes as an initial step of etioplast development.</p>

Two Trichome Birefringence-Like Proteins Mediate Xylan Acetylation, Which Is Essential for Leaf Blight Resistance in Rice
<p>Acetylation is a ubiquitous modification on cell wall polymers, which play a structural role in plant growth and stress defenses. However, the mechanisms for how crop plants accomplish cell wall polymer <i>O</i>-acetylation are largely unknown. Here, we report on the isolation and characterization of two <i>trichome birefringence-like</i> (<i>tbl</i>) mutants in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), which are affected in xylan <i>O</i>-acetylation. <i>ostbl1</i> and <i>ostbl2</i> single mutant and the <i>tbl1 tbl2</i> double mutant displayed a stunted growth phenotype with varied degree of dwarfism. As shown by chemical assays, the wall acetylation level is affected in the mutants and the knock-down and overexpression transgenic plants. Furthermore, NMR spectroscopy analyses showed that all those mutants have varied decreases in xylan monoacetylation. The divergent expression levels of <i>OsTBL1</i> and <i>OsTBL2</i> explained the chemotype difference and indicated that <i>OsTBL1</i> is a functionally dominant gene. OsTBL1 was found to be Golgi-localized. The recombinant OsTBL1 protein incorporates acetyl groups onto xylan. By using xylopentaose, a preferred acceptor substrate, OsTBL1 can transfer up to four acetyl residues onto xylopentaose, and this activity showed saturable kinetics. 2D-NMR spectroscopy showed that OsTBL1 transfers acetate to both 2-<i>O</i> and 3-<i>O</i> sites of xylosyl residues. In addition, <i>ostbl1</i> and <i>tbl1 tbl2</i> displayed susceptibility to rice blight disease, indicating that this xylan modification is required for pathogen resistance. This study identifies the major genes responsible for xylan acetylation in rice plants.</p>

Oxidation of P700 in Photosystem I Is Essential for the Growth of Cyanobacteria
<p>The photoinhibition of photosystem I (PSI) is lethal to oxygenic phototrophs. Nevertheless, it is unclear how photodamage occurs or how oxygenic phototrophs prevent it. Here, we provide evidence that keeping P700 (the reaction center chlorophyll in PSI) oxidized protects PSI. Previous studies have suggested that PSI photoinhibition does not occur in the two model cyanobacteria, <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 and <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> PCC 7942, when photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> fixation was suppressed under low CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure even in mutants deficient in flavodiiron protein (FLV), which mediates alternative electron flow. The lack of FLV in <i>Synechococcus</i> sp. PCC 7002 (S. 7002), however, is linked directly to reduced growth and PSI photodamage under CO<sub>2</sub>-limiting conditions. Unlike <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 and <i>S. elongatus</i> PCC 7942, S. 7002 reduced P700 during CO<sub>2</sub>-limited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">il<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lumin</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ation in the absence of FLV, resulting in decreases in both PSI and photosynthetic activities. Even at normal air CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, the growth of S. 7002 mutant was retarded relative to that of the wild type. Therefore, P700 oxidation is essential for protecting PSI against photoinhibition. Here, we present various strategies to alleviate PSI photoinhibition in cyanobacteria.</p>

Genetic Bases of Fungal White Rot Wood Decay Predicted by Phylogenomic Analysis of Correlated Gene-Phenotype Evolution
<p>Fungal decomposition of plant cell walls (PCW) is a complex process that has diverse industrial applications and huge impacts on the carbon cycle. White rot (WR) is a powerful mode of PCW decay in which lignin and carbohydrates are both degraded. Mechanistic studies of decay coupled with comparative genomic analyses have provided clues to the enzymatic components of WR systems and their evolutionary origins, but the complete suite of genes necessary for WR remains undetermined. Here, we use phylogenomic comparative methods, which we validate through simulations, to identify shifts in gene family diversification rates that are correlated with evolution of WR, using data from 62 fungal genomes. We detected 409 gene families that appear to be evolutionarily correlated with WR. The identified gene families encode well-characterized decay enzymes, e.g., fungal class II peroxidases and cellobiohydrolases, and enzymes involved in import and detoxification pathways, as well as 73 gene families that have no functional annotation. About 310 of the 409 identified gene families are present in the genome of the model WR fungus <i>Phanerochaete chrysosporium</i> and 192 of these (62%) have been shown to be upregulated under ligninolytic culture conditions, which corroborates the phylogeny-based functional inferences. These results <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">il<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lumin</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ate the complexity of WR and suggest that its evolution has involved a general elaboration of the decay apparatus, including numerous gene families with as-yet unknown exact functions.</p>

Efficient Inference of Recombination Hot Regions in Bacterial Genomes
<p>In eukaryotes, detailed surveys of recombination rates have shown variation at multiple genomic scales and the presence of “hotspots” of highly elevated recombination. In bacteria, studies of recombination rate variation are less developed, in part because there are few analysis methods that take into account the clonal context within which bacterial evolution occurs. Here, we focus in particular on identifying “hot regions” of the genome where DNA is transferred frequently between isolates. We present a computationally efficient algorithm based on the recently developed “chromosome painting” algorithm, which characterizes patterns of haplotype sharing across a genome. We compare the average genome wide painting, which principally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>s clonal descent, with the painting for each site which additionally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>s the specific deviations at the site due to recombination. Using simulated data, we show that hot regions have consistently higher deviations from the genome wide average than normal regions. We applied our approach to previously analyzed <i>Escherichia coli</i> genomes and revealed that the new method is highly correlated with the number of recombination events affecting each site inferred by ClonalOrigin, a method that is only applicable to small numbers of genomes. Furthermore, we analyzed recombination hot regions in <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> by using 200 genomes. We identified three recombination hot regions, which are enriched for genes related to membrane proteins. Our approach and its implementation, which is downloadable from <ext-link>https://github.com/bioprojects/orderedPainting</ext-link>, will help to develop a new phase of population genomic studies of recombination in prokaryotes.</p>

Quartet-Net: A Quartet-Based Method to Reconstruct Phylogenetic Networks
<p>Phylogenetic networks can model reticulate evolutionary events such as hybridization, recombination, and horizontal gene transfer. However, reconstructing such networks is not trivial. Popular character-based methods are computationally inefficient, whereas distance-based methods cannot guarantee reconstruction accuracy because pairwise genetic distances only <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong> partial information about a reticulate phylogeny. To balance accuracy and computational efficiency, here we introduce a quartet-based method to construct a phylogenetic network from a multiple sequence alignment. Unlike distances that only <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong> the relationship between a pair of taxa, quartets contain information on the relationships among four taxa; these quartets provide adequate capacity to infer a more accurate phylogenetic network. In applications to simulated and biological data sets, we demonstrate that this novel method is robust and effective in reconstructing reticulate evolutionary events and it has the potential to infer more accurate phylogenetic distances than other conventional phylogenetic network construction methods such as Neighbor-Joining, Neighbor-Net, and Split Decomposition. This method can be used in constructing phylogenetic networks from simple evolutionary events involving a few reticulate events to complex evolutionary histories involving a large number of reticulate events. A software called “Quartet-Net” is implemented and available at <ext-link>http://sysbio.cvm.msstate.edu/QuartetNet/</ext-link>.</p>

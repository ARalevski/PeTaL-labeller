Fasting Versus Nonfasting and Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Accuracy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Recent recommendations favoring nonfasting lipid assessment may affect low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ation. The novel method of LDL-C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ation (LDL-C<sub>N</sub>) uses a flexible approach to derive patient-specific ratios of triglycerides to very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. This adaptability may confer an accuracy advantage in nonfasting patients over the fixed approach of the classic Friedewald method (LDL-C<sub>F</sub>).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used a US cross-sectional sample of 1 545  634 patients (959 153 fasting ≥10–12 hours; 586 481 nonfasting) from the second harvest of the Very Large Database of Lipids study to assess for the first time the impact of fasting status on novel LDL-C accuracy. Rapid ultracentrifugation was used to directly measure LDL-C content (LDL-C<sub>D</sub>). Accuracy was defined as the percentage of LDL-C<sub>D</sub> falling within an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ated LDL-C (LDL-C<sub>N</sub> or LDL-C<sub>F</sub>) category by clinical cut points. For low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ated LDL-C (<70 mg/dL), we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated accuracy by triglyceride levels. The magnitude of absolute and percent differences between LDL-C<sub>D</sub> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ated LDL-C (LDL-C<sub>N</sub> or LDL-C<sub>F</sub>) was stratified by LDL-C and triglyceride categories.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In both fasting and nonfasting samples, accuracy was higher with the novel method across all clinical LDL-C categories (range, 87%–94%) compared with the Friedewald <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ation (range, 71%–93%; <i>P</i>≤0.001). With LDL-C <70 mg/dL, nonfasting LDL-C<sub>N</sub> accuracy (92%) was superior to LDL-C<sub>F</sub> accuracy (71%; <i>P</i><0.001). In this LDL-C range, 19% of fasting and 30% of nonfasting patients had differences ≥10 mg/dL between LDL-C<sub>F</sub> and LDL-C<sub>D</sub>, whereas only 2% and 3% of patients, respectively, had similar differences with novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ation. Accuracy of LDL-C <70 mg/dL further decreased as triglycerides increased, particularly for Friedewald <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ation (range, 37%–96%) versus the novel method (range, 82%–94%). With triglycerides of 200 to 399 mg/dL in nonfasting patients, LDL-C<sub>N</sub> <70 mg/dL accuracy (82%) was superior to LDL-C<sub>F</sub> (37%; <i>P</i><0.001). In this triglyceride range, 73% of fasting and 81% of nonfasting patients had ≥10 mg/dL differences between LDL-C<sub>F</sub> and LDL-C<sub>D</sub> compared with 25% and 20% of patients, respectively, with LDL-C<sub>N</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Novel adaptable LDL-C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ation performs better in nonfasting samples than the fixed Friedewald <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ation, with a particular accuracy advantage in settings of low LDL-C and high triglycerides.

Use of a Single Baseline Versus Multiyear 24-Hour Urine Collection for Estimation of Long-Term Sodium Intake and Associated Cardiovascular and Renal Risk
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>A decrease in sodium intake has been shown to lower blood pressure, but data from cohort studies on the association with cardiovascular and renal outcomes are inconsistent. In these studies, sodium intake was often <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ated with a single baseline measurement, which may be inaccurate considering day-to-day changes in sodium intake and sodium excretion.

However, relative to a single baseline measurement, 50% of the subjects had a >0.8-g (>34-mmol) difference in sodium intake with long-term <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ations. As a result, 45%, 49%, and 50% of all subjects switched between tertiles of sodium intake when the 1-, 5-, or 15-year average was used, respectively.

Direct Determination of the Mutation Rate in the Bumblebee Reveals Evidence for Weak Recombination-Associated Mutation and an Approximate Rate Constancy in Insects
<p>Accurate knowledge of the mutation rate provides a base line for inferring expected rates of evolution, for testing evolutionary hypotheses and for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ation of key parameters. Advances in sequencing technology now permit direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ates of the mutation rate from sequencing of close relatives. Within insects there have been three prior such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ates, two in nonsocial insects (<i>Drosophila</i>: 2.8 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> per bp per haploid genome per generation; <i>Heliconius</i>: 2.9 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>) and one in a social species, the honeybee (3.4 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>). Might the honeybee’s rate be ∼20% higher because it has an exceptionally high recombination rate and recombination may be directly or indirectly mutagenic? To address this possibility, we provide a direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ate of the mutation rate in the bumblebee (<i>Bombus terrestris</i>), this being a close relative of the honeybee but with a much lower recombination rate. We confirm that the crossover rate of the bumblebee is indeed much lower than honeybees (8.7 cM/Mb vs. 37 cM/Mb). Importantly, we find no significant difference in the mutation rates: we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ate for bumblebees a rate of 3.6 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> per haploid genome per generation (95% confidence intervals 2.38 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> and 5.37 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>) which is just 5% higher than the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ate that of honeybees. Both genomes have approximately one new mutation per haploid genome per generation. While we find evidence for a direct coupling between recombination and mutation (also seen in honeybees), the effect is so weak as to leave almost no footprint on any between-species differences. The similarity in mutation rates suggests an approximate constancy of the mutation rate in insects.</p>

Lack of Concordance Between Empirical Scores and Physician Assessments of Stroke and Bleeding Risk in Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Physicians treating patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) must weigh the benefits of anticoagulation in preventing stroke versus the risk of bleeding. Although empirical models have been developed to predict such risks, the degree to which these coincide with clinicians’ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ates is unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We examined 10 094 AF patients enrolled in the Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of AF (ORBIT-AF) registry between June 2010 and August 2011. Empirical stroke and bleeding risks were assessed by using the congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥75 years, diabetes mellitus, and previous stroke or transient ischemic attack (CHADS<sub>2</sub>) and Anticoagulation and Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation (ATRIA) scores, respectively. Separately, physicians were asked to categorize their patients’ stroke and bleeding risks: low risk (<3%); intermediate risk (3%–6%); and high risk (>6%). Overall, 72% (n=7251) in ORBIT-AF had high-risk CHADS<sub>2</sub> scores (≥2). However, only 16% were assessed as high stroke risk by physicians. Although 17% (n=1749) had high ATRIA bleeding risk (score ≥5), only 7% (n=719) were considered so by physicians. The associations between empirical and physician-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ated stroke and bleeding risks were low (weighted Kappa 0.1 and 0.11, respectively).

Assessment of methane emissions from the U.S. oil and gas supply chain
<p>Methane emissions from the U.S. oil and natural gas supply chain were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ated by using ground-based, facility-scale measurements and validated with aircraft observations in areas accounting for ~30% of U.S. gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion. When scaled up nationally, our facility-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ate of 2015 supply chain emissions is 13 ± 2 teragrams per year, equivalent to 2.3% of gross U.S. gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion. This value is ~60% higher than the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency inventory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ate, likely because existing inventory methods miss emissions released during abnormal operating conditions. Methane emissions of this magnitude, per unit of natural gas consumed, produce radiative forcing over a 20-year time horizon comparable to the CO<sub>2</sub> from natural gas combustion. Substantial emission reductions are feasible through rapid detection of the root causes of high emissions and deployment of less failure-prone systems.</p>

The Cost-Effectiveness of Antibiotic Prophylaxis for Patients at Risk of Infective Endocarditis

Only a marginal reduction in annual IE rates (1.44 cases in high-risk and 33 cases in all at-risk patients) would be required for AP to be considered cost-effective at £20 000 ($26 600) per quality-adjusted life-year.

Storage Compartments for Capillary Water Rarely Refill in an Intact Woody Plant
<p>Water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">storag</span></strong>e is thought to play an integral role in the maintenance of whole-plant water balance. The contribution of both living and dead cells to water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">storag</span></strong>e can be derived from rehydration and water-release curves on excised plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al, but the underlying tissue-specific emptying/refilling dynamics remain unclear. Here, we used x-ray computed microtomography to characterize the refilling of xylem fibers, pith cells, and vessels under both excised and in vivo conditions in <i>Laurus nobilis</i>. In excised stems supplied with water, water uptake exhibited a biphasic response curve, and x-ray computed microtomography images showed that high water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">storag</span></strong>e capacitance was associated with fiber and pith refilling as driven by capillary forces: fibers refilled more rapidly than pith cells, while vessel refilling was minimal. In excised stems that were sealed, fiber and pith refilling was associated with vessel emptying, indicating a link between tissue connectivity and water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">storag</span></strong>e. In contrast, refilling of fibers, pith cells, and vessels was negligible in intact saplings over two time scales, 24 h and 3 weeks. However, those compartments did refill slowly when the shoot was covered to prevent transpiration. Collectively, our data (1) provide direct evidence that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">storag</span></strong>e compartments for capillary water refill in excised stems but rarely under in vivo conditions, (2) highlight that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ates of capacitance from excised samples should be interpreted with caution, as certain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">storag</span></strong>e compartments may not be utilized in the intact plant, and (3) question the paradigm that fibers play a substantial role in daily discharge/recharge of stem capacitance in an intact tree.</p>

Population Parameters Underlying an Ongoing Soft Sweep in Southeast Asian Malaria Parasites
<p>Multiple <i>kelch13</i> alleles conferring artemisinin resistance (ART-R) are currently spreading through Southeast Asian malaria parasite populations, providing a unique opportunity to observe an ongoing soft selective sweep, investigate why resistance alleles have evolved multiple times and determine fundamental population genetic parameters for <i>Plasmodium</i>. We sequenced <i>kelch13</i> (<i>n</i> = 1,876), genotyped 75 flanking SNPs, and measured clearance rate (<i>n</i> = 3,552) in parasite infections from Western Thailand (2001–2014). We describe 32 independent coding mutations including common mutations outside the <i>kelch13</i> propeller associated with significant reductions in clearance rate. Mutations were first observed in 2003 and rose to 90% by 2014, consistent with a selection coefficient of ∼0.079. ART-R allele diversity rose until 2012 and then dropped as one allele (C580Y) spread to high frequency. The frequency with which adaptive alleles arise is determined by the rate of mutation and the population size. Two factors drive this soft sweep: (1) multiple <i>kelch13</i> amino-acid mutations confer resistance providing a large mutational target—we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ate the target is 87–163 bp. (2) The population mutation parameter (<i>Θ</i> = 2<i>N</i><sub>e</sub><i>μ</i>) can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ated from the frequency distribution of ART-R alleles and is ∼5.69, suggesting that short term effective population size is 88 thousand to 1.2 million. This is 52–705 times greater than <i>N</i><sub>e</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ated from fluctuation in allele frequencies, suggesting that we have previously under<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ated the capacity for adaptive evolution in <i>Plasmodium</i>. Our central conclusions are that retrospective studies may under<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ate the complexity of selective events and the <i>N</i><sub>e</sub> relevant for adaptation for malaria is considerably higher than previously <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ated.</p>

The metabolic cost of communicative sound production in bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>)
<p>Bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>) produce various communicative sounds that are important for social behavior, maintaining group cohesion and coordinating foraging. For example, whistle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion increases during disturbances, such as separations of mother–calf pairs and vessel approaches. It is clear that acoustic communication is important to the survival of these marine mammals, yet the metabolic cost of producing whistles and other socials sounds and the energetic consequences of modifying these sounds in response to both natural and anthropogenic disturbance are unknown. We used flow-through respirometry to determine whether the metabolic cost of sound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion could be quantified in two captive dolphins producing social sounds (whistles and squawks). On average, we found that metabolic rates measured during 2 min periods of sound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion were 1.2 times resting values. Up to 7 min were required for metabolism to return to resting values following vocal periods. The total metabolic cost (over resting values) of the 2 min vocal period plus the required recovery period (163.3 to 2995.9 ml O<sub>2</sub> or 3279.6 to 60,166.7 J) varied by individual as well as by mean duration of sounds produced within the vocal period. Observed variation in received cumulative sound energy levels of vocalizations was not related to total metabolic costs. Furthermore, our empirical findings did not agree with previous theoretical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ates of the metabolic cost of whistles. This study provides the first empirical data on the metabolic cost of sound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion in dolphins, which can be used to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ate metabolic costs of vocal responses to environmental perturbations in wild dolphins.</p>

Systolic Blood Pressure Trajectory, Frailty, and All-Cause Mortality >80 Years of Age
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Clinical trials show benefit from lowering systolic blood pressure (SBP) in people ≥80 years of age, but nonrandomized epidemiological studies suggest lower SBP may be associated with higher mortality. This study aimed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ate associations of SBP with all-cause mortality by frailty category >80 years of age and to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ate SBP trajectories before death.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A population-based cohort study was conducted using electronic health records of 144 403 participants ≥80 years of age registered with family practices in the United Kingdom from 2001 to 2014. Participants were followed for ≤5 years. Clinical records of SBP were analyzed. Frailty status was classified using the e-Frailty Index into the categories of fit, mild, moderate, and severe. All-cause mortality was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated by frailty status and mean SBP in Cox proportional-hazards models. SBP trajectories were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated using person months as observations, with mean SBP and antihypertensive treatment status <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ated for each person month. Fractional polynomial models were used to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ate SBP trajectories over 5 years before death.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>During follow-up, 51 808 deaths occurred. Mortality rates increased with frailty level and were greatest at SBP <110 mm Hg. In fit women, mortality was 7.7 per 100 person years at SBP 120 to 139 mm Hg, 15.2 at SBP 110 to 119 mm Hg, and 22.7 at SBP <110 mm Hg. For women with severe frailty, rates were 16.8, 25.2, and 39.6, respectively. SBP trajectories showed an accelerated decline in the last 2 years of life. The relative odds of SBP <120 mm Hg were higher in the last 3 months of life than 5 years previously in both treated (odds ratio, 6.06; 95% confidence interval, 5.40–6.81) and untreated (odds ratio, 6.31; 95% confidence interval, 5.30–7.52) patients. There was no evidence of intensification of antihypertensive therapy in the final 2 years of life.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>A terminal decline of SBP in the final 2 years of life suggests that nonrandomized epidemiological associations of low SBP with higher mortality may be accounted for by reverse causation if participants with lower blood pressure values are closer, on average, to the end of life.</p></sec>

Nuclear PTEN enhances the maturation of a microRNA regulon to limit MyD88-dependent susceptibility to sepsis
<p>Sepsis-induced organ damage is caused by systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), which results in substantial comorbidities. Therefore, it is of medical importance to identify molecular brakes that can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exploit</span></strong>ed to dampen inflammation and prevent the development of SIRS. We investigated the role of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) in suppressing SIRS, increasing microbial clearance, and preventing lung damage. Septic patients and mice with sepsis exhibited increased <i>PTEN</i> expression in leukocytes. Myeloid-specific <i>Pten</i> deletion in an animal model of sepsis increased bacterial loads and cytokine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion, which depended on enhanced myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance and resulted in mortality. PTEN-mediated induction of the microRNAs (miRNAs) miR125b and miR203b reduced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of MyD88. Loss- and gain-of-function assays demonstrated that PTEN induced miRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion by associating with and facilitating the nuclear localization of Drosha-Dgcr8, part of the miRNA-processing complex. Reconstitution of PTEN-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts with a mutant form of PTEN that does not localize to the nucleus resulted in retention of Drosha-Dgcr8 in the cytoplasm and impaired <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of mature miRNAs. Thus, we identified a regulatory pathway involving nuclear PTEN–mediated miRNA generation that limits the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of MyD88 and thereby limits sepsis-associated mortality.</p>

Root Cortical Senescence Improves Growth under Suboptimal Availability of N, P, and K
<p>Root cortical senescence (RCS) in Triticeae reduces nutrient uptake, nutrient content, respiration, and radial hydraulic conductance of root tissue. We used the functional-structural model <i>SimRoot</i> to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ate the functional implications of RCS in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) under suboptimal nitrate, phosphorus, and potassium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>ability. The utility of RCS was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated using sensitivity analyses in contrasting nutrient regimes. At flowering (80 d), RCS increased simulated plant growth by up to 52%, 73%, and 41% in nitrate-, phosphorus-, and potassium-limiting conditions, respectively. Plants with RCS had reduced nutrient requirement of root tissue for optimal plant growth, reduced total cumulative cortical respiration, and increased total carbon reserves. Nutrient reallocation during RCS had a greater effect on simulated plant growth than reduced respiration or nutrient uptake. Under low nutrient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>ability, RCS had greater benefit in plants with fewer tillers. RCS had greater benefit in phenotypes with fewer lateral roots at low nitrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>ability, but the opposite was true in low phosphorus or potassium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>ability. Additionally, RCS was quantified in field-grown barley in different nitrogen regimes. Field and virtual soil coring simulation results demonstrated that living cortical volume per root length (an indicator of RCS) decreased with depth in younger plants, while roots of older plants had very little living cortical volume per root length. RCS may be an adaptive trait for nutrient acquisition by reallocating nutrients from senescing tissue and secondarily by reducing root respiration. These simulated results suggest that RCS merits investigation as a breeding target for enhanced soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resourc</span></strong>e acquisition and edaphic stress tolerance.</p>

A High-Throughput, Field-Based Phenotyping Technology for Tall Biomass Crops
<p>Recent advances in omics technologies have not been accompanied by equally efficient, cost-effective, and accurate phenotyping methods required to dissect the genetic architecture of complex traits. Even though high-throughput phenotyping platforms have been developed for controlled environments, field-based aerial and ground technologies have only been designed and deployed for short-stature crops. Therefore, we developed and tested Phenobot 1.0, an auto-steered and self-propelled field-based high-throughput phenotyping platform for tall dense canopy crops, such as sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>). Phenobot 1.0 was equipped with laterally positioned and vertically stacked stereo RGB cameras. Images collected from 307 diverse sorghum lines were reconstructed in 3D for feature extraction. User interfaces were developed, and multiple algorithms were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated for their accuracy in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ating plant height and stem diameter. Tested feature extraction methods included the following: (1) User-interactive Individual Plant Height Extraction (UsIn-PHe) based on dense stereo three-dimensional reconstruction; (2) Automatic Hedge-based Plant Height Extraction (Auto-PHe) based on dense stereo 3D reconstruction; (3) User-interactive Dense Stereo Matching Stem Diameter Extraction; and (4) User-interactive Image Patch Stereo Matching Stem Diameter Extraction (IPaS-Di). Comparative genome-wide association analysis and ground-truth validation demonstrated that both UsIn-PHe and Auto-PHe were accurate methods to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ate plant height, while Auto-PHe had the additional advantage of being a completely automated process. For stem diameter, IPaS-Di generated the most accurate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ates of this biomass-related architectural trait. In summary, our technology was proven robust to obtain ground-based high-throughput plant architecture parameters of sorghum, a tall and densely planted crop species.</p>

Tight junction protein gene expression patterns and changes in transcript abundance during development of model fish gill epithelia
<p>In vertebrates, tight junction (TJ) proteins play an important role in epithelium formation and development, the maintenance of tissue integrity and regulation of TJ permeability. In this study, primary cultured model gill epithelia composed of pavement cells (PVCs) were used to examine TJ protein transcript <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance during the development of epithelium confluence and epithelium resistive properties. Differences in TJ protein expression patterns and transcript <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance between gill models composed of PVCs and models composed of PVCs and mitochondrion-rich cells (MRCs) were also examined. Marked alterations in TJ protein transcript <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance were observed as cells developed to confluence in flask-cultured model gill epithelia. In contrast, during the formation of tissue resistance in insert-cultured epithelia (i.e. epithelia cultured on a permeable substrate), changes in TJ protein mRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance were conservative, despite paracellular marker flux decreasing by orders of magnitude. In both cases significant changes in <i>claudin-8b, -8d, -27b, -28b</i> and -<i>32a</i> transcript <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance were observed, suggesting that temporal alterations in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of these genes are important end points of model gill epithelium integrity. When MRCs were present in cultured gill models, the mRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of several TJ proteins significantly altered and <i>claudin-10c, -10d</i> and -<i>33b</i> were only detected in preparations that included MRCs. These data provide insight into the role of select TJ proteins in the formation and development of gill epithelia and the maintenance of gill barrier properties. In addition, observations reveal a heterogeneous distribution of claudin TJ proteins in the gill epithelial cells of rainbow trout.</p>

Ecophysiological variables influencing Aleppo pine seed and cone production: a review
<p>The most interesting factors associated with seed and cone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of Aleppo pine were largely reviewed to identify broad patterns and potential effectiveness of reforestation efforts and planning. Aleppo pine cone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion and seed yields are relatively variable, with differences between spatial and temporal influences. These differences are considered, mainly between (i) year, (ii) stand characteristics and (iii) individual tree measurements. Annual variability among populations was recorded for cone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion per tree, based on influencing factors such as genetic characteristics, wetness, nutrient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>ability, insect pests and disease. In addition, some factors may affect Aleppo pine tree growth directly but may be affecting seed and cone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion indirectly. Therefore, reduced stand density results in less competition among Aleppo pine trees and accompanying understory flora, which subsequently increases the stem diameter and other tree dimensions, including seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion. This review suggests that reforestation planning, particularly thinning, will result in improved tree morphology that will increase Aleppo pine seed and cone crops. Wildfire intensity and stand conditions such as light and soil nutrient status are also examined.</p>

Diversity, Disparity, and Evolutionary Rate Estimation for Unresolved Yule Trees
<p>The branching structure of biological evolution confers statistical dependencies on phenotypic trait values in related organisms. For this reason, comparative macroevolutionary studies usually begin with an inferred phylogeny that describes the evolutionary relationships of the organisms of interest. The probability of the observed trait data can be computed by assuming a model for trait evolution, such as Brownian motion, over the branches of this fixed tree. However, the phylogenetic tree itself contributes statistical uncertainty to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ates of rates of phenotypic evolution, and many comparative evolutionary biologists regard the tree as a nuisance parameter. In this article, we present a framework for analytically integrating over unknown phylogenetic trees in comparative evolutionary studies by assuming that the tree arises from a continuous-time Markov branching model called the Yule process. To do this, we derive a closed-form expression for the distribution of phylogenetic diversity (PD), which is the sum of branch lengths connecting the species in a clade. We then present a generalization of PD which is equivalent to the expected trait disparity in a set of taxa whose evolutionary relationships are generated by a Yule process and whose traits evolve by Brownian motion. We find expressions for the distribution of expected trait disparity under a Yule tree. Given one or more observations of trait disparity in a clade, we perform fast likelihood-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ation of the Brownian variance for unresolved clades. Our method does not require simulation or a fixed phylogenetic tree. We conclude with a brief example illustrating Brownian rate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ation for 12 families in the mammalian order Carnivora, in which the phylogenetic tree for each family is unresolved.

Phylogenetic Signal Variation in the Genomes of <i>Medicago</i> (Fabaceae)
<p>Genome-scale data offer the opportunity to clarify phylogenetic relationships that are difficult to resolve with few loci, but they can also identify genomic regions with evolutionary history distinct from that of the species history. We collected whole-genome sequence data from 29 taxa in the legume genus <i>Medicago</i>, then aligned these sequences to the <i>Medicago truncatula</i> reference genome to confidently identify 87 596 variable homologous sites. We used this data set to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ate phylogenetic relationships among <i>Medicago</i> species, to investigate the number of sites needed to provide robust phylogenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ates and to identify specific genomic regions supporting topologies in conflict with the genome-wide phylogeny. Our full genomic data set resolves relationships within the genus that were previously intractable. Subsampling the data reveals considerable variation in phylogenetic signal and power in smaller subsets of the data. Even when sampling 5000 sites, no random sample of the data supports a topology identical to that of the genome-wide phylogeny. Phylogenetic relationships <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ated from 500-site sliding windows revealed genome regions supporting several alternative species relationships among recently diverged taxa, consistent with the expected effects of deep coalescence or introgression in the recent history of <i>Medicago</i>.

Cells alter their tRNA abundance to selectively regulate protein synthesis during stress conditions

RORγt limits the amount of the cytokine receptor γc through the prosurvival factor Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> in developing thymocytes
<p>The cytokine receptor subunit γc provides critical signals for T cell survival and differentiation. We investigated the molecular mechanism that controls the cell surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of γc during T cell development in the thymus. We found that the amount of γc was low on CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> double-positive (DP) thymocytes before their positive selection to become mature T cells. The transcription factor RORγt was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ant in immature DP thymocytes, and its loss resulted in an increase in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of surface γc, specifically on preselection DP cells. Rather than directly repressing expression of the gene encoding γc, RORγt acted through the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> to reduce the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of surface γc, which resulted in decreased cytokine signaling and was associated with inhibition of cell metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis. Accordingly, overexpression of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> in RORγt-deficient thymocytes restored the amount of surface γc to that present on normal preselection DP cells. Together, these data highlight a previously unappreciated role for RORγt and Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> in limiting γc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance at the cell surface and reveal a signaling circuit in which survival factors control cytokine signaling by limiting the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance and surface distribution of a receptor subunit shared by several cytokines.</p>

The host microRNA miR-301a blocks the IRF1-mediated neuronal innate immune response to Japanese encephalitis virus infection
<p>Effective recognition of viral components and the subsequent stimulation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of type I interferons (IFNs) is crucial for the induction of host antiviral immunity. The failure of the host to efficiently produce type I IFNs in response to infection by the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is linked with an increased probability for the disease to become lethal. JEV is a neurotropic virus of the <i>Flaviviridae</i> family that causes encephalitis in humans. JEV infection is regulated by several host factors, including microRNAs, which are conserved noncoding RNAs that participate in various physiological and pathological processes. We showed that the JEV-induced expression of <i>miR-301a</i> led to inhibition of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of type I IFN by reducing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ances of the transcription factor IFN regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) and the signaling protein suppressor of cytokine signaling 5 (SOCS5). Mechanistically, induction of <i>miR-301a</i> expression during JEV infection required the transcription factor nuclear factor κB. In mouse neurons, neutralization of miR-301a restored the host innate immune response by enabling IFN-β <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion, thereby restricting viral propagation. Inhibition of miR-301a in mouse brain rescued the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of IRF1 and SOCS5, increased the generation of IFN-β, and reduced the extent of JEV replication, thus improving mouse survival. Thus, our study suggests that the JEV-induced expression of <i>miR-301a</i> assists viral pathogenesis by suppressing IFN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion, which might be targeted by antiviral therapies.</p>

Midbrain dopamine neurons control judgment of time

However, a direct link between signals carried by dopamine neurons and temporal judgments is lacking.

Super-dry reforming of methane intensifies CO<sub>2</sub> utilization via Le Chatelier’s principle
<p>Efficient CO<sub>2</sub> transformation from a waste <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong> to a carbon source for chemicals and fuels will require reaction conditions that effect its reduction. We developed a “super-dry” CH<sub>4</sub> reforming reaction for enhanced CO <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion from CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>. We used Ni/MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> as a CH<sub>4</sub>-reforming catalyst, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> as a solid oxygen carrier, and CaO/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> as a CO<sub>2</sub> sorbent. The isothermal coupling of these three different processes resulted in higher CO <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion as compared with that of conventional dry reforming, by avoiding back reactions with water. The reduction of iron oxide was intensified through CH<sub>4</sub> conversion to syngas over Ni and CO<sub>2</sub> extraction and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">storag</span></strong>e as CaCO<sub>3</sub>. CO<sub>2</sub> is then used for iron reoxidation and CO <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exploit</span></strong>ing equilibrium shifts effected with inert gas sweeping (Le Chatelier’s principle). Super-dry reforming uses up to three CO<sub>2</sub> molecules per CH<sub>4</sub> and offers a high CO space-time yield of 7.5 millimole CO per second per kilogram of iron at 1023 kelvin.</p>

Photochemical Route for Accessing Amorphous Metal Oxide Materials for Water Oxidation Catalysis

Construction and Optimization of a Large Gene Coexpression Network in Maize Using RNA-Seq Data
<p>With the emergence of massively parallel sequencing, genomewide expression data <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion has reached an unprecedented level. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of data has greatly facilitated maize research, but may not be amenable to traditional analysis techniques that were optimized for other data types. Using publicly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>able data, a gene coexpression network (GCN) can be constructed and used for gene function prediction, candidate gene selection, and improving understanding of regulatory pathways. Several GCN studies have been done in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), mostly using microarray datasets. To build an optimal GCN from plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als RNA-Seq data, parameters for expression data normalization and network inference were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated. A comprehensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ation of these two parameters and a ranked aggregation strategy on network performance, using libraries from 1266 maize samples, were conducted. Three normalization methods and 10 inference methods, including six correlation and four mutual information methods, were tested. The three normalization methods had very similar performance. For network inference, correlation methods performed better than mutual information methods at some genes. Increasing sample size also had a positive effect on GCN. Aggregating single networks together resulted in improved performance compared to single networks.</p>

Biosynthesis of Diterpenoids in <i>Tripterygium</i> Adventitious Root Cultures
<p>Adventitious root cultures were developed from <i>Tripterygium regelii</i>, and growth conditions were optimized for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of diterpenoids, which can be collected directly from the medium. An analysis of publicly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>able transcriptome data sets collected with <i>T. regelii</i> roots and root cultures indicated the presence of a large gene family (with 20 members) for terpene synthases (TPSs). Nine candidate diterpene synthase genes were selected for follow-up functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ation, of which two belonged to the TPS-c, three to the TPS-e/f, and four to the TPS-b subfamilies. These genes were characterized by heterologous expression in a modular metabolic engineering system in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. Members of the TPS-c subfamily were characterized as copalyl diphosphate (diterpene) synthases, and those belonging to the TPS-e/f subfamily catalyzed the formation of precursors of kaurane diterpenoids. The TPS-b subfamily encompassed genes coding for enzymes involved in abietane diterpenoid biosynthesis and others with activities as monoterpene synthases. The structural characterization of diterpenoids accumulating in the medium of <i>T. regelii</i> adventitious root cultures, facilitated by searching the Spektraris online spectral database, enabled us to formulate a biosynthetic pathway for the biosynthesis of triptolide, a diterpenoid with pharmaceutical potential. Considering the significant enrichment of diterpenoids in the culture medium, fast-growing adventitious root cultures may hold promise as a sustainable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resourc</span></strong>e for the large-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of triptolide.</p>

Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Phosphatases Affect UV-B-Induced Stomatal Closure via Controlling NO in Guard Cells
<p>Ultraviolet B (UV-B) radiation induces the activation of MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE PHOSPHATASE1 (MKP1) and its targets MPK3 and MPK6, but whether they participate in UV-B guard cell signaling is not clear. Here, evidence shows that UV-B-induced stomatal closure in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) is antagonistically regulated by MKP1 and MPK6 via modulating hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)-induced nitric oxide (NO) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion in guard cells. The <i>mkp1</i> mutant was hypersensitive to UV-B-induced stomatal closure and NO <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion in guard cells but not to UV-B-induced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion, suggesting that MKP1 negatively regulates UV-B-induced stomatal closure via inhibiting NO generation in guard cells. Moreover, MPK3 and MPK6 were activated by UV-B in leaves of the wild type and hyperactivated in the <i>mkp1</i> mutant, but the UV-B-induced activation of MPK3 and MPK6 was largely inhibited in mutants for <i>ATRBOHD</i> and <i>ATRBOHF</i> but not in mutants for <i>NIA1</i> and <i>NIA2</i>. <i>mpk6</i> mutants showed defects of UV-B-induced NO <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion and stomatal closure but were normal in UV-B-induced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion, while stomata of <i>mpk3</i> mutants responded to UV-B just like those of the wild type. The defect of UV-B-induced stomatal closure in <i>mpk6</i> mutants was rescued by exogenous NO but not by exogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Furthermore, double mutant <i>mkp1</i>/<i>mpk6</i> and the single mutant <i>mpk6</i> showed the same responses to UV-B in terms of either stomatal movement or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and NO <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion. These data indicate that MPK6, but not MPK3, positively regulates UV-B-induced stomatal closure via acting downstream of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and upstream of NO, while MKP1 functions negatively in UV-B guard cell signaling via down-regulation of MPK6.</p>

Y Chromosome Analysis of Dingoes and Southeast Asian Village Dogs Suggests a Neolithic Continental Expansion from Southeast Asia Followed by Multiple Austronesian Dispersals
<p>Dogs originated more than 14,000 BP, but the location(s) where they first arose is uncertain. The earliest archeological evidence of ancient dogs was discovered in Europe and the Middle East, some 5–7 millennia before that from Southeast Asia. However, mitochondrial DNA analyses suggest that most modern dogs derive from Southeast Asia, which has fueled the controversial hypothesis that dog domestication originated in this region despite the lack of supporting archeological evidence. We propose and investigate with Y chromosomes an alternative hypothesis for the proximate origins of dogs from Southeast Asia—a massive Neolithic expansion of dogs from this region that largely replaced more primitive dogs to the west and north. Previous attempts to test matrilineal findings with independent patrilineal markers have lacked the necessary genealogical resolution and mutation rate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ates. Here, we used Y chromosome genotypes, composed of 29 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) and 5 single tandem repeats (STRs), from 338 Australian dingoes, New Guinea singing dogs, and village dogs from Island Southeast Asia, along with modern European breed dogs, to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ate the evolutionary mutation rates of Y chromosome STRs based on calibration to the independently known age of the dingo population. Dingoes exhibited a unique haplogroup characterized by a single distinguishing SNP mutation and 14 STR haplotypes. The age of the European haplogroup was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ated to be only 1.7 times older than that of the dingo population, suggesting an origin during the Neolithic rather than the Paleolithic (as predicted by the Southeast Asian origins hypothesis). We hypothesize that isolation of Neolithic dogs from wolves in Southeast Asia was a key step accelerating their phenotypic transformation, enhancing their value in trade and as cargo, and enabling them to rapidly expand and replace more primitive dogs to the West. Our findings also suggest that dingoes could have arrived in Australia directly from Taiwan, independently of later dispersals of dogs through Thailand to Island Southeast Asia.</p>

<i>Enterococcus faecalis</i> Infective Endocarditis
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Because of the nephrotoxic effects of aminoglycosides, the Danish guidelines on infective endocarditis were changed in January 2007, reducing gentamicin treatment in enterococcal infective endocarditis from 4 to 6 weeks to only 2 weeks. In this pilot study, we compare outcomes in patients with <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i> infective endocarditis treated in the years before and after endorsement of these new recommendations.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>A total of 84 consecutive patients admitted with definite left-sided <i>E faecalis</i> endocarditis in the period of 2002 to 2011 were enrolled. Forty-one patients were treated before and 43 patients were treated after January 1, 2007. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics. At hospitalization, the 2 groups had similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ated glomerular filtration rates of 66 and 75 mL/min (<i>P</i>=0.22). Patients treated before January 2007 received gentamicin for a significantly longer period (28 versus 14 days; <i>P</i><0.001). The primary outcome, 1-year event-free survival, did not differ: 66% versus 69%, respectively (<i>P</i>=0.75). At discharge, the patients treated before 2007 had a lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ated glomerular filtration rate (45 versus 66 mL/min; <i>P</i>=0.008) and a significantly greater decrease in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ated glomerular filtration rate (median, 11 versus 1 mL/min; <i>P</i>=0.009) compared with those treated after 2007.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Our present pilot study suggests that the recommended 2-week treatment with gentamicin seems adequate and preferable in treating non–high-level aminoglycoside-resistant <i>E faecalis</i> infective endocarditis. The longer duration of gentamicin treatment is associated with worse renal function. Although the certainty of the clinical outcomes is limited by the sample size, outcomes appear to be no worse with the shorter treatment duration. Randomized, controlled studies are warranted to substantiate these results.</p></sec>

State-to-state chemistry for three-body recombination in an ultracold rubidium gas
<p>Experimental investigation of chemical reactions with full quantum state resolution for all reactants and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>s has been a long-term challenge. Here we prepare an ultracold few-body quantum state of reactants and demonstrate state-to-state chemistry for the recombination of three spin-polarized ultracold rubidium (Rb) atoms to form a weakly bound Rb<sub>2</sub> molecule. The measured <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong> distribution covers about 90% of the final <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>s, and we are able to discriminate between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong> states with a level splitting as small as 20 megahertz multiplied by Planck’s constant. Furthermore, we formulate propensity rules for the distribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>s, and we develop a theoretical model that predicts many of our experimental observations. The scheme can readily be adapted to other species and opens a door to detailed investigations of inelastic or reactive processes.</p>

Estimating economic damage from climate change in the United States
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ates of climate change damage are central to the design of climate policies. Here, we develop a flexible architecture for computing damages that integrates climate science, econometric analyses, and process models. We use this approach to construct spatially explicit, probabilistic, and empirically derived <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ates of economic damage in the United States from climate change. The combined value of market and nonmarket damage across analyzed sectors—agriculture, crime, coastal storms, energy, human mortality, and labor—increases quadratically in global mean temperature, costing roughly 1.2% of gross domestic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong> per +1°C on average. Importantly, risk is distributed unequally across locations, generating a large transfer of value northward and westward that increases economic inequality. By the late 21st century, the poorest third of counties are projected to experience damages between 2 and 20% of county income (90% chance) under business-as-usual emissions (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5).</p>

Using climate models to estimate the quality of global observational data sets
<p>Observational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ates of the climate system are essential to monitoring and understanding ongoing climate change and to assessing the quality of climate models used to produce near- and long-term climate information. This study poses the dual and unconventional question: Can climate models be used to assess the quality of observational references? We show that this question not only rests on solid theoretical grounds but also offers insightful applications in practice. By comparing four observational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>s of sea surface temperature with a large multimodel climate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forecast</span></strong> ensemble, we find compelling evidence that models systematically score better against the most recent, advanced, but also most independent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>. These results call for generalized procedures of model-observation comparison and provide guidance for a more objective observational data set selection.</p>

Positive biodiversity-productivity relationship predominant in global forests
<p>The biodiversity-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ivity relationship (BPR) is foundational to our understanding of the global extinction crisis and its impacts on ecosystem functioning. Understanding BPR is critical for the accurate valuation and effective conservation of biodiversity. Using ground-sourced data from 777,126 permanent plots, spanning 44 countries and most terrestrial biomes, we reveal a globally consistent positive concave-down BPR, showing that continued biodiversity loss would result in an accelerating decline in forest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ivity worldwide. The value of biodiversity in maintaining commercial forest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ivity alone—US$166 billion to 490 billion per year according to our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ation—is more than twice what it would cost to implement effective global conservation. This highlights the need for a worldwide reassessment of biodiversity values, forest management strategies, and conservation priorities.</p>

Synthetic nacre by predesigned matrix-directed mineralization
<p>Although biomimetic designs are expected to play a key role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">explor</span></strong>ing future structural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als, facile fabrication of bulk biomimetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als under ambient conditions remains a major challenge. Here, we describe a mesoscale “assembly-and-mineralization” approach inspired by the natural process in mollusks to fabricate bulk synthetic nacre that highly resembles both the chemical composition and the hierarchical structure of natural nacre. The millimeter-thick synthetic nacre consists of alternating organic layers and aragonite platelet layers (91 weight percent) and exhibits good ultimate strength and fracture toughness. This predesigned matrix-directed mineralization method represents a rational strategy for the preparation of robust composite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als with hierarchically ordered structures, where various constituents are adaptable, including brittle and heat-labile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als.</p>

Tri-Hydroxy-Triacylglycerol Is Efficiently Produced by Position-Specific Castor Acyltransferases
<p>Understanding the biochemistry of triacylglycerol (TAG) assembly is critical in tailoring seed oils to produce high-value <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>s. Hydroxy-fatty acid (HFA) is one such valuable modified fatty acid, which can be produced at low levels in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed through transgenic expression of the castor (<i>Ricinus communis</i>) hydroxylase. The resulting plants have low seed oil content and poor seedling establishment, indicating that Arabidopsis lacks efficient metabolic networks for biosynthesis and catabolism of hydroxy-containing TAG. To improve utilization of such substrates, we expressed three castor acyltransferase enzymes that incorporate HFA at each stereochemical position during TAG synthesis. This produced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ant tri-HFA TAG and concentrated 44% of seed HFA moieties into this one TAG species. Ricinoleic acid was more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ant than any other fatty acid in these seeds, which had 3-fold more HFA by weight than that in seeds following simple hydroxylase expression, the highest yet measured in a nonnative plant. Efficient utilization of hydroxy-containing lipid substrates increased the rate of TAG synthesis 2-fold, leading to complete relief of the low-oil phenotype. Partition of HFA into specific TAG molecules increased the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">storag</span></strong>e lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>able for mobilization during seedling development, resulting in a 1.9-fold increase in seedling establishment. Expression of a complete acyltransferase pathway to efficiently process HFA establishes a benchmark in the quest to successfully produce modified oils in plants.</p>

Parts-Prospecting for a High-Efficiency Thiamin Thiazole Biosynthesis Pathway
<p>Plants synthesize the thiazole precursor of thiamin (cThz-P) via THIAMIN4 (THI4), a suicide enzyme that mediates one reaction cycle and must then be degraded and resynthesized. It has been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ated that this THI4 turnover consumes 2% to 12% of the maintenance energy budget and that installing an energy-efficient alternative pathway could substantially increase crop yield potential. Available data point to two natural alternatives to the suicidal THI4 pathway: (i) nonsuicidal prokaryotic THI4s that lack the active-site Cys residue on which suicide activity depends, and (ii) an uncharacterized thiazole synthesis pathway in flowers of the tropical arum lily <i>Caladium bicolor</i> that enables <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion and emission of large amounts of the cThz-P analog 4-methyl-5-vinylthiazole (MVT). We used functional complementation of an <i>Escherichia coli</i> Δ<i>thiG</i> strain to identify a nonsuicidal bacterial THI4 (from <i>Thermovibrio ammonificans</i>) that can function in conditions like those in plant cells. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">explor</span></strong>ed whether <i>C. bicolor</i> synthesizes MVT de novo via a novel route, via a suicidal or a nonsuicidal THI4, or by catabolizing thiamin. Analysis of developmental changes in MVT emission, extractable MVT, thiamin level, and THI4 expression indicated that <i>C. bicolor</i> flowers make MVT de novo via a massively expressed THI4 and that thiamin is not involved. Functional complementation tests indicated that <i>C. bicolor</i> THI4, which has the active-site Cys needed to operate suicidally, may be capable of suicidal and – in hypoxic conditions – nonsuicidal operation. <i>T. ammonificans</i> and <i>C. bicolor</i> THI4s are thus candidate parts for rational redesign or directed evolution of efficient, nonsuicidal THI4s for use in crop improvement.</p>

Going with the Flow: Multiscale Insights into the Composite Nature of Water Transport in Roots
<p>As water often limits crop <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion, a more complete understanding of plant water capture and transport is necessary. Here, we developed MECHA, a mathematical model that computes the flow of water across the root at the scale of walls, membranes, and plasmodesmata of individual cells, and used it to test hypotheses related to root water transport in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). The model uses detailed root anatomical descriptions and a minimal set of experimental cell properties, including the conductivity of plasma membranes, cell walls, and plasmodesmata, which yield quantitative and scale-consistent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ations of water pathways and root radial hydraulic conductivity (<i>k</i><sub>r</sub>). MECHA revealed that the mainstream hydraulic theories derived independently at the cell and root segment scales are compatible only if osmotic potentials within the apoplastic domains are uniform. The results suggested that the convection-diffusion of apoplastic solutes explained most of the offset between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ated <i>k</i><sub>r</sub> in pressure clamp and osmotic experiments, while the contribution of water-filled intercellular spaces was limited. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses quantified the relative impact of cortex and endodermis cell conductivity of plasma membranes on root <i>k</i><sub>r</sub> and suggested that only the latter contributed substantially to <i>k</i><sub>r</sub> due to the composite nature of water flow across roots. The explicit root hydraulic anatomy framework brings insights into contradictory interpretations of experiments from the literature and suggests experiments to efficiently address questions pertaining to root water relations. Its scale consistency opens avenues for cross-scale communication in the world of root hydraulics.</p>

TCS: A New Multiple Sequence Alignment Reliability Measure to Estimate Alignment Accuracy and Improve Phylogenetic Tree Reconstruction
<p>Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is a key modeling procedure when analyzing biological sequences. Homology and evolutionary modeling are the most common applications of MSAs. Both are known to be sensitive to the underlying MSA accuracy. In this work, we show how this problem can be partly overcome using the transitive consistency score (TCS), an extended version of the T-Coffee scoring scheme. Using this local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ation function, we show that one can identify the most reliable portions of an MSA, as judged from BAliBASE and PREFAB structure-based reference alignments. We also show how this measure can be used to improve phylogenetic tree reconstruction using both an established simulated data set and a novel empirical yeast data set. For this purpose, we describe a novel lossless alternative to site filtering that involves overweighting the trustworthy columns. Our approach relies on the T-Coffee framework; it uses libraries of pairwise alignments to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ate any third party MSA. Pairwise projections can be produced using fast or slow methods, thus allowing a trade-off between speed and accuracy. We compared TCS with Heads-or-Tails, GUIDANCE, Gblocks, and trimAl and found it to lead to significantly better <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ates of structural accuracy and more accurate phylogenetic trees.

Modular radical cross-coupling with sulfones enables access to sp<sup>3</sup>-rich (fluoro)alkylated scaffolds
<p>Cross-coupling chemistry is widely applied to carbon-carbon bond formation in the synthesis of medicines, agrochemicals, and other functional materials. Recently, single-electron–induced variants of this reaction class have proven particularly useful in the formation of C(sp<sup>2</sup>)–C(sp<sup>3</sup>) linkages, although certain compound classes have remained a challenge. Here, we report the use of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfon</span></strong>es to activate the alkyl coupling partner in nickel-catalyzed radical cross-coupling with aryl zinc reagents. This method’s tolerance of fluoroalkyl substituents proved particularly advantageous for the streamlined preparation of pharmaceutically oriented fluorinated scaffolds that previously required multiple steps, toxic reagents, and nonmodular retrosynthetic blueprints. Five specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfon</span></strong>e reagents facilitate the rapid assembly of a vast set of compounds, many of which contain challenging fluorination patterns.</p>

Multivalent counterions diminish the lubricity of polyelectrolyte brushes
<p>Polyelectrolyte brushes provide wear protection and lubrication in many technical, medical, physiological, and biological applications. Wear resistance and low friction are attributed to counterion osmotic pressure and the hydration layer surrounding the charged polymer segments. However, the presence of multivalent counterions in solution can strongly affect the interchain interactions and structural properties of brush layers. We evaluated the lubrication properties of polystyrene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfon</span></strong>ate brush layers sliding against each other in aqueous solutions containing increasing concentrations of counterions. The presence of multivalent ions (Y<sup>3+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Ba<sup>2+</sup>), even at minute concentrations, markedly increases the friction forces between brush layers owing to electrostatic bridging and brush collapse. Our results suggest that the lubricating properties of polyelectrolyte brushes in multivalent solution are hindered relative to those in monovalent solution.</p>

Two-billion-year-old evaporites capture Earth’s great oxidation
<p>Major changes in atmospheric and ocean chemistry occurred in the Paleoproterozoic era (2.5 to 1.6 billion years ago). Increasing oxidation dramatically changed Earth’s surface, but few quantitative constraints exist on this important transition. This study describes the sedimentology, mineralogy, and geochemistry of a 2-billion-year-old, ~800-meter-thick evaporite succession from the Onega Basin in Russian Karelia. The deposit consists of a basal unit dominated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">halit</span></strong>e (~100 meters) followed by units dominated by anhydrite-magnesite (~500 meters) and dolomite-magnesite (~200 meters). The evaporite minerals robustly constrain marine sulfate concentrations to at least 10 millimoles per kilogram of water, representing an oxidant reservoir equivalent to more than 20% of the modern ocean-atmosphere oxidizing capacity. These results show that substantial amounts of surface oxidant accumulated during this critical transition in Earth’s oxygenation.</p>

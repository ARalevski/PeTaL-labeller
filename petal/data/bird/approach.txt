Auxin Function in the Brown Alga <i>Dictyota dichotoma</i>
<p>Auxin controls body plan patterning in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants and has been proposed to play a similar role in the development of brown algae (Phaeophyta) despite their distant evolutionary relationship with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants. The mechanism of auxin action in brown algae remains controversial because of contradicting conclusions derived from pharmacological studies on <i>Fucus</i>. In this study, we used <i>Dictyota</i> <i>dichotoma</i> as a model system to show that auxin plays a role during the apical-basal patterning of the embryo of brown algae. Indole-3-acetic acid was detectable in <i>D. dichotoma</i> germlings and mature tissue. Although two-celled <i>D. dichotoma</i> zygotes normally develop a rhizoid from one pole and a thallus meristem from the other, addition of exogenous auxins to one-celled embryos affected polarization, and both poles of the spheroidal embryo developed into rhizoids instead. The effect was strongest at lower pH and when variable extrinsic informational cues were applied. 2-[4-(diethylamino)-2-hydroxybenzoyl]benzoic acid, an inhibitor of the ABC-B/multidrug resistance/P-glycoprotein subfamily of transporters in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants, affected rhizoid formation by increasing rhizoid branching and inducing ectopic rhizoids. An in silico survey of auxin genes suggested that a diverse range of biosynthesis genes and transport genes, such as PIN-LIKES, and the ATP-binding cassette subfamily (ABC-B/multidrug resistance/P-glycoprotein) transporters from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants have homologs in <i>D. dichotoma</i> and <i>Ectocarpus siliculosus</i>. Together with reports on auxin function in basal lineages of green algae, these results suggest that auxin function predates the divergence between the green and brown lineage and the transition toward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants.</p>

Primitive Auxin Response without TIR1 and Aux/IAA in the Charophyte Alga <i>Klebsormidium nitens</i>
<p>The phytohormone auxin regulates many aspects of growth and development in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants, but the origin and evolution of auxin signaling and response mechanisms remain largely unknown. Indeed, it remains to be investigated whether auxin-related pathways diverged before the emergence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants. To address this knowledge deficit, we analyzed auxin responses in the charophyte alga <i>Klebsormidium nitens</i> NIES-2285, whose ancestor diverged from a green algal ancestor during the evolution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants. This strain is the same as <i>Klebsormidium flaccidum</i> NIES-2285, for which the draft genome was sequenced in 2014, and was taxonomically reclassified as <i>K. nitens</i>. This genome sequence revealed genes involved in auxin responses. Furthermore, the auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) was detected in cultures of <i>K. nitens</i>, but <i>K. nitens</i> lacks the central regulators of the canonical auxin-signaling pathway found in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants. Exogenous IAA inhibited cell division and cell elongation in <i>K. nitens</i>. Inhibitors of auxin biosynthesis and of polar auxin transport also inhibited cell division and elongation. Moreover, exogenous IAA rapidly induced expression of a LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES-DOMAIN transcription factor. These results suggest that <i>K. nitens</i> has acquired the part of the auxin system that regulates transcription and cell growth without the requirement for the central players that govern auxin signaling in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants.</p>

Classifying drivers of global forest loss
<p>Global maps of forest loss depict the scale and magnitude of forest disturbance, yet companies, governments, and nongovernmental organizations need to distinguish permanent conversion (i.e., deforestation) from temporary loss from forestry or wildfire. Using satellite imagery, we developed a forest loss classification model to determine a spatial attribution of forest disturbance to the dominant drivers of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> cover and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> use change over the period 2001 to 2015. Our results indicate that 27% of global forest loss can be attributed to deforestation through permanent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> use change for commodity production. The remaining areas maintained the same <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> use over 15 years; in those areas, loss was attributed to forestry (26%), shifting agriculture (24%), and wildfire (23%). Despite corporate commitments, the rate of commodity-driven deforestation has not declined. To end deforestation, companies must eliminate 5 million hectares of conversion from supply chains each year.</p>

A Novel N-Methyltransferase in Arabidopsis Appears to Feed a Conserved Pathway for Nicotinate Detoxification among Land Plants and Is Associated with Lignin Biosynthesis
<p>The Preiss-Handler pathway, which salvages nicotinate (NA) for NAD synthesis, is an indispensable biochemical pathway in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants. Various NA conjugations (mainly methylation and glycosylation) have been detected and have long been proposed for NA detoxification in plants. Previously, we demonstrated that NA <i>O</i>-glucosylation functions as a mobilizable storage form for NAD biosynthesis in the Brassicaceae. However, little is known about the functions of other NA conjugations in plants. In this study, we first found that <i>N</i>-methylnicotinate is a ubiquitous NA conjugation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants. Furthermore, we functionally identified a novel methyltransferase (At3g53140; NA<i>N</i>MT), which is mainly responsible for <i>N</i>-methylnicotinate formation, from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We also established that trigonelline is a detoxification form of endogenous NA in plants. Combined phylogenetic analysis and enzymatic assays revealed that NA <i>N</i>-methylation activity was likely derived from the duplication and subfunctionalization of an ancestral caffeic acid <i>O</i>-methyltransferase (<i>COMT</i>) gene in the course of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plant evolution. COMT enzymes, which function in <i>S</i>-lignin biosynthesis, also have weak NA<i>N</i>MT activity. Our data suggest that NA detoxification conferred by NA<i>N</i>MT and COMT might have facilitated the retention of the Preiss-Handler pathway in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants.</p>

Origins and Evolution of Stomatal Development
<p>The fossil record suggests stomata-like pores were present on the surfaces of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants over 400 million years ago. Whether stomata arose once or whether they arose independently across newly evolving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plant lineages has long been a matter of debate. In Arabidopsis, a genetic toolbox has been identified that tightly controls stomatal development and patterning. This includes the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors <i>SPEECHLESS</i> (<i>SPCH</i>), <i>MUTE</i>, <i>FAMA</i>, and <i>ICE/SCREAMs</i> (<i>SCRMs</i>), which promote stomatal formation. These factors are regulated via a signaling cascade, which includes mobile <i>EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR</i> (<i>EPF</i>) peptides to enforce stomatal spacing. Mosses and hornworts, the most ancient extant lineages to possess stomata, possess orthologs of these Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) stomatal toolbox genes, and manipulation in the model bryophyte <i>Physcomitrella patens</i> has shown that the bHLH and EPF components are also required for moss stomatal development and patterning. This supports an ancient and tightly conserved genetic origin of stomata. Here, we review recent discoveries and, by interrogating newly available plant genomes, we advance the story of stomatal development and patterning across <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plant evolution. Furthermore, we identify potential orthologs of the key toolbox genes in a hornwort, further supporting a single ancient genetic origin of stomata in the ancestor to all stomatous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants.</p>

Climate change: The 2015 Paris Agreement thresholds and Mediterranean basin ecosystems
<p>The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Paris Agreement of December 2015 aims to maintain the global average warming well below 2°C above the preindustrial level.

We compare scenarios of climate-driven future change in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> ecosystems with reconstructed ecosystem dynamics during the past 10,000 years. Only a 1.5°C warming scenario permits ecosystems to remain within the Holocene variability. At or above 2°C of warming, climatic change will generate Mediterranean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> ecosystem changes that are unmatched in the Holocene, a period characterized by recurring precipitation deficits rather than temperature anomalies.</p>

Massive Tandem Proliferation of ELIPs Supports Convergent Evolution of Desiccation Tolerance across Land Plants
<p>Desiccation tolerance was a critical adaptation for the colonization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> by early nonvascular plants. Resurrection plants have maintained or rewired these ancestral protective mechanisms, and desiccation-tolerant species are dispersed across the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plant phylogeny. Although common physiological, biochemical, and molecular signatures are observed across resurrection plant lineages, features underlying the recurrent evolution of desiccation tolerance are unknown. Here we used a comparative approach to identify patterns of genome evolution and gene duplication associated with desiccation tolerance. We identified a single gene family with dramatic expansion in all sequenced resurrection plant genomes and no expansion in desiccation-sensitive species. This gene family of early light-induced proteins (ELIPs) expanded in resurrection plants convergent through repeated tandem gene duplication. ELIPs are universally highly expressed during desiccation in all surveyed resurrection plants and may play a role in protecting against photooxidative damage of the photosynthetic apparatus during prolonged dehydration. Photosynthesis is particularly sensitive to dehydration, and the increased abundance of ELIPs may help facilitate the rapid recovery observed for most resurrection plants. Together, these observations support convergent evolution of desiccation tolerance in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants through tandem gene duplication.</p>

Agriculturally dominated landscapes reduce bee phylogenetic diversity and pollination services

Whether phylogenetic diversity loss compromises ecosystem service delivery remains unknown. We address this knowledge gap using extensive genomic, community, and crop datasets to examine relationships among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> use, pollinator phylogenetic structure, and crop production. Pollinator communities in highly agricultural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong>scapes contain 230 million fewer years of evolutionary history; this loss was strongly associated with reduced crop yield and quality. Our study links <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong>scape–mediated changes in the phylogenetic structure of natural communities to the disruption of ecosystem services. Measuring conservation success by species counts alone may fail to protect ecosystem functions and the full diversity of life from which they are derived.</p>

Identity inference of genomic data using long-range familial searches

We project that about 60% of the searches for individuals of European <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">descent</span></strong> will result in a third-cousin or closer match, which theoretically allows their identification using demographic identifiers. Moreover, the technique could implicate nearly any U.S. individual of European <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">descent</span></strong> in the near future. We demonstrate that the technique can also identify research participants of a public sequencing project. On the basis of these results, we propose a potential mitigation strategy and policy implications for human subject research.</p>

Global extent of rivers and streams
<p>The turbulent surfaces of rivers and streams are natural hotspots of biogeochemical exchange with the atmosphere. At the global scale, the total river-atmosphere flux of trace gasses such as carbon dioxide depends on the proportion of Earth’s surface that is covered by the fluvial network, yet the total surface area of rivers and streams is poorly constrained. We used a global database of planform river hydromorphology and a statistical approach to show that global river and stream surface area at mean annual discharge is 773,000 ± 79,000 square kilometers (0.58 ± 0.06%) of Earth’s nonglaciated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> surface, an area 44 ± 15% larger than previous spatial estimates.

The evolutionary history of dogs in the Americas

We sequenced 71 mitochondrial and 7 nuclear genomes from ancient North American and Siberian dogs from time frames spanning ~9000 years. Our analysis indicates that American dogs were not derived from North American wolves. Instead, American dogs form a monophyletic lineage that likely originated in Siberia and dispersed into the Americas alongside people. After the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arriv</span></strong>al of Europeans, native American dogs almost completely disappeared, leaving a minimal genetic legacy in modern dog populations. The closest detectable extant lineage to precontact American dogs is the canine transmissible venereal tumor, a contagious cancer clone derived from an individual dog that lived up to 8000 years ago.</p>

One-third of global protected land is under intense human pressure

For protected areas designated before the Convention on Biological Diversity was ratified in 1992, 55% have since experienced human pressure increases.

Transparent reporting on human pressure within protected areas is now critical, as are global targets aimed at efforts required to halt biodiversity loss.</p>

Evolution of alluvial mudrock forced by early land plants
<p>Mudrocks are a primary archive of Earth’s history from the Archean eon to recent times, and their source-to-sink production and deposition play a central role in long-term ocean chemistry and climate regulation. Using original and published stratigraphic data from all 704 of Earth’s known alluvial formations from the Archean eon (3.5 billion years ago) to the Carboniferous period (0.3 billion years ago), we prove contentions of an upsurge in the proportion of mud retained on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> coeval with vegetation evolution. We constrain the onset of the upsurge to the Ordovician-Silurian and show that alluvium deposited after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plant evolution contains a proportion of mudrock that is, on average, 1.4 orders of magnitude greater than the proportion contained in alluvium from the preceding 90% of Earth’s history. We attribute this shift to the ways in which vegetation revolutionized mud production and sediment flux from continental interiors.</p>

Arabidopsis β-Amylase2 Is a K<sup>+</sup>-Requiring, Catalytic Tetramer with Sigmoidal Kinetics
<p>The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) genome contains nine β-amylase (<i>BAM</i>) genes, some of which play important roles in starch hydrolysis. However, little is known about BAM2, a plastid-localized enzyme reported to have extremely low catalytic activity. Using conservation of intron positions, we determined that the nine Arabidopsis <i>BAM</i> genes fall into two distinct subfamilies. A similar pattern was found in each major lineage of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants, suggesting that these subfamilies diverged prior to the origin of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis indicated that <i>BAM2</i> is the ancestral member of one of these subfamilies. This finding, along with the conservation of amino acids in the active site of BAM2, suggested that it might be catalytically active. We then identified KCl as necessary for BAM2 activity. Unlike BAM1, BAM3, and BAM5, three Arabidopsis BAMs that all exhibited hyperbolic kinetics, BAM2 exhibited sigmoidal kinetics with a Hill coefficient of over 3. Using multi-angle light scattering, we determined that BAM2 was a tetramer, whereas BAM5 was a monomer. Conserved residues from a diverse set of BAM2 orthologs were mapped onto a homology model of the protein, revealing a large, conserved surface away from the active site that we hypothesize is a secondary carbohydrate-binding site. Introduction of bulky methionine for glycine at two points on this surface reduced catalytic activity significantly without disrupting the tetrameric structure. Expression analysis indicated that BAM2 is more closely coexpressed with other starch degradation enzymes than any other BAM, suggesting that BAM2 may play an important role in starch degradation in plants.</p>

Insights into the Evolution of Hydroxyproline-Rich Glycoproteins from 1000 Plant Transcriptomes
<p>The carbohydrate-rich cell walls of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants and algae have been the focus of much interest given the value of cell wall-based products to our current and future economies. Hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs), a major group of wall glycoproteins, play important roles in plant growth and development, yet little is known about how they have evolved in parallel with the polysaccharide components of walls. We investigate the origins and evolution of the HRGP superfamily, which is commonly divided into three major multigene families: the arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs), extensins (EXTs), and proline-rich proteins. Using motif and amino acid bias, a newly developed bioinformatics pipeline, we identified HRGPs in sequences from the 1000 Plants transcriptome project (<ext-link>www.onekp.com</ext-link>). Our analyses provide new insights into the evolution of HRGPs across major evolutionary milestones, including the transition to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> and the early radiation of angiosperms. Significantly, data mining reveals the origin of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored AGPs in green algae and a 3- to 4-fold increase in GPI-AGPs in liverworts and mosses. The first detection of cross-linking (CL)-EXTs is observed in bryophytes, which suggests that CL-EXTs arose though the juxtaposition of preexisting SP<sub>n</sub> EXT glycomotifs with refined Y-based motifs. We also detected the loss of CL-EXT in a few lineages, including the grass family (Poaceae), that have a cell wall composition distinct from other monocots and eudicots. A key challenge in HRGP research is tracking individual HRGPs throughout evolution. Using the 1000 Plants output, we were able to find putative orthologs of Arabidopsis pollen-specific GPI-AGPs in basal eudicots.</p>

Fern Stomatal Responses to ABA and CO<sub>2</sub> Depend on Species and Growth Conditions
<p>Changing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels, climate, and air humidity affect plant gas exchange that is controlled by stomata, small pores on plant leaves and stems formed by guard cells. Evolution has shaped the morphology and regulatory mechanisms governing stomatal movements to correspond to the needs of various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plant groups over the past 400 million years. Stomata close in response to the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA), elevated CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, and reduced air humidity. Whether the active regulatory mechanisms that control stomatal closure in response to these stimuli are present already in mosses, the oldest plant group with stomata, or were acquired more recently in angiosperms remains controversial. It has been suggested that the stomata of the basal vascular plants, such as ferns and lycophytes, close solely hydropassively. On the other hand, active stomatal closure in response to ABA and CO<sub>2</sub> was found in several moss, lycophyte, and fern species. Here, we show that the stomata of two temperate fern species respond to ABA and CO<sub>2</sub> and that an active mechanism of stomatal regulation in response to reduced air humidity is present in some ferns. Importantly, fern stomatal responses depend on growth conditions. The data indicate that the stomatal behavior of ferns is more complex than anticipated before, and active stomatal regulation is present in some ferns and has possibly been lost in others. Further analysis that takes into account fern species, life history, evolutionary age, and growth conditions is required to gain insight into the evolution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plant stomatal responses.</p>

Evolutionary Conservation of ABA Signaling for Stomatal Closure<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Abscisic acid (ABA)-driven stomatal regulation reportedly evolved after the divergence of ferns, during the early evolution of seed plants approximately 360 million years ago. This hypothesis is based on the observation that the stomata of certain fern species are unresponsive to ABA, but exhibit passive hydraulic control. However, ABA-induced stomatal closure was detected in some mosses and lycophytes. Here, we observed that a number of ABA signaling and membrane transporter protein families diversified over the evolutionary history of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants. The aquatic ferns <i>Azolla filiculoides</i> and <i>Salvinia cucullata</i> have representatives of 23 families of proteins orthologous to those of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and all other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plant species studied. Phylogenetic analysis of the key ABA signaling proteins indicates an evolutionarily conserved stomatal response to ABA. Moreover, comparative transcriptomic analysis has identified a suite of ABA-responsive genes that differentially expressed in a terrestrial fern species, <i>Polystichum proliferum</i>. These genes encode proteins associated with ABA biosynthesis, transport, reception, transcription, signaling, and ion and sugar transport, which fit the general ABA signaling pathway constructed from Arabidopsis and <i>Hordeum vulgare</i>. The retention of these key ABA-responsive genes could have had a profound effect on the adaptation of ferns to dry conditions. Furthermore, stomatal assays have shown the primary evidence for ABA-induced closure of stomata in two terrestrial fern species <i>P</i>. <i>proliferum</i> and <i>Nephrolepis exaltata</i>. In summary, we report, to our knowledge, new molecular and physiological evidence for the presence of active stomatal control in ferns.</p>

Deep-diving sea lions exhibit extreme bradycardia in long-duration dives
<p>Heart rate and peripheral blood flow distribution are the primary determinants of the rate and pattern of oxygen store utilisation and ultimately breath-hold duration in marine endotherms. Despite this, little is known about how otariids (sea lions and fur seals) regulate heart rate (<i>f</i><sub>H</sub>) while diving. We investigated dive <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> in five adult female California sea lions (<i>Zalophus californianus</i>) during foraging trips by instrumenting them with digital electrocardiogram (ECG) loggers and time depth recorders. In all dives, dive <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> (number of beats/duration; 50±9 beats min<sup>−1</sup>) decreased compared with surface rates (113±5 beats min<sup>−1</sup>), with all dives exhibiting an instantaneous <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> below resting (<54 beats min<sup>−1</sup>) at some point during the dive. Both dive <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> and minimum instantaneous <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> significantly decreased with increasing dive duration. Typical instantaneous <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> profiles of deep dives (>100 m) consisted of: (1) an initial rapid decline in <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> resulting in the lowest instantaneous <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> of the dive at the end of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">descent</span></strong>, often below 10 beats min<sup>−1</sup> in dives longer than 6 min in duration; (2) a slight increase in <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> to ~10–40 beats min<sup>−1</sup> during the bottom portion of the dive; and (3) a gradual increase in <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> during ascent with a rapid increase prior to surfacing. Thus, <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> regulation in deep-diving sea lions is not simply a progressive bradycardia. Extreme bradycardia and the presumed associated reductions in pulmonary and peripheral blood flow during late <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">descent</span></strong> of deep dives should (a) contribute to preservation of the lung oxygen store, (b) increase dependence of muscle on the myoglobin-bound oxygen store, (c) conserve the blood oxygen store and (d) help limit the absorption of nitrogen at depth. This <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> profile during deep dives of sea lions may be characteristic of deep-diving marine endotherms that dive on inspiration as similar <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> profiles have been recently documented in the emperor penguin, another deep diver that dives on inspiration.</p>

Time to Epinephrine Administration and Survival From Nonshockable Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Among Children and Adults
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that earlier epinephrine administration is associated with improved survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with shockable initial rhythms. However, the effect of epinephrine timing on patients with nonshockable initial rhythms is unclear. The objective of this study was to measure the association between time to epinephrine administration and survival in adults and children with emergency medical services (EMS)–treated OHCA with nonshockable initial rhythms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed a secondary analysis of OHCAs prospectively identified by the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium network from June 4, 2011, to June 30, 2015. We included patients of all ages with an EMS-treated OHCA and an initial nonshockable rhythm. We excluded those with return of spontaneous circulation in <10 minutes. We conducted a subgroup analysis involving patients <18 years of age. The primary exposure was time (minutes) from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arriv</span></strong>al of the first EMS agency to the first dose of epinephrine. Secondary exposure was time to epinephrine dichotomized as early (<10 minutes) or late (≥10 minutes). The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. We adjusted for Utstein covariates and Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium study site.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>From 55 568 EMS-treated OHCAs, 32 101 patients with initial nonshockable rhythms were included. There were 12 238 in the early group, 14 517 in the late group, and 5346 not treated with epinephrine. After adjusting for potential confounders, each minute from EMS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arriv</span></strong>al to epinephrine administration was associated with a 4% decrease in odds of survival for adults, odds ratio=0.96 (95% confidence interval, 0.95–0.98). A subgroup analysis (n=13 290) examining neurological outcomes showed a similar association (adjusted odds ratio, 0.94 per minute; 95% confidence interval, 0.89–0.98). When epinephrine was given late in comparison with early, odds of survival were 18% lower (odds ratio, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.68–0.98). In a pediatric analysis (n=595), odds of survival were 9% lower (odds ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.81–1.01) for each minute delay in epinephrine.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among OHCAs with nonshockable initial rhythms, the majority of patients were administered epinephrine >10 minutes after EMS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arriv</span></strong>al. Each minute delay in epinephrine administration was associated with decreased survival and unfavorable neurological outcomes. EMS agencies should consider strategies to reduce epinephrine administration times in patients with initial nonshockable rhythms.</p></sec>

Optimizing a Drone Network to Deliver Automated External Defibrillators
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Public access defibrillation programs can improve survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, but automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are rarely available for bystander use at the scene. Drones are an emerging technology that can deliver an AED to the scene of an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest for bystander use. We hypothesize that a drone network designed with the aid of a mathematical model combining both optimization and queuing can reduce the time to AED <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arriv</span></strong>al.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We applied our model to 53 702 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests that occurred in the 8 regions of the Toronto Regional RescuNET between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2014. Our primary analysis quantified the drone network size required to deliver an AED 1, 2, or 3 minutes faster than historical median 911 response times for each region independently. A secondary analysis quantified the reduction in drone resources required if RescuNET was treated as a large coordinated region.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The region-specific analysis determined that 81 bases and 100 drones would be required to deliver an AED ahead of median 911 response times by 3 minutes. In the most urban region, the 90th percentile of the AED <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arriv</span></strong>al time was reduced by 6 minutes and 43 seconds relative to historical 911 response times in the region. In the most rural region, the 90th percentile was reduced by 10 minutes and 34 seconds. A single coordinated drone network across all regions required 39.5% fewer bases and 30.0% fewer drones to achieve similar AED delivery times.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>An optimized drone network designed with the aid of a novel mathematical model can substantially reduce the AED delivery time to an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest event.</p></sec>

The Receptor-Like Kinase AtVRLK1 Regulates Secondary Cell Wall Thickening
<p>During the growth and development of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants, some specialized cells, such as tracheary elements, undergo secondary cell wall thickening. Secondary cell walls contain additional lignin, compared with primary cell walls, thus providing mechanical strength and potentially improving defenses against pathogens. However, the molecular mechanisms that initiate wall thickening are unknown. In this study, we identified an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase, encoded by <i>AtVRLK1</i> (<i>Vascular-Related Receptor-Like Kinase1</i>), that is expressed specifically in cells undergoing secondary cell wall thickening. Suppression of <i>AtVRLK1</i> expression resulted in a range of phenotypes that included retarded early elongation of the inflorescence stem, shorter fibers, slower root growth, and shorter flower filaments. In contrast, up-regulation of <i>AtVRLK1</i> led to longer fiber cells, reduced secondary cell wall thickening in fiber and vessel cells, and defects in anther dehiscence. Molecular and cellular analyses showed that down-regulation of <i>AtVRLK1</i> promoted secondary cell wall thickening and up-regulation of <i>AtVRLK1</i> enhanced cell elongation and inhibited secondary cell wall thickening. We propose that AtVRLK1 functions as a signaling component in coordinating cell elongation and cell wall thickening during growth and development.</p>

Betaine Lipid Is Crucial for Adapting to Low Temperature and Phosphate Deficiency in <i>Nannochloropsis</i>
<p>Diacylglyceryl-<i>N,N,N</i>-trimethylhomo-Ser (DGTS) is a nonphosphorous, polar glycerolipid that is regarded as analogous to the phosphatidylcholine in bacteria, fungi, algae, and basal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants. In some species of algae, including the stramenopile microalga <i>Nannochloropsis oceanica</i>, DGTS contains an abundance of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which is relatively scarce in phosphatidylcholine, implying that DGTS has a unique physiological role. In this study, we addressed the role of DGTS in <i>N. oceanica</i>. We identified two DGTS biosynthetic enzymes that have distinct domain configurations compared to previously identified DGTS synthases. Mutants lacking DGTS showed growth retardation under phosphate starvation, demonstrating a pivotal role for DGTS in the adaptation to this condition. Under normal conditions, DGTS deficiency led to an increase in the relative amount of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol, a major plastid membrane lipid with high EPA content, whereas excessive production of DGTS induced by gene overexpression led to a decrease in monogalactosyldiacylglycerol. Meanwhile, lipid analysis of partial phospholipid-deficient mutants revealed a role for phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine in EPA biosynthesis. These results suggest that DGTS and monogalactosyldiacylglycerol may constitute the two major pools of EPA in extraplastidic and plastidic membranes, partially competing to acquire EPA or its precursors derived from phospholipids. The mutant lacking DGTS also displayed impaired growth and a lower proportion of EPA in extraplastidic compartments at low temperatures. Our results indicate that DGTS is involved in the adaptation to low temperatures through a mechanism that is distinct from the DGTS-dependent adaptation to phosphate starvation in <i>N. oceanica</i>.</p>

<i>ELIGULUM-A</i> Regulates Lateral Branch and Leaf Development in Barley
<p>The shoot apical and axillary meristems control shoot development, effectively influencing lateral branch and leaf formation. The barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) <i>uniculm2</i> (<i>cul2</i>) mutation blocks axillary meristem development, and mutant plants lack lateral branches (tillers) that normally develop from the crown. A genetic screen for <i>cul2</i> suppressors recovered two recessive alleles of <i>ELIGULUM-A</i> (<i>ELI-A</i>) that partially rescued the <i>cul2</i> tillering phenotype. Mutations in <i>ELI-A</i> produce shorter plants with fewer tillers and disrupt the leaf blade-sheath boundary, producing liguleless leaves and reduced secondary cell wall development in stems and leaves. <i>ELI-A</i> is predicted to encode an unannotated protein containing an RNaseH-like domain that is conserved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants. <i>ELI-A</i> transcripts accumulate at the preligule boundary, the developing ligule, leaf margins, cells destined to develop secondary cell walls, and cells surrounding leaf vascular bundles. Recent studies have identified regulatory similarities between boundary development in leaves and lateral organs. Interestingly, we observed <i>ELI-A</i> transcripts at the preligule boundary, suggesting that <i>ELI-A</i> contributes to boundary formation between the blade and sheath. However, we did not observe <i>ELI-A</i> transcripts at the axillary meristem boundary in leaf axils, suggesting that <i>ELI-A</i> is not involved in boundary development for axillary meristem development. Our results show that <i>ELI-A</i> contributes to leaf and lateral branch development by acting as a boundary gene during ligule development but not during lateral branch development.</p>

Fine-Tuning of Photosynthesis Requires CURVATURE THYLAKOID1-Mediated Thylakoid Plasticity
<p>The thylakoid membrane system of higher plant chloroplasts consists of interconnected subdomains of appressed and nonappressed membrane bilayers, known as grana and stroma lamellae, respectively. CURVATURE THYLAKOID1 (CURT1) protein complexes mediate the shape of grana stacks in a dosage-dependent manner and facilitate membrane curvature at the grana margins, the interface between grana and stroma lamellae. Although grana stacks are highly conserved among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants, the functional relevance of grana stacking remains unclear. Here, we show that inhibiting CURT1-mediated alteration of thylakoid ultrastructure in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) reduces photosynthetic efficiency and plant fitness under adverse, controlled, and natural light conditions. Plants that lack CURT1 show less adjustment of grana diameter, which compromises regulatory mechanisms like the photosystem II repair cycle and state transitions. Interestingly, CURT1A suffices to induce thylakoid membrane curvature in planta and thylakoid hyperbending in plants overexpressing CURT1A. We suggest that CURT1 oligomerization is regulated at the posttranslational level in a light-dependent fashion and that CURT1-mediated thylakoid plasticity plays an important role in fine-tuning photosynthesis and plant fitness during challenging growth conditions.</p>

Overexpression of RING Domain E3 Ligase ZmXerico1 Confers Drought Tolerance through Regulation of ABA Homeostasis
<p>Drought stress is one of the main environmental problems encountered by crop growers. Reduction in arable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> area and reduced water availability make it paramount to identify and develop strategies to allow crops to be more resilient in water-limiting environments. The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays an important role in the plants’ response to drought stress through its control of stomatal aperture and water transpiration, and transgenic modulation of ABA levels therefore represents an attractive avenue to improve the drought tolerance of crops. Several steps in the ABA-signaling pathway are controlled by ubiquitination involving really interesting new genes (RING) domain-containing proteins. We characterized the maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) RING protein family and identified two novel RING-H2 genes called <i>ZmXerico1</i> and <i>ZmXerico2</i>. Expression of <i>ZmXerico</i> genes is induced by drought stress, and we show that overexpression of <i>ZmXerico1</i> and <i>ZmXerico2</i> in Arabidopsis and maize confers ABA hypersensitivity and improved water use efficiency, which can lead to enhanced maize yield performance in a controlled drought-stress environment. Overexpression of <i>ZmXerico1</i> and <i>ZmXerico2</i> in maize results in increased ABA levels and decreased levels of ABA degradation products diphaseic acid and phaseic acid. We show that ZmXerico1 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, where ABA 8′-hydroxylases have been shown to be localized, and that it functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. We demonstrate that ZmXerico1 plays a role in the control of ABA homeostasis through regulation of ABA 8′-hydroxylase protein stability, representing a novel control point in the regulation of the ABA pathway.</p>

A Dynamic Hydro-Mechanical and Biochemical Model of Stomatal Conductance for C<sub>4</sub> Photosynthesis
<p>C<sub>4</sub> plants are major grain (maize [<i>Zea mays</i>] and sorghum [<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>]), sugar (sugarcane [<i>Saccharum officinarum</i>]), and biofuel (<i>Miscanthus</i> spp.) producers and contribute ∼20% to global productivity. Plants lose water through stomatal pores in order to acquire CO<sub>2</sub> (assimilation [<i>A</i>]) and control their carbon-for-water balance by regulating stomatal conductance (<i>g</i><sub>S</sub>). The ability to mechanistically predict <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> and <i>A</i> in response to atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, water availability, and time is critical for simulating stomatal control of plant-atmospheric carbon and water exchange under current, past, or future environmental conditions. Yet, dynamic mechanistic models for <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> are lacking, especially for C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. We developed and coupled a hydromechanical model of stomatal behavior with a biochemical model of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis, calibrated using gas-exchange measurements in maize, and extended the coupled model with time-explicit functions to predict dynamic responses. We demonstrated the wider applicability of the model with three additional C<sub>4</sub> grass species in which interspecific differences in stomatal behavior could be accounted for by fitting a single parameter. The model accurately predicted steady-state responses of <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> to light, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and oxygen, soil drying, and evaporative demand as well as dynamic responses to light intensity. Further analyses suggest that the effect of variable leaf hydraulic conductance is negligible. Based on the model, we derived a set of equations suitable for incorporation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> surface models. Our model illuminates the processes underpinning stomatal control in C<sub>4</sub> plants and suggests that the hydraulic benefits associated with fast stomatal responses of C<sub>4</sub> grasses may have supported the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis.</p>

Linking Auxin with Photosynthetic Rate via Leaf Venation
<p>Land plants lose vast quantities of water to the atmosphere during photosynthetic gas exchange. In angiosperms, a complex network of veins irrigates the leaf, and it is widely held that the density and placement of these veins determines maximum leaf hydraulic capacity and thus maximum photosynthetic rate. This theory is largely based on interspecific comparisons and has never been tested using vein mutants to examine the specific impact of leaf vein morphology on plant water relations. Here we characterize mutants at the <i>Crispoid</i> (<i>Crd</i>) locus in pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>), which have altered auxin homeostasis and activity in developing leaves, as well as reduced leaf vein density and aberrant placement of free-ending veinlets. This altered vein phenotype in <i>crd</i> mutant plants results in a significant reduction in leaf hydraulic conductance and leaf gas exchange. We find <i>Crispoid</i> to be a member of the <i>YUCCA</i> family of auxin biosynthetic genes. Our results link auxin biosynthesis with maximum photosynthetic rate through leaf venation and substantiate the theory that an increase in the density of leaf veins coupled with their efficient placement can drive increases in leaf photosynthetic capacity.</p>

MILDEW RESISTANCE LOCUS O Function in Pollen Tube Reception Is Linked to Its Oligomerization and Subcellular Distribution
<p>Sexual reproduction in flowering plants requires communication between synergid cells and a tip-elongating pollen tube (PT) for the successful delivery of sperm cells to the embryo sac. The reception of the PT relies on signaling within the synergid cell that ultimately leads to the degeneration of the receptive synergid and PT rupture, releasing the sperm cells for double fertilization. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), NORTIA, a member of the MILDEW RESISTANCE LOCUS O (MLO) family of proteins, plays a critical role in the communication processes regulating PT reception. In this study, we determined that MLO function in PT reception is dependent on MLO protein localization into a Golgi-associated compartment before PT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arriv</span></strong>al, indicating that PT-triggered regulation of the synergid secretory system is important for synergid function during pollination. Additionally, a structure-function analysis revealed that MLO homooligomerization, mediated by the amino-terminal region of the protein, and carboxyl-terminal tail identity both contribute to MLO activity during PT reception.</p>

Defining the Diverse Cell Populations Contributing to Lignification in Arabidopsis Stems<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants evolved tall and sturdy growth habits due to specialized cells with thick lignified cell walls: tracheary elements that function in water transport and fibers that function in structural support. The objective of this study was to define how and when diverse cell populations contribute lignin precursors, monolignols, to secondary cell walls during lignification of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) inflorescence stem. Previous work demonstrated that, when lignin biosynthesis is suppressed in fiber and tracheary element cells with thickened walls, fibers become lignin-depleted while vascular bundles still lignify, suggesting that nonlignifying neighboring xylem cells are contributing to lignification. In this work, we dissect the contributions of different cell types, specifically xylary parenchyma and fiber cells, to lignification of the stem using cell-type-specific promoters to either knock down an essential monolignol biosynthetic gene or to introduce novel monolignol conjugates. Analysis of either reductions in lignin in knockdown lines, or the addition of novel monolignol conjugates, directly identifies the xylary parenchyma and fiber cell populations that contribute to the stem lignification and the developmental timing at which each contribution is most important.</p>

In addition, HvEPF1OE barley lines exhibit significantly enhanced water use efficiency, drought tolerance, and soil water conservation properties.

EXO70C2 Is a Key Regulatory Factor for Optimal Tip Growth of Pollen
<p>The exocyst, a eukaryotic tethering complex, coregulates targeted exocytosis as an effector of small GTPases in polarized cell growth. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants, several exocyst subunits are encoded by double or triple paralogs, culminating in tens of EXO70 paralogs. Out of 23 <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> EXO70 isoforms, we analyzed seven isoforms expressed in pollen. Genetic and microscopic analyses of single mutants in <i>EXO70A2</i>, <i>EXO70C1</i>, <i>EXO70C2</i>, <i>EXO70F1</i>, <i>EXO70H3</i>, <i>EXO70H5</i>, and <i>EXO70H6</i> genes revealed that only a loss-of-function <i>EXO70C2</i> allele resulted in a significant male-specific transmission defect (segregation 40%:51%:9%) due to aberrant pollen tube growth. Mutant pollen tubes grown in vitro exhibited an enhanced growth rate and a decreased thickness of the tip cell wall, causing tip bursts. However, <i>exo70C2</i> pollen tubes could frequently recover and restart their speedy elongation, resulting in a repetitive stop-and-go growth dynamics. A pollen-specific depletion of the closest paralog, <i>EXO70C1</i>, using artificial microRNA in the <i>exo70C2</i> mutant background, resulted in a complete pollen-specific transmission defect, suggesting redundant functions of EXO70C1 and EXO70C2. Both EXO70C1 and EXO70C2, GFP tagged and expressed under the control of their native promoters, localized in the cytoplasm of pollen grains, pollen tubes, and also root trichoblast cells. The expression of EXO70C2-GFP complemented the aberrant growth of <i>exo70C2</i> pollen tubes. The absent EXO70C2 interactions with core exocyst subunits in the yeast two-hybrid assay, cytoplasmic localization, and genetic effect suggest an unconventional EXO70 function possibly as a regulator of exocytosis outside the exocyst complex. In conclusion, EXO70C2 is a novel factor contributing to the regulation of optimal tip growth of Arabidopsis pollen tubes.</p>

A Salivary Endo-β-1,4-Glucanase Acts as an Effector That Enables the Brown Planthopper to Feed on Rice
<p>The brown planthopper (BPH) <i>Nilaparvata lugens</i> is one of the most destructive insect pests on rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) in Asia. After <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong>ing on plants, BPH rapidly accesses plant phloem and sucks the phloem sap through unknown mechanisms. We discovered a salivary endo-β-1,4-glucanase (NlEG1) that has endoglucanase activity with a maximal activity at pH 6 at 37°C and is secreted into rice plants by BPH. <i>NlEG1</i> is highly expressed in the salivary g<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong>s and midgut. Silencing <i>NlEG1</i> decreases the capacity of BPH to reach the phloem and reduces its food intake, mass, survival, and fecundity on rice plants. By contrast, <i>NlEG1</i> silencing had only a small effect on the survival rate of BPH raised on artificial diet. Moreover, NlEG1 secreted by BPH did not elicit the production of the defense-related signal molecules salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and jasmonoyl-isoleucine in rice, although wounding plus the application of the recombination protein NlEG1 did slightly enhance the levels of jasmonic acid and jasmonoyl-isoleucine in plants compared with the corresponding controls. These data suggest that NlEG1 enables the BPH’s stylet to reach the phloem by degrading celluloses in plant cell walls, thereby functioning as an effector that overcomes the plant cell wall defense in rice.</p>

The Liverwort, <i>Marchantia</i>, Drives Alternative Electron Flow Using a Flavodiiron Protein to Protect PSI
<p>The diffusion efficiency of oxygen in the atmosphere, like that of CO<sub>2</sub>, is approximately 10<sup>4</sup> times greater than that in aqueous environments. Consequently, terrestrial photosynthetic organisms need mechanisms to protect against potential oxidative damage. The liverwort <i>Marchantia polymorpha</i>, a basal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plant, has habitats where it is exposed to both water and the atmosphere. Furthermore, like cyanobacteria, <i>M. polymorpha</i> has genes encoding flavodiiron proteins (FLV). In cyanobacteria, FLVs mediate oxygen-dependent alternative electron flow (AEF) to suppress the production of reactive oxygen species. Here, we investigated whether FLVs are required for the protection of photosynthesis in <i>M. polymorpha</i>. A mutant deficient in the FLV1 isozyme (Δ<i>MpFlv1</i>) sustained photooxidative damage to photosystem I (PSI) following repetitive short-saturation pulses of light. Compared with the wild type (Takaragaike-1), Δ<i>MpFlv1</i> showed the same photosynthetic oxygen evolution rate but a lower electron transport rate during the induction phase of photosynthesis. Additionally, the reaction center chlorophyll in PSI, P700, was highly reduced in Δ<i>MpFlv1</i> but not in Takaragaike-1. These results indicate that the gene product of <i>MpFlv1</i> drives AEF to oxidize PSI, as in cyanobacteria. Furthermore, FLV-mediated AEF supports the production of a proton motive force to possibly induce the nonphotochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence and suppress electron transport in the cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub>/<i>f</i> complex. After submerging the thalli, a decrease in photosystem II operating efficiency was observed, particularly in Δ<i>MpFlv1</i>, which implies that species living in these sorts of habitats require FLV-mediated AEF.</p>

SENSITIVE TO FREEZING2 Aides in Resilience to Salt and Drought in Freezing-Sensitive Tomato
<p>SENSITIVE TO FREEZING2 (SFR2) is crucial for protecting chloroplast membranes following freezing in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). It has been shown that SFR2 homologs are present in all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants, including freezing-sensitive species, raising the question of SFR2 function beyond freezing tolerance. Similar to freezing, salt and drought can cause dehydration. Thus, it is hypothesized that in freezing-sensitive plants SFR2 may play roles in their resilience to salt or drought. To test this hypothesis, <i>SlSFR2</i> RNAi lines were generated in the cold/freezing-sensitive species tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i> [M82 <i>cv</i>]). Hypersensitivity to salt and drought of <i>SlSFR2</i>-RNAi lines was observed. Higher tolerance of wild-type tomatoes was correlated with the production of trigalactosyldiacylglycerol, a product of SFR2 activity. Tomato SFR2 in vitro activity is Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and its optimal pH is 7.5, similar to that of Arabidopsis SFR2, but the specific activity of tomato SFR2 in vitro is almost double that of Arabidopsis SFR2. When salt and drought stress were applied to Arabidopsis, no conditions could be identified at which SFR2 was induced prior to irreversibly impacting plant growth, suggesting that SFR2 protects Arabidopsis primarily against freezing. Discovery of tomato SFR2 function in drought and salt resilience provides further insights into general membrane lipid remodeling-based stress tolerance mechanisms and together with protection against freezing in freezing-resistant plants such as Arabidopsis, it adds lipid remodeling as a possible target for the engineering of abiotic stress-resilient crops.</p>

Efficient Inference of Recombination Hot Regions in Bacterial Genomes
<p>In eukaryotes, detailed surveys of recombination rates have shown variation at multiple genomic scales and the presence of “hotspots” of highly elevated recombination. In bacteria, studies of recombination rate variation are less developed, in part because there are few analysis methods that take into account the clonal context within which bacterial evolution occurs. Here, we focus in particular on identifying “hot regions” of the genome where DNA is transferred frequently between isolates. We present a computationally efficient algorithm based on the recently developed “chromosome painting” algorithm, which characterizes patterns of haplotype sharing across a genome. We compare the average genome wide painting, which principally reflects clonal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">descent</span></strong>, with the painting for each site which additionally reflects the specific deviations at the site due to recombination. Using simulated data, we show that hot regions have consistently higher deviations from the genome wide average than normal regions. We applied our approach to previously analyzed <i>Escherichia coli</i> genomes and revealed that the new method is highly correlated with the number of recombination events affecting each site inferred by ClonalOrigin, a method that is only applicable to small numbers of genomes. Furthermore, we analyzed recombination hot regions in <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> by using 200 genomes. We identified three recombination hot regions, which are enriched for genes related to membrane proteins. Our approach and its implementation, which is downloadable from <ext-link>https://github.com/bioprojects/orderedPainting</ext-link>, will help to develop a new phase of population genomic studies of recombination in prokaryotes.</p>

Expansion of Secretin-Like G Protein-Coupled Receptors and Their Peptide Ligands via Local Duplications Before and After Two Rounds of Whole-Genome Duplication
<p>In humans, the secretin-like G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family comprises 15 members with 18 corresponding peptide ligand genes. Although members have been identified in a large variety of vertebrate and nonvertebrate species, the origin and relationship of these proteins remain unresolved. To address this issue, we employed large-scale genome comparisons to identify genome fragments with conserved synteny and matched these fragments to linkage groups in reconstructed early gnathostome ancestral chromosomes (<i>GAC</i>). This genome comparison revealed that most receptor and peptide genes were clustered in three <i>GAC</i> linkage groups and suggested that the ancestral forms of five peptide subfamilies (corticotropin-releasing hormone-like, calcitonin-like, parathyroid hormone-like, glucagon-like, and growth hormone-releasing hormone-like) and their cognate receptor families emerged through tandem local gene duplications before two rounds (2R) of whole-genome duplication. These subfamily genes have, then, been amplified by 2R whole-genome duplication, followed by additional local duplications and gene loss prior to the divergence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> vertebrates and teleosts. This study delineates a possible evolutionary scenario for whole secretin-like peptide and receptor family members and may shed light on evolutionary mechanisms for expansion of a gene family with a large number of paralogs.</p>

Y Chromosome Analysis of Dingoes and Southeast Asian Village Dogs Suggests a Neolithic Continental Expansion from Southeast Asia Followed by Multiple Austronesian Dispersals
<p>Dogs originated more than 14,000 BP, but the location(s) where they first arose is uncertain. The earliest archeological evidence of ancient dogs was discovered in Europe and the Middle East, some 5–7 millennia before that from Southeast Asia. However, mitochondrial DNA analyses suggest that most modern dogs derive from Southeast Asia, which has fueled the controversial hypothesis that dog domestication originated in this region despite the lack of supporting archeological evidence. We propose and investigate with Y chromosomes an alternative hypothesis for the proximate origins of dogs from Southeast Asia—a massive Neolithic expansion of dogs from this region that largely replaced more primitive dogs to the west and north. Previous attempts to test matrilineal findings with independent patrilineal markers have lacked the necessary genealogical resolution and mutation rate estimates. Here, we used Y chromosome genotypes, composed of 29 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) and 5 single tandem repeats (STRs), from 338 Australian dingoes, New Guinea singing dogs, and village dogs from Is<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> Southeast Asia, along with modern European breed dogs, to estimate the evolutionary mutation rates of Y chromosome STRs based on calibration to the independently known age of the dingo population. Dingoes exhibited a unique haplogroup characterized by a single distinguishing SNP mutation and 14 STR haplotypes. The age of the European haplogroup was estimated to be only 1.7 times older than that of the dingo population, suggesting an origin during the Neolithic rather than the Paleolithic (as predicted by the Southeast Asian origins hypothesis). We hypothesize that isolation of Neolithic dogs from wolves in Southeast Asia was a key step accelerating their phenotypic transformation, enhancing their value in trade and as cargo, and enabling them to rapidly expand and replace more primitive dogs to the West. Our findings also suggest that dingoes could have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arriv</span></strong>ed in Australia directly from Taiwan, independently of later dispersals of dogs through Thai<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> to Is<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> Southeast Asia.</p>

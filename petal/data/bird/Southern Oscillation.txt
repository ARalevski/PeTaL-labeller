Differential radial growth patterns between beech (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i> L.) and oak (<i>Quercus robur</i> L.) on periodically waterlogged soils
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e scenarios for northern Central Europe project rising temperatures and increasing frequency and intensity of droughts but also a shift in precipitation pattern with more humid winters. This in turn may result in soil waterlogging during the following spring, leading to increasing stress for trees growing on hydric sites. The influence of waterlogging on growth of common beech and pedunculate oak has been studied intensively on seedlings under experimental conditions. However, the question remains whether results of these studies can be transferred to mature trees growing under natural conditions. To test this, we investigated general growth patterns and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e–growth relationships in four mature stands of beech and oak growing on hydromorphic soils (Stagnosols) in northeast Germany using dendrochronological methods. Our results confirmed the expected tolerance of oak to strong water-level fluctuations. Neither extremely wet conditions during spring nor summer droughts significantly affected its radial growth. Oak growth responded positively to warmer temperatures during previous year October and March of the current year of ring formation. Contrary to our expectations, also beech showed relatively low sensitivity to periods of high soil water saturation. Instead, summer drought turned out to be the main <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>ic factor influencing ring width of beech even under the specific periodically wet soil conditions of our study. This became evident from general <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e–growth correlations over the last century as well as from discontinuous (pointer year) analysis with summer drought being significantly correlated to the occurrence of growth depressions. As ring width of the two species is affected by differing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e parameters, species-specific chronologies show no coherence in high-frequency variations even for trees growing in close proximity. We assume differences in rooting depth as the main reason for the differing growth patterns and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e correlations of the two species under study. Our results indicate that under the projected future <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e scenarios, beech may suffer from increasing drought stress even on hydromorphic soils. Oak might be able to maintain a sufficient hydraulic status during summer droughts by reaching water in deeper soil strata with its root system. Wet phases with waterlogged soil conditions during spring or summer appear to have only a little direct influence on radial growth of both species.</p>

Precipitation drives global variation in natural selection
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e change has the potential to affect the ecology and evolution of every species on Earth. Although the ecological consequences of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e change are increasingly well documented, the effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e on the key evolutionary process driving adaptation—natural selection—are largely unknown. We report that aspects of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration, along with the North Atlantic Oscillation, predicted variation in selection across plant and animal populations throughout many terrestrial biomes, whereas temperature explained little variation. By showing that selection was influenced by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e variation, our results indicate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e change may cause widespread alterations in selection regimes, potentially shifting evolutionary trajectories at a global scale.</p>

Using climate models to estimate the quality of global observational data sets
<p>Observational estimates of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e system are essential to monitoring and understanding ongoing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e change and to assessing the quality of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e models used to produce near- and long-term <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e information. This study poses the dual and unconventional question: Can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e models be used to assess the quality of observational references? We show that this question not only rests on solid theoretical grounds but also offers insightful applications in practice. By comparing four observational products of sea surface temperature with a large multimodel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e forecast ensemble, we find compelling evidence that models systematically score better against the most recent, advanced, but also most independent product. These results call for generalized procedures of model-observation comparison and provide guidance for a more objective observational data set selection.</p>

<i>CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1</i> (<i>CCA1</i>) and the Circadian Control of Stomatal Aperture
<p>The endogenous circadian (∼24 h) system allows plants to anticipate and adapt to daily environmental changes. Stomatal aperture is one of the many processes under circadian control; stomatal opening and closing occurs under constant conditions, even in the absence of environmental cues. To understand the significance of circadian-mediated anticipation in stomatal opening, we have generated <i>SGC</i> (specifically guard cell) Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants in which the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator gene <i>CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1</i> (<i>CCA1</i>) was overexpressed under the control of the guard-cell-specific promoter, <i>GC1.</i> The <i>SGC</i> plants showed a loss of ability to open stomata in anticipation of daily dark-to-light changes and of circadian-mediated stomatal opening in constant light. We observed that under fully watered and mild drought conditions, <i>SGC</i> plants outperform wild type with larger leaf area and biomass. To investigate the molecular basis for circadian control of guard cell aperture, we used large-scale qRT-PCR to compare circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator gene expression in guard cells compared with the “average” whole-leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator and examined gene expression and stomatal aperture in several lines of plants with misexpressed <i>CCA1</i>. Our results show that the guard cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator is different from the average plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator. Moreover, the differences in guard cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator function may be important for the correct regulation of photoperiod pathway genes that have previously been reported to control stomatal aperture. We conclude by showing that CONSTANS and FLOWERING LOCUS T, components of the photoperiod pathway that regulate flowering time, also control stomatal aperture in a daylength-dependent manner.</p>

Quantum oscillations of electrical resistivity in an insulator
<p>In metals, orbital motions of conduction electrons on the Fermi surface are quantized in magnetic fields, which is manifested by quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations in electrical resistivity. This Landau quantization is generally absent in insulators. Here, we report a notable exception in an insulator—ytterbium dodecaboride (YbB<sub>12</sub>). The resistivity of YbB<sub>12</sub>, which is of a much larger magnitude than the resistivity in metals, exhibits distinct quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations. These unconventional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations arise from the insulating bulk, even though the temperature dependence of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lation amplitude follows the conventional Fermi liquid theory of metals with a large effective mass.

Climate change: The 2015 Paris Agreement thresholds and Mediterranean basin ecosystems

Spectacular Oscillations in Plant Isoprene Emission under Transient Conditions Explain the Enigmatic CO<sub>2</sub> Response<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plant isoprene emissions respond to light and temperature similarly to photosynthesis, but CO<sub>2</sub> dependencies of isoprene emission and photosynthesis are profoundly different, with photosynthesis increasing and isoprene emission decreasing with increasing CO<sub>2</sub> concentration due to reasons not yet understood. We studied isoprene emission, net assimilation rate, and chlorophyll fluorescence under different CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the strong isoprene emitter hybrid aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus tremuloides</i>), and used rapid changes in ambient CO<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>2</sub> concentrations or light level to induce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations. As isoprene-emitting species support very high steady-state chloroplastic pool sizes of the primary isoprene substrate, dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMADP), which can mask the effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>latory dynamics on isoprene emission, the size of the DMADP pool was experimentally reduced by either partial inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis pathway by fosmidomycin-feeding or by changes in ambient gas concentrations leading to DMADP pool depletion in intact leaves. In feedback-limited conditions observed at low O<sub>2</sub> and/or high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration under which the rate of photosynthesis is governed by the limited rate of ATP and NADPH formation due to low chloroplastic phosphate levels, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations in photosynthesis and isoprene emission were repeatedly induced by rapid environmental modifications in both partly fosmidomycin-inhibited leaves and in intact leaves with in vivo reduced DMADP pools. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations in net assimilation rate and isoprene emission in feedback-inhibited leaves were in the same phase, and relative changes in the pools of photosynthetic metabolites and DMADP estimated by in vivo kinetic methods were directly proportional through all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations induced by different environmental perturbations. We conclude that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations in isoprene emission provide direct experimental evidence demonstrating that the response of isoprene emission to changes in ambient gas concentrations is controlled by the chloroplastic reductant supply.</p>

Genomic signals of selection predict climate-driven population declines in a migratory bird
<p>The ongoing loss of biodiversity caused by rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>ic shifts requires accurate models for predicting species’ responses. Despite evidence that evolutionary adaptation could mitigate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e change impacts, evolution is rarely integrated into predictive models. Integrating population genomics and environmental data, we identified genomic variation associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e across the breeding range of the migratory songbird, yellow warbler (<i>Setophaga petechia</i>). Populations requiring the greatest shifts in allele frequencies to keep pace with future <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e change have experienced the largest population declines, suggesting that failure to adapt may have already negatively affected populations. Broadly, our study suggests that the integration of genomic adaptation can increase the accuracy of future species distribution models and ultimately guide more effective mitigation efforts.</p>

Estimating economic damage from climate change in the United States
<p>Estimates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e change damage are central to the design of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e policies. Here, we develop a flexible architecture for computing damages that integrates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e science, econometric analyses, and process models. We use this approach to construct spatially explicit, probabilistic, and empirically derived estimates of economic damage in the United States from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e change. The combined value of market and nonmarket damage across analyzed sectors—agriculture, crime, coastal storms, energy, human mortality, and labor—increases quadratically in global mean temperature, costing roughly 1.2% of gross domestic product per +1°C on average. Importantly, risk is distributed unequally across locations, generating a large transfer of value northward and westward that increases economic inequality. By the late 21st century, the poorest third of counties are projected to experience damages between 2 and 20% of county income (90% chance) under business-as-usual emissions (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5).</p>

BIG Regulates Dynamic Adjustment of Circadian Period in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>Circadian clocks drive rhythms with a period near 24 h, but the molecular basis of the regulation of the period of the circadian clockis poorly understood. We previously demonstrated that metabolites affect the free-running period of the circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), with endogenous sugars acting as an accelerator and exogenous nicotinamide acting as a brake. Changes in circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator period are thought to adjust the timing of biological activities through the process of entrainment, in which the circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator becomes synchronized to rhythmic signals such as light and dark cycles as well as changes in internal metabolism. To identify the molecular components associated with the dynamic adjustment of circadian period, we performed a forward genetic screen. We identified Arabidopsis mutants that were either period insensitive to nicotinamide (<i>sin</i>) or period oversensitive to nicotinamide (<i>son</i>). We mapped <i>son1</i> to <i>BIG</i>, a gene of unknown molecular function that was shown previously to play a role in light signaling. We found that <i>son1</i> has an early entrained phase, suggesting that the dynamic alteration of circadian period contributes to the correct timing of biological events. Our data provide insight into how the dynamic period adjustment of circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lators contributes to establishing a correct phase relationship with the environment and show that BIG is involved in this process.</p>

Sucrose and Ethylene Signaling Interact to Modulate the Circadian Clock
<p>Circadian clocks drive rhythmic physiology and metabolism to optimize plant growth and performance under daily environmental fluctuations caused by the rotation of the planet. Photosynthesis is a key metabolic process that must be appropriately timed to the light-dark cycle. The circadian clock contributes to the regulation of photosynthesis, and in turn the daily accumulation of sugars from photosynthesis also feeds back to regulate the circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator. We have previously shown that <i>GIGANTEA</i> (<i>GI</i>) is required to sustain Suc-dependent circadian rhythms in darkness. The mechanism by which Suc affects the circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator in a <i>GI</i>-dependent manner was unknown. Here, we identify that Suc sustains rhythms in the dark by stabilizing GI protein, dependent on the F-box protein <i>ZEITLUPE</i>, and implicate <i>CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE RESPONSE1</i> (<i>CTR1</i>), a negative regulator of ethylene signaling. Our identification of a role for CTR1 in the response to Suc prompted a reinvestigation of the effects of ethylene on the circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator. We demonstrate that ethylene shortens the circadian period, conditional on the effects of Suc and requiring <i>GI</i>. These findings reveal that Suc affects the stability of circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator proteins and can mask the effects of ethylene on the circadian system, identifying novel molecular pathways for input of sugar to the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) circadian network.</p>

Winter drought impairs xylem phenology, anatomy and growth in Mediterranean Scots pine forests
<p>Continental Mediterranean forests face drought but also cold spells and both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e extremes can impair the resilience capacity of these forests. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e warming could amplify the negative effects of cold spells by inducing premature dehardening. Here we capitalize on a winter drought-induced dieback triggered by a cold spell which occurred in December 2001 affecting Scots pine forests in eastern Spain. We assessed post-dieback recovery by quantifying and comparing radial growth and xylem anatomy of non-declining (ND, crown cover >50%) and declining (D, crown cover ≤50%) trees in two sites (VP, Villarroya de los Pinares; TO, Torrijas). We also characterized xylogenesis in both sites and aboveground productivity in site VP. Dieback caused legacy effects since needle loss, a 60% reduction in litter fall and radial-growth decline characterized D-trees 3 years after dieback symptoms started appearing in spring 2002. D-trees formed collapsed tracheids in the 2002-ring, particularly in the most affected VP site where xylogenesis differences between ND and D trees were most noticeable. The lower growth rates of D-trees were caused by a shorter duration of their major xylogenesis phases. In site VP the radial-enlargement and wall-thickening of tracheids were significantly reduced in D-trees as compared to ND-trees because these xylogenesis phases tended to start earlier and end later in ND-trees. Gompertz models fitted to tracheid production predicted that maximum growth rates occurred 11–12 days earlier in ND than in D-trees. The formation of radially-enlarging tracheids was enhanced by longer days in both study sites and also by wetter conditions in the driest TO site, but xylogenesis sensitivity to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e was reduced in D-trees. Winter-drought dieback impairs xylem anatomy and phenology, aboveground productivity, xylogenesis and growth in Mediterranean Scots pine populations. Affected stands show a costly post-dieback recovery challenging their resilience ability.</p>

The joint influence of photoperiod and temperature during growth cessation and development of dormancy in white spruce (<i>Picea glauca</i>)
<p>Timely responses to environmental cues enable the synchronization of phenological life-history transitions essential for the health and survival of north-temperate and boreal tree species. While photoperiodic cues will remain persistent under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e change, temperature cues may vary, contributing to possible asynchrony in signals influencing developmental and physiological transitions essential to forest health. Understanding the relative contribution of photoperiod and temperature as determinants of the transition from active growth to dormancy is important for informing adaptive forest management decisions that consider future <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>es. Using a combination of photoperiod (long = 20 h or short = 8 h day lengths) and temperature (warm = 22 °C/16 °C and cool = 8 °C/4 °C day/night, respectively) treatments, we used microscopy, physiology and modeling to comprehensively examine hallmark traits of the growth–dormancy transition—including bud formation, growth cessation, cold hardiness and gas exchange—within two provenances of white spruce [<i>Picea glauca</i> (Moench) Voss] spanning a broad latitude in Alberta, Canada. Following exposure to experimental treatments, seedlings were transferred to favorable conditions, and the depth of dormancy was assessed by determining the timing and ability of spruce seedlings to resume growth. Short photoperiods promoted bud development and growth cessation, whereas longer photoperiods extended the growing season through the induction of lammas growth. In contrast, cool temperatures under both photoperiodic conditions delayed bud development. Photoperiod strongly predicted the development of cold hardiness, whereas temperature predicted photosynthetic rates associated with active growth. White spruce was capable of attaining endodormancy, but its release was environmentally determined. Dormancy depth varied substantially across experimental treatments suggesting that environmental cues experienced within one season could affect growth in the following season, which is particularly important for a determinate species such as white spruce. The joint influence of these environmental cues points toward the importance of including local constant photoperiod and shifting temperature cues into predictive models that consider how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e change may affect northern forests.</p>

Paleo-Drainage Basin Connectivity Predicts Evolutionary Relationships across Three Southeast Asian Biodiversity Hotspots
<p>Understanding factors driving diversity across biodiversity hotspots is critical for formulating conservation priorities in the face of ongoing and escalating environmental deterioration. While biodiversity hotspots encompass a small fraction of Earth's land surface, more than half the world's plants and two-thirds of terrestrial vertebrate species are endemic to these hotspots. Tropical Southeast (SE) Asia displays extraordinary species richness, encompassing four biodiversity hotspots, though disentangling multiple potential drivers of species richness is confounded by the region's dynamic geological and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>ic history. Here, we use multilocus molecular genetic data from dense multispecies sampling of freshwater fishes across three biodiversity hotspots, to test the effect of Quaternary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e change and resulting drainage rearrangements on aquatic faunal diversification. While Cenozoic geological processes have clearly shaped evolutionary history in SE Asian halfbeak fishes, we show that paleo-drainage re-arrangements resulting from Quaternary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e change played a significant role in the spatiotemporal evolution of lowland aquatic taxa, and provide priorities for conservation efforts.

p53 dynamics in response to DNA damage vary across cell lines and are shaped by efficiency of DNA repair and activity of the kinase ATM
<p>Cellular systems show a wide range of signaling dynamics. Many of these dynamics are highly stereotyped, such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations at a fixed frequency. However, most studies looking at the role of signaling dynamics focus on one or a few cell lines, leaving the diversity of dynamics across tissues or cell lines a largely unexplored question. We focused on the dynamics of the tumor suppressor protein p53, which regulates cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to DNA damage. We established live-cell reporters for 12 cancer cell lines expressing wild-type p53 and quantified p53 dynamics in response to double-strand break–inducing DNA damage. In many of the tested cell lines, we found that p53 abundance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lated in response to ionizing radiation or the DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic neocarzinostatin and that the periodicity of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations was fixed. In other cell lines, p53 abundance dynamically changed in different ways, such as a single broad pulse or a continuous induction. By combining single-cell assays of p53 signaling dynamics, small-molecule screening in live cells, and mathematical modeling, we identified molecules that perturbed p53 dynamics and determined that cell-specific variation in the efficiency of DNA repair and the activity of the kinase ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) controlled the signaling landscape of p53 dynamics. Because the dynamics of wild-type p53 varied substantially between cell lines, our study highlights the limitation of using one line as a model system and emphasizes the importance of studying the dynamics of other signaling pathways across different cell lines and genetic backgrounds.</p>

Arc-continent collisions in the tropics set Earth’s climate state
<p>On multimillion-year time scales, Earth has experienced warm ice-free and cold glacial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>es, but it is unknown whether transitions between these background <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e states were the result of changes in carbon dioxide sources or sinks. Low-latitude arc-continent collisions are hypothesized to drive cooling by exhuming and eroding mafic and ultramafic rocks in the warm, wet tropics, thereby increasing Earth’s potential to sequester carbon through chemical weathering. To better constrain global weatherability through time, the paleogeographic position of all major Phanerozoic arc-continent collisions was reconstructed and compared to the latitudinal distribution of ice sheets. This analysis reveals a strong correlation between the extent of glaciation and arc-continent collisions in the tropics. Earth’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e state is set primarily by global weatherability, which changes with the latitudinal distribution of arc-continent collisions.</p>

Historically, there existed a latitudinal gradient in nest predation, with the highest rates in the tropics; however, this pattern has been recently reversed in the Northern Hemisphere, most notably in the Arctic.

Urbanization and humidity shape the intensity of influenza epidemics in U.S. cities
<p>Influenza epidemics vary in intensity from year to year, driven by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>ic conditions and by viral antigenic evolution. However, important spatial variation remains unexplained. Here we show predictable differences in influenza incidence among cities, driven by population size and structure. Weekly incidence data from 603 cities in the United States reveal that epidemics in smaller cities are focused on shorter periods of the influenza season, whereas in larger cities, incidence is more diffuse. Base transmission potential estimated from city-level incidence data is positively correlated with population size and with spatiotemporal organization in population density, indicating a milder response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e forcing in metropolises. This suggests that urban centers incubate critical chains of transmission outside of peak <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>ic conditions, altering the spatiotemporal geometry of herd immunity.</p>

A silicon Brillouin laser
<p>Brillouin laser <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lators offer powerful and flexible dynamics as the basis for mode-locked lasers, microwave <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lators, and optical gyroscopes in a variety of optical systems. However, Brillouin interactions are markedly weak in conventional silicon photonic waveguides, stifling progress toward silicon-based Brillouin lasers. The recent advent of hybrid photonic-phononic waveguides has revealed Brillouin interactions to be one of the strongest and most tailorable nonlinearities in silicon. In this study, we have harnessed these engineered nonlinearities to demonstrate Brillouin lasing in silicon. Moreover, we show that this silicon-based Brillouin laser enters a regime of dynamics in which optical self-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lation produces phonon linewidth narrowing. Our results provide a platform to develop a range of applications for monolithic integration within silicon photonic circuits.</p>

Sustained climate warming drives declining marine biological productivity
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e change projections to the year 2100 may miss physical-biogeochemical feedbacks that emerge later from the cumulative effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e warming. In a coupled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e simulation to the year 2300, the westerly winds strengthen and shift poleward, surface waters warm, and sea ice disappears, leading to intense nutrient trapping in the Southern Ocean. The trapping drives a global-scale nutrient redistribution, with net transfer to the deep ocean. Ensuing surface nutrient reductions north of 30°S drive steady declines in primary production and carbon export (decreases of 24 and 41%, respectively, by 2300). Potential fishery yields, constrained by lower–trophic-level productivity, decrease by more than 20% globally and by nearly 60% in the North Atlantic. Continued high levels of greenhouse gas emissions could suppress marine biological productivity for a millennium.</p>

Winter color polymorphisms identify global hot spots for evolutionary rescue from climate change
<p>Maintenance of biodiversity in a rapidly changing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e will depend on the efficacy of evolutionary rescue, whereby population declines due to abrupt environmental change are reversed by shifts in genetically driven adaptive traits. However, a lack of traits known to be under direct selection by anthropogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e change has limited the incorporation of evolutionary processes into global conservation efforts. In 21 vertebrate species, some individuals undergo a seasonal color molt from summer brown to winter white as camouflage against snow, whereas other individuals remain brown. Seasonal snow duration is decreasing globally, and fitness is lower for winter white animals on snowless backgrounds. Based on 2713 georeferenced samples of known winter coat color—from eight species across trophic levels—we identify environmentally driven clinal gradients in winter coat color, including polymorphic zones where winter brown and white morphs co-occur. These polymorphic zones, underrepresented by existing global protected area networks, indicate hot spots for evolutionary rescue in a changing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e.</p>

Asylum applications respond to temperature fluctuations
<p>International negotiations on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e change, along with recent upsurges in migration across the Mediterranean Sea, have highlighted the need to better understand the possible effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e change on human migration—in particular, across national borders. Here we examine how, in the recent past (2000–2014), weather variations in 103 source countries translated into asylum applications to the European Union, which averaged 351,000 per year in our sample. We find that temperatures that deviated from the moderate optimum (~20°C) increased asylum applications in a nonlinear fashion, which implies an accelerated increase under continued future warming. Holding everything else constant, asylum applications by the end of the century are predicted to increase, on average, by 28% (98,000 additional asylum applications per year) under representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenario 4.5 and by 188% (660,000 additional applications per year) under RCP 8.5 for the 21 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e models in the NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections (NEX-GDDP).</p>

Calibrated mitotic oscillator drives motile ciliogenesis
<p>Cell division and differentiation depend on massive and rapid organelle remodeling. The mitotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator, centered on the cyclin-dependent kinase 1–anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (CDK1-APC/C) axis, spatiotemporally coordinates this reorganization in dividing cells. Here we discovered that nondividing cells could also implement this mitotic clocklike regulatory circuit to orchestrate subcellular reorganization associated with differentiation. We probed centriole amplification in differentiating mouse-brain multiciliated cells. These postmitotic progenitors fine-tuned mitotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator activity to drive the orderly progression of centriole production, maturation, and motile ciliation while avoiding the mitosis commitment threshold. Insufficient CDK1 activity hindered differentiation, whereas excessive activity accelerated differentiation yet drove postmitotic progenitors into mitosis. Thus, postmitotic cells can redeploy and calibrate the mitotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator to uncouple cytoplasmic from nuclear dynamics for organelle remodeling associated with differentiation.</p>

Changing climate shifts timing of European floods

We analyzed the timing of river floods in Europe over the past five decades, using a pan-European database from 4262 observational hydrometric stations, and found clear patterns of change in flood timing. Warmer temperatures have led to earlier spring snowmelt floods throughout northeastern Europe; delayed winter storms associated with polar warming have led to later winter floods around the North Sea and some sectors of the Mediterranean coast; and earlier soil moisture maxima have led to earlier winter floods in western Europe. Our results highlight the existence of a clear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e signal in flood observations at the continental scale.</p>

High-temperature quantum oscillations caused by recurring Bloch states in graphene superlattices
<p>Cyclotron motion of charge carriers in metals and semiconductors leads to Landau quantization and magneto-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>latory behavior in their properties. Cryogenic temperatures are usually required to observe these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations. We show that graphene superlattices support a different type of quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lation that does not rely on Landau quantization. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations are extremely robust and persist well above room temperature in magnetic fields of only a few tesla. We attribute this phenomenon to repetitive changes in the electronic structure of superlattices such that charge carriers experience effectively no magnetic field at simple fractions of the flux quantum per superlattice unit cell. Our work hints at unexplored physics in Hofstadter butterfly systems at high temperatures.</p>

Satellites reveal contrasting responses of regional climate to the widespread greening of Earth
<p>Changes in vegetation cover associated with the observed greening may affect several biophysical processes, whose net effects on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e are unclear. We analyzed remotely sensed dynamics in leaf area index (LAI) and energy fluxes in order to explore the associated variation in local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e. We show that the increasing trend in LAI contributed to the warming of boreal zones through a reduction of surface albedo and to an evaporation-driven cooling in arid regions. The interplay between LAI and surface biophysics is amplified up to five times under extreme warm-dry and cold-wet years. Altogether, these signals reveal that the recent dynamics in global vegetation have had relevant biophysical impacts on the local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>es and should be considered in the design of local mitigation and adaptation plans.</p>

An unexpected disruption of the atmospheric quasi-biennial oscillation

An unprecedented westward jet formed within the eastward phase in the lower stratosphere and cannot be accounted for by the standard QBO paradigm based on vertical momentum transport. Instead, the primary cause was waves transporting momentum from the Northern Hemisphere. Seasonal forecasts did not predict the disruption, but analogous QBO disruptions are seen very occasionally in some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e simulations. A return to more typical QBO behavior within the next year is forecast, although the possibility of more frequent occurrences of similar disruptions is projected for a warming <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e.</p>

Climate model shows large-scale wind and solar farms in the Sahara increase rain and vegetation
<p>Wind and solar farms offer a major pathway to clean, renewable energies. However, these farms would significantly change land surface properties, and, if sufficiently large, the farms may lead to unintended <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e consequences. In this study, we used a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e model with dynamic vegetation to show that large-scale installations of wind and solar farms covering the Sahara lead to a local temperature increase and more than a twofold precipitation increase, especially in the Sahel, through increased surface friction and reduced albedo. The resulting increase in vegetation further enhances precipitation, creating a positive albedo–precipitation–vegetation feedback that contributes ~80% of the precipitation increase for wind farms. This local enhancement is scale dependent and is particular to the Sahara, with small impacts in other deserts.</p>

Past and future global transformation of terrestrial ecosystems under climate change
<p>Impacts of global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e change on terrestrial ecosystems are imperfectly constrained by ecosystem models and direct observations. Pervasive ecosystem transformations occurred in response to warming and associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>ic changes during the last glacial-to-interglacial transition, which was comparable in magnitude to warming projected for the next century under high-emission scenarios. We reviewed 594 published paleoecological records to examine compositional and structural changes in terrestrial vegetation since the last glacial period and to project the magnitudes of ecosystem transformations under alternative future emission scenarios. Our results indicate that terrestrial ecosystems are highly sensitive to temperature change and suggest that, without major reductions in greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere, terrestrial ecosystems worldwide are at risk of major transformation, with accompanying disruption of ecosystem services and impacts on biodiversity.</p>

Quantification of drought during the collapse of the classic Maya civilization

Attempts to estimate the magnitude of hydrologic change, however, have met with equivocal success because of the qualitative and indirect nature of available <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e proxy data. We reconstructed the past isotopic composition (δ<sup>18</sup>O, δD, <sup>17</sup>O-excess, and d-excess) of water in Lake Chichancanab, Mexico, using a technique that involves isotopic analysis of the structurally bound water in sedimentary gypsum, which was deposited under drought conditions. The triple oxygen and hydrogen isotope data provide a direct measure of past changes in lake hydrology. We modeled the data and conclude that annual precipitation decreased between 41 and 54% (with intervals of up to 70% rainfall reduction during peak drought conditions) and that relative humidity declined by 2 to 7% compared to present-day conditions.</p>

Human influence on the seasonal cycle of tropospheric temperature

Satellite data and the anthropogenic “fingerprint” predicted by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e models show common large-scale changes in geographical patterns of seasonal cycle amplitude. These common features include increases in amplitude at mid-latitudes in both hemispheres, amplitude decreases at high latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere, and small changes in the tropics. Simple physical mechanisms explain these features. The model fingerprint of seasonal cycle changes is identifiable with high statistical confidence in five out of six satellite temperature datasets. Our results suggest that attribution studies with the changing seasonal cycle provide powerful evidence for a significant human effect on Earth’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e.</p>

Two-channel model for ultralow thermal conductivity of crystalline Tl<sub>3</sub>VSe<sub>4</sub>
<p>Solids with ultralow thermal conductivity are of great interest as thermal barrier coatings for insulation or thermoelectrics for energy conversion. However, the theoretical limits of lattice thermal conductivity (κ) are unclear. In typical crystals a phonon picture is valid, whereas lowest κ values occur in highly disordered materials where this picture fails and heat is supposedly carried by random walk among uncorrelated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lators. Here we identify a simple crystal, Tl<sub>3</sub>VSe<sub>4</sub>, with a calculated phonon κ [0.16 Watts per meter-Kelvin (W/m-K)] one-half that of our measured κ (0.30 W/m-K) at 300 K, approaching disorder κ values, although Raman spectra, specific heat, and temperature dependence of κ reveal typical phonon characteristics. Adding a transport component based on uncorrelated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lators explains the measured κ and suggests that a two-channel model is necessary for crystals with ultralow κ.</p>

Rapid sea level rise in the aftermath of a Neoproterozoic snowball Earth
<p>Earth’s most severe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e changes occurred during global-scale “snowball Earth” glaciations, which profoundly altered the planet’s atmosphere, oceans, and biosphere.

We use paleohydraulic analysis of wave ripples and tidal laminae in the Elatina Formation, Australia—deposited after the Marinoan glaciation ~635 million years ago—to show that water depths of 9 to 16 meters remained nearly constant for ~100 years throughout 27 meters of sediment accumulation. This accumulation rate was too great to have been accommodated by subsidence and instead indicates an extraordinarily rapid rate of sea level rise (0.2 to 0.27 meters per year).

Measurement of the fine-structure constant as a test of the Standard Model

Coupling between distant biofilms and emergence of nutrient time-sharing
<p>Bacteria within communities can interact to organize their behavior. It has been unclear whether such interactions can extend beyond a single community to coordinate the behavior of distant populations. We discovered that two <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> biofilm communities undergoing metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations can become coupled through electrical signaling and synchronize their growth dynamics. Coupling increases competition by also synchronizing demand for limited nutrients. As predicted by mathematical modeling, we confirm that biofilms resolve this conflict by switching from in-phase to antiphase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations. This results in time-sharing behavior, where each community takes turns consuming nutrients. Time-sharing enables biofilms to counterintuitively increase growth under reduced nutrient supply. Distant biofilms can thus coordinate their behavior to resolve nutrient competition through time-sharing, a strategy used in engineered systems to allocate limited resources.</p>

Greater role for Atlantic inflows on sea-ice loss in the Eurasian Basin of the Arctic Ocean
<p>Arctic sea-ice loss is a leading indicator of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e change and can be attributed, in large part, to atmospheric forcing. Here, we show that recent ice reductions, weakening of the halocline, and shoaling of the intermediate-depth Atlantic Water layer in the eastern Eurasian Basin have increased winter ventilation in the ocean interior, making this region structurally similar to that of the western Eurasian Basin. The associated enhanced release of oceanic heat has reduced winter sea-ice formation at a rate now comparable to losses from atmospheric thermodynamic forcing, thus explaining the recent reduction in sea-ice cover in the eastern Eurasian Basin. This encroaching “atlantification” of the Eurasian Basin represents an essential step toward a new Arctic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e state, with a substantially greater role for Atlantic inflows.</p>

We showed that TMEM24 is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–anchored membrane protein whose reversible localization to ER-plasma membrane (PM) contacts is governed by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations in cytosolic calcium. A lipid-binding module in TMEM24 transports the phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>] precursor phosphatidylinositol between bilayers, allowing replenishment of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> hydrolyzed during signaling. In the absence of TMEM24, calcium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations are abolished, leading to a defect in triggered insulin release. Our findings implicate direct lipid transport between the ER and the PM in the control of insulin secretion, a process impaired in patients with type II diabetes.</p>

Airborne laser-guided imaging spectroscopy to map forest trait diversity and guide conservation
<p>Functional biogeography may bridge a gap between field-based biodiversity information and satellite-based Earth system studies, thereby supporting conservation plans to protect more species and their contributions to ecosystem functioning. We used airborne laser-guided imaging spectroscopy with environmental modeling to derive large-scale, multivariate forest canopy functional trait maps of the Peruvian Andes-to-Amazon biodiversity hotspot. Seven mapped canopy traits revealed functional variation in a geospatial pattern explained by geology, topography, hydrology, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e. Clustering of canopy traits yielded a map of forest beta functional diversity for land-use analysis. Up to 53% of each mapped, functionally distinct forest presents an opportunity for new conservation action. Mapping functional diversity advances our understanding of the biosphere to conserve more biodiversity in the face of land use and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e change.</p>

Large benefits to marine fisheries of meeting the 1.5°C global warming target
<p>Translating the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 1.5°C above preindustrial level into impact-related targets facilitates communication of the benefits of mitigating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e change to policy-makers and stakeholders. Developing ecologically relevant impact-related targets for marine ecosystem services, such as fisheries, is an important step. Here, we use maximum catch potential and species turnover as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">climat</span></strong>e-risk indicators for fisheries. We project that potential catches will decrease by more than 3 million metric tons per degree Celsius of warming. Species turnover is more than halved when warming is lowered from 3.5° to 1.5°C above the preindustrial level. Regionally, changes in maximum catch potential and species turnover vary across ecosystems, with the biggest risk reduction in the Indo-Pacific and Arctic regions when the Paris Agreement target is achieved.</p>

Archaeal (Per)Chlorate Reduction at High Temperature: An Interplay of Biotic and Abiotic Reactions
<sec><title>Archaea Powered by Rocket Fuel</title><p>Perchlorate is a ubiquitous chlorine-based compound that forms naturally in the atmosphere. It is only present in large deposits in a few locations, such as the Atacama Desert in Chile, which has been assumed to be because perchlorate-reducing bacteria normally degrade it into chloride and oxygen. <bold>Liebensteiner <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 85; see the Perspective by <bold>Nerenberg</bold>), however, found that an archeon, <i>Archaeoglobus fulgidus</i>, can also reduce perchlorate. The archaeal perchlorate reduction pathway shares limited similarity with bacterial perchlorate reduction: Instead of producing chloride and oxygen, enzymatically produced chlorite reacts with sulfide to produce oxidized sulfur compounds. Because hyperthermophilic anaerobic archaea similar to <i>A. fulgidus</i> are thought to have been among the first complex organisms to evolve on Earth, they may have started creating oxidized conditions in some habitats before the emergence of oxygen-generating photosynthesis.</p></sec>

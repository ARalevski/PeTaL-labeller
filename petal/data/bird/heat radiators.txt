Scalable-manufactured randomized glass-polymer hybrid metamaterial for daytime radiative cooling
<p>Passive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing draws heat from surfaces and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>es it into space as infrared <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion to which the atmosphere is transparent. However, the energy density mismatch between solar irradiance and the low infrared <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion flux from a near-ambient-temperature surface requires materials that strongly emit thermal energy and barely absorb sunlight. We embedded resonant polar dielectric microspheres randomly in a polymeric matrix, resulting in a metamaterial that is fully transparent to the solar spectrum while having an infrared emissivity greater than 0.93 across the atmospheric window. When backed with a silver coating, the metamaterial shows a noontime <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing power of 93 watts per square meter under direct sunshine. More critically, we demonstrated high-throughput, economical roll-to-roll manufacturing of the metamaterial, which is vital for promoting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing as a viable energy technology.</p>

Aerosol-driven droplet concentrations dominate coverage and water of oceanic low-level clouds
<p>A lack of reliable estimates of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) aerosols over oceans has severely limited our ability to quantify their effects on cloud properties and extent of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing by reflecting solar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion—a key uncertainty in anthropogenic climate forcing. We introduce a methodology for ascribing cloud properties to CCN and isolating the aerosol effects from meteorological effects. Its application showed that for a given meteorology, CCN explains three-fourths of the variability in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing effect of clouds, mainly through affecting shallow cloud cover and water path. This reveals a much greater sensitivity of cloud <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ive forcing to CCN than previously reported, which means too much <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing if incorporated into present climate models. This suggests the existence of compensating aerosol warming effects yet to be discovered, possibly through deep clouds.</p>

Hierarchically porous polymer coatings for highly efficient passive daytime radiative cooling
<p>Passive daytime <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing (PDRC) involves spontaneously <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing a surface by reflecting sunlight and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ing heat to the cold outer space. Current PDRC designs are promising alternatives to electrical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing but are either inefficient or have limited applicability. We present a simple, inexpensive, and scalable phase inversion–based method for fabricating hierarchically porous poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropene) [P(VdF-HFP)<sub>HP</sub>] coatings with excellent PDRC capability. High, substrate-independent hemispherical solar reflectances (0.96 ± 0.03) and long-wave infrared emittances (0.97 ± 0.02) allow for subambient temperature drops of ~6°C and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing powers of ~96 watts per square meter (W m<sup>−2</sup>) under solar intensities of 890 and 750 W m<sup>−2</sup>, respectively. The performance equals or surpasses those of state-of-the-art PDRC designs, and the technique offers a paint-like simplicity.</p>

Highly efficient electrocaloric cooling with electrostatic actuation
<p>Solid-state refrigeration offers potential advantages over traditional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing systems, but few devices offer high specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing power with a high coefficient of performance (COP) and the ability to be applied directly to surfaces. We developed a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing device with a high intrinsic thermodynamic efficiency using a flexible electrocaloric (EC) polymer film and an electrostatic actuation mechanism. Reversible electrostatic forces reduce parasitic power consumption and allow efficient heat transfer through good thermal contacts with the heat source or heat sink. The EC device produced a specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing power of 2.8 watts per gram and a COP of 13. The new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing device is more efficient and compact than existing surface-conformable solid-state <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing technologies, opening a path to using the technology for a variety of practical applications.</p>

Synchrotron radiation from an accelerating light pulse
<p>Synchrotron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion—namely, electromagnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion produced by charges moving in a curved path—is regularly generated at large-scale facilities where giga–electron volt electrons move along kilometer-long circular paths. We use a metasurface to bend light and demonstrate synchrotron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion produced by a subpicosecond pulse, which moves along a circular arc of radius 100 micrometers inside a nonlinear crystal. The emitted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion, in the terahertz frequency range, results from the nonlinear polarization induced by the pulse. The generation of synchrotron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion from a pulse revolving about a circular trajectory holds promise for the development of on-chip terahertz sources.</p>

Using DNA, radiation therapy gets personal
<p>At most cancer hospitals today, medical oncologists routinely order genetic tests that help guide their drug treatment decisions. But down the hallway in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion ward, cancer patients typically get a one-size-fits-all course of radiotherapy, regardless of their genetics or those of their cancer. A small but increasing number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion oncologists is hoping to change that. At the annual meeting of the American Society for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion Oncology next week in Boston, researchers will describe their hunt for gene activity profiles in tumors that can help determine how susceptible the cancer will be to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion.

Risk of Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction in Older Women After Contemporary Radiotherapy for Breast Cancer
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiomyocytes are resistant to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion. However, cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion exposure causes coronary microvascular endothelial inflammation, a perturbation implicated in the pathogenesis of heart failure (HF) and particularly HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Radiotherapy for breast cancer results in variable cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion exposure and may increase the risk of HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a population-based case-control study of incident HF in 170 female residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota (59 cases and 111 controls), who underwent contemporary (1998–2013) radiotherapy for breast cancer with computed tomography–assisted radiotherapy planning. Controls were matched to cases for age, tumor side, chemotherapy use, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. Mean cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion dose (MCRD) in each patient was calculated from the patient’s computed tomography images and radiotherapy plan.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Mean age at radiotherapy was 69±9 years. Of HF cases, 38 (64%) had EF≥50% (HFpEF), 18 (31%) had EF<50% (HF with reduced EF), and 3 (5%) did not have EF measured. The EF was ≥40% in 50 of the 56 HF cases (89%) with an EF measurement. The mean interval from radiotherapy to HF was 5.8±3.4 years. The odds of HF was higher in patients with a history of ischemic heart disease or atrial fibrillation. The MCRD was 2.5 Gy (range, 0.2–13.1 Gy) and higher in cases (3.3±2.7 Gy) than controls (2.1±2.0 Gy; <i>P</i>=0.004). The odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for HF per log MCRD was 9.1 (3.4–24.4) for any HF, 16.9 (3.9–73.7) for HFpEF, and 3.17 (0.8–13.0) for HF with reduced EF. The increased odds of any HF or HFpEF with increasing MCRD remained significant after adjustment for HF risk factors and in sensitivity analyses matching by cancer stage rather than tumor side. Only 18.6% of patients experienced new or recurrent ischemic events between radiotherapy and the onset of HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The relative risk of HFpEF increases with increasing cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion exposure during contemporary conformal breast cancer radiotherapy. These data emphasize the importance of radiotherapy techniques that limit MCRD during breast cancer treatment. Moreover, these data provide further support for the importance of coronary microvascular compromise in the pathophysiology of HFpEF.</p></sec>

A radiative cooling structural material
<p>Reducing human reliance on energy-inefficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing methods such as air conditioning would have a large impact on the global energy landscape.

Structural basis of cooling agent and lipid sensing by the cold-activated TRPM8 channel
<p>Transient receptor potential melastatin member 8 (TRPM8) is a calcium ion (Ca<sup>2+</sup>)–permeable cation channel that serves as the primary cold and menthol sensor in humans. Activation of TRPM8 by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing compounds relies on allosteric actions of agonist and membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>), but lack of structural information has thus far precluded a mechanistic understanding of ligand and lipid sensing by TRPM8. Using cryo–electron microscopy, we determined the structures of TRPM8 in complex with the synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing compound icilin, PIP<sub>2</sub>, and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, as well as in complex with the menthol analog WS-12 and PIP<sub>2</sub>. Our structures reveal the binding sites for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing agonists and PIP<sub>2</sub> in TRPM8. Notably, PIP<sub>2</sub> binds to TRPM8 in two different modes, which illustrate the mechanism of allosteric coupling between PIP<sub>2</sub> and agonists. This study provides a platform for understanding the molecular mechanism of TRPM8 activation by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing agents.</p>

Rapid Pliocene adaptive radiation of modern kangaroos
<p>Differentiating between ancient and younger, more rapidly evolved clades is important for determining paleoenvironmental drivers of diversification. Australia possesses many aridity-adapted lineages, the origins of which have been closely linked to late Miocene continental aridification.

In contrast, low-crowned, short-faced kangaroos <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ed into predominantly browsing niches as the late Cenozoic became more arid, contradicting the view that this was an interval of global browser decline. Our results implicate warm-to-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong> climatic oscillations as a trigger for adaptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion and refute arguments attributing Pleistocene megafaunal extinction to aridity-forced dietary change.</p>

Creation of a Bose-condensed gas of <sup>87</sup>Rb by laser cooling
<p>Protocols for attaining quantum degeneracy in atomic gases almost exclusively rely on evaporative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing, a time-consuming final step associated with substantial atom loss. We demonstrate direct laser <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing of a gas of rubidium-87 (<sup>87</sup>Rb) atoms to quantum degeneracy. The method is fast and induces little atom loss. The atoms are trapped in a two-dimensional optical lattice that enables cycles of compression to increase the density, followed by Raman sideband <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing to decrease the temperature. From a starting number of 2000 atoms, 1400 atoms reach quantum degeneracy in 300 milliseconds, as confirmed by a bimodal velocity distribution.

The DNA-sensing AIM2 inflammasome controls radiation-induced cell death and tissue injury
<p>Acute exposure to ionizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion induces massive cell death and severe damage to tissues containing actively proliferating cells, including bone marrow and the gastrointestinal tract. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this pathology remain controversial. Here, we show that mice deficient in the double-stranded DNA sensor AIM2 are protected from both subtotal body ir<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion–induced gastrointestinal syndrome and total body ir<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion–induced hematopoietic failure. AIM2 mediates the caspase-1–dependent death of intestinal epithelial cells and bone marrow cells in response to double-strand DNA breaks caused by ionizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion and chemotherapeutic agents. Mechanistically, we found that AIM2 senses <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion-induced DNA damage in the nucleus to mediate inflammasome activation and cell death. Our results suggest that AIM2 may be a new therapeutic target for ionizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion exposure.</p>

The B-Box-Containing MicroProtein miP1a/BBX31 Regulates Photomorphogenesis and UV-B Protection
<p>The bZIP transcription factor ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) represents a major hub in the light-signaling cascade both under visible and UV-B light. The mode of transcriptional regulation of <i>HY5</i>, especially under UV-B light, is not well characterized. B-BOX (BBX) transcription factors regulate <i>HY5</i> transcription and also posttranscriptionally modulate HY5 to control photomorphogenesis under white light. Here, we identify BBX31 as a key signaling intermediate in visible and UV-B light signal transduction in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). <i>BBX31</i> expression is induced by UV-B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion in a fluence-dependent manner. HY5 directly binds to the promoter of <i>BBX31</i> and regulates its transcript levels. Loss- and gain-of-function mutants of <i>BBX31</i> indicate that it acts as a negative regulator of photomorphogenesis under white light but is a positive regulator of UV-B signaling. Genetic interaction studies suggest that <i>BBX31</i> regulates photomorphogenesis independent of <i>HY5</i>. We found no evidence for a direct BBX31-HY5 interaction, and they primarily regulate different sets of genes in white light. Under high doses of UV-B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion, BBX31 promotes the accumulation of UV-protective flavonoids and phenolic compounds. It enhances tolerance to UV-B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion by regulating genes involved in photoprotection and DNA repair in a HY5-dependent manner. Under UV-B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion, overexpression of <i>BBX31</i> enhances <i>HY5</i> transcriptional levels in a UV RESISTANCE LOCUS8-dependent manner, suggesting that BBX31 might regulate <i>HY5</i> transcription.</p>

Molecular Adaptation during a Rapid Adaptive Radiation
<p>“Explosive” adaptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ions on islands remain one of the most puzzling evolutionary phenomena and the evolutionary genetic processes behind such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ions remain unclear. Rapid morphological and ecological evolution during island <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ions suggests that many genes may be under fairly strong selection, although this remains untested. Here, we report that during a rapid recent diversification in the Hawaiian endemic plant genus <i>Schiedea</i> (<i>Caryophyllaceae</i>), 5 in 36 studied genes evolved under positive selection. Positively selected genes are involved in defence mechanisms, photosynthesis, and reproduction. Comparison with eight mainland plant groups demonstrates both the relaxation of purifying selection and more widespread positive selection in Hawaiian <i>Schiedea</i>. This provides compelling evidence that adaptive evolution of protein-coding genes may play a significant role during island adaptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ions.</p>

Laser cooling of ions in a neutral plasma
<p>Laser <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing of a neutral plasma is a challenging task because of the high temperatures typically associated with the plasma state. By using an ultracold neutral plasma created by photoionization of an ultracold atomic gas, we avoid this obstacle and demonstrate laser <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing of ions in a neutral plasma. After 135 microseconds of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing, we observed a reduction in ion temperature by up to a factor of four, with the temperature reaching as low as 50(4) millikelvin. This pushes laboratory studies of neutral plasmas deeper into the strongly coupled regime, beyond the limits of validity of current kinetic theories for calculating transport properties. The same optical forces also retard the plasma expansion, opening avenues for neutral-plasma confinement and manipulation.</p>

These protons are lost to atmospheric neutrals and D-ring dust. Strong proton depletions that map onto features on the D-ring indicate a highly structured and diverse dust environment near Saturn.</p>

UV-B Inhibits Leaf Growth through Changes in Growth Regulating Factors and Gibberellin Levels
<p>Ultraviolet-B (UV-B) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion affects leaf growth in a wide range of species. In this work, we demonstrate that UV-B levels present in solar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion inhibit maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) leaf growth without causing any other visible stress symptoms, including the accumulation of DNA damage. We conducted kinematic analyses of cell division and expansion to understand the impact of UV-B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion on these cellular processes. Our results demonstrate that the decrease in leaf growth in UV-B-ir<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ed leaves is a consequence of a reduction in cell production and a shortened growth zone (GZ). To determine the molecular pathways involved in UV-B inhibition of leaf growth, we performed RNA sequencing on isolated GZ tissues of control and UV-B-exposed plants. Our results show a link between the observed leaf growth inhibition and the expression of specific cell cycle and developmental genes, including growth-regulating factors (GRFs) and transcripts for proteins participating in different hormone pathways. Interestingly, the decrease in the GZ size correlates with a decrease in the concentration of GA19, the immediate precursor of the active gibberellin, GA1, by UV-B in this zone, which is regulated, at least in part, by the expression of GRF1 and possibly other transcription factors of the GRF family.</p>

Diurnal Solar Energy Conversion and Photoprotection in Rice Canopies
<p>Genetic improvement of photosynthetic performance of cereal crops and increasing the efficiency with which solar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion is converted into biomass has recently become a major focus for crop physiologists and breeders. The pulse amplitude modulated chlorophyll fluorescence technique (PAM) allows quantitative leaf level monitoring of the utilization of energy for photochemical light conversion and photoprotection in natural environments, potentially over the entire crop lifecycle. Here, the diurnal relationship between electron transport rate (ETR) and irradiance was measured in five cultivars of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) in canopy conditions with PAM fluorescence under natural solar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion. This relationship differed substantially from that observed for conventional short term light response curves measured under controlled actinic light with the same leaves. This difference was characterized by a reduced curvature factor when curve fitting was used to model this diurnal response. The engagement of photoprotective processes in chloroplast electron transport in leaves under canopy solar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion was shown to be a major contributor to this difference. Genotypic variation in the irradiance at which energy flux into photoprotective dissipation became greater than ETR was observed. Cultivars capable of higher ETR at midrange light intensities were shown to produce greater leaf area over time, estimated by noninvasive imaging.</p>

This study aimed to measure DNA damage/repair markers in operators perfoming EVAR.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Expression of the DNA damage/repair marker, γ-H2AX and DNA damage response marker, phosphorylated ataxia telangiectasia mutated (pATM), were quantified in circulating lymphocytes in operators during the peri-operative period of endovascular (infrarenal, branched, and fenestrated) and open aortic repair using flow cytometry. These markers were separately measured in the same operators but this time wearing leg lead shielding in addition to upper body protection and compared with those operating with unprotected legs.

There was no change in γ-H2AX or pATM expression after open repair. Leg protection abrogated γ-H2AX and pATM response after branched endovascular aortic repair/fenestrated endovascular aortic repair.

The vast majority of RAHD patients had prior breast cancer (53%) and Hodgkin lymphoma (27%), and the mean time from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion was 18±12 years. Clinical and surgical parameters were recorded. The preoperative EuroSCORE and all-cause mortality were recorded. The mean EuroSCOREs were similar in the RAHD and comparison groups (7.8±3 versus 7.4±3, respectively; <i>P</i>=0.1). Proximal coronary artery disease was higher in patients with RAHD versus the comparison patients (45% versus 38%; <i>P</i>=0.09), whereas redo CTS was lower in the RACD versus the comparison group (20% versus 29%; <i>P</i>=0.02).

The joint influence of photoperiod and temperature during growth cessation and development of dormancy in white spruce (<i>Picea glauca</i>)
<p>Timely responses to environmental cues enable the synchronization of phenological life-history transitions essential for the health and survival of north-temperate and boreal tree species. While photoperiodic cues will remain persistent under climate change, temperature cues may vary, contributing to possible asynchrony in signals influencing developmental and physiological transitions essential to forest health. Understanding the relative contribution of photoperiod and temperature as determinants of the transition from active growth to dormancy is important for informing adaptive forest management decisions that consider future climates. Using a combination of photoperiod (long = 20 h or short = 8 h day lengths) and temperature (warm = 22 °C/16 °C and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong> = 8 °C/4 °C day/night, respectively) treatments, we used microscopy, physiology and modeling to comprehensively examine hallmark traits of the growth–dormancy transition—including bud formation, growth cessation, cold hardiness and gas exchange—within two provenances of white spruce [<i>Picea glauca</i> (Moench) Voss] spanning a broad latitude in Alberta, Canada. Following exposure to experimental treatments, seedlings were transferred to favorable conditions, and the depth of dormancy was assessed by determining the timing and ability of spruce seedlings to resume growth. Short photoperiods promoted bud development and growth cessation, whereas longer photoperiods extended the growing season through the induction of lammas growth. In contrast, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong> temperatures under both photoperiodic conditions delayed bud development. Photoperiod strongly predicted the development of cold hardiness, whereas temperature predicted photosynthetic rates associated with active growth. White spruce was capable of attaining endodormancy, but its release was environmentally determined. Dormancy depth varied substantially across experimental treatments suggesting that environmental cues experienced within one season could affect growth in the following season, which is particularly important for a determinate species such as white spruce. The joint influence of these environmental cues points toward the importance of including local constant photoperiod and shifting temperature cues into predictive models that consider how climate change may affect northern forests.</p>

Root diameter variations explained by anatomy and phylogeny of 50 tropical and temperate tree species
<p>Root diameter, a critical indicator of root physiological function, varies greatly among tree species, but the underlying mechanism of this high variability is unclear. Here, we sampled 50 tree species across tropical and temperate zones in China, and measured root morphological and anatomical traits along the first five branch orders in each species. Our objectives were (i) to reveal the relationships between root diameter, cortical thickness and stele diameter among tree species in tropical and temperate forests, and (ii) to investigate the relationship of both root morphological and anatomical traits with divergence time during species <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion. The results showed that root diameter was strongly affected by cortical thickness but less by stele diameter in both tropical and temperate species. Changes in cortical thickness explained over 90% of variation in root diameter for the first order, and ∼74–87% for the second and third orders. Thicker roots displayed greater cortical thickness and more cortical cell layers than thinner roots. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that root diameter, cortical thickness and number of cortical cell layers significantly correlated with divergence time at the family level, showing similar variation trends in geological time. The results also suggested that trees tend to decrease their root cortical thickness rather than stele diameter during species <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion. The close linkage of variations in root morphology and anatomy to phylogeny as demonstrated by the data from the 50 tree species should provide some insights into the mechanism of root diameter variability among tree species.</p>

Systematic Biology
Continental Diversification of an African Catfish Radiation (Mochokidae: <i>Synodontis</i>)
<p>Despite African rivers containing high species diversity, continental-scale studies investigating the mechanisms generating biological diversity of African riverine faunas are limited compared with lacustrine systems. To investigate the build-up of diversity in a tropical aquatic continental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion, we test different models of lineage diversification and reconstruct the biogeographic history in a species-rich siluriform genus, <i>Synodontis</i> (~130 species), with a broad distribution across all major tropical African drainage basins. The resulting robust species-level phylogeny (~60% complete, based on a multigene data set) exhibits a near constant rate of lineage accumulation throughout the mid-Cenozoic to recent, irrespective of missing species and despite the changing environmental conditions that were prevalent during this time period. This pattern contrasts with the findings for species-level diversification of large clades that commonly show an early burst of cladogenesis followed by declining rates through time. The identification of distinct biogeographic clades demonstrates a correlation between river hydrology and cladogenesis, although there is evidence of recent repeat dispersal into the southern range of the focal group. We conclude that diverse freshwater fish <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ions with tropical continental distributions represent important organisms to test hypotheses of diversification and investigate the effects of palaeo-landscapes and climates on present day biodiversity.

Radiation inhibits salivary gland function by promoting STIM1 cleavage by caspase-3 and loss of SOCE through a TRPM2-dependent pathway
<p>Store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (SOCE) is critical for salivary gland fluid secretion. We report that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion treatment caused persistent salivary gland dysfunction by activating a TRPM2-dependent mitochondrial pathway, leading to caspase-3–mediated cleavage of stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) and loss of SOCE. After ir<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion, acinar cells from the submandibular glands of <i>TRPM2</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup>, but not those from <i>TRPM2</i><sup><i>−/−</i></sup> mice, displayed an increase in the concentrations of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> and reactive oxygen species, a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, and activation of caspase-3, which was associated with a sustained decrease in STIM1 abundance and attenuation of SOCE. In a salivary gland cell line, silencing the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter or caspase-3 or treatment with inhibitors of TRPM2 or caspase-3 prevented ir<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion-induced loss of STIM1 and SOCE. Expression of exogenous STIM1 in the salivary glands of ir<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ed mice increased SOCE and fluid secretion. We suggest that targeting the mechanisms underlying the loss of STIM1 would be a potentially useful approach for preserving salivary gland function after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion therapy.</p>

URI is required to maintain intestinal architecture during ionizing radiation
<p>Ionizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion (IR) can cause gastrointestinal syndrome (GIS), a lethal disorder, by means of unknown mechanisms. We show that high-dose ir<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion increases unconventional prefoldin RPB5 interactor (URI) levels in mouse intestinal crypt, but organ regeneration correlates with URI reductions. URI overexpression in intestine protects mice from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion-induced GIS, whereas halving URI expression sensitizes mice to IR. URI specifically inhibits β-catenin in stem cell–like label-retaining (LR) cells, which are essential for organ regeneration after IR. URI reduction activates β-catenin–induced c-MYC expression, causing proliferation of and DNA damage to LR cells, rendering them radiosensitive. Therefore, URI labels LR cells which promote tissue regeneration in response to high-dose ir<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion, and c-MYC inhibitors could be countermeasures for humans at risk of developing GIS.</p>

A key metabolic gene for recurrent freshwater colonization and radiation in fishes
<p>Colonization of new ecological niches has triggered large adaptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ions. Although some lineages have made use of such opportunities, not all do so. The factors causing this variation among lineages are largely unknown. Here, we show that deficiency in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an essential ω-3 fatty acid, can constrain freshwater colonization by marine fishes. Our genomic analyses revealed multiple independent duplications of the fatty acid desaturase gene <i>Fads2</i> in stickleback lineages that subsequently colonized and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ed in freshwater habitats, but not in close relatives that failed to colonize. Transgenic manipulation of <i>Fads2</i> in marine stickleback increased their ability to synthesize DHA and survive on DHA-deficient diets. Multiple freshwater ray-finned fishes also show a convergent increase in <i>Fads2</i> copies, indicating its key role in freshwater colonization.</p>

Dynamic gating of infrared radiation in a textile
<p>The human body absorbs and loses heat largely through infrared <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion centering around a wavelength of 10 micrometers. However, neither our skin nor the textiles that make up clothing are capable of dynamically controlling this optical channel for thermal management. By coating triacetate-cellulose bimorph fibers with a thin layer of carbon nanotubes, we effectively modulated the infrared <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion by more than 35% as the relative humidity of the underlying skin changed. Both experiments and modeling suggest that this dynamic infrared gating effect mainly arises from distance-dependent electromagnetic coupling between neighboring coated fibers in the textile yarns. This effect opens a pathway for developing wearable localized thermal management systems that are autonomous and self-powered, as well as expanding our ability to adapt to demanding environments.</p>

The Little Ice Age and 20th-century deep Pacific cooling
<p>Proxy records show that before the onset of modern anthropogenic warming, globally coherent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing occurred from the Medieval Warm Period to the Little Ice Age. The long memory of the ocean suggests that these historical surface anomalies are associated with ongoing deep-ocean temperature adjustments. Combining an ocean model with modern and paleoceanographic data leads to a prediction that the deep Pacific is still adjusting to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing going into the Little Ice Age, whereas temperature trends in the surface ocean and deep Atlantic reflect modern warming. This prediction is corroborated by temperature changes identified between the HMS Challenger expedition of the 1870s and modern hydrography. The implied heat loss in the deep ocean since 1750 CE offsets one-fourth of the global heat gain in the upper ocean.</p>

The low-frequency source of Saturn’s kilometric radiation

We present wave and plasma measurements from the Cassini spacecraft during its ring-grazing high-inclination orbits, which passed three times through the high-altitude SKR emission region. Northern dawn-side, narrow-banded radio sources were encountered at frequencies of 10 to 20 kilohertz, within regions of upward currents mapping to the ultraviolet auroral oval. The kilometric waves were produced on the extraordinary mode by the cyclotron maser instability from 6– to 12–kilo–electron volt electron beams and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ed quasi-perpendicularly to the auroral magnetic field lines. The SKR low-frequency sources appear to be strongly controlled by time-variable magnetospheric electron densities.</p>

Building one molecule from a reservoir of two atoms
<p>Chemical reactions typically proceed via stochastic encounters between reactants. Going beyond this paradigm, we combined exactly two atoms in a single, controlled reaction. The experimental apparatus traps two individual laser-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ed atoms [one sodium (Na) and one cesium (Cs)] in separate optical tweezers and then merges them into one optical dipole trap. Subsequently, photoassociation forms an excited-state NaCs molecule. The discovery of previously unseen resonances near the molecular dissociation threshold and measurement of collision rates are enabled by the tightly trapped ultracold sample of atoms. As laser-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing and trapping capabilities are extended to more elements, the technique will enable the study of more diverse, and eventually more complex, molecules in an isolated environment, as well as synthesis of designer molecules for qubits.</p>

Adaptive infrared-reflecting systems inspired by cephalopods
<p>Materials and systems that statically reflect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion in the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum underpin the performance of many entrenched technologies, including building insulation, energy-conserving windows, spacecraft components, electronics shielding, container packaging, protective clothing, and camouflage platforms. The development of their adaptive variants, in which the infrared-reflecting properties dynamically change in response to external stimuli, has emerged as an important unmet scientific challenge. By drawing inspiration from cephalopod skin, we developed adaptive infrared-reflecting platforms that feature a simple actuation mechanism, low working temperature, tunable spectral range, weak angular dependence, fast response, stability to repeated cycling, amenability to patterning and multiplexing, autonomous operation, robust mechanical properties, and straightforward manufacturability.

Observation of bulk Fermi arc and polarization half charge from paired exceptional points
<p>The ideas of topology have found tremendous success in closed physical systems, but even richer properties exist in the more general open or dissipative framework. We theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate a bulk Fermi arc that develops from non-Hermitian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ive losses in an open system of photonic crystal slabs. Moreover, we discover half-integer topological charges in the polarization of far-field <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion around the bulk Fermi arc. Both phenomena are shown to be direct consequences of the non-Hermitian topological properties of exceptional points, where resonances coincide in their frequencies and linewidths. Our work connects the fields of topological photonics, non-Hermitian physics, and singular optics, providing a framework to explore more complex non-Hermitian topological systems.</p>

The spectra of SSS17a began displaying broad features after 1.46 days and evolved qualitatively over each subsequent day, with distinct blue (early-time) and red (late-time) components. The late-time component is consistent with theoretical models of r-process–enriched neutron star ejecta, whereas the blue component requires high-velocity, lanthanide-free material.</p>

Femtosecond laser reshaping yields gold nanorods with ultranarrow surface plasmon resonances
<p>The ir<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion of gold nanorod colloids with a femtosecond laser can be tuned to induce controlled nanorod reshaping, yielding colloids with exceptionally narrow localized surface plasmon resonance bands. The process relies on a regime characterized by a gentle multishot reduction of the aspect ratio, whereas the rod shape and volume are barely affected. Successful reshaping can only occur within a narrow window of the heat dissipation rate: Low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing rates lead to drastic morphological changes, and fast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing has nearly no effect. Hence, a delicate balance must be achieved between ir<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion fluence and surface density of the surfactant on the nanorods. This perfection process is appealing because it provides a simple, fast, reproducible, and scalable route toward gold nanorods with an optical response of exceptional quality, near the theoretical limit.</p>

Thermal processing of diblock copolymer melts mimics metallurgy

Buffer-gas cooling of antiprotonic helium to 1.5 to 1.7 K, and antiproton-to–electron mass ratio
<p>Charge, parity, and time reversal (CPT) symmetry implies that a particle and its antiparticle have the same mass.

About 2 × 10<sup>9</sup> antiprotonic helium atoms were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ed to temperatures between 1.5 and 1.7 kelvin by using buffer-gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing in cryogenic low-pressure helium gas; the narrow thermal distribution led to the observation of sharp spectral lines of small thermal Doppler width.

From this, [Formula] was determined as 1836.1526734(15), which agrees with a recent proton-to-electron experimental value within 8 × 10<sup>−10</sup>.</p>

Seasonal Regulation of Petal Number
<p>Four petals characterize the flowers of most species in the Brassicaceae family, and this phenotype is generally robust to genetic and environmental variation. A variable petal number distinguishes the flowers of <i>Cardamine hirsuta</i> from those of its close relative Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), and allelic variation at many loci contribute to this trait. However, it is less clear whether <i>C. hirsuta</i> petal number varies in response to seasonal changes in environment. To address this question, we assessed whether petal number responds to a suite of environmental and endogenous cues that regulate flowering time in <i>C. hirsuta</i>. We found that petal number showed seasonal variation in <i>C. hirsuta</i>, such that spring flowering plants developed more petals than those flowering in summer. Conditions associated with spring flowering, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong> ambient temperature, short photoperiod, and vernalization, all increased petal number in <i>C. hirsuta</i>. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong> temperature caused the strongest increase in petal number and lengthened the time interval over which floral meristems matured. We performed live imaging of early flower development and showed that floral buds developed more slowly at 15°C versus 20°C. This extended phase of floral meristem formation, coupled with slower growth of sepals at 15°C, produced larger intersepal regions with more space available for petal initiation. In summary, the growth and maturation of floral buds is associated with variable petal number in <i>C. hirsuta</i> and responds to seasonal changes in ambient temperature.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Large Numbers of Novel miRNAs Originate from DNA Transposons and Are Coincident with a Large Species Radiation in Bats
<p>Vesper bats (family Vespertilionidae) experienced a rapid adaptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion beginning around 36 Ma that resulted in the second most species-rich mammalian family (>400 species). Coincident with that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion was an initial burst of DNA transposon activity that has continued into the present in some species. Such extensive and recent DNA transposon activity has not been seen in any other extant mammal. Indeed, retrotransposon activity is much more common in all other sequenced mammal genomes. Deep sequencing of the small RNA fraction from a vespertilionid bat, <i>Eptesicus fuscus</i>, as well as a dog and horse revealed large numbers of 17–24 bp putative miRNAs (p/miRNAs). Although the origination rate of p/miRNAs is similar in all three taxa, 61.1% of postdivergence p/miRNAs in <i>Eptesicus</i> are derived from transposable elements (TEs) compared with only 23.9% and 16.5% in the dog and horse, respectively. Not surprisingly, given the retrotransposon bias of dog and horse, the majority of TE-derived p/miRNAs are associated with retrotransposons. In <i>Eptesicus</i>, however, 58.7% of the TE-derived and 35.9% of the total p/miRNAs arose not from retrotransposons but from bat-specific DNA transposons. Notably, we observe that the timing of the DNA transposon expansion and the resulting introduction of novel p/miRNAs coincide with the rapid diversification of the family Vespertilionidae. Furthermore, potential targets of the DNA transposon-derived p/miRNAs are identifiable and enriched for genes that are important for regulation of transcription. We propose that lineage-specific DNA transposon activity lead to the rapid and repeated introduction of novel p/miRNAs. Some of these p/miRNAs are likely functional miRNAs and potentially influenced the diversification of Vespertilionidae. Our observations suggest a mechanism for introducing functional genomic variation rapidly through the expansion of DNA transposons that fits within the TE-thrust hypothesis.</p>

The use of ultra-low-dose CT scans for the evaluation of limb fractures
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To evaluate whether an ultra-low-dose CT protocol can diagnose   selected limb fractures as well as conventional CT (C-CT).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We prospectively studied 40 consecutive patients with a limb   fracture in whom a CT scan was indicated. These were scanned using   an ultra-low-dose CT Reduced Effective Dose Using Computed Tomography   In Orthopaedic Injury (REDUCTION) protocol. Studies from 16 selected   cases were compared with 16 C-CT scans matched for age, gender and   type of fracture. Studies were assessed for diagnosis and image   quality. Descriptive and reliability statistics were calculated.   The total effective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion dose for each scanned site was compared.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean estimated effective dose (ED) for the REDUCTION protocol   was 0.03 milliSieverts (mSv) and 0.43 mSv (p < 0.005) for C-CT.   The sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value   (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the REDUCTION protocol   to detect fractures were 0.98, 0.89, 0.98 and 0.89 respectively   when two occult fractures were excluded. Inter- and intra-observer   reliability for diagnosis using the REDUCTION protocol (κ = 0.75, κ =   0.71) were similar to those of C-CT (κ = 0.85, κ = 0.82). Using   the REDUCTION protocol, 3D CT reconstructions were equivalent in   quality and diagnostic information to those generated by C-CT (κ =   0.87, κ = 0.94).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>With a near 14-fold reduction in estimated ED compared with C-CT,   the REDUCTION protocol reduces the amount of CT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion substantially   without significant diagnostic decay. It produces images that appear   to be comparable with those of C-CT for evaluating fractures of   the limbs.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2016;98-B:1668-73.</p></sec>

Stroma provides an intestinal stem cell niche in the absence of epithelial Wnts
<p>Wnt/β-catenin signaling supports intestinal homeostasis by regulating proliferation in the crypt. Multiple Wnts are expressed in Paneth cells as well as other intestinal epithelial and stromal cells. <i>Ex vivo</i>, Wnts secreted by Paneth cells can support intestinal stem cells when Wnt signaling is enhanced with supplemental R-Spondin 1 (RSPO1). However, <i>in vivo</i>, the source of Wnts in the stem cell niche is less clear. Genetic ablation of <i>Porcn</i>, an endoplasmic reticulum resident O-acyltransferase that is essential for the secretion and activity of all vertebrate Wnts, confirmed the role of intestinal epithelial Wnts in <i>ex vivo</i> culture. Unexpectedly, mice lacking epithelial Wnt activity (<i>Porcn<sup>Del</sup>/Villin-Cre</i> mice) had normal intestinal proliferation and differentiation, as well as successful regeneration after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion injury, indicating that epithelial Wnts are dispensable for these processes. Consistent with a key role for stroma in the crypt niche, intestinal stromal cells endogenously expressing Wnts and <i>Rspo3</i> support the growth of <i>Porcn<sup>Del</sup></i> organoids <i>ex vivo</i> without RSPO1 supplementation. Conversely, increasing pharmacologic PORCN inhibition, affecting both stroma and epithelium, reduced <i>Lgr5</i> intestinal stem cells, inhibited recovery from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion injury, and at the highest dose fully blocked intestinal proliferation. We conclude that epithelial Wnts are dispensable and that stromal production of Wnts can fully support normal murine intestinal homeostasis.</p>

Exposure to Low-Dose Ionizing Radiation From Cardiac Procedures and Malignancy Risk in Adults With Congenital Heart Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Adults with congenital heart disease (CHD) are exposed to increasing amounts of low-dose ionizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion (LDIR) from cardiac procedures. Cancer prevalence in this population is higher than in the general population. This study estimates the association between LDIR exposure from cardiac procedures and incident cancer in adult patients with CHD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The study population derived from the Quebec Congenital Heart Disease Database. We measured cumulative numbers of LDIR-related cardiac procedures for each patient until 1 year before the time of cancer diagnosis or administrative censoring. To assess the association between LDIR exposure and cancer risk, we conducted a nested case-control study and matched cancer cases with controls on sex, CHD severity, birth year, and age.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The study included 24 833 adult patients with CHD aged 18 to 64 years from 1995 to 2009. In >250 791 person-years of follow-up, 602 cancer cases were observed (median age, 55.4 years). The cumulative incidence of cancer estimated up to 64 years of age was 15.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 14.2–16.5). Cases had more LDIR-related cardiac procedures than controls (1410 versus 921 per 1000 adult patients with CHD, <i>P</i><0.0001). Cumulative LDIR exposure was independently associated with cancer (odds ratio [OR], 1.08 per procedure; 95% CI, 1.04–1.13). Similar results were obtained by using dose estimates for LDIR exposure (OR, 1.10 per 10 mSv; 95% CI, 1.05–1.15) with a possible dose-related response. The effect measure was in the same direction, and the association was persistent for exposure from ≥6 procedures in all sensitivity analyses: after excluding most smoking-related cancer cases (OR, 1.10 per procedure; 95% CI, 1.05–1.16 and OR when exposure from ≥6 procedures, 3.08; 95% CI, 1.77–5.37), and after applying a 3-year lag period (OR, 1.09 per procedure; 95% CI, 1.03–1.14 and OR when exposure from ≥6 procedures: 2.58; 95% CI, 1.43–4.69).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first large population-based study to analyze and document the association between LDIR-related cardiac procedures and incident cancer in the population of adults with CHD. Confirmations of these findings by prospective studies are needed to reinforce policy recommendations for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion surveillance in patients with CHD where no regulation currently exists. Physicians ordering and performing cardiac imaging should ensure that exposure is as low as reasonably achievable without sacrificing quality of care.</p></sec>

Long-range hot-carrier transport in hybrid perovskites visualized by ultrafast microscopy
<p>The Shockley-Queisser limit for solar cell efficiency can be overcome if hot carriers can be harvested before they thermalize. Recently, carrier <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cool</span></strong>ing time up to 100 picoseconds was observed in hybrid perovskites, but it is unclear whether these long-lived hot carriers can migrate long distance for efficient collection. We report direct visualization of hot-carrier migration in methylammonium lead iodide (CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub>) thin films by ultrafast transient absorption microscopy, demonstrating three distinct transport regimes. Quasiballistic transport was observed to correlate with excess kinetic energy, resulting in up to 230 nanometers transport distance that could overcome grain boundaries. The nonequilibrium transport persisted over tens of picoseconds and ~600 nanometers before reaching the diffusive transport limit. These results suggest potential applications of hot-carrier devices based on hybrid perovskites.</p>

A conserved NAD<sup>+</sup> binding pocket that regulates protein-protein interactions during aging
<p>DNA repair is essential for life, yet its efficiency declines with age for reasons that are unclear. Numerous proteins possess Nudix homology domains (NHDs) that have no known function. We show that NHDs are NAD<sup>+</sup> (oxidized form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) binding domains that regulate protein-protein interactions. The binding of NAD<sup>+</sup> to the NHD domain of DBC1 (deleted in breast cancer 1) prevents it from inhibiting PARP1 [poly(adenosine diphosphate–ribose) polymerase], a critical DNA repair protein. As mice age and NAD<sup>+</sup> concentrations decline, DBC1 is increasingly bound to PARP1, causing DNA damage to accumulate, a process rapidly reversed by restoring the abundance of NAD<sup>+</sup>. Thus, NAD<sup>+</sup> directly regulates protein-protein interactions, the modulation of which may protect against cancer, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion, and aging.</p>

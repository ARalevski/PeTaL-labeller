Cold acclimation alters the connective tissue content of the zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) heart
<p>Thermal acclimation can alter cardiac function and morphology in a number of fish species, but little is known about the regulation of these changes. The purpose of the present study was to determine how cold acclimation affects zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) cardiac morphology, collagen composition and connective tissue regulation. Heart volume, the thickness of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong> myocardium, collagen content and collagen fiber composition were compared between control (27°C) and cold-acclimated (20°C) zebrafish using serially sectioned hearts stained with Picrosirius Red. Collagen content and fiber composition of the pericardial membrane were also examined. Cold acclimation did not affect the volume of the contracted heart; however, there was a significant decrease in the thickness of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong> myocardium. There was also a decrease in the collagen content of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong> myocardium and in the amount of thick collagen fibers throughout the heart. Cold-acclimated zebrafish also increased ex<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong>ion of the gene transcript for matrix metalloproteinase 2, matrix metalloproteinase 9, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 and collagen Type I α1. We propose that the reduction in the thickness of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong> myocardium as well as the change in collagen content may help to maintain the compliance of the ventricle as temperatures decrease. Together, these results clearly demonstrate that the zebrafish heart undergoes significant remodeling in response to cold acclimation.</p>

H3K9me3-heterochromatin loss at protein-coding genes enables developmental lineage specification
<p>Gene silencing by chromatin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong>ion is integral to establishing and maintaining cell fates. Trimethylated histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9me3)–marked heterochromatin is reduced in embryonic stem cells compared to differentiated cells. However, the establishment and dynamics of closed regions of chromatin at protein-coding genes, in embryologic development, remain elusive. We developed an antibody-independent method to isolate and map <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong>ed heterochromatin from low–cell number samples. We discovered high levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong>ed heterochromatin, H3K9me3-decorated, at protein-coding genes in early, uncommitted cells at the germ-layer stage, undergoing profound rearrangements and reduction upon differentiation, concomitant with cell type–specific gene ex<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong>ion. Perturbation of the three H3K9me3-related methyltransferases revealed a pivotal role for H3K9me3 heterochromatin during lineage commitment at the onset of organogenesis and for lineage fidelity maintenance.</p>

Programmed DNA destruction by miniature CRISPR-Cas14 enzymes
<p>CRISPR-Cas systems provide microbes with adaptive immunity to infectious nucleic acids and are widely employed as genome editing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong>s. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong>s use RNA-guided Cas proteins whose large size (950 to 1400 amino acids) has been considered essential to their specific DNA- or RNA-targeting activities. Here we present a set of CRISPR-Cas systems from uncultivated archaea that contain Cas14, a family of exceptionally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong> RNA-guided nucleases (400 to 700 amino acids). Despite their small size, Cas14 proteins are capable of targeted single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) cleavage without restrictive sequence requirements. Moreover, target recognition by Cas14 triggers nonspecific cutting of ssDNA molecules, an activity that enables high-fidelity single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping (Cas14-DETECTR). Metagenomic data show that multiple CRISPR-Cas14 systems evolved independently and suggest a potential evolutionary origin of single-effector CRISPR-based adaptive immunity.</p>

Mutation of a nucleosome compaction region disrupts Polycomb-mediated axial patterning
<p>Nucleosomes play important structural and regulatory roles by tightly wrapping the DNA that constitutes the metazoan genome. The Polycomb group (PcG) proteins modulate nucleosomes to maintain re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong>ion of key developmental genes, including <i>Hox</i> genes whose temporal and spatial ex<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong>ion is tightly regulated to guide patterning of the anterior-posterior body axis. CBX2, a component of the mammalian Polycomb re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong>ive complex 1 (PRC1), contains a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong>ion region that has the biochemically defined activity of bridging adjacent nucleosomes. Here, we demonstrate that a functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong>ion region is necessary for proper body patterning, because mutating this region leads to homeotic transformations similar to those observed with PcG loss-of-function mutations. We propose that CBX2-driven nucleosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong>ion is a key mechanism by which PcG proteins maintain gene silencing during mouse development.</p>

MoChlo: A Versatile, Modular Cloning Toolbox for Chloroplast Biotechnology
<p>Plant synthetic biology is a rapidly evolving field with new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong>s constantly emerging to drive innovation. Of particular interest is the application of synthetic biology to chloroplast biotechnology to generate plants capable of producing new metabolites, vaccines, biofuels, and high-value chemicals. Progress made in the assembly of large DNA molecules, composing multiple transcriptional units, has significantly aided in the ability to rapidly construct novel vectors for genetic engineering. In particular, Golden Gate assembly has provided a facile molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong> for standardized assembly of synthetic genetic elements into larger DNA constructs. In this work, a complete modular chloroplast cloning system, MoChlo, was developed and validated for fast and flexible chloroplast engineering in plants. A library of 128 standardized chloroplast-specific parts (47 promoters, 38 5′ untranslated regions [5′UTRs], nine promoter:5′UTR fusions, 10 3′UTRs, 14 genes of interest, and 10 chloroplast-specific destination vectors) were mined from the literature and modified for use in MoChlo assembly, along with chloroplast-specific destination vectors. The strategy was validated by assembling synthetic operons of various sizes and determining the efficiency of assembly. This method was successfully used to generate chloroplast transformation vectors containing up to seven transcriptional units in a single vector (∼10.6-kb synthetic operon). To enable researchers with limited resources to engage in chloroplast biotechnology, and to accelerate progress in the field, the entire kit, as described, is available through Addgene at minimal cost. Thus, the MoChlo kit represents a valuable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong> for fast and flexible design of heterologous metabolic pathways for plastid metabolic engineering.</p>

Modulating Protein Stability to Switch Toxic Protein Function On and Off in Living Cells
<p>Toxic proteins are prime targets for molecular farming (the generation of pharmacologically active or biotechnologically usable compounds in plants) and are also efficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong>s for targeted cell ablation in genetics, developmental biology, and biotechnology. However, achieving conditional activity of cytotoxins and maintaining the toxin-ex<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong>ing plants as stably transformed lines remain challenging. Here, we produce a switchable version of the highly cytotoxic bacterial RNase barnase by fusing the protein to a portable protein degradation cassette, the low-temperature degron cassette. This method allows conditional genetics based on conditional protein degradation via the N-end rule or N-degron pathway and has been used to vice versa accumulate and/or deplete a diverse variety of highly active, unstable or stable target proteins in different living multicellular organisms and cell systems. Moreover, we ex<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong>ed the barnase fusion under control of the trichome-specific <i>TRIPTYCHON</i> promoter. This enabled efficient temperature-dependent control of protein accumulation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaf hairs (trichomes). By tuning the levels of the protein, we were able to control the fate of trichomes in vivo. The on-demand formation of trichomes through manipulating the balance between stabilization and destabilization of barnase provides proof of concept for a robust and powerful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong> for conditional switchable cell arrest. We present this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong> as a potential strategy for the manufacture and accumulation of cytotoxic proteins and toxic high-value products in plants or for conditional genetic cell ablation.</p>

The Coumarin Glucoside, Esculin, Reveals Rapid Changes in Phloem-Transport Velocity in Response to Environmental Cues
<p>The study of phloem transport and its vital roles in long-distance communication and carbon allocation have been hampered by a lack of suitable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong>s that allow high-throughput, real-time studies. Esculin, a fluorescent coumarin glucoside, is recognized by Suc transporters, including AtSUC2, which loads it into the phloem for translocation to sink tissues. These properties make it an ideal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong> for use in live-imaging experiments, where it acts as a surrogate for Suc. Here, we show that esculin is translocated with a similar efficiency to Suc and, because of its ease of application and detection, demonstrate that it is an ideal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong> for in vivo studies of phloem transport. We used esculin to determine the effect of different environmental cues on the velocity of phloem transport. We provide evidence that fluctuations in cotyledon Suc levels influence phloem velocity rapidly, supporting the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong>ure-flow model of phloem transport. Under acute changes in light levels, the phloem velocity mirrored changes in the ex<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong>ion of <i>AtSUC2</i>. This observation suggests that under certain environmental conditions, transcriptional regulation may affect the abundance of AtSUC2 and thus regulate the phloem transport velocity.</p>

Predicted Arabidopsis Interactome Resource and Gene Set Linkage Analysis: A Transcriptomic Analysis Resource
<p>An advanced functional understanding of omics data is important for elucidating the design logic of physiological processes in plants and effectively controlling desired traits in plants. We present the latest versions of the Predicted Arabidopsis Interactome Resource (PAIR) and of the gene set linkage analysis (GSLA) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong>, which enable the interpretation of an observed transcriptomic change (differentially ex<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong>ed genes [DEGs]) in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) with respect to its functional impact for biological processes. PAIR version 5.0 integrates functional association data between genes in multiple forms and infers 335,301 putative functional interactions. GSLA relies on this high-confidence inferred functional association network to expand our perception of the functional impacts of an observed transcriptomic change. GSLA then interprets the biological significance of the observed DEGs using established biological concepts (annotation terms), describing not only the DEGs themselves but also their potential functional impacts. This unique analytical capability can help researchers gain deeper insights into their experimental results and highlight prospective directions for further investigation. We demonstrate the utility of GSLA with two case studies in which GSLA uncovered how molecular events may have caused physiological changes through their collective functional influence on biological processes. Furthermore, we showed that typical annotation-enrichment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong>s were unable to produce similar insights to PAIR/GSLA. The PAIR version 5.0-inferred interactome and GSLA Web <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong> both can be accessed at <ext-link>http://public.synergylab.cn/pair/</ext-link>.</p>

Phylogenetic Tools for Generalized HIV-1 Epidemics: Findings from the PANGEA-HIV Methods Comparison
<p>Viral phylogenetic methods contribute to understanding how HIV spreads in populations, and thereby help guide the design of prevention interventions. So far, most analyses have been applied to well-sampled concentrated HIV-1 epidemics in wealthy countries. To direct the use of phylogenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong>s to where the impact of HIV-1 is greatest, the Phylogenetics And Networks for Generalized HIV Epidemics in Africa (PANGEA-HIV) consortium generates full-genome viral sequences from across sub-Saharan Africa. Analyzing these data presents new challenges, since epidemics are principally driven by heterosexual transmission and a smaller fraction of cases is sampled. Here, we show that viral phylogenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong>s can be adapted and used to estimate epidemiological quantities of central importance to HIV-1 prevention in sub-Saharan Africa. We used a community-wide methods comparison exercise on simulated data, where participants were blinded to the true dynamics they were inferring. Two distinct simulations captured generalized HIV-1 epidemics, before and after a large community-level intervention that reduced infection levels. Five research groups participated. Structured coalescent modeling approaches were most successful: phylogenetic estimates of HIV-1 incidence, incidence reductions, and the proportion of transmissions from individuals in their first 3 months of infection correlated with the true values (Pearson correlation > 90%), with small bias. However, on some simulations, true values were markedly outside reported confidence or credibility intervals. The blinded comparison revealed current limits and strengths in using HIV phylogenetics in challenging settings, provided benchmarks for future methods’ development, and supports using the latest generation of phylogenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong>s to advance HIV surveillance and prevention.</p>

Fkbp1a controls ventricular myocardium trabeculation and compaction by regulating endocardial Notch1 activity
<p>Trabeculation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong>ion of the embryonic myocardium are morphogenetic events crucial for the formation and function of the ventricular walls. Fkbp1a (FKBP12) is a ubiquitously ex<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong>ed <i>cis</i>-<i>trans</i> peptidyl-prolyl isomerase. <i>Fkbp1a</i>-deficient mice develop ventricular hypertrabeculation and non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong>ion. To determine the physiological function of Fkbp1a in regulating the intercellular and intracellular signaling pathways involved in ventricular trabeculation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong>ion, we generated a series of <i>Fkbp1a</i> conditional knockouts. Surprisingly, cardiomyocyte-restricted ablation of <i>Fkbp1a</i> did not give rise to the ventricular developmental defect, whereas endothelial cell-restricted ablation of <i>Fkbp1a</i> recapitulated the ventricular hypertrabeculation and non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong>ion observed in <i>Fkbp1a</i> systemically deficient mice, suggesting an important contribution of Fkbp1a within the developing endocardia in regulating the morphogenesis of ventricular trabeculation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong>ion. Further analysis demonstrated that Fkbp1a is a novel negative modulator of activated Notch1. Activated Notch1 (N1ICD) was significantly upregulated in <i>Fkbp1a</i>-ablated endothelial cells <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>. Overex<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong>ion of Fkbp1a significantly reduced the stability of N1ICD and direct inhibition of Notch signaling significantly reduced hypertrabeculation in <i>Fkbp1a</i>-deficient mice. Our findings suggest that Fkbp1a-mediated regulation of Notch1 plays an important role in intercellular communication between endocardium and myocardium, which is crucial in controlling the formation of the ventricular walls.</p>

Discovering relationships between nuclear receptor signaling pathways, genes, and tissues in Transcriptomine
<p>We previously developed a web <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong>, Transcriptomine, to explore ex<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong>ion profiling data sets involving small-molecule or genetic manipulations of nuclear receptor signaling pathways. We describe advances in biocuration, query interface design, and data visualization that enhance the discovery of uncharacterized biology in these pathways using this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong>. Transcriptomine currently contains about 45 million data points encompassing more than 2000 experiments in a reference library of nearly 550 data sets retrieved from public archives and systematically curated. To make the underlying data points more accessible to bench biologists, we classified experimental small molecules and gene manipulations into signaling pathways and experimental tissues and cell lines into physiological systems and organs. Incorporation of these mappings into Transcriptomine enables the user to readily evaluate tissue-specific regulation of gene ex<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong>ion by nuclear receptor signaling pathways. Data points from animal and cell model experiments and from clinical data sets elucidate the roles of nuclear receptor pathways in gene ex<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong>ion events accompanying various normal and pathological cellular processes. In addition, data sets targeting non-nuclear receptor signaling pathways highlight transcriptional cross-talk between nuclear receptors and other signaling pathways. We demonstrate with specific examples how data points that exist in isolation in individual data sets validate each other when connected and made accessible to the user in a single interface. In summary, Transcriptomine allows bench biologists to routinely develop research hypotheses, validate experimental data, or model relationships between signaling pathways, genes, and tissues.</p>

Electrified methane reforming: A compact approach to greener industrial hydrogen production
<p>Electrification of conventionally fired chemical reactors has the potential to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and provide flexible and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong> heat generation. Here, we describe a disruptive approach to a fundamental process by integrating an electrically heated catalytic structure directly into a steam-methane–reforming (SMR) reactor for hydrogen production. Intimate contact between the electric heat source and the reaction site drives the reaction close to thermal equilibrium, increases catalyst utilization, and limits unwanted byproduct formation. The integrated design with small characteristic length scales allows <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong> reactor designs, potentially 100 times smaller than current reformer platforms. Electrification of SMR offers a strong platform for new reactor design, scale, and implementation opportunities. Implemented on a global scale, this could correspond to a reduction of nearly 1% of all CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>

1.9-million- and 2.4-million-year-old artifacts and stone tool–cutmarked bones from Ain Boucherit, Algeria

Here we report older stone artifacts and cutmarked bones excavated from two nearby deposits at Ain Boucherit estimated to ~1.9 Ma ago, and the older to ~2.4 Ma ago. Hence, the Ain Boucherit evidence shows that ancestral hominins inhabited the Mediterranean fringe in northern Africa much earlier than previously thought.

But it also has limitations; for instance, the method can't reliably evaluate a chemical's risk of causing cancer. And it's not clear how open regulatory agencies will be to adopting a nonanimal approach, although both European and U.S. regulators say they are open to the idea. Still, the big data approach is encouraging to those seeking to reduce and replace animal testing.</p>

Ultrafast optical ranging using microresonator soliton frequency combs

Thirst-associated preoptic neurons encode an aversive motivational drive
<p>Water deprivation produces a drive to seek and consume water. How neural activity creates this motivation remains poorly understood. We used activity-dependent genetic labeling to characterize neurons activated by water deprivation in the hypothalamic median preoptic nucleus (MnPO). Single-cell transcriptional profiling revealed that dehydration-activated MnPO neurons consist of a single excitatory cell type. After optogenetic activation of these neurons, mice drank water and performed an operant lever-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong>ing task for water reward with rates that scaled with stimulation frequency. This stimulation was aversive, and instrumentally pausing stimulation could reinforce lever-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong>ing. Activity of these neurons gradually decreased over the course of an operant session. Thus, the activity of dehydration-activated MnPO neurons establishes a scalable, persistent, and aversive internal state that dynamically controls thirst-motivated behavior.</p>

ChromEMT: Visualizing 3D chromatin structure and compaction in interphase and mitotic cells
<p>The chromatin structure of DNA determines genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong>ion and activity in the nucleus. On the basis of in vitro structures and electron microscopy (EM) studies, the hierarchical model is that 11-nanometer DNA-nucleosome polymers fold into 30- and subsequently into 120- and 300- to 700-nanometer fibers and mitotic chromosomes. To visualize chromatin in situ, we identified a fluorescent dye that stains DNA with an osmiophilic polymer and selectively enhances its contrast in EM. Using ChromEMT (ChromEM tomography), we reveal the ultrastructure and three-dimensional (3D) organization of individual chromatin polymers, megabase domains, and mitotic chromosomes. We show that chromatin is a disordered 5- to 24-nanometer-diameter curvilinear chain that is packed together at different 3D concentration distributions in interphase and mitosis. Chromatin chains have many different particle arrangements and bend at various lengths to achieve structural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong>ion and high packing densities.</p>

The adoption of plasmid vector assembly standards and parts libraries has greatly enhanced the reproducibility of research and the exchange of parts between different labs and biological systems. However, a standardized modular cloning (MoClo) system is not yet available for cyanobacteria, which lag behind other prokaryotes in synthetic biology despite their huge potential regarding biotechnological applications. By building on the assembly library and syntax of the Plant Golden Gate MoClo kit, we have developed a versatile system called CyanoGate that unites cyanobacteria with plant and algal systems. Here, we describe the generation of a suite of parts and acceptor vectors for making (1) marked/unmarked knock-outs or integrations using an integrative acceptor vector, and (2) transient multigene ex<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong>ion and re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong>ion systems using known and previously undescribed replicative vectors. We tested and compared the CyanoGate system in the established model cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 and the more recently described fast-growing strain <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973. The UTEX 2973 fast-growth phenotype was only evident under specific growth conditions; however, UTEX 2973 accumulated high levels of proteins with strong native or synthetic promoters. The system is publicly available and can be readily expanded to accommodate other standardized MoClo parts to accelerate the development of reliable synthetic biology <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong>s for the cyanobacterial community.</p>

PaCeQuant: A Tool for High-Throughput Quantification of Pavement Cell Shape Characteristics
<p>Pavement cells (PCs) are the most frequently occurring cell type in the leaf epidermis and play important roles in leaf growth and function. In many plant species, PCs form highly complex jigsaw-puzzle-shaped cells with interlocking lobes. Understanding of their development is of high interest for plant science research because of their importance for leaf growth and hence for plant fitness and crop yield. Studies of PC development, however, are limited, because robust methods are lacking that enable automatic segmentation and quantification of PC shape parameters suitable to reflect their cellular complexity. Here, we present our new ImageJ-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong>, PaCeQuant, which provides a fully automatic image analysis workflow for PC shape quantification. PaCeQuant automatically detects cell boundaries of PCs from confocal input images and enables manual correction of automatic segmentation results or direct import of manually segmented cells. PaCeQuant simultaneously extracts 27 shape features that include global, contour-based, skeleton-based, and PC-specific object descriptors. In addition, we included a method for classification and analysis of lobes at two-cell junctions and three-cell junctions, respectively. We provide an R script for graphical visualization and statistical analysis. We validated PaCeQuant by extensive comparative analysis to manual segmentation and existing quantification <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong>s and demonstrated its usability to analyze PC shape characteristics during development and between different genotypes. PaCeQuant thus provides a platform for robust, efficient, and reproducible quantitative analysis of PC shape characteristics that can easily be applied to study PC development in large data sets.</p>

<p>A forward genetic screen is one of the best methods for revealing the function of genes. In plants, this technique is highly efficient, as it is relatively easy to grow and screen hundreds or thousands of individuals. The cost efficiency and ease of data production afforded by next-generation sequencing have created new opportunities for rapid mapping of induced mutations. Current mapping <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong>s are often not user friendly, are complicated, or require extensive preparation steps. To simplify the process of mapping new mutations, we developed a pipeline that takes next-generation sequencing fastq files as input, calls on several well-established and freely available genome-analysis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong>s, and outputs the most likely causal DNA changes. The pipeline has been validated in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> (Arabidopsis) and can be readily applied to other species, with the possibility of mapping either dominant or recessive mutations.</p>

Hybridization in Plants: Old Ideas, New Techniques
<p>Hybridization has played an important role in the evolution of many lineages. With the growing availability of genomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong>s and advancements in genomic analyses, it is becoming increasingly clear that gene flow between divergent taxa can generate new phenotypic diversity, allow for adaptation to novel environments, and contribute to speciation. Hybridization can have immediate phenotypic consequences through the ex<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong>ion of hybrid vigor. On longer evolutionary time scales, hybridization can lead to local adaption through the introgression of novel alleles and transgressive segregation and, in some cases, result in the formation of new hybrid species. Studying both the abundance and the evolutionary consequences of hybridization has deep historical roots in plant biology. Many of the hypotheses concerning how and why hybridization contributes to biological diversity currently being investigated were first proposed tens and even hundreds of years ago. In this Update, we discuss how new advancements in genomic and genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong>s are revolutionizing our ability to document the occurrence of and investigate the outcomes of hybridization in plants.</p>

Insights from the Shell Proteome: Biomineralization to Adaptation
<p>Bivalves have evolved a range of complex shell forming mechanisms that are reflected by their incredible diversity in shell mineralogy and microstructures. A suite of proteins exported to the shell matrix space plays a significant role in controlling these features, in addition to underpinning some of the physical properties of the shell itself. Although, there is a general consensus that a minimum basic protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong> kit is required for shell construction, to date, this remains undefined. In this study, the shell matrix proteins (SMPs) of four highly divergent bivalves (The Pacific oyster, <i>Crassostrea gigas</i>; the blue mussel, <i>Mytilus edulis</i>; the clam, <i>Mya truncata</i>, and the king scallop, <i>Pecten maximus</i>) were analyzed in an identical fashion using proteomics pipeline. This enabled us to identify the critical elements of a “basic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong> kit” for calcification processes, which were conserved across the taxa irrespective of the shell morphology and arrangement of the crystal surfaces. In addition, protein domains controlling the crystal layers specific to aragonite and calcite were also identified. Intriguingly, a significant number of the identified SMPs contained domains related to immune functions. These were often are unique to each species implying their involvement not only in immunity, but also environmental adaptation. This suggests that the SMPs are selectively exported in a complex mix to endow the shell with both mechanical protection and biochemical defense.</p>

Hierarchical and Spatially Explicit Clustering of DNA Sequences with BAPS Software
<p>Phylogeographical analyses have become commonplace for a myriad of organisms with the advent of cheap DNA sequencing technologies. Bayesian model-based clustering is a powerful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong> for detecting important patterns in such data and can be used to decipher even quite subtle signals of systematic differences in molecular variation. Here, we introduce two upgrades to the Bayesian Analysis of Population Structure (BAPS) software, which enable 1) spatially explicit modeling of variation in DNA sequences and 2) hierarchical clustering of DNA sequence data to reveal nested genetic population structures. We provide a direct interface to map the results from spatial clustering with Google Maps using the portal <ext-link>http://www.spatialepidemiology.net/</ext-link> and illustrate this approach using sequence data from <i>Borrelia burgdorferi</i>. The usefulness of hierarchical clustering is demonstrated through an analysis of the metapopulation structure within a bacterial population experiencing a high level of local horizontal gene transfer.

An inducible knockout mouse to model the cell-autonomous role of PTEN in initiating endometrial, prostate and thyroid neoplasias
<p><i>PTEN</i> is one of the most frequently mutated tumor sup<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong>or genes in human cancers. The role of PTEN in carcinogenesis has been validated by knockout mouse models. <i>PTEN</i> heterozygous mice develop neoplasms in multiple organs. Unfortunately, the embryonic lethality of biallelic excision of <i>PTEN</i> has inhibited the study of complete <i>PTEN</i> deletion in the development and progression of cancer. By crossing PTEN conditional knockout mice with transgenic mice ex<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong>ing a tamoxifen-inducible Cre-ER<sup>T</sup> under the control of a chicken actin promoter, we have generated a tamoxifen-inducible mouse model that allows temporal control of <i>PTEN</i> deletion. Interestingly, administration of a single dose of tamoxifen resulted in <i>PTEN</i> deletion mainly in epithelial cells, but not in stromal, mesenchymal or hematopoietic cells. Using the mT/mG double-fluorescent Cre reporter mice, we demonstrate that epithelial-specific <i>PTEN</i> excision was caused by differential Cre activity among tissues and cells types. Tamoxifen-induced deletion of <i>PTEN</i> resulted in extremely rapid and consistent formation of endometrial <i>in situ</i> adenocarcinoma, prostate intraepithelial neoplasia and thyroid hyperplasia. We also analyzed the role of PTEN ablation in other epithelial cells, such as the tubular cells of the kidney, hepatocytes, colonic epithelial cells or bronchiolar epithelium, but those tissues did not exhibit neoplastic growth. Finally, to validate this model as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong> to assay the efficacy of anti-tumor drugs in PTEN deficiency, we administered the mTOR inhibitor everolimus to mice with induced <i>PTEN</i> deletion. Everolimus dramatically reduced the progression of endometrial proliferations and significantly reduced thyroid hyperplasia. This model could be a valuable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong> to study the cell-autonomous mechanisms involved in PTEN-loss-induced carcinogenesis and provides a good platform to study the effect of anti-neoplastic drugs on PTEN-negative tumors.</p>

<i>De novo</i> formation of nucleoli in developing mouse embryos originating from enucleolated zygotes
<p>The large, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong> oocyte nucleoli, sometimes referred to as nucleolus precursor bodies (NPBs), are essential for embryonic development in mammals; in their absence, the oocytes complete maturation and can be fertilized, but no nucleoli are formed in the zygote or embryo, leading to developmental failure. It has been convincingly documented that zygotes inherit the oocyte nucleolar material and form NPBs again in pronuclei. It is commonly accepted that during early embryonic development, the original <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong> zygote NPBs gradually transform into reticulated nucleoli of somatic cells. Here, we show that zygote NPBs are not required for embryonic and full-term development in the mouse. When NPBs were removed from late-stage zygotes by micromanipulation, the enucleolated zygotes developed to the blastocyst stage and, after transfer to recipients, live pups were obtained. We also describe <i>de novo</i> formation of nucleoli in developing embryos. After removal of NPBs from zygotes, they formed new nucleoli after several divisions. These results indicate that the zygote NPBs are not used in embryonic development and that the nucleoli in developing embryos originate from <i>de novo</i> synthesized materials.</p>

Derivation and Validation of the CREST Model for Very Early Prediction of Circulatory Etiology Death in Patients Without ST-Segment–Elevation Myocardial Infarction After Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>No practical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong> quantitates the risk of circulatory-etiology death (CED) immediately after successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation in patients without ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction. We developed and validated a prediction model to rapidly determine that risk and facilitate triage to individualized treatment pathways.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>With the use of INTCAR (International Cardiac Arrest Registry), an 87-question data set representing 44 centers in the United States and Europe, patients were classified as having had CED or a combined end point of neurological-etiology death or survival. Demographics and clinical factors were modeled in a derivation cohort, and backward stepwise logistic regression was used to identify factors independently associated with CED. We demonstrated model performance using area under the curve and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test in the derivation and validation cohorts, and assigned a simplified point-scoring system.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 638 patients in the derivation cohort, 121 (18.9%) had CED. The final model included preexisting coronary artery disease (odds ratio [OR], 2.86; confidence interval [CI], 1.83–4.49; <i>P</i>≤0.001), nonshockable rhythm (OR, 1.75; CI, 1.10–2.77; P=0.017), initial ejection fraction<30% (OR, 2.11; CI, 1.32–3.37; <i>P</i>=0.002), shock at presentation (OR, 2.27; CI, 1.42–3.62; P<0.001), and ischemic time >25 minutes (OR, 1.42; CI, 0.90–2.23; P=0.13). The derivation model area under the curve was 0.73, and Hosmer-Lemeshow test P=0.47. Outcomes were similar in the 318-patient validation cohort (area under the curve 0.68, Hosmer-Lemeshow test P=0.41). When assigned a point for each associated factor in the derivation model, the average predicted versus observed probability of CED with a CREST score (coronary artery disease, initial heart rhythm, low ejection fraction, shock at the time of admission, and ischemic time >25 minutes) of 0 to 5 was: 7.1% versus 10.2%, 9.5% versus 11%, 22.5% versus 19.6%, 32.4% versus 29.6%, 38.5% versus 30%, and 55.7% versus 50%.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The CREST model stratified patients immediately after resuscitation according to risk of a circulatory-etiology death.

Targeted mutagenesis using CRISPR/Cas system in medaka
<p>Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) system-based RNA-guided endonuclease (RGEN) has recently emerged as a simple and efficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong> for targeted genome editing. In this study, we showed successful targeted mutagenesis using RGENs in medaka, <i>Oryzias latipes</i>. Somatic and heritable mutations were induced with high efficiency at the targeted genomic sequence on the <i>DJ-1</i> gene in embryos that had been injected with the single guide RNA (sgRNA) transcribed by a T7 promoter and capped RNA encoding a Cas9 nuclease. The sgRNAs that were designed for the target genomic sequences without the 5′ end of GG required by the T7 promoter induced the targeted mutations. This suggests that the RGEN can target any sequence adjacent to an NGG protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence, which occurs once every 8 bp. The off-target alterations at 2 genomic loci harboring double mismatches in the 18-bp targeting sequences were induced in the RGEN-injected embryos. However, we also found that the off-target effects could be reduced by lower dosages of sgRNA. Taken together, our results suggest that CRISPR/Cas-mediated RGENs may be an efficient and flexible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong> for genome editing in medaka.</p>

Basal aurora kinase B activity is sufficient for histone H3 phosphorylation in prophase
<p>Histone H3 phosphorylation is the hallmark of mitosis deposited by aurora kinase B. Benzo[e]pyridoindoles are a family of potent, broad, ATP-competitive aurora kinase inhibitors. However, benzo[e]pyridoindole C4 only inhibits histone H3 phosphorylation in prophase but not in metaphase. Under the C4 treatment, the cells enter into mitosis with dephosphorylated histone H3, assemble chromosomes normally and progress to metaphase, and then to anaphase. C4 also induces lagging chromosome in anaphase but we demonstrated that these chromosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong>ion defects are not related to the absence of H3 phosphorylation in prophase. As a result of C4 action, mitosis lasts longer and the cell cycle is slowed down.</p><p>We reproduced the mitotic defects with reduced concentrations of potent pan aurora kinase as well as with a specific aurora B ATP-competitive inhibitor; we therefore propose that histone H3 phosphorylation and anaphase chromosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong>ion involve the basal activity of aurora kinase B. Our data suggest that aurora kinase B is progressively activated at mitosis entry and at anaphase onset. The full activation of aurora kinase B by its partners, in prometaphase, induces a shift in the catalytic domain of aurora B that modifies its affinity for ATP. These waves of activation/deactivation of aurora B correspond to different conformations of the chromosomal complex revealed by FRAP.</p><p>The presence of lagging chromosomes may have deleterious consequences on the daughter cells and, unfortunately, the situation may be encountered in patients receiving treatment with aurora kinase inhibitors.</p>

<i>Cryptosporidium parvum</i>-induced ileo-caecal adenocarcinoma and Wnt signaling in a mouse model
<p><i>Cryptosporidium</i> species are apicomplexan protozoans that are found worldwide. These parasites constitute a large risk to human and animal health. They cause self-limited diarrhea in immunocompetent hosts and a life-threatening disease in immunocompromised hosts. Interestingly, <i>Cryptosporidium parvum</i> has been related to digestive carcinogenesis in humans. Consistent with a potential tumorigenic role of this parasite, in an original reproducible animal model of chronic cryptosporidiosis based on dexamethasone-treated or untreated adult SCID mice, we formerly reported that <i>C. parvum</i> (strains of animal and human origin) is able to induce digestive adenocarcinoma even in infections induced with very low inoculum. The aim of this study was to further characterize this animal model and to explore metabolic pathways potentially involved in the development of <i>C. parvum</i>-induced ileo-caecal oncogenesis. We searched for alterations in genes or proteins commonly involved in cell cycle, differentiation or cell migration, such as β-catenin, <i>Apc</i>, E-cadherin, <i>Kras</i> and <i>p53</i>. After infection of animals with <i>C. parvum</i> we demonstrated immunohistochemical abnormal localization of Wnt signaling pathway components and p53. Mutations in the selected loci of studied genes were not found after high-throughput sequencing. Furthermore, alterations in the ultrastructure of adherens junctions of the ileo-caecal neoplastic epithelia of <i>C. parvum</i>-infected mice were recorded using transmission electron microscopy. In conclusion, we found for the first time that the Wnt signaling pathway, and particularly the cytoskeleton network, seems to be pivotal for the development of the <i>C. parvum</i>-induced neoplastic process and cell migration of transformed cells. Furthermore, this model is a valuable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong> in understanding the host-pathogen interactions associated with the intricate infection process of this parasite, which is able to modulate host cytoskeleton activities and several host-cell biological processes and remains a significant cause of infection worldwide.</p>

Cross-species analysis of genetically engineered mouse models of MAPK-driven colorectal cancer identifies hallmarks of the human disease
<p>Effective treatment options for advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) are limited, survival rates are poor and this disease continues to be a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Despite being a highly heterogeneous disease, a large subset of individuals with sporadic CRC typically harbor relatively few established ‘driver’ lesions. Here, we describe a collection of genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of sporadic CRC that combine lesions frequently altered in human patients, including well-characterized tumor sup<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong>ors and activators of MAPK signaling. Primary tumors from these models were profiled, and individual GEMM tumors segregated into groups based on their genotypes. Unique allelic and genotypic ex<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong>ion signatures were generated from these GEMMs and applied to clinically annotated human CRC patient samples. We provide evidence that a <i>Kras</i> signature derived from these GEMMs is capable of distinguishing human tumors harboring <i>KRAS</i> mutation, and tracks with poor prognosis in two independent human patient cohorts. Furthermore, the analysis of a panel of human CRC cell lines suggests that high ex<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong>ion of the GEMM <i>Kras</i> signature correlates with sensitivity to targeted pathway inhibitors. Together, these findings implicate GEMMs as powerful preclinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong>s with the capacity to recapitulate relevant human disease biology, and support the use of genetic signatures generated in these models to facilitate future drug discovery and validation efforts.</p>

Functional analysis of a zebrafish <i>myd88</i> mutant identifies key transcriptional components of the innate immune system
<p>Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are an important class of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that recognize microbial and danger signals. Their downstream signaling upon ligand binding is vital for initiation of the innate immune response. In human and mammalian models, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MYD88) is known for its central role as an adaptor molecule in interleukin 1 receptor (IL-1R) and TLR signaling. The zebrafish is increasingly used as a complementary model system for disease research and drug screening. Here, we describe a zebrafish line with a truncated version of MyD88 as the first zebrafish mutant for a TLR signaling component. We show that this immune-compromised mutant has a lower survival rate under standard rearing conditions and is more susceptible to challenge with the acute bacterial pathogens <i>Edwardsiella tarda</i> and <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>. Microarray and quantitative PCR analysis revealed that ex<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong>ion of genes for transcription factors central to innate immunity (including NF-ĸB and AP-1) and the pro-inflammatory cytokine Il1b, is dependent on MyD88 signaling during these bacterial infections. Nevertheless, ex<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong>ion of immune genes independent of MyD88 in the <i>myd88</i> mutant line was sufficient to limit growth of an attenuated <i>S. typhimurium</i> strain. In the case of infection with the chronic bacterial pathogen <i>Mycobacterium marinum</i>, we show that MyD88 signaling has an important protective role during early pathogenesis. During mycobacterial infection, the <i>myd88</i> mutant shows accelerated formation of granuloma-like aggregates and increased bacterial burden, with associated lower induction of genes central to innate immunity. This zebrafish <i>myd88</i> mutant will be a valuable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong> for further study of the role of IL1R and TLR signaling in the innate immunity processes underlying infectious diseases, inflammatory disorders and cancer.</p>

Generation and validation of a zebrafish model of EAST (epilepsy, ataxia, sensorineural deafness and tubulopathy) syndrome
<p>Recessive mutations in <i>KCNJ10</i>, which encodes an inwardly rectifying potassium channel, were recently identified as the cause of EAST syndrome, a severe and disabling multi-organ disorder consisting of epilepsy, ataxia, sensorineural deafness and tubulopathy that becomes clinically apparent with seizures in infancy. A <i>Kcnj10</i> knockout mouse shows postnatal mortality and is therefore not suitable for drug discovery. Because zebrafish are ideal for <i>in vivo</i> screening for potential therapeutics, we tested whether <i>kcnj10</i> knockdown in zebrafish would fill this need. We cloned zebrafish <i>kcnj10</i> and demonstrated that its function is equivalent to that of human <i>KCNJ10</i>. We next injected splice- and translation-blocking <i>kcnj10</i> antisense morpholino oligonucleotides and reproduced the cardinal symptoms of EAST syndrome – ataxia, epilepsy and renal tubular defects. Several of these phenotypes could be assayed in an automated manner. We could rescue the morphant phenotype with complementary RNA (cRNA) encoding human wild-type KCNJ10, but not with cRNA encoding a KCNJ10 mutation identified in individuals with EAST syndrome. Our results suggest that zebrafish will be a valuable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong> to screen for compounds that are potentially therapeutic for EAST syndrome or its individual symptoms. Knockdown of <i>kcnj10</i> represents the first zebrafish model of a salt-losing tubulopathy, which has relevance for blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong>ure control.</p>

Bloomsbury report on mouse embryo phenotyping: recommendations from the IMPC workshop on embryonic lethal screening
<p>Identifying genes that are important for embryo development is a crucial first step towards understanding their many functions in driving the ordered growth, differentiation and organogenesis of embryos. It can also shed light on the origins of developmental disease and congenital abnormalities. Current international efforts to examine gene function in the mouse provide a unique opportunity to pinpoint genes that are involved in embryogenesis, owing to the emergence of embryonic lethal knockout mutants. Through internationally coordinated efforts, the International Knockout Mouse Consortium (IKMC) has generated a public resource of mouse knockout strains and, in April 2012, the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC), supported by the EU InfraCoMP programme, convened a workshop to discuss developing a phenotyping pipeline for the investigation of embryonic lethal knockout lines. This workshop brought together over 100 scientists, from 13 countries, who are working in the academic and commercial research sectors, including experts and opinion leaders in the fields of embryology, animal imaging, data capture, quality control and annotation, high-throughput mouse production, phenotyping, and reporter gene analysis. This article summarises the outcome of the workshop, including (1) the vital scientific importance of phenotyping embryonic lethal mouse strains for basic and translational research; (2) a common framework to harmonise international efforts within this context; (3) the types of phenotyping that are likely to be most appropriate for systematic use, with a focus on 3D embryo imaging; (4) the importance of centralising data in a standardised form to facilitate data mining; and (5) the development of online <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tool</span></strong>s to allow open access to and dissemination of the phenotyping data.</p>

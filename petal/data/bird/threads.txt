Posterior spinal fusion for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis using a convex pedicle screw technique
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We present the results of correcting a double or triple curve   adolescent idiopathic scoliosis using a convex segmental pedicle   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screw</span></strong> technique.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We reviewed 191 patients with a mean age at surgery of 15 years   (11 to 23.3). Pedicle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screw</span></strong>s were placed at the convexity of each   curve. Concave <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screw</span></strong>s were inserted at one or two cephalad levels   and two caudal levels. The mean operating time was 183 minutes (132   to 276) and the mean blood loss 0.22% of the total blood volume   (0.08% to 0.4%). Multimodal monitoring remained stable throughout   the operation. The mean hospital stay was 6.8 days (5 to 15).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean post-operative follow-up was 5.8 years (2.5 to 9.5).   There were no neurological complications, deep wound infection,   obvious nonunion or need for revision surgery.</p><p>Upper thoracic scoliosis was corrected by a mean 68.2% (38% to   48%, p < 0.001). Main thoracic scoliosis was corrected by a mean   71% (43.5% to 8.9%, p < 0.001). Lumbar scoliosis was corrected   by a mean 72.3% (41% to 90%, p < 0.001). No patient lost more   than 3° of correction at follow-up. The thoracic kyphosis improved   by 13.1° (-21° to 49°, p < 0.001); the lumbar lordosis remained   unchanged (p = 0.58). Coronal imbalance was corrected by a mean   98% (0% to 100%, p < 0.001). Sagittal imbalance was corrected   by a mean 96% (20% to 100%, p < 0.001). The Scoliosis Research   Society Outcomes Questionnaire score improved from a mean 3.6 to   4.6 (2.4 to 4, p < 0.001); patient satisfaction was a mean 4.9   (4.8 to 5). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This technique carries low neurological and vascular risks because   the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screw</span></strong>s are placed in the pedicles of the convex side of the   curve, away from the spinal cord, cauda equina and the aorta. A   low implant density (pedicle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screw</span></strong> density 1.2, when a density of   2 represents placement of pedicle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screw</span></strong>s bilaterally at every instrumented segment)   achieved satisfactory correction of the scoliosis, an improved thoracic   kyphosis and normal global sagittal balance. Both patient satisfaction   and functional outcomes were excellent.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1080–7.</p></sec>

Accuracy of CT-navigated pedicle screw positioning in the cervical and upper thoracic region with and without prior anterior surgery and ventral plating
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We aimed to retrospectively assess the accuracy and safety of   CT navigated pedicle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screw</span></strong>s and to compare accuracy in the cervical   and thoracic spine (C2-T8) with (COMB) and without (POST) prior   anterior surgery (anterior cervical discectomy or corpectomy and   fusion with ventral plating: ACDF/ACCF).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 592 pedicle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screw</span></strong>s, which were used in 107 consecutively   operated patients (210 COMB, 382 POST), were analysed. The accuracy   of positioning was determined according to the classification of   Gertzbein and Robbins on post-operative CT scans.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>High accuracy was achieved in 524 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screw</span></strong>s (88.5%), 192 (87.7%)   in the cervical spine and 332 (89%) in the thoracic spine, respectively.   The results in the two surgical groups were compared and a logistic   regression mixed model was performed to analyse the risk of low   accuracy. Significantly lower accuracy was found in the COMB group   with 82.9% <i>versus</i> 91.6% in the POST group (p =   0.036). There were no neurological complications, but two vertebral artery   lesions were recorded. Three patients underwent revision surgery   for malpositioning of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screw</span></strong>. Although the risk of malpositioning   of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screw</span></strong> after primary anterior surgery was estimated to be 2.4-times   higher than with posterior surgery alone, the overall rates of complication   and revision were low.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We therefore conclude that CT navigated pedicle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screw</span></strong>s can be   positioned safely although greater caution must be taken in patients   who have previously undergone anterior surgery.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1373–80.</p></sec>

The Targon Femoral Neck hip screw <i>versus</i> cannulated screws for internal fixation of intracapsular fractures of the hip
<p>We compared a new fixation system, the Targon   Femoral Neck (TFN) hip <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screw</span></strong>, with the current standard treatment of   cannulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screw</span></strong> fixation. This was a single-centre, participant-blinded,   randomised controlled trial. Patients aged 65 years and over with   either a displaced or undisplaced intracapsular fracture of the   hip were eligible. The primary outcome was the risk of revision   surgery within one year of fixation.</p><p>A total of 174 participants were included in the trial. The absolute   reduction in risk of revision was of 4.7% (95% CI 14.2 to 22.5)   in favour of the TFN hip <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screw</span></strong> (chi-squared test, p = 0.741), which   was less than the pre-specified level of minimum clinically important   difference.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Regular Motifs in Xylan Modulate Molecular Flexibility and Interactions with Cellulose Surfaces
<p>Xylan is tightly associated with cellulose and lignin in secondary plant cell walls, contributing to its rigidity and structural integrity in vascular plants. However, the molecular features and the nanoscale forces that control the interactions among cellulose microfibrils, hemicelluloses, and lignin are still not well understood. Here, we combine comprehensive mass spectrometric glycan sequencing and molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the substitution pattern in softwood xylans and to investigate the effect of distinct intramolecular motifs on xylan conformation and on the interaction with cellulose surfaces in Norway spruce (<i>Picea abies</i>). We confirm the presence of motifs with evenly spaced glycosyl decorations on the xylan backbone, together with minor motifs with consecutive glucuronation. These domains are differently enriched in xylan fractions extracted by alkali and subcritical water, which indicates their preferential positioning in the secondary plant cell wall ultrastructure. The flexibility of the 3-fold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screw</span></strong> conformation of xylan in solution is enhanced by the presence of arabinofuranosyl decorations. Additionally, molecular dynamic simulations suggest that the glycosyl substitutions in xylan are not only sterically tolerated by the cellulose surfaces but that they increase the affinity for cellulose and favor the stabilization of the 2-fold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screw</span></strong> conformation. This effect is more significant for the hydrophobic surface compared with the hydrophilic ones, which demonstrates the importance of nonpolar driving forces on the structural integrity of secondary plant cell walls. These novel molecular insights contribute to an improved understanding of the supramolecular architecture of plant secondary cell walls and have fundamental implications for overcoming lignocellulose recalcitrance and for the design of advanced wood-based materials.</p>

Reconstruction with 3D-printed pelvic endoprostheses after resection of a pelvic tumour
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of this retrospective study were to report the feasibility   of using 3D-printing technology for patients with a pelvic tumour   who underwent reconstruction.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 35 patients underwent resection of a pelvic tumour   and reconstruction using 3D-printed endoprostheses between September   2013 and December 2015. According to Enneking’s classification of   bone defects, there were three Type I lesions, 12 Type II+III lesions,   five Type I+II lesions, two Type I+II+III lesions, ten type I+II+IV   lesions and three type I+II+III+IV lesions. A total of three patients   underwent reconstruction using an iliac prosthesis, 12 using a standard   hemipelvic prosthesis and 20 using a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screw</span></strong>-rod connected hemipelvic   prosthesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>All patients had an <i>en bloc</i> resection. Margins   were wide in 15 patients, marginal in 14 and intralesional in six.   After a mean follow-up of 20.5 months (6 to 30), 25 patients survived   without evidence of disease, five were alive with disease and five   had died from metastatic disease. </p><p>Complications included seven patients with delayed wound healing   and two with a dislocation of the hip. None had a deep infection.   For the 30 surviving patients, the mean Musculoskeletal Society   93 score was 22.7 (20 to 25) for patients with an iliac prosthesis,   19.8 (15 to 26) for those with a standard prosthesis, and 17.7 (9   to 25) for those with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screw</span></strong>-rod connected prosthesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The application of 3D-printing technology can facilitate the   precise matching and osseointegration between implants and the host   bone.

Local and Systemic Metabolic Responses during Light-Induced Rapid Systemic Signaling
<p>Plants evolved multiple signaling pathways that transduce light-related signals between leaves. These are thought to improve light stress acclimation in a process termed systemic acquired acclimation. Although responses to light stress have been studied extensively in local leaves, and to a lesser degree in systemic leaves, little is known about the responses that occur in the different tissues that connect the local to the systemic leaves. These could be important in defining the specificity of the systemic response as well as in supporting the generation of different systemic signals. Here, we report that local application of light stress to one rosette leaf of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bolt</span></strong>ing Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants resulted in a metabolic response that encompassed local, systemic and transport tissues (stem tissues that connect the local to the systemic tissues), demonstrating a high degree of physical and metabolic continuity between different tissues throughout the plant. Our results further indicate that the response of many of the systemically altered metabolites is associated with the function of the reactive oxygen species wave and that the levels of eight different metabolites are altered in a similar manner in all tissues tested (local, systemic, and transport). These compounds could define a core metabolic signature for light stress that propagates from the local to the systemic leaves. Our findings suggest that metabolic changes occurring in cells that connect the local and systemic tissues play an important role in systemic acquired acclimation and could convey specificity to the rapid systemic response of plants to light stress.</p>

The use of an anterior pelvic internal fixator to treat disruptions of the anterior pelvic ring
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The anterior pelvic internal fixator is increasingly used for   the treatment of unstable, or displaced, injuries of the anterior   pelvic ring. The evidence for its use, however, is limited. The   aim of this paper is to describe the indications for its use, how   it is applied and its complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We reviewed the case notes and radiographs of 50 patients treated   with an anterior pelvic internal fixator between April 2010 and   December 2015 at a major trauma centre in the United Kingdom. The   median follow-up time was 38 months (interquartile range 24 to 51).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Three patients were excluded from the analysis leaving 47 patients   with complete follow-up data. Of the 47 patients, 46 achieved radiological   union and one progressed to an asymptomatic nonunion. Of the remaining patients,   45 required supplementary posterior fixation with percutaneous iliosacral   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screw</span></strong>s, 2 of which required sacral plating. The incidence of injury   to the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN) was 34%. The rate   of infection was 2%. There were no other significant complications.   Without this treatment, 44 patients (94%) would have needed unilateral   or bilateral open reduction and plate fixation extending laterally   to the hip joint.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The anterior pelvic internal fixator reduces the need for extensive   open surgery and is a useful addition to the armamentarium for the   treatment of anterior pelvic injuries. It is associated with injury   to the LFCN in a third of patients.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B.1232–6.</p></sec>

Sliding hip screw <i>versus</i> the Targon PFT nail for trochanteric hip fractures
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To compare the outcomes for trochanteric fractures treated with   a sliding hip <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screw</span></strong> (SHS) or a cephalomedullary nail.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 400 patients with a trochanteric hip fracture were   randomised to receive a SHS or a cephalomedullary nail (Targon PFT).   All surviving patients were followed up to one year from injury.   Functional outcome was assessed by a research nurse blinded to the   implant used.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Recovery of mobility, as assessed by a mobility scale, was superior   for those treated with the intramedullary nail compared with the   SHS at eight weeks, three and nine months    (p-values between 0.01 and 0.04), the difference at six and 12 months   was not statistically significant (p = 0.15 and p = 0.18 respectively).   The mean difference was around 0.4 points (0.3 to 0.5) on a nine   point scale. Surgical time for the nail was four minutes less than   that for the SHS (p < 0.001). Fracture healing complications   were similar for the two groups. There were no statistically significant   differences between implants for any other recorded outcomes including   the need for post-operative blood transfusion, wound healing complications,   general medical complications, hospital stay or mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study confirms the findings of a previous study that both   methods of treatment produce similar results, although intramedullary   fixation does result in marginally improved regain of mobility in   comparison with the SHS.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1210–15.</p></sec>

Radiation reduction of minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion with localisation system in overweight patients
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (MITLIF)   has been well validated in overweight and obese patients who are   consequently subject to a higher radiation exposure. This prospective   multicentre study aimed to investigate the efficacy of a novel lumbar   localisation system for MITLIF in overweight patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The initial study group consisted of 175 patients. After excluding   49 patients for various reasons, 126 patients were divided into   two groups. Those in Group A were treated using the localisation   system while those in Group B were treated by conventional means.   The primary outcomes were the effective radiation dosage to the   surgeon and the exposure time.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were 62 patients in Group A and 64 in Group B. The mean   effective dosage was 0.0217 mSv (standard deviation (<sc>sd</sc>) 0.0079)   in Group A and 0.0383 mSv (<sc>sd</sc> 0.0104) in Group B (p < 0.001).   The mean fluoroscopy exposure time was 26.42 seconds (<sc>sd</sc> 5.91)   in Group A and 40.67 seconds (<sc>sd</sc> 8.18) in Group B (p <   0.001). The operating time was 175.56 minutes (<sc>sd</sc> 32.23)   and 206.08 minutes (<sc>sd</sc> 30.15) (p < 0.001), respectively.   The mean pre-operative localisation time was 4.73 minutes (<sc>sd</sc> 0.84)   in Group A and 7.03 minutes (<sc>sd</sc> 1.51) in Group B (p <   0.001). The mean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">screw</span></strong> placement time was 47.37 minutes (<sc>sd</sc> 10.43)   in Group A and 67.86 minutes (<sc>sd</sc> 14.15) in Group B (p <   0.001).

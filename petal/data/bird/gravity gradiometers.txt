Extra strengthening and work hardening in gradient nanotwinned metals
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong> structures exist ubiquitously in nature and are increasingly being introduced in engineering. However, understanding structural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>–related mechanical behaviors in all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong> structures, including those in engineering materials, has been challenging. We explored the mechanical performance of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong> nanotwinned structure with highly tunable structural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>s in pure copper. A large structural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong> allows for superior work hardening and strength that can exceed those of the strongest component of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong> structure. We found through systematic experiments and atomistic simulations that this unusual behavior is afforded by a unique patterning of ultrahigh densities of dislocations in the grain interiors. These observations not only shed light on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong> structures, but may also indicate a promising route for improving the mechanical properties of materials through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong> design.</p>

Electromagnetic evidence that SSS17a is the result of a binary neutron star merger
<p>Eleven hours after the detection of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravit</span></strong>ational wave source GW170817 by the Laser Interferometer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravit</span></strong>ational-Wave Observatory and Virgo Interferometers, an associated optical transient, SSS17a, was identified in the galaxy NGC 4993. Although the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravit</span></strong>ational wave data indicate that GW170817 is consistent with the merger of two compact objects, the electromagnetic observations provide independent constraints on the nature of that system. We synthesize the optical to near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy of SSS17a collected by the One-Meter Two-Hemisphere collaboration, finding that SSS17a is unlike other known transients. The source is best described by theoretical models of a kilonova consisting of radioactive elements produced by rapid neutron capture (the r-process). We conclude that SSS17a was the result of a binary neutron star merger, reinforcing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravit</span></strong>ational wave result.</p>

Scaling morphogen gradients during tissue growth by a cell division rule
<p>Morphogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>s guide the patterning of tissues and organs during the development of multicellular organisms. In many cases, morphogen signaling is also required for tissue growth. The consequences of this interplay between growth and patterning are not well understood. In the <i>Drosophila</i> wing imaginal disc, the morphogen Dpp guides patterning and is also required for tissue growth. In particular, it was recently reported that cell division in the disc correlates with the temporal increase in Dpp signaling. Here we mathematically model morphogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong> formation in a growing tissue, accounting also for morphogen advection and dilution. Our analysis defines a new scaling mechanism, which we term the morphogen-dependent division rule (MDDR): when cell division depends on the temporal increase in morphogen signaling, the morphogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong> scales with the growing tissue size, tissue growth becomes spatially uniform and the tissue naturally attains a finite size. This model is consistent with many properties of the wing disc. However, we find that the MDDR is not consistent with the phenotype of scaling-defective mutants, supporting the view that temporal increase in Dpp signaling is not the driver of cell division during late phases of disc development. More generally, our results show that local coupling of cell division with morphogen signaling can lead to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong> scaling and uniform growth even in the absence of global feedbacks. The MDDR scaling mechanism might be particularly beneficial during rapid proliferation, when global feedbacks are hard to implement.</p>

A surface gravity traverse on Mars indicates low bedrock density at Gale crater
<p>Gravimetry, the precise measurement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravit</span></strong>ational fields, can be used to probe the internal structure of Earth and other planets. The Curiosity rover on Mars carries accelerometers normally used for navigation and attitude determination. We have recalibrated them to isolate the signature of the changing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravit</span></strong>ational acceleration as the rover climbs through Gale crater. The subsurface rock density is inferred from the measured decrease in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravit</span></strong>ational field strength with elevation. The density of the sedimentary rocks in Gale crater is 1680 ± 180 kilograms per cubic meter. This value is lower than expected, indicating a high porosity and constraining maximum burial depths of the rocks over their history.</p>

Decoding of position in the developing neural tube from antiparallel morphogen gradients
<p>Like many developing tissues, the vertebrate neural tube is patterned by antiparallel morphogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>s. To understand how these inputs are interpreted, we measured morphogen signaling and target gene expression in mouse embryos and chick ex vivo assays. From these data, we derived and validated a characteristic decoding map that relates morphogen input to the positional identity of neural progenitors. Analysis of the observed responses indicates that the underlying interpretation strategy minimizes patterning errors in response to the joint input of noisy opposing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>s. We reverse-engineered a transcriptional network that provides a mechanistic basis for the observed cell fate decisions and accounts for the precision and dynamics of pattern formation. Together, our data link opposing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong> dynamics in a growing tissue to precise pattern formation.</p>

Dynamic creation and evolution of gradient nanostructure in single-crystal metallic microcubes
<p>We demonstrate the dynamic creation and subsequent static evolution of extreme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong> nanograined structures in initially near–defect-free single-crystal silver microcubes. Extreme nanostructural transformations are imposed by high strain rates, strain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>s, and recrystallization in high-velocity impacts of the microcubes against an impenetrable substrate. We synthesized the silver microcubes in a bottom-up seed-growth process and use an advanced laser-induced projectile impact testing apparatus to selectively launch them at supersonic velocities (~400 meters per second). Our study provides new insights into the fundamental deformation mechanisms and the effects of crystal and sample-shape symmetries resulting from high-velocity impacts. The nanostructural transformations produced in our experiments show promising pathways to developing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong> nanograined metals for engineering applications requiring both high strength and high toughness—for example, in structural components of aircraft and spacecraft.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
The Role of Auxin in the Pattern Formation of the Asteraceae Flower Head (Capitulum)
<p>Nature often creates complex structures by rearranging pre-existing units. One such example is the flower head (capitulum) in daisies, where a group of flowers (florets) and phyllaries (modified bracts) are arranged to superficially mimic a single flower. The capitulum is a key taxonomical innovation that defines the daisy family (Asteraceae), the largest flowering plant group. However, patterning mechanisms underlying its structure remain elusive. Here, we show that auxin, a plant hormone, provides a developmental patterning cue for the capitulum. During capitulum development, a temporal auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong> occurs, regulating the successive and centripetal formation of distinct florets and phyllaries. Disruption of the endogenous auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong> led to homeotic conversions of florets and phyllaries in the capitulum. Furthermore, auxin regulates floral meristem identity genes, such as <i>Matricaria inodora RAY2</i> and <i>M</i>. <i>inodora LEAFY</i>, which determine floret and phyllary identity. This study reveals the mechanism of capitulum patterning and highlights how common developmental tools, such as hormone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>s, have independently evolved in plants and animals.</p>

Comparative Analysis of Arabidopsis Ecotypes Reveals a Role for Brassinosteroids in Root Hydrotropism
<p>Plant roots respond to soil moisture <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>s and remodel their growth orientation toward water through hydrotropism, a process vital for acclimation to a changing soil environment. Mechanisms underlying the root hydrotropic response, however, remain poorly understood. Here, we examined hydrotropism in 31 Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) ecotypes collected from different parts of the world and grown along moisture <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>s in a specially designed soil-simulation system. Comparative transcriptome profiling and physiological analyses were carried out on three selected ecotypes, Wassilewskija (Ws), Columbia (Col-0) (strongly hydrotropic), Col-0 (moderately hydrotropic), and C24 (weakly hydrotropic), and in mutant lines with altered root hydrotropic responses. We show that H<sup>+</sup> efflux, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, redox homeostasis, epigenetic regulation, and phytohormone signaling may contribute to root hydrotropism. Among phytohormones, the role of brassinosteroids (BRs) was examined further. In the presence of an inhibitor of BR biosynthesis, the strong hydrotropic response observed in Ws was reduced. The root H<sup>+</sup> efflux and primary root elongation also were inhibited when compared with C24, an ecotype that showed a weak hydrotropic response. The BR-insensitive mutant <i>bri1-5</i> displayed higher rates of root growth inhibition and root curvature on moisture <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>s in vertical or oblique orientation when compared with wild-type Ws. We also demonstrate that BRI1 (a BR receptor) interacts with AHA2 (a plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase) and that their expression patterns are highly coordinated. This synergistic action may contribute to the strong hydrotropism observed in Ws. Our results suggest that BR-associated H<sup>+</sup> efflux is critical in the hydrotropic response of Arabidopsis roots.</p>

Gradients in Wall Mechanics and Polysaccharides along Growing Inflorescence Stems
<p>At early stages of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) flowering, the inflorescence stem undergoes rapid growth, with elongation occurring predominantly in the apical ∼4 cm of the stem. We measured the spatial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>s for elongation rate, osmotic pressure, cell wall thickness, and wall mechanical compliances and coupled these macroscopic measurements with molecular-level characterization of the polysaccharide composition, mobility, hydration, and intermolecular interactions of the inflorescence cell wall using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and small-angle neutron scattering. Force-extension curves revealed a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>, from high to low, in the plastic and elastic compliances of cell walls along the elongation zone, but plots of growth rate versus wall compliances were strikingly nonlinear. Neutron-scattering curves showed only subtle changes in wall structure, including a slight increase in cellulose microfibril alignment along the growing stem. In contrast, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectra showed substantial decreases in pectin amount, esterification, branching, hydration, and mobility in an apical-to-basal pattern, while the cellulose content increased modestly. These results suggest that pectin structural changes are connected with increases in pectin-cellulose interaction and reductions in wall compliances along the apical-to-basal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong> in growth rate. These pectin structural changes may lessen the ability of the cell wall to undergo stress relaxation and irreversible expansion (e.g. induced by expansins), thus contributing to the growth kinematics of the growing stem.</p>

LAZY Genes Mediate the Effects of Gravity on Auxin Gradients and Plant Architecture<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>A rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) mutant led to the discovery of a plant-specific LAZY1 protein that controls the orientation of shoots. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) possesses six <i>LAZY</i> genes having spatially distinct expression patterns. Branch angle phenotypes previously associated with single <i>LAZY</i> genes were here studied in roots and shoots of single and higher-order <i>atlazy</i> mutants. The results identify the major contributors to root and shoot branch angles and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravit</span></strong>ropic behavior of seedling hypocotyls and primary roots. <i>AtLAZY1</i> is the principal determinant of inflorescence branch angle. The weeping inflorescence phenotype of <i>atlazy1</i>,<i>2</i>,<i>4</i> mutants may be due at least in part to a reversal in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravit</span></strong>ropism mechanism. <i>AtLAZY2</i> and <i>AtLAZY4</i> determined lateral root branch angle. Lateral roots of the <i>atlazy2</i>,<i>4</i> double mutant emerged slightly upward, approximately 10° greater than perpendicular to the primary root axis, and they were a<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravit</span></strong>ropic. Etiolated hypocotyls of the quadruple <i>atlazy1</i>,<i>2</i>,<i>3</i>,<i>4</i> mutant were essentially a<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravit</span></strong>ropic, but their phototropic response was robust. In light-grown seedlings, the root of the <i>atlazy2</i>,<i>3</i>,<i>4</i> mutant was also a<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravit</span></strong>ropic but when adapted to dim red light it displayed a reversed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravit</span></strong>ropic response. A reversed auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong> across the root visualized by a fluorescent signaling reporter explained the reversed, upward bending response. We propose that AtLAZY proteins control plant architecture by coupling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravit</span></strong>y sensing to the formation of auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>s that override a LAZY-independent mechanism that creates an opposing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravit</span></strong>y-induced auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>.</p>

Light Sheet Microscopy Imaging of Light Absorption and Photosynthesis Distribution in Plant Tissue
<p>In vivo variable chlorophyll fluorescence measurements of photosystem II (PSII) quantum yields in optically dense systems are complicated by steep tissue light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>s due to scattering and absorption. Consequently, externally measured effective PSII quantum yields may be composed of signals derived from cells differentially exposed to actinic light, where cells located deeper inside tissues receive lower irradiance than cells closer to the surface and can display distinct photophysiological status. We demonstrate how measured distributions of PSII quantum yields in plant tissue change under natural tissue light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>s as compared with conventionally measured quantum yields with even exposure to actinic light. This was achieved by applying actinic irradiance perpendicular to one side of thallus cross sections of the aquatic macrophyte <i>Fucus vesiculosus</i> with laser light sheets of defined spectral composition, while imaging variable chlorophyll fluorescence from cross sections with a microscope-mounted pulse amplitude-modulated imaging system. We show that quantum yields are highly affected by light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>s and that traditional surface-based variable chlorophyll fluorescence measurements result in substantial underestimations and/or overestimations, depending on incident actinic irradiance. We present a method for using chlorophyll fluorescence profiles in combination with integrating sphere measurements of reflectance and transmittance to calculate depth-resolved photon absorption profiles, which can be used to correct apparent PSII electron transport rates to photons absorbed by PSII. Absorption profiles of the investigated aquatic macrophyte were different in shape from what is typically observed in terrestrial leaves, and based on this finding, we discuss strategies for optimizing photon absorption via modulation of the structural organization of phytoelements according to in situ light environments.</p>

Hemodynamic and Echocardiographic Comparison of the Lotus and CoreValve Transcatheter Aortic Valves in Patients With High and Extreme Surgical Risk
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Comparative echocardiographic data on transcatheter aortic valve replacement systems from randomized trials are limited. The REPRISE III trial (Repositionable Percutaneous Replacement of Stenotic Aortic Valve through Implantation of Lotus Valve System – Randomized Clinical Evaluation) is a multicenter, randomized comparison of a mechanically expanded (Lotus) versus self-expanding (CoreValve) transcatheter aortic valve replacement device.

Patients were enrolled at 55 centers. All transthoracic echocardiograms with Doppler were obtained following a standard protocol up to 12 months postimplant and analyzed by a core laboratory. Valve size, mean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>, aortic valve area, and Doppler velocity index and their impact on clinical outcomes are reported. Additional parameters including paravalvular leak were evaluated using a multiparametric approach.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 912 patients were randomly assigned (2:1 ratio; 607 Lotus:305 CoreValve). Median age was 84 years, 51% of the patients were women, and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons score was 6.8±4.1. CoreValve demonstrated lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>s and larger aortic valve area and Doppler velocity index than Lotus at discharge; the difference decreased in subsequent follow-up up to a year (all <i>P</i><0.01). Lotus had lower rates of paravalvular leak that persisted over time (<i>P</i><0.05). Similar outcomes were seen when comparing each valve type by size group (small, medium, large). The hemodynamic differences between valves did not translate into worse clinical outcomes. All-cause mortality was not different between the 2 groups in any of the 3 valve sizes.

Stepwise phosphorylation of leukotriene B<sub>4</sub> receptor 1 defines cellular responses to leukotriene B<sub>4</sub>
<p>Leukotriene B<sub>4</sub> (LTB<sub>4</sub>) receptor type 1 (BLT1) is abundant in phagocytic and immune cells and plays crucial roles in various inflammatory diseases. BLT1 is phosphorylated at several serine and threonine residues upon stimulation with the inflammatory lipid LTB<sub>4</sub>. Using Phos-tag gel electrophoresis to separate differentially phosphorylated forms of BLT1, we identified two distinct types of phosphorylation, basal and ligand-induced, in the carboxyl terminus of human BLT1. In the absence of LTB<sub>4</sub>, the basal phosphorylation sites were modified to various degrees, giving rise to many different phosphorylated forms of BLT1. Different concentrations of LTB<sub>4</sub> induced distinct phosphorylation events, and these ligand-induced modifications facilitated additional phosphorylation events at the basal phosphorylation sites. Because neutrophils migrate toward inflammatory sites along a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong> of LTB<sub>4</sub>, the degree of BLT1 phosphorylation likely increases in parallel with the increase in LTB<sub>4</sub> concentration as the cells migrate. At high concentrations of LTB<sub>4</sub>, deficiencies in these two types of phosphorylation events impaired chemotaxis and β-hexosaminidase release, a proxy for degranulation, in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) and rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells, respectively. These results suggest that an LTB<sub>4</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong> around inflammatory sites enhances BLT1 phosphorylation in a stepwise manner to facilitate the precise migration of phagocytic and immune cells and the initiation of local responses, including degranulation.</p>

Ligand- and voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels differentially regulate the mode of vesicular neuropeptide release in mammalian sensory neurons
<p>Neuropeptides released from dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons play essential roles in the neurotransmission of sensory inputs, including those underlying nociception and pathological pain. Neuropeptides are released from intracellular vesicles through two modes: a partial release mode called “kiss-and-run” (KAR) and a full release mode called “full fusion–like” (FFL). Using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, we traced the release of pH-sensitive green fluorescent protein–tagged neuropeptide Y (pHluorin-NPY) from individual dense-core vesicles in the soma and axon of single DRG neurons after Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through either voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VGCCs) or ligand-gated transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channels. We found that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through VGCCs stimulated FFL and a greater single release of neuropeptides. In contrast, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through TRPV1 channels stimulated KAR and a pulsed but prolonged release of neuropeptides that was partially mediated by Dynamin 1, which limits fusion pore expansion. Suppressing the Ca<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong> to an extent similar to that seen after TRPV1 activation abolished the VGCC preference for FFL. The findings suggest that by generating a steeper Ca<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>, VGCCs promote a more robust fusion pore opening that facilitates FFL. Thus, KAR and FFL release modes are differentially regulated by the two principal types of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable channels in DRG neurons.</p>

Metabolic asymmetry and the global diversity of marine predators

We compiled a comprehensive dataset for 998 species of sharks, fish, reptiles, mammals, and birds to identify and quantify inverse latitudinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>s in diversity, and derived a theory to explain these patterns. We found that richness, phylogenetic diversity, and abundance of marine predators diverge systematically with thermoregulatory strategy and water temperature, reflecting metabolic differences between endotherms and ectotherms that drive trophic and competitive interactions. Spatial patterns of foraging support theoretical predictions, with total prey consumption by mammals increasing by a factor of 80 from the equator to the poles after controlling for productivity.</p>

Flexo-photovoltaic effect

Here we report that the bulk photovoltaic effect, which is free from the thermodynamic Shockley-Queisser limit but usually manifested only in noncentrosymmetric (piezoelectric or ferroelectric) materials, can be realized in any semiconductor, including silicon, by mediation of flexoelectric effect. We used either an atomic force microscope or a micrometer-scale indentation system to introduce strain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>s, thus creating very large photovoltaic currents from centrosymmetric single crystals of strontium titanate, titanium dioxide, and silicon. This strain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>–induced bulk photovoltaic effect, which we call the flexo-photovoltaic effect, functions in the absence of a p-n junction. This finding may extend present solar cell technologies by boosting the solar energy conversion efficiency from a wide pool of established semiconductors.</p>

Morphogen gradient reconstitution reveals Hedgehog pathway design principles
<p>In developing tissues, cells estimate their spatial position by sensing graded concentrations of diffusible signaling proteins called morphogens.

In this work, combining cell-based in vitro <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong> reconstitution, genetic rewiring, and mathematical modeling, we systematically analyzed the distinctive architectural features of the Sonic Hedgehog pathway. We found that the combination of double-negative regulatory logic and negative feedback through the PTCH receptor accelerates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong> formation and improves robustness to variation in the morphogen production rate compared with alternative designs. The ability to isolate morphogen patterning from concurrent developmental processes and to compare the patterning behaviors of alternative, rewired pathway architectures offers a powerful way to understand and engineer multicellular patterning.</p>

Global climatic drivers of leaf size
<p>Leaf size varies by over a 100,000-fold among species worldwide. Although 19th-century plant geographers noted that the wet tropics harbor plants with exceptionally large leaves, the latitudinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong> of leaf size has not been well quantified nor the key climatic drivers convincingly identified. Here, we characterize worldwide patterns in leaf size. Large-leaved species predominate in wet, hot, sunny environments; small-leaved species typify hot, sunny environments only in arid conditions; small leaves are also found in high latitudes and elevations. By modeling the balance of leaf energy inputs and outputs, we show that daytime and nighttime leaf-to-air temperature differences are key to geographic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>s in leaf size. This knowledge can enrich “next-generation” vegetation models in which leaf temperature and water use during photosynthesis play key roles.</p>

Higher predation risk for insect prey at low latitudes and elevations
<p>Biotic interactions underlie ecosystem structure and function, but predicting interaction outcomes is difficult. We tested the hypothesis that biotic interaction strength increases toward the equator, using a global experiment with model caterpillars to measure predation risk. Across an 11,660-kilometer latitudinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong> spanning six continents, we found increasing predation toward the equator, with a parallel pattern of increasing predation toward lower elevations. Patterns across both latitude and elevation were driven by arthropod predators, with no systematic trend in attack rates by birds or mammals. These matching <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>s at global and regional scales suggest consistent drivers of biotic interaction strength, a finding that needs to be integrated into general theories of herbivory, community organization, and life-history evolution.</p>

Restored iron transport by a small molecule promotes absorption and hemoglobinization in animals
<p>Multiple human diseases ensue from a hereditary or acquired deficiency of iron-transporting protein function that diminishes transmembrane iron flux in distinct sites and directions. Because other iron-transport proteins remain active, labile iron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>s build up across the corresponding protein-deficient membranes. Here we report that a small-molecule natural product, hinokitiol, can harness such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>s to restore iron transport into, within, and/or out of cells. The same compound promotes gut iron absorption in DMT1-deficient rats and ferroportin-deficient mice, as well as hemoglobinization in DMT1- and mitoferrin-deficient zebrafish. These findings illuminate a general mechanistic framework for small molecule–mediated site- and direction-selective restoration of iron transport. They also suggest that small molecules that partially mimic the function of missing protein transporters of iron, and possibly other ions, may have potential in treating human diseases.</p>

iPTF16geu: A multiply imaged, gravitationally lensed type Ia supernova
<p>We report the discovery of a multiply imaged, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravit</span></strong>ationally lensed type Ia supernova, iPTF16geu (SN 2016geu), at redshift <i>z</i> = 0.409. This phenomenon was identified because the light from the stellar explosion was magnified more than 50 times by the curvature of space around matter in an intervening galaxy. We used high-spatial-resolution observations to resolve four images of the lensed supernova, approximately 0.3 arc seconds from the center of the foreground galaxy. The observations probe a physical scale of ~1 kiloparsec, smaller than is typical in other studies of extragalactic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravit</span></strong>ational lensing. The large magnification and symmetric image configuration imply close alignment between the lines of sight to the supernova and to the lens. The relative magnifications of the four images provide evidence for substructures in the lensing galaxy.</p>

Formation of the Orientale lunar multiring basin

A SWELL Channel Indeed
<p>Water constitutes about two-thirds of the mass of most living organisms. It serves as a solvent in the cell cytoplasm and exterior, and like other molecules, it moves down its concentration <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong> by osmosis.

Boron Alleviates Aluminum Toxicity by Promoting Root Alkalization in Transition Zone via Polar Auxin Transport
<p>Boron (B) alleviates aluminum (Al) toxicity in higher plants; however, the underlying mechanisms behind this phenomenon remain unknown. Here, we used bromocresol green pH indicator, noninvasive microtest, and microelectrode ion flux estimation techniques to demonstrate that B promotes root surface pH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>s in pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) roots, leading to alkalization in the root transition zone and acidification in the elongation zone, while Al inhibits these pH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>s. B significantly decreased Al accumulation in the transition zone (∼1.0–2.5 mm from the apex) of lateral roots, thereby alleviating Al-induced inhibition of root elongation. Net indole acetic acid (IAA) efflux detected by an IAA-sensitive platinum microelectrode showed that polar auxin transport, which peaked in the root transition zone, was inhibited by Al toxicity, while it was partially recovered by B. Electrophysiological experiments using the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) auxin transporter mutants (<i>auxin resistant1-7</i>; <i>pin-formed2</i> [<i>pin2</i>]) and the specific polar auxin transporter inhibitor1-naphthylphthalamic acid showed that PIN2-based polar auxin transport is involved in root surface alkalization in the transition zone. Our results suggest that B promotes polar auxin transport driven by the auxin efflux transporter PIN2 and leads to the downstream regulation of the plasma membrane-H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, resulting in elevated root surface pH, which is essential to decrease Al accumulation in this Al-targeted apical root zone. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the role of exogenous B in alleviation of Al accumulation and toxicity in plants.</p>

Reassessing the Roles of PIN Proteins and Anticlinal Microtubules during Pavement Cell Morphogenesis
<p>The leaf epidermis is a biomechanical shell that influences the size and shape of the organ. Its morphogenesis is a multiscale process in which nanometer-scale cytoskeletal protein complexes, individual cells, and groups of cells pattern growth and define macroscopic leaf traits. Interdigitated growth of neighboring cells is an evolutionarily conserved developmental strategy. Understanding how signaling pathways and cytoskeletal proteins pattern cell walls during this form of tissue morphogenesis is an important research challenge. The cellular and molecular control of a lobed cell morphology is currently thought to involve PIN-FORMED (PIN)-type plasma membrane efflux carriers that generate subcellular auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>s. Auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>s were proposed to function across cell boundaries to encode stable offset patterns of cortical microtubules and actin filaments between adjacent cells. Many models suggest that long-lived microtubules along the anticlinal cell wall generate local cell wall heterogeneities that restrict local growth and specify the timing and location of lobe formation. Here, we used Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) reverse genetics and multivariate long-term time-lapse imaging to test current cell shape control models. We found that neither PIN proteins nor long-lived microtubules along the anticlinal wall predict the patterns of lobe formation. In fields of lobing cells, anticlinal microtubules are not correlated with cell shape and are unstable at the time scales of cell expansion. Our analyses indicate that anticlinal microtubules have multiple functions in pavement cells and that lobe initiation is likely controlled by complex interactions among cell geometry, cell wall stress patterns, and transient microtubule networks that span the anticlinal and periclinal walls.</p>

Phloem Loading through Plasmodesmata: A Biophysical Analysis
<p>In many species, Suc en route out of the leaf migrates from photosynthetically active mesophyll cells into the phloem down its concentration <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong> via plasmodesmata, i.e. symplastically. In some of these plants, the process is entirely passive, but in others phloem Suc is actively converted into larger sugars, raffinose and stachyose, and segregated (trapped), thus raising total phloem sugar concentration to a level higher than in the mesophyll. Questions remain regarding the mechanisms and selective advantages conferred by both of these symplastic-loading processes. Here, we present an integrated model—including local and global transport and kinetics of polymerization—for passive and active symplastic loading. We also propose a physical model of transport through the plasmodesmata. With these models, we predict that (1) relative to passive loading, polymerization of Suc in the phloem, even in the absence of segregation, lowers the sugar content in the leaf required to achieve a given export rate and accelerates export for a given concentration of Suc in the mesophyll and (2) segregation of oligomers and the inverted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong> of total sugar content can be achieved for physiologically reasonable parameter values, but even higher export rates can be accessed in scenarios in which polymers are allowed to diffuse back into the mesophyll. We discuss these predictions in relation to further studies aimed at the clarification of loading mechanisms, fitness of active and passive symplastic loading, and potential targets for engineering improved rates of export.</p>

SHADE AVOIDANCE 4 Is Required for Proper Auxin Distribution in the Hypocotyl
<p>The phytohormone auxin is involved in virtually every aspect of plant growth and development. Through polar auxin transport, auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>s can be established, which then direct plant differentiation and growth. Shade avoidance responses are well-known processes that require polar auxin transport. In this study, we have identified a mutant, <i>shade avoidance 4</i> (<i>sav4</i>), defective in shade-induced hypocotyl elongation and basipetal auxin transport. <i>SAV4</i> encodes an unknown protein with armadillo repeat- and tetratricopeptide repeat-like domains known to provide protein-protein interaction surfaces. C terminally yellow fluorescent protein-tagged SAV4 localizes to both the plasma membrane and the nucleus. Membrane-localized SAV4 displays a polar association with the shootward plasma membrane domain in hypocotyl and root cells, which appears to be necessary for its function in hypocotyl elongation. Cotransfection of SAV4 and ATP-binding cassette B1 (ABCB1) auxin transporter in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>) revealed that SAV4 blocks ABCB1-mediated auxin efflux. We thus propose that polarly localized SAV4 acts to inhibit ABCB-mediated auxin efflux toward shoots and facilitates the establishment of proper auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>s.</p>

Apparent Overinvestment in Leaf Venation Relaxes Leaf Morphological Constraints on Photosynthesis in Arid Habitats
<p>Leaf veins supply the mesophyll with water that evaporates when stomata are open to allow CO<sub>2</sub> uptake for photosynthesis. Theoretical analyses suggest that water is optimally distributed in the mesophyll when the lateral distance between veins (<i>d</i><sub>x</sub>) is equal to the distance from these veins to the epidermis (<i>d</i><sub>y</sub>), expressed as <i>d</i><sub>x</sub>:<i>d</i><sub>y</sub> ≈ 1. Although this theory is supported by observations of many derived angiosperms, we hypothesize that plants in arid environments may reduce <i>d</i><sub>x</sub>:<i>d</i><sub>y</sub> below unity owing to climate-specific functional adaptations of increased leaf thickness and increased vein density. To test our hypothesis, we assembled leaf hydraulic, morphological, and photosynthetic traits of 68 species from the <i>Eucalyptus</i> and <i>Corymbia</i> genera (termed eucalypts) along an aridity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong> in southwestern Australia. We inferred the potential gas-exchange advantage of reducing <i>d</i><sub>x</sub> beyond <i>d</i><sub>y</sub> using a model that links leaf morphology and hydraulics to photosynthesis. Our observations reveal that eucalypts in arid environments have thick amphistomatous leaves with high vein densities, resulting in <i>d</i><sub>x</sub>:<i>d</i><sub>y</sub> ratios that range from 1.6 to 0.15 along the aridity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>. Our model suggests that, as leaves become thicker, the effect of reducing <i>d</i><sub>x</sub> beyond <i>d</i><sub>y</sub> is to offset the reduction in leaf gas exchange that would result from maintaining <i>d</i><sub>x</sub>:<i>d</i><sub>y</sub> at unity. This apparent overinvestment in leaf venation may be explained from the selective pressure of aridity, under which traits associated with long leaf life span, high hydraulic and thermal capacitances, and high potential rates of leaf water transport confer a competitive advantage.</p>

Simultaneous high-resolution pH and spectrophotometric recordings of oxygen binding in blood microvolumes
<p>Oxygen equilibrium curves have been widely used to understand oxygen transport in numerous organisms. A major challenge has been to monitor oxygen binding characteristics and concomitant pH changes as they occur <i>in vivo</i>, in limited sample volumes. Here we report a technique allowing highly resolved and simultaneous monitoring of pH and blood pigment saturation in minute blood volumes. We equipped a gas diffusion chamber with a broad-range fibre-optic spectrophotometer and a micro-pH optode and recorded changes of pigment oxygenation along oxygen partial pressure (<i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) and pH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>s to test the setup. Oxygen binding parameters derived from measurements in only 15 μl of haemolymph from the cephalopod <i>Octopus vulgaris</i> showed low instrumental error (0.93%) and good agreement with published data. Broad-range spectra, each resolving 2048 data points, provided detailed insight into the complex absorbance characteristics of diverse blood types. After consideration of photobleaching and intrinsic fluorescence, pH optodes yielded accurate recordings and resolved a sigmoidal shift of 0.03 pH units in response to changing <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> from 0 to 21 kPa. Highly resolved continuous recordings along pH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>s conformed to stepwise measurements at low rates of pH changes. In this study we showed that a diffusion chamber upgraded with a broad-range spectrophotometer and an optical pH sensor accurately characterizes oxygen binding with minimal sample consumption and manipulation. We conclude that the modified diffusion chamber is highly suitable for experimental biologists who demand high flexibility, detailed insight into oxygen binding as well as experimental and biological accuracy combined in a single setup.</p>

Physiology of Angina and Its Alleviation With Nitroglycerin
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The mechanisms governing exercise-induced angina and its alleviation by the most commonly used antianginal drug, nitroglycerin, are incompletely understood. The purpose of this study was to develop a method by which the effects of antianginal drugs could be evaluated invasively during physiological exercise to gain further understanding of the clinical impact of angina and nitroglycerin.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Forty patients (mean age, 65.2±7.6 years) with exertional angina and coronary artery disease underwent cardiac catheterization via radial access and performed incremental exercise using a supine cycle ergometer. As they developed limiting angina, sublingual nitroglycerin was administered to half the patients, and all patients continued to exercise for 2 minutes at the same workload. Throughout exercise, distal coronary pressure and flow velocity and central aortic pressure were recorded with sensor wires.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Patients continued to exercise after nitroglycerin administration with less ST-segment depression (<i>P</i>=0.003) and therefore myocardial ischemia. Significant reductions in afterload (aortic pressure, <i>P</i>=0.030) and myocardial oxygen demand were seen (tension-time index, <i>P</i>=0.024; rate-pressure product, <i>P</i>=0.046), as well as an increase in myocardial oxygen supply (Buckberg index, <i>P</i>=0.017). Exercise reduced peripheral arterial wave reflection (<i>P</i><0.05), which was not further augmented by the administration of nitroglycerin (<i>P</i>=0.648). The observed increases in coronary pressure <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>, stenosis resistance, and flow velocity did not reach statistical significance; however, the diastolic velocity–pressure <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong> relation was consistent with a significant increase in relative stenosis severity (k coefficient, <i>P</i><0.0001), in keeping with exercise-induced vasoconstriction of stenosed epicardial segments and dilatation of normal segments, with trends toward reversal with nitroglycerin.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The catheterization laboratory protocol provides a model to study myocardial ischemia and the actions of novel and established antianginal drugs. Administration of nitroglycerin causes changes in the systemic and coronary circulation that combine to reduce myocardial oxygen demand and to increase supply, thereby attenuating exercise-induced ischemia.

Resting MBF (<i>P</i>=0.383) and hyperemic microvascular resistance (<i>P</i>=0.431) were not changed and maintained stable.

Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 Induces Aortic Valve Calcification by Inhibiting Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1 Signaling in Valvular Interstitial Cells
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Calcification of the aortic valve leads to increased leaflet stiffness and consequently to the development of calcific aortic valve disease. However, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms of calcification remain unclear. Here, we identified that dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4, also known as CD26) increases valvular calcification and promotes calcific aortic valve disease progression.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We obtained the aortic valve tissues from humans and murine models (wild-type and endothelial nitric oxide synthase-deficient-mice) and cultured the valvular interstitial cells (VICs) and valvular endothelial cells from the cusps. We induced osteogenic differentiation in the primary cultured VICs and examined the effects of the DPP-4 inhibitor on the osteogenic changes in vitro and aortic valve calcification in endothelial nitric oxide synthase-deficient-mice. We also induced calcific aortic stenosis in male New Zealand rabbits (weight, 2.5–3.0 kg) by a cholesterol-enriched diet+vitamin D2 (25 000 IU, daily). Echocardiography was performed to assess the aortic valve area and the maximal and mean transaortic pressure <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>s at baseline and 3-week intervals thereafter. After 12 weeks, we harvested the heart and evaluated the aortic valve tissue using immunohistochemistry.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We found that nitric oxide depletion in human valvular endothelial cells activates NF-κB in human VICs. Consequently, the NF-κB promotes DPP-4 expression, which then induces the osteogenic differentiation of VICs by limiting autocrine insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling. The inhibition of DPP-4 enzymatic activity blocked the osteogenic changes in VICs in vitro and reduced the aortic valve calcification in vivo in a mouse model. Sitagliptin administration in a rabbit calcific aortic valve disease model led to significant improvements in the rate of change in aortic valve area, transaortic peak velocity, and maximal and mean pressure <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>s over 12 weeks. Immunohistochemistry staining confirmed the therapeutic effect of Sitagliptin in terms of reducing the calcium deposits in the rabbit aortic valve cusps.

Flavodiiron Protein Substitutes for Cyclic Electron Flow without Competing CO<sub>2</sub> Assimilation in Rice
<p>Flavodiiron protein (FLV) mediates photoreduction of O<sub>2</sub> to H<sub>2</sub>O. It is conserved from cyanobacteria to gymnosperms but not in angiosperms. The introduction of a moss (<i>Physcomitrella patens</i>) <i>FLV</i> (<i>PpFLV</i>) gene into Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) made photosystem I (PSI) resistant to fluctuating light. Here, we used the same strategy with three rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) genotypes. PpFLV in the wild-type rice background functioned as an efficient PSI electron sink and increased resistance to PSI photodamage under fluctuating light. The introduction of PpFLV into the <i>PGR5</i>-RNAi mutant [defective in PROTON GRADIENT REGULATION5 (PGR5)-dependent cyclic electron transport around PSI, CET-PSI], the <i>crr6</i> mutant [defective in chloroplast NAD(P)H-dehydrogenase-like complex (NDH)-dependent CET-PSI], and the <i>PGR5</i>-RNAi <i>crr6</i> double mutant (double defective in CET-PSI activity) alleviated PSI photodamage under fluctuating light. Furthermore, PpFLV substituted for the function of PGR5- and NDH-dependent CET-PSI without competing for CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation under constant light, as there was no difference in CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation per Rubisco content and biomass production was recovered to the wild-type level. Thus, the exogenous FLV system could act not only as a safety valve under fluctuating light, but also generate a proton motive force for balancing the ATP/NADPH production ratio during steady-state photosynthesis.</p>

Light Signaling-Dependent Regulation of Photoinhibition and Photoprotection in Tomato<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Photoreceptor-mediated light signaling plays a critical role in plant growth, development, and stress responses but its contribution to the spatial regulation of photoinhibition and photoprotection within the canopy remains unclear. Here, we show that low-red/far-red (<i>L</i>-<i>R</i>/<i>FR</i>) ratio light conditions significantly alleviate PSII and PSI photoinhibition in the shade leaves of tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) plants. This protection is accompanied by a phytochrome A-dependent induction of LONG HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5). HY5 binds to the promoter of <i>ABA INSENSITIVE</i>5 (<i>ABI5</i>), triggering <i>RESPIRATORY BURST OXIDASE HOMOLOG1</i> (<i>RBOH1</i>)-dependent H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production in the apoplast. Decreased levels of <i>HY5</i>, <i>ABI5</i>, and <i>RBOH1</i> transcripts increased cold-induced photoinhibition and abolished <i>L</i>-<i>R</i>/<i>FR</i>-induced alleviation of photoinhibition. <i>L</i>-<i>R</i>/<i>FR</i> illumination induced nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) of chlorophyll <i>a</i> fluorescence and increased the activities of Foyer-Halliwell-Asada cycle enzymes and cyclic electron flux (CEF) around PSI. In contrast, decreased <i>HY5</i>, <i>ABI5</i>, and <i>RBOH1</i> transcript levels abolished the positive effect of <i>L</i>-<i>R</i>/<i>FR</i> on photoprotection. Loss of <i>PROTON GRADIENT REGULATION5</i>-dependent CEF led to increased photoinhibition and attenuated <i>L</i>-<i>R</i>/<i>FR</i>-dependent NPQ. These data demonstrate that HY5 is an important hub in the cross talk between light and cold response pathways, integrating ABA and reactive oxygen species signaling, leading to the attenuation of photoinhibition by enhanced induction of photoprotection in shade leaves.</p>

NDH-PSI Supercomplex Assembly Precedes Full Assembly of the NDH Complex in Chloroplast
<p>The chloroplast NADH dehydrogenase-like (NDH) complex is structurally similar to respiratory complex I and mediates PSI cyclic electron flow. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), chloroplast NDH is composed of at least 29 subunits and associates with two copies of PSI to form the NDH-PSI supercomplex. Here, we found that CHLORORESPIRATORY REDUCTION3 (CRR3) is an assembly factor required for the accumulation of subcomplex B (SubB) of chloroplast NDH. In Suc density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong> centrifugation, CRR3 was detected in three protein complexes. Accumulation of the largest peak III complex was impaired in mutants defective in the SubB subunits PnsB2-PnsB5. The oligomeric form of CRR3 likely functions to assemble the core of SubB to form the peak III complex as an assembly intermediate. A defect in the PnsL3 subunit increased the level of the peak III complex, suggesting that CRR3 was released from the assembly intermediate after PnsL3 binding. Unlike PnsB2-PnsB5 and PnsL3, PnsB1 was not absolutely necessary for stabilizing SubB. PnsB1 is likely incorporated into the intermediate at the final step during SubB assembly. Lhca6 is a linker protein mediating NDH-PSI supercomplex formation, and its site of contact with NDH was suggested to be SubB. In the <i>lhca6</i> mutant, accumulation of the peak III complex was impaired, suggesting that SubB interacted with Lhca6 during the step of SubB assembly. The process of supercomplex formation was triggered before the completion of the NDH assembly. Consistent with its predicted function, CRR3 accumulated in young leaves, where the NDH complex was assembled.</p>

Environmental and Genetic Factors Regulating Localization of the Plant Plasma Membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase
<p>A P-type H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase is the primary transporter that converts ATP to electrochemical energy at the plasma membrane of higher plants. Its product, the proton-motive force, is composed of an electrical potential and a pH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>. Many studies have demonstrated that this proton-motive force not only drives the secondary transporters required for nutrient uptake, but also plays a direct role in regulating cell expansion. Here, we have generated a transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plant expressing H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase isoform 2 (AHA2) that is translationally fused with a fluorescent protein and examined its cellular localization by live-cell microscopy. Using a 3D imaging approach with seedlings grown for various times under a variety of light intensities, we demonstrate that AHA2 localization at the plasma membrane of root cells requires light. In dim light conditions, AHA2 is found in intracellular compartments, in addition to the plasma membrane. This localization profile was age-dependent and specific to cell types found in the transition zone located between the meristem and elongation zones. The accumulation of AHA2 in intracellular compartments is consistent with reduced H<sup>+</sup> secretion near the transition zone and the suppression of root growth. By examining AHA2 localization in a knockout mutant of a receptor protein kinase, FERONIA, we found that the intracellular accumulation of AHA2 in the transition zone is dependent on a functional FERONIA-dependent inhibitory response in root elongation. Overall, this study provides a molecular underpinning for understanding the genetic, environmental, and developmental factors influencing root growth via localization of the plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase.</p>

Type B Response Regulators Act As Central Integrators in Transcriptional Control of the Auxin Biosynthesis Enzyme TAA1
<p>During embryogenesis and organ formation, establishing proper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong> is critical for auxin function, which is achieved through coordinated regulation of both auxin metabolism and transport. Expression of auxin biosynthetic genes is often tissue specific and is regulated by environmental signals. However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we investigated the transcriptional regulation of a key auxin biosynthetic gene, <sc>l</sc>-Tryptophan aminotransferase of Arabidopsis1 (<i>TAA1</i>). A canonical and a novel Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) response regulator (ARR) binding site were identified in the promoter and the second intron of <i>TAA1</i>, which were required for its tissue-specific expression. C-termini of a subset of the type B ARRs selectively bind to one or both cis elements and activate the expression of <i>TAA1</i>. We further demonstrated that the ARRs not only mediate the transcriptional regulation of <i>TAA1</i> by cytokinins, but also mediate its regulation by ethylene, light, and developmental signals. Through direct protein-protein interactions, the transcriptional activity of ARR1 is enhanced by ARR12, DELLAs, and ethylene-insenstive3 (EIN3). Our study thus revealed the ARR proteins act as key node that mediate the regulation of auxin biosynthesis by various hormonal, environmental, and developmental signals through transcriptional regulation of the key auxin biosynthesis gene <i>TAA1</i>.</p>

Root Bending Is Antagonistically Affected by Hypoxia and ERF-Mediated Transcription via Auxin Signaling
<p>When plants encounter soil water logging or flooding, roots are the first organs to be confronted with reduced gas diffusion resulting in limited oxygen supply. Since roots do not generate photosynthetic oxygen, they are rapidly faced with oxygen shortage rendering roots particularly prone to damage. While metabolic adaptations to low oxygen conditions, which ensure basic energy supply, have been well characterized, adaptation of root growth and development have received less attention. In this study, we show that hypoxic conditions cause the primary root to grow sidewise in a low oxygen environment, possibly to escape soil patches with reduced oxygen availability. This growth behavior is reversible in that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravit</span></strong>ropic growth resumes when seedlings are returned to normoxic conditions. Hypoxic root bending is inhibited by the group VII ethylene response factor (ERFVII) RAP2.12, as <i>rap2.12-1</i> seedlings show exaggerated primary root bending. Furthermore, overexpression of the ERFVII member <i>HRE2</i> inhibits root bending, suggesting that primary root growth direction at hypoxic conditions is antagonistically regulated by hypoxia and hypoxia-activated ERFVIIs. Root bending is preceded by the establishment of an auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong> across the root tip as quantified with DII-VENUS and is synergistically enhanced by hypoxia and the auxin transport inhibitor naphthylphthalamic acid. The protein abundance of the auxin efflux carrier PIN2 is reduced at hypoxic conditions, a response that is suppressed by RAP2.12 overexpression, suggesting antagonistic control of auxin flux by hypoxia and ERFVII. Taken together, we show that hypoxia triggers an escape response of the primary root that is controlled by ERFVII activity and mediated by auxin signaling in the root tip.</p>

The Sites of Evaporation within Leaves
<p>The sites of evaporation within leaves are unknown, but they have drawn attention for decades due to their perceived implications for many factors, including patterns of leaf isotopic enrichment, the maintenance of mesophyll water status, stomatal regulation, and the interpretation of measured stomatal and leaf hydraulic conductances. We used a spatially explicit model of coupled water and heat transport outside the xylem, MOFLO 2.0, to map the distribution of net evaporation across leaf tissues in relation to anatomy and environmental parameters. Our results corroborate earlier predictions that most evaporation occurs from the epidermis at low light and moderate humidity but that the mesophyll contributes substantially when the leaf center is warmed by light absorption, and more so under high humidity. We also found that the bundle sheath provides a significant minority of evaporation (15% in darkness and 18% in high light), that the vertical center of amphistomatous leaves supports net condensation, and that vertical temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong>s caused by light absorption vary over 10-fold across species, reaching 0.3°C. We show that several hypotheses that depend on the evaporating sites require revision in light of our findings, including that experimental measurements of stomatal and hydraulic conductances should be affected directly by changes in the location of the evaporating sites. We propose a new conceptual model that accounts for mixed-phase water transport outside the xylem. These conclusions have far-reaching implications for inferences in leaf hydraulics, gas exchange, water use, and isotope physiology.</p>

Experimental analysis of the liquid-feeding mechanism of the butterfly <i>Pieris rapae</i>
<p>The butterfly <i>Pieirs rapae</i> drinks liquid using a long proboscis. A high pressure <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gradient</span></strong> is induced in the proboscis when cibarial pump muscles contract. However, liquid feeding through the long proboscis poses a disadvantage of high flow resistance. Hence, butterflies may possess special features to compensate for this disadvantage and succeed in foraging. The main objective of this study is to analyze the liquid-feeding mechanism of butterflies. The systaltic motion of the cibarial pump organ was visualized using the synchrotron X-ray imaging technique. In addition, an ellipsoidal pump model was established based on synchrotron X-ray micro-computed tomography. To determine the relationship between the cyclic variation of the pump volume and the liquid-feeding flow, velocity fields of the intake flow at the tip of the proboscis were measured using micro-particle image velocimetry. Reynolds and Womersley numbers of liquid-feeding flow in the proboscis were ~1.40 and 0.129, respectively. The liquid-feeding flow could be characterized as a quasi-steady state laminar flow. Considering these results, we analyzed the dimensions of the feeding apparatus on the basis of minimum energy consumption during the liquid-feeding process. The relationship between the proboscis and the cibarial pump was determined when minimum energy consumption occurs. As a result, the volume of the cibarial pump is proportional to the cube of the radius of the proboscis. It seems that the liquid-feeding system of butterflies and other long-proboscid insects follow the cube relationship. The present results provide insights into the feeding strategies of liquid-feeding butterflies.</p>

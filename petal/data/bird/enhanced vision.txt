Extracellular Vesicles Isolated from the Leaf Apoplast Carry Stress-Response Proteins
<p>Exosomes are extracellular vesicles (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>s) that play a central role in intercellular signaling in mammals by transporting proteins and small RNAs. Plants are also known to produce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>s, particularly in response to pathogen infection. The contents of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>s have not been analyzed, how<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>er, and their function is unknown. Here, we describe a method for purifying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>s from the apoplastic fluids of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves. Proteomic analyses of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>s r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>ealed that they are highly enriched in proteins involved in biotic and abiotic stress responses. Consistent with this finding, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong> secretion was enhanced in plants infected with <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> and in response to treatment with salicylic acid. These findings suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>s may represent an important component of plant immune responses.</p>

Astrocyte-shed extracellular vesicles regulate the peripheral leukocyte response to inflammatory brain lesions
<p>Brain injury induces a peripheral acute cytokine response that directs the transmigration of leukocytes into the brain. Because this brain-to-peripheral immune communication affects patient recovery, understanding its regulation is important. Using a mouse model of inflammatory brain injury, we set out to find a soluble mediator for this phenomenon. We found that extracellular vesicles (EVs) shed from astrocytes in response to intracerebral injection of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) rapidly entered into peripheral circulation and promoted the transmigration of leukocytes through modulation of the peripheral acute cytokine response. Bioinformatic analysis of the protein and microRNA cargo of EVs identified peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor α (PPARα) as a primary molecular target of astrocyte-shed EVs. We confirmed in mice that astrocytic EVs promoted the transmigration of leukocytes into the brain by inhibiting PPARα, resulting in the increase of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activity that triggered the production of cytokines in liver. These findings expand our understanding of the mechanisms regulating communication between the brain and peripheral immune system and identify astrocytic EVs as a molecular regulator of the immunological response to inflammatory brain damage.</p>

Selective Elimination of Membrane-Damaged Chloroplasts via Microautophagy
<p>Plant chloroplasts constantly accumulate damage caused by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visibl</span></strong>e wavelengths of light during photosynthesis. Our pr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>ious study r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>ealed that entire photodamaged chloroplasts are subjected to vacuolar digestion through an autophagy process termed chlorophagy; how<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>er, how this process is induced and executed remained poorly understood. In this study, we monitored intracellular induction of chlorophagy in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves and found that mesophyll cells damaged by high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visibl</span></strong>e light displayed abnormal chloroplasts with a swollen shape and 2.5 times the volume of normal chloroplasts. In wild-type plants, the activation of chlorophagy decreased the number of swollen chloroplasts. In the autophagy-deficient <i>autophagy</i> mutants, the swollen chloroplasts persisted, and dysfunctional chloroplasts that had lost chlorophyll fluorescence accumulated in the cytoplasm. Chloroplast swelling and subsequent induction of chlorophagy were suppressed by the application of exogenous mannitol to increase the osmotic pressure outside chloroplasts or by overexpression of VESICLE INDUCING PROTEIN IN PLASTID1, which maintains chloroplast envelope integrity. Microscopic observations of autophagy-related membranes showed that swollen chloroplasts were partly surrounded by autophagosomal structures and were engulfed directly by the tonoplast, as in microautophagy. Our results indicate that an el<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>ation in osmotic potential inside the chloroplast due to high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visibl</span></strong>e light-derived envelope damage results in chloroplast swelling and serves as an induction factor for chlorophagy, and this process mobilizes entire chloroplasts via tonoplast-mediated sequestering to avoid the cytosolic accumulation of dysfunctional chloroplasts.</p>

Protein Storage Vacuoles Originate from Remodeled Preexisting Vacuoles in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>Protein storage vacuoles (PSV) are the main repository of protein in dicotyledonous seeds, but little is known about the origins of these transient organelles. PSV are hypothesized to either arise de novo or originate from the preexisting embryonic vacuole (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>) during seed maturation. Here, we tested these hypotheses by studying PSV formation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) embryos at different stages of seed maturation and recapitulated this process in Arabidopsis leaves reprogrammed to an embryogenic fate by inducing expression of the <i>LEAFY COTYLEDON2</i> transcription factor. Confocal and immunoelectron microscopy indicated that both storage proteins and tonoplast proteins typical of PSV were delivered to the preexisting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong> in embryos or to the lytic vacuole in reprogrammed leaf cells. In addition, sectioning through embryos at s<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>eral d<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>elopmental stages using serial block face scanning electron microscopy r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>ealed the 3D architecture of forming PSV.

Using neuroscience to develop artificial intelligence
<p>When the mathematician Alan Turing posed the question “Can machines think?” in the first line of his seminal 1950 paper that ushered in the quest for artificial intelligence (AI) (<i>1</i>), the only known systems carrying out complex computations were biological nervous systems. It is not surprising, therefore, that scientists in the nascent field of AI turned to brain circuits as a source for guidance. One path that was taken since the early attempts to perform intelligent computation by brain-like circuits (<i>2</i>), and which led recently to remarkable successes, can be described as a highly reductionist approach to model cortical circuitry. In its basic current form, known as a “deep network” (or deep net) architecture, this brain-inspired model is built from successive layers of neuron-like elements, connected by adjustable weights, called “synapses” after their biological counterparts (<i>3</i>). The application of deep nets and related methods to AI systems has been transformative. They proved superior to pr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>iously known methods in central areas of AI research, including computer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vision</span></strong>, speech recognition and production, and playing complex games. Practical applications are already in broad use, in areas such as computer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vision</span></strong> and speech and text translation, and large-scale efforts are under way in many other areas. Here, I discuss how additional aspects of brain circuitry could supply cues for guiding network models toward broader aspects of cognition and general AI.</p>

Thyroid hormone signaling specifies cone subtypes in human retinal organoids
<p>The mechanisms underlying specification of neuronal subtypes within the human nervous system are largely unknown. The blue (S), green (M), and red (L) cones of the retina enable high-acuity daytime and color <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vision</span></strong>. To determine the mechanism that controls S versus L/M fates, we studied the differentiation of human retinal organoids. Organoids and retinas have similar distributions, expression profiles, and morphologies of cone subtypes. S cones are specified first, followed by L/M cones, and thyroid hormone signaling controls this temporal switch. Dynamic expression of thyroid hormone–degrading and –activating proteins within the retina ensures low signaling early to specify S cones and high signaling late to produce L/M cones. This work establishes organoids as a model for determining mechanisms of human d<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>elopment with promising utility for therapeutics and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vision</span></strong> repair.</p>

Near-infrared deep brain stimulation via upconversion nanoparticle–mediated optogenetics
<p>Optogenetics has r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>olutionized the experimental interrogation of neural circuits and holds promise for the treatment of neurological disorders. It is limited, how<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>er, because <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visibl</span></strong>e light cannot penetrate deep inside brain tissue.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
The B-Box-Containing MicroProtein miP1a/BBX31 Regulates Photomorphogenesis and UV-B Protection
<p>The bZIP transcription factor ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) represents a major hub in the light-signaling cascade both under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visibl</span></strong>e and UV-B light. The mode of transcriptional regulation of <i>HY5</i>, especially under UV-B light, is not well characterized. B-BOX (BBX) transcription factors regulate <i>HY5</i> transcription and also posttranscriptionally modulate HY5 to control photomorphogenesis under white light. Here, we identify BBX31 as a key signaling intermediate in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visibl</span></strong>e and UV-B light signal transduction in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). <i>BBX31</i> expression is induced by UV-B radiation in a fluence-dependent manner. HY5 directly binds to the promoter of <i>BBX31</i> and regulates its transcript l<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>els. Loss- and gain-of-function mutants of <i>BBX31</i> indicate that it acts as a negative regulator of photomorphogenesis under white light but is a positive regulator of UV-B signaling. Genetic interaction studies suggest that <i>BBX31</i> regulates photomorphogenesis independent of <i>HY5</i>. We found no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>idence for a direct BBX31-HY5 interaction, and they primarily regulate different sets of genes in white light. Under high doses of UV-B radiation, BBX31 promotes the accumulation of UV-protective flavonoids and phenolic compounds. It enhances tolerance to UV-B radiation by regulating genes involved in photoprotection and DNA repair in a HY5-dependent manner. Under UV-B radiation, overexpression of <i>BBX31</i> enhances <i>HY5</i> transcriptional l<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>els in a UV RESISTANCE LOCUS8-dependent manner, suggesting that BBX31 might regulate <i>HY5</i> transcription.</p>

Octopaminergic modulation of the visual flight speed regulator of <i>Drosophila</i>
<p>Recent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>idence suggests that flies' sensitivity to large-field optic flow is increased by the release of octopamine during flight. This increase in gain presumably enhances visually mediated behaviors such as the active regulation of forward speed, a process that involves the comparison of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vision</span></strong>-based estimate of velocity with an internal set point. To determine where in the neural circuit this comparison is made, we selectively silenced the octopamine neurons in the fruit fly <i>Drosophila</i>, and examined the effect on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vision</span></strong>-based velocity regulation in free-flying flies. We found that flies with inactivated octopamine neurons accelerated more slowly in response to visual motion than control flies, but maintained nearly the same baseline flight speed. Our results are parsimonious with a circuit architecture in which the internal control signal is injected into the visual motion pathway upstream of the interneuron network that estimates groundspeed.</p>

High complexity of aquatic irradiance may have driven the evolution of four-dimensional colour vision in shallow-water fish
<p>Humans use three cone photoreceptor classes for colour <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vision</span></strong>, yet many birds, reptiles and shallow-water fish are tetrachromatic and use four cone classes. Screening pigments, which narrow the spectrum of photoreceptors in birds and diurnal reptiles, render visual systems with four cone classes more efficient. To date, how<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>er, the question of tetrachromacy in shallow-water fish that, like humans, lack screening pigments, is still unsolved. We raise the possibility that tetrachromacy in fish has <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>olved in response to higher spectral complexity of underwater light. We compared the dimensionality of colour <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vision</span></strong> in humans and fish by examining the spectral complexity of the colour signal reflected from objects into their eyes. We show that fish require four to six cone classes to reconstruct the colour signal of aquatic objects at the accuracy l<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>el achi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>ed by humans viewing terrestrial objects. This is because environmental light, which alters the colour signals, is more complex and contains more spectral fluctuations underwater than on land. We further show that fish cones are better suited than human cones to detect these spectral fluctuations, suggesting that the capability of fish cones to detect high-frequency fluctuations in the colour signal confers an advantage. Taken together, we propose that tetrachromacy in fish has <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>olved to enhance the reconstruction of complex colour signals in shallow aquatic environments. Of course, shallow-water fish might possess fewer than four cone classes; how<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>er, this would come with the in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>itable loss in accuracy of signal reconstruction.</p>

A generative vision model that trains with high data efficiency and breaks text-based CAPTCHAs

The model demonstrates excellent generalization and occlusion-reasoning capabilities and outperforms deep neural networks on a challenging scene text recognition benchmark while being 300-fold more data efficient. In addition, the model fundamentally breaks the defense of modern text-based CAPTCHAs (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) by generatively segmenting characters without CAPTCHA-specific heuristics. Our model emphasizes aspects such as data efficiency and compositionality that may be important in the path toward general artificial intelligence.</p>

Topological and modality-specific representation of somatosensory information in the fly brain
<p>Insects and mammals share similarities of neural organization underlying the perception of odors, taste, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vision</span></strong>, sound, and gravity. We observed that insect somatosensation also corresponds to that of mammals. In <i>Drosophila</i>, the projections of all the somatosensory neuron types to the insect’s equivalent of the spinal cord segregated into modality-specific layers comparable to those in mammals. Some sensory neurons innervate the ventral brain directly to form modality-specific and topological somatosensory maps. Ascending interneurons with dendrites in matching layers of the nerve cord send axons that converge to respective brain regions. Pathways arising from leg somatosensory neurons encode distinct qualities of leg movement information and play different roles in ground detection. Establishment of the ground pattern and genetic tools for neuronal manipulation should provide the basis for elucidating the mechanisms underlying somatosensation.</p>

In this process, carbon-nitrogen bond formation proceeds through a key aminium radical cation intermediate that is generated via electron transfer between an excited-state iridium photocatalyst and an amine substrate. These reactions are redox-neutral and completely atom-economical, exhibit broad functional group tolerance, and occur readily at room temperature under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visibl</span></strong>e light irradiation.

Data returned by the Visible and InfraRed Mapping Spectrometer on board the Dawn spacecraft show a clear detection of an organic absorption feature at 3.4 micrometers on dwarf planet Ceres. This signature is characteristic of aliphatic organic matter and is mainly localized on a broad region of ~1000 square kilometers close to the ~50-kilometer Ernutet crater. The combined presence on Ceres of ammonia-bearing hydrated minerals, water ice, carbonates, salts, and organic material indicates a very complex chemical environment, suggesting favorable environments to prebiotic chemistry.</p>

S<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>eral efforts have aimed to create transfer-DNA (T-DNA) insertional mutant populations in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>, a monocot plant used as a model system to study temperate cereals, but there has been a lack of research aimed at using transposon strategies. Here, we describe the application of a maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) <i>Dissociation</i> (<i>Ds</i>) transposon tagging system in <i>B</i>. <i>distachyon</i>. The <i>35S</i>::<i>AcTPase</i> cassette and <i>Ds</i> element were constructed within the same T-DNA and transformed into <i>B</i>. <i>distachyon</i> plants. The <i>Ds</i> element was readily transposed to other chromosomes or to the same chromosome under the function of <i>Activator</i> (<i>Ac</i>) transposase. Through homologous chromosome synapsis, recombination, and segregation, the <i>Ds</i> element separated from the <i>Ac</i> element. We selected stable <i>Ds</i>-only plants using G418 and GFP assays and analyzed 241 T<sub>0</sub> lines, some of which were highly efficient at producing <i>Ds</i>-only progeny. Through thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR, we isolated 710 independent <i>Ds</i> flanking sequences from <i>Ds</i>-only plants.

Direct Comparison of Leaf Plasmodesma Structure and Function in Relation to Phloem-Loading Type
<p>The export of photosynthetically produced sugars from leaves depends on plasmodesmatal transport of sugar molecules from mesophyll to phloem. Traditionally, the density of plasmodesmata (PD) along this phloem-loading pathway has been used as a defining feature of different phloem-loading types, with species proposed to have either many or few PD between the phloem and surrounding cells of the leaf. How<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>er, quantitative determination of PD density has rarely been performed. Moreover, the structure of PD has not been considered, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>en though it could impact permeability, and functional data are only available for very few species. Here, a comparison of PD density, structure, and function using data from transmission electron microscopy and live-cell microscopy was conducted for all rel<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>ant cell–cell interfaces in leaves of nine species. These species represent the three principal phloem-loading types currently discussed in literature. Results show that relative PD density among the different cell-cell interfaces in one species, but not absolute PD density, is indicative of phloem-loading type. PD density data of single interfaces, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>en combined with PD diameter and length data, did not correlate with the intercellular diffusion capacity measured by the fluorescence loss in photobleaching method. This means that PD substructure not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visibl</span></strong>e on standard transmission electron micrographs may have a strong influence on permeability. Furthermore, the results support a proposed passive symplasmic loading mechanism in the tree species horse chestnut (<i>Aesculus hippocastanum</i>), white birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>), orchard apple (<i>Malus domestica</i>), and gray poplar (<i>Populus x canescens</i>) as functional cell coupling and PD structure differed from active symplasmic and apoplasmic phloem-loading species.</p>

Plant Phenotyping: An Active Vision Cell for Three-Dimensional Plant Shoot Reconstruction
<p>Three-dimensional (3D) computer-generated models of plants are urgently needed to support both phenotyping and simulation-based studies such as photosynthesis modeling. How<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>er, the construction of accurate 3D plant models is challenging, as plants are complex objects with an intricate leaf structure, often consisting of thin and highly reflective surfaces that vary in shape and size, forming dense, complex, crowded scenes. We address these issues within an image-based method by taking an active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vision</span></strong> approach, one that investigates the scene to intelligently capture images, to image acquisition. Rather than use the same camera positions for all plants, our technique is to acquire the images needed to reconstruct the target plant, tuning camera placement to match the plant’s individual structure. Our method also combines volumetric- and surface-based reconstruction methods and determines the necessary images based on the analysis of voxel clusters. We describe a fully automatic plant modeling/phenotyping cell (or module) comprising a six-axis robot and a high-precision turntable. By using a standard color camera, we overcome the difficulties associated with laser-based plant reconstruction methods. The 3D models produced are compared with those obtained from fixed cameras and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>aluated by comparison with data obtained by x-ray microcomputed tomography across different plant structures. Our results show that our method is successful in improving the accuracy and quality of data obtained from a variety of plant types.</p>

Molecular Mechanisms Preventing Senescence in Response to Prolonged Darkness in a Desiccation-Tolerant Plant
<p>The desiccation-tolerant plant <i>Haberlea rhodopensis</i> can withstand months of darkness without any <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visibl</span></strong>e senescence. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of this adaptation to prolonged (30 d) darkness and subsequent return to light. <i>H. rhodopensis</i> plants remained green and viable throughout the dark treatment. Transcriptomic analysis r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>ealed that darkness regulated s<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>eral transcription factor (TF) genes. Stress- and autophagy-related TFs such as <i>ERF8</i>, <i>HSFA2b</i>, <i>RD26</i>, <i>TGA1</i>, and <i>WRKY33</i> were up-regulated, while chloroplast- and flowering-related TFs such as <i>ATH1</i>, <i>COL2</i>, <i>COL4</i>, <i>RL1</i>, and <i>PTAC7</i> were repressed. <i>PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR4</i>, a negative regulator of photomorphogenesis and promoter of senescence, also was down-regulated. In response to darkness, most of the photosynthesis- and photorespiratory-related genes were strongly down-regulated, while genes related to autophagy were up-regulated. This occurred concomitant with the induction of SUCROSE NON-FERMENTING1-RELATED PROTEIN KINASES (SnRK1) signaling pathway genes, which regulate responses to stress-induced starvation and autophagy. Most of the genes associated with chlorophyll catabolism, which are induced by darkness in dark-senescing species, were either unregulated (<i>PHEOPHORBIDE A OXYGENASE, PAO; RED CHLOROPHYLL CATABOLITE REDUCTASE, RCCR</i>) or repressed (<i>STAY GREEN-LIKE</i>, <i>PHEOPHYTINASE</i>, and <i>NON-YELLOW COLORING1</i>). Metabolite profiling r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>ealed increases in the l<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>els of many amino acids in darkness, suggesting increased protein degradation. In darkness, l<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>els of the chloroplastic lipids digalactosyldiacylglycerol, monogalactosyldiacylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, and sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol decreased, while those of storage triacylglycerols increased, suggesting degradation of chloroplast membrane lipids and their conversion to triacylglycerols for use as energy and carbon sources. Collectively, these data show a coordinated response to darkness, including repression of photosynthetic, photorespiratory, flowering, and chlorophyll catabolic genes, induction of autophagy and SnRK1 pathways, and metabolic reconfigurations that enable survival under prolonged darkness.</p>

An Improved <i>Brome mosaic virus</i> Silencing Vector: Greater Insert Stability and More Extensive VIGS
<p>Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) is used extensively for gene function studies in plants. VIGS is inexpensive and rapid compared with silencing conducted through stable transformation, but many virus-silencing vectors, especially in grasses, induce only transient silencing phenotypes. A major reason for transient phenotypes is the instability of the foreign gene fragment (insert) in the vector during VIGS. Here, we report the d<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>elopment of a <i>Brome mosaic virus</i> (BMV)-based vector that better maintains inserts through modification of the original BMV vector RNA sequence. Modification of the BMV RNA3 sequence yielded a vector, BMVCP5, that better maintained <i>phytoene desaturase</i> and <i>heat shock protein70-1</i> (<i>HSP70-1</i>) inserts in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). Longer maintenance of inserts was correlated with greater target gene silencing and more extensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visibl</span></strong>e silencing phenotypes displaying greater tissue penetration and involving more leaves. The modified vector accumulated similarly to the original vector in <i>N. benthamiana</i> after agroinfiltration, thus maintaining a high titer of virus in this intermediate host used to produce virus inoculum for grass hosts. For <i>HSP70</i>, silencing one family member led to a large increase in the expression of another family member, an increase likely related to the target gene knockdown and not a general effect of virus infection. The cause of the increased insert stability in the modified vector is discussed in relationship to its recombination and accumulation potential. The modified vector will improve functional genomic studies in grasses, and the conceptual methods used to improve the vector may be applied to other VIGS vectors.</p>

Dead or Alive? Using Membrane Failure and Chlorophyll <i>a</i> Fluorescence to Predict Plant Mortality from Drought
<p>Climate models predict widespread increases in both drought intensity and duration in the next decades. Although water deficiency is a significant determinant of plant survival, limited understanding of plant responses to extreme drought impedes forecasts of both forest and crop productivity under increasing aridity. Drought induces a suite of physiological responses; how<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>er, we lack an accurate mechanistic description of plant response to lethal drought that would improve predictive understanding of mortality under altered climate conditions. Here, proxies for leaf cellular damage, chlorophyll <i>a</i> fluorescence, and electrolyte leakage were directly associated with failure to recover from drought upon rewatering in <i>Brassica</i> <i>rapa</i> (genotype R500) and thus define the exact timing of drought-induced death. We validated our results using a second genotype (imb211) that differs substantially in life history traits. Our study demonstrates that whereas changes in carbon dynamics and water transport are critical indicators of drought stress, they can be unrelated to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visibl</span></strong>e metrics of mortality, i.e. lack of meristematic activity and regrowth. In contrast, membrane failure at the cellular scale is the most proximate cause of death. This hypothesis was corroborated in two gymnosperms (<i>Picea engelmannii</i> and <i>Pinus contorta</i>) that experienced lethal water stress in the field and in laboratory conditions. We suggest that measurement of chlorophyll <i>a</i> fluorescence can be used to operationally define plant death arising from drought, and improved plant characterization can enhance surface model predictions of drought mortality and its consequences to ecosystem services at a global scale.</p>

The PEX1 ATPase Stabilizes PEX6 and Plays Essential Roles in Peroxisome Biology
<p>A variety of metabolic pathways are sequestered in peroxisomes, conserved organelles that are essential for human and plant survival. Peroxin (PEX) proteins generate and maintain peroxisomes. The PEX1 ATPase facilitates recycling of the peroxisome matrix protein receptor PEX5 and is the most commonly affected peroxin in human peroxisome biogenesis disorders. Here, we describe the isolation and characterization of, to our knowledge, the first Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>pex1</i> missense alleles: <i>pex1-2</i> and <i>pex1-3</i>. <i>pex1-2</i> displayed peroxisome-related defects accompanied by reduced PEX1 and PEX6 l<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>els. These <i>pex1-2</i> defects were exacerbated by growth at high temperature and ameliorated by growth at low temperature or by <i>PEX6</i> overexpression, suggesting that PEX1 enhances PEX6 stability and vice versa. <i>pex1-3</i> conferred embryo lethality when homozygous, confirming that PEX1, like s<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>eral other Arabidopsis peroxins, is essential for embryogenesis. <i>pex1-3</i> displayed symptoms of peroxisome dysfunction when heterozygous; this semidominance is consistent with PEX1 forming a heterooligomer with PEX6 that is poisoned by pex1-3 subunits. Blocking autophagy partially rescued <i>PEX1</i>/<i>pex1-3</i> defects, including the restoration of normal peroxisome size, suggesting that increasing peroxisome abundance can compensate for the deficiencies caused by <i>pex1-3</i> and that the enlarged peroxisomes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visibl</span></strong>e in <i>PEX1</i>/<i>pex1-3</i> may represent autophagy intermediates. Overexpressing <i>PEX1</i> in wild-type plants impaired growth, suggesting that excessive PEX1 can be detrimental. Our genetic, molecular, and physiological data support the heterohexamer model of PEX1-PEX6 function in plants.</p>

The Auxin Biosynthetic <i>TRYPTOPHAN AMINOTRANSFERASE RELATED TaTAR2.1-3A</i> Increases Grain Yield of Wheat
<p>Controlling the major auxin biosynthetic pathway to manipulate auxin content could be a target for genetic engineering of crops with desired traits, but little progress had been made because low or high auxin contents often cause d<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>elopmental inhibition. Here, we performed a genome-wide analysis of bread wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) to identify the Tryptophan Aminotransferase of Arabidopsis1/Tryptophan Aminotransferase-Related (TAA1/TAR) genes that function in the tryptophan-dependent pathway of auxin biosynthesis. Sequence mining together with gene cloning identified 15 <i>TaTAR</i> genes, among which 12 and three genes were phylogenetically close to Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) AtTAR2 and AtTAR3, respectively. <i>TaTAR2.1</i> had the most abundant transcripts in the <i>TaTAR2</i> genes and was expressed mainly in roots and up-regulated by low nitrogen (N) availability. Knockdown of <i>TaTAR2.1</i> caused vegetative and reproductive deficiencies and impaired lateral root (LR) growth under both high- and low-N conditions. Overexpressing <i>TaTAR2.1-3A</i> in wheat enhanced LR branching, plant height, spike number, grain yield, and aerial N accumulation under different N supply l<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>els. In addition, overexpressing <i>TaTAR2.1-3A</i> in Arabidopsis el<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>ated auxin accumulation in the primary root tip, LR tip, LR primordia, and cotyledon and hypocotyl and increased primary root length, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visibl</span></strong>e LR number, and shoot fresh weight under high- and low-N conditions. Our results indicate that <i>TaTAR2.1</i> is critical for wheat growth and also shows potential for genetic engineering to reach the aim of improving the grain yield of wheat.</p>

An Animal-Like Cryptochrome Controls the <i>Chlamydomonas</i> Sexual Cycle
<p>Cryptochromes are known as flavin-binding blue light receptors in bacteria, fungi, plants, and insects. The animal-like cryptochrome (aCRY) of the green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> has extended our view on cryptochromes, because it responds also to other wavelengths of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visibl</span></strong>e spectrum, including red light. Here, we have investigated if aCRY is involved in the regulation of the sexual life cycle of <i>C. reinhardtii</i>, which is controlled by blue and red light at the steps of gametogenesis along with its restoration and germination. We show that aCRY is differentially expressed not only during the life cycle but also within the cell as part of the soluble and/or membrane-associated protein fraction. Moreover, localization of aCRY within the algal cell body varies between vegetative cells and the different cell types of gametogenesis. aCRY is significantly (early day) or to a small extent (late night) enriched in the nucleus in vegetative cells. In pregametes, gametes and dark-inactivated gametes, aCRY is localized over the cell body. aCRY plays an important role in the sexual life cycle of <i>C. reinhardtii</i>: It controls the germination of the alga, under which the zygote undergoes meiosis, in a positive manner, similar to the regulation by the blue light receptors phototropin and plant cryptochrome (pCRY). How<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>er, aCRY acts in combination with pCRY as a negative regulator for mating ability as well as for mating maintenance, opposite to the function of phototropin in these processes.</p>

Trimethylguanosine Synthase1 (TGS1) Is Essential for Chilling Tolerance
<p>Chilling stress is a major factor limiting plant d<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>elopment and crop productivity. Because the plant response to chilling is so complex, we are far from understanding the genes important in the response to chilling. To identify new genes important in chilling tolerance, we conducted a novel mutant screen, combining a confirmed SALK T-DNA insertion collection with traditional forward genetics. We screened a pool of more than 3700 confirmed homozygous SALK T-DNA insertion lines for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visibl</span></strong>e defects under prolonged growth at 5°C. Of the chilling-sensitive mutants we observed, mutations at one locus were characterized in detail. This gene, At1g45231, encodes an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) trimethylguanosine synthase (TGS1), pr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>iously uncharacterized in the plant kingdom. We confirmed that Arabidopsis TGS1 is a functional ortholog of other trimethylguanosine synthases based both on its in vitro methyltransferase activity and on its ability to rescue the cold-growth inhibition of a <i>Saccharomyces cer<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>isiae tgs1Δ</i> mutant in vivo. While <i>tgs1</i> mutant plants grew normally at 22°C, their vegetative and reproductive growth was s<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>erely compromised under chilling conditions. When we transgenically expressed <i>TGS1</i> in the mutant plants, the chilling-sensitive phenotype was reli<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>ed, demonstrating that TGS1 is required for chilling tolerance.</p>

UV-B Inhibits Leaf Growth through Changes in Growth Regulating Factors and Gibberellin Levels
<p>Ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation affects leaf growth in a wide range of species. In this work, we demonstrate that UV-B l<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>els present in solar radiation inhibit maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) leaf growth without causing any other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">visibl</span></strong>e stress symptoms, including the accumulation of DNA damage. We conducted kinematic analyses of cell di<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vision</span></strong> and expansion to understand the impact of UV-B radiation on these cellular processes. Our results demonstrate that the decrease in leaf growth in UV-B-irradiated leaves is a consequence of a reduction in cell production and a shortened growth zone (GZ). To determine the molecular pathways involved in UV-B inhibition of leaf growth, we performed RNA sequencing on isolated GZ tissues of control and UV-B-exposed plants. Our results show a link between the observed leaf growth inhibition and the expression of specific cell cycle and d<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>elopmental genes, including growth-regulating factors (GRFs) and transcripts for proteins participating in different hormone pathways. Interestingly, the decrease in the GZ size correlates with a decrease in the concentration of GA19, the immediate precursor of the active gibberellin, GA1, by UV-B in this zone, which is regulated, at least in part, by the expression of GRF1 and possibly other transcription factors of the GRF family.</p>

The Genomes of Two Bat Species with Long Constant Frequency Echolocation Calls
<p>Bats can perceive the world by using a wide range of sensory systems, and some of the systems have become highly specialized, such as auditory sensory perception. Among bat species, the Old World leaf-nosed bats and horseshoe bats (rhinolophoid bats) possess the most sophisticated echolocation systems. Here, we reported the whole-genome sequencing and <i>de novo</i> assembles of two rhinolophoid bats—the great leaf-nosed bat (<i>Hipposideros armiger</i>) and the Chinese rufous horseshoe bat (<i>Rhinolophus sinicus</i>). Comparative genomic analyses r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>ealed the adaptation of auditory sensory perception in the rhinolophoid bat lineages, probably resulting from the extreme selectivity used in the auditory processing by these bats. Pseudogenization of some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vision</span></strong>-related genes in rhinolophoid bats was observed, suggesting that these genes have undergone relaxed natural selection. An extensive contraction of olfactory receptor gene repertoires was observed in the lineage leading to the common ancestor of bats. Further extensive gene contractions can be observed in the branch leading to the rhinolophoid bats. Such concordance suggested that molecular changes at one sensory gene might have direct consequences for genes controlling for other sensory modalities. To characterize the population genetic structure and patterns of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>olution, we re-sequenced the genome of 20 great leaf-nosed bats from four different geographical locations of China. The result showed similar sequence diversity values and little differentiation among populations. Moreover, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>idence of genetic adaptations to high altitudes in the great leaf-nosed bats was observed. Taken together, our work provided a useful resource for future research on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>olution of bats.</p>

Can bees see at a glance?
<p>Primates can analyse visual scenes extremely rapidly, making accurate decisions for presentation times of only 20 ms. We asked whether bumblebees, despite having potentially more limited processing power, could similarly detect and discriminate visual patterns presented for durations of 100 ms or less. Bumblebees detected stimuli and discriminated between differently oriented and coloured stimuli when presented as briefly as 25 ms but failed to identify ecologically rel<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>ant shapes (predatory spiders on flowers) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ev</span></strong>en when presented for 100 ms. This suggests an important difference between primate and insect visual processing, so that while primates can capture entire visual scenes ‘at a glance’, insects might have to rely on continuous online sampling of the world around them, using a process of active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vision</span></strong>, which requires longer integration times.</p>

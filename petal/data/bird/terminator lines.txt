p53 dynamics in response to DNA damage vary across cell lines and are shaped by efficiency of DNA repair and activity of the kinase ATM
<p>Cellular systems show a wide range of signaling dynamics. Many of these dynamics are highly stereotyped, such as oscillations at a fixed frequency. However, most studies looking at the role of signaling dynamics focus on one or a few cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s, leaving the diversity of dynamics across tissues or cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s a largely unexplored question. We focused on the dynamics of the tumor suppressor protein p53, which regulates cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to DNA damage. We established live-cell reporters for 12 cancer cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s expressing wild-type p53 and quantified p53 dynamics in response to double-strand break–inducing DNA damage. In many of the tested cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s, we found that p53 abundance oscillated in response to ionizing radiation or the DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic neocarzinostatin and that the periodicity of the oscillations was fixed. In other cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s, p53 abundance dynamically changed in different ways, such as a single broad pulse or a continuous induction. By combining single-cell assays of p53 signaling dynamics, small-molecule screening in live cells, and mathematical modeling, we identified molecules that perturbed p53 dynamics and determined that cell-specific variation in the efficiency of DNA repair and the activity of the kinase ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) controlled the signaling landscape of p53 dynamics. Because the dynamics of wild-type p53 varied substantially between cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s, our study highlights the limitation of using one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong> as a model system and emphasizes the importance of studying the dynamics of other signaling pathways across different cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s and genetic backgrounds.</p>

An on/off Berry phase switch in circular graphene resonators
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> of a quantum state may not return to its original value after the system’s parameters cycle around a closed path; instead, the wave function may acquire a measurable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> difference called the Berry <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>. Berry <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>s typically have been accessed through interference experiments. Here, we demonstrate an unusual Berry <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>–induced spectroscopic feature: a sudden and large increase in the energy of angular-momentum states in circular graphene p-n junction resonators when a relatively small critical magnetic field is reached. This behavior results from turning on a π Berry <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> associated with the topological properties of Dirac fermions in graphene. The Berry <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> can be switched on and off with small magnetic field changes on the order of 10 millitesla, potentially enabling a variety of optoelectronic graphene device applications.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Establishment of Photosynthesis through Chloroplast Development Is Controlled by Two Distinct Regulatory Phases
<p>Chloroplasts develop from undifferentiated proplastids present in meristematic tissue. Thus, chloroplast biogenesis is closely connected to leaf development, which restricts our ability to study the process of chloroplast biogenesis per se. As a consequence, we know relatively little about the regulatory mechanisms behind the establishment of the photosynthetic reactions and how the activities of the two genomes involved are coordinated during chloroplast development. We developed a single cell-based experimental system from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) with high temporal resolution allowing for investigations of the transition from proplastids to functional chloroplasts. Using this unique cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>, we could show that the establishment of photosynthesis is dependent on a regulatory mechanism involving two distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>s. The first <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> is triggered by rapid light-induced changes in gene expression and the metabolome. The second <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> is dependent on the activation of the chloroplast and generates massive changes in the nuclear gene expression required for the transition to photosynthetically functional chloroplasts. The second <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> also is associated with a spatial transition of the chloroplasts from clusters around the nucleus to the final position at the cell cortex. Thus, the establishment of photosynthesis is a two-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> process with a clear checkpoint associated with the second regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> allowing coordination of the activities of the nuclear and plastid genomes.</p>

Histopathology reveals correlative and unique phenotypes in a high-throughput mouse phenotyping screen
<p>The Mouse Genetics Project (MGP) at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute aims to generate and phenotype over 800 genetically modified mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s over the next 5 years to gain a better understanding of mammalian gene function and provide an invaluable resource to the scientific community for follow-up studies. Phenotyping includes the generation of a standardized biobank of paraffin-embedded tissues for each mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>, but histopathology is not routinely performed. In collaboration with the Pathology Core of the Centre for Modeling Human Disease (CMHD) we report the utility of histopathology in a high-throughput primary phenotyping screen. Histopathology was assessed in an unbiased selection of 50 mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s with (<i>n</i>=30) or without (<i>n</i>=20) clinical phenotypes detected by the standard MGP primary phenotyping screen. Our findings revealed that histopathology added correlating morphological data in 19 of 30 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s (63.3%) in which the primary screen detected a phenotype. In addition, seven of the 50 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s (14%) presented significant histopathology findings that were not associated with or predicted by the standard primary screen. Three of these seven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s had no clinical phenotype detected by the standard primary screen. Incidental and strain-associated background lesions were present in all mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s with good concordance to wild-type controls. These findings demonstrate the complementary and unique contribution of histopathology to high-throughput primary phenotyping of mutant mice.</p>

Chemical responses to modified lignin composition in tension wood of hybrid poplar (<i>Populus tremula × Populus alba</i>)
<p>The effect of altering the expression level of the <i>F5H</i> gene was investigated in three wood tissues (normal, opposite and tension wood) in 1-year-old hybrid poplar clone 717 (<i>Populus tremula × Populus alba</i> L.), containing the <i>F5H</i> gene under the control of the <i>C4H</i> promoter. Elevated expression of the <i>F5H</i> gene in poplar has been previously reported to increase the percent syringyl content of lignin. The wild-type and three transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s were inc<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>d 45° for 3 months to induce tension wood formation. Tension and opposite wood from inc<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>d trees, along with normal wood from control trees, were analyzed separately for carbohydrates, lignin, cellulose crystallinity and microfibril angle (MFA). In the wild-type poplar, the lignin in tension wood contained a significantly higher percentage of syringyl than normal wood or opposite wood. However, there was no significant difference in the percent syringyl content of the three wood types within each of the transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s. Increasing the <i>F5H</i> gene expression caused an increase in the percent syringyl content and a slight decrease in the total lignin in normal wood. In tension wood, the addition of a gelatinous layer in the fiber walls resulted in a consistently lower percentage of total lignin in the tissue. Acid-soluble lignin was observed to increase by up to 2.3-fold in the transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s. Compared with normal wood and opposite wood, cell wall crystallinity in tension wood was higher and the MFA was smaller, as expected, with no evidence of an effect from modifying the syringyl monomer ratio. Tension wood in all the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s contained consistently higher total sugar and glucose percentages when compared with normal wood within the respective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s. However, both sugar and glucose percentages were lower in the tension wood of transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s when compared with the tension wood of wild-type trees. Evaluating the response of trees with altered syringyl content to gravity will improve our understanding of the changes in cell wall chemistry and ultrastructural properties of normal, opposite and tension wood in plants.</p>

Terahertz field–induced ferroelectricity in quantum paraelectric SrTiO<sub>3</sub>
<p>“Hidden <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>s” are metastable collective states of matter that are typically not accessible on equilibrium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> diagrams. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>s can host exotic properties in otherwise conventional materials and hence may enable novel functionality and applications, but their discovery and access are still in early stages. Using intense terahertz electric field excitation, we found that an ultrafast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> transition into a hidden ferroelectric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> can be dynamically induced in quantum paraelectric strontium titanate (SrTiO<sub>3</sub>). The induced lowering in crystal symmetry yields substantial changes in the phonon excitation spectra. Our results demonstrate collective coherent control over material structure, in which a single-cycle field drives ions along the microscopic pathway leading directly to their locations in a new crystal<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> on an ultrafast time scale.</p>

The Amino Acid Permease 5 (OsAAP5) Regulates Tiller Number and Grain Yield in Rice
<p>As fundamental nutrients, amino acids are important for rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) growth and development. Here, we identified the amino acid permease 5 (OsAAP5), that regulates tiller number and grain yield in rice. The <i>OsAAP5</i> promoter sequence differed between <i>indica</i> and <i>japonica</i> rice varieties. Lower expression of <i>OsAAP5</i> in the young leaf blade in <i>indica</i> varieties than in <i>japonica</i> varieties was associated with more tillers in <i>indica</i> than in <i>japonica</i>. Down-regulation of <i>OsAAP5</i> expression in <i>japonica</i> using RNA interference (RNAi) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats led to increases in tiller number and grain yield, whereas <i>OsAAP5</i> overexpression (OE) had the opposite effect. Both a protoplast amino acid uptake assay and HPLC analysis indicated that more basic (Lys, Arg) and neutral (Val, Ala) amino acids were transported and accumulated in the OE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s than in the wild type, but the opposite was observed in the RNAi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s. Furthermore, exogenous application of Lys, Arg, Val, and Ala in the OE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s substantially inhibited tiller bud elongation, but the effect was lost in the RNAi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s. Notably, concentrations of the cytokinins cis-zeatin and dihydrozeatin were much lower in the OE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s than in the wild type, whereas concentrations in the RNAi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s were higher. Thus, <i>OsAAP5</i> could regulate tiller bud outgrowth by affecting cytokinin levels, and knockout of <i>OsAAP5</i> could be valuable for <i>japonica</i> breeding programs seeking high yield and grain quality.</p>

The Spermine Synthase OsSPMS1 Regulates Seed Germination, Grain Size, and Yield
<p>Polyamines, including putrescine, spermidine, and spermine, play essential roles in a wide variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) contains four putative spermidine/spermine synthase (SPMS)-encoding genes (<i>OsSPMS1</i>, <i>OsSPMS2</i>, <i>OsSPMS3</i>, and <i>OsACAULIS5</i>), but none have been functionally characterized. In this study, we used a reverse genetic strategy to investigate the biological function of <i>OsSPMS1</i>. We generated several homozygous RNA interference (RNAi) and overexpression (OE) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s of <i>OsSPMS1</i>. Phenotypic analysis indicated that <i>OsSPMS1</i> negatively regulates seed germination, grain size, and grain yield per plant. The ratio of spermine to spermidine was significantly lower in the RNAi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s and considerably higher in the OE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s than in the wild type, suggesting that OsSPMS1 may function as a SPMS. <i>S</i>-Adenosyl-<sc>l</sc>-methionine is a common precursor of polyamines and ethylene biosynthesis. The 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) and ethylene contents in seeds increased significantly in RNAi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s and decreased in OE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s, respectively, compared with the wild type. Additionally, the reduced germination rates and growth defects of OE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s could be rescued with ACC treatment. These data suggest that <i>OsSPMS1</i> affects ethylene synthesis and may regulate seed germination and plant growth by affecting the ACC and ethylene pathways. Most importantly, an <i>OsSPMS1</i> knockout mutant showed an increase in grain yield per plant in a high-yield variety, Suken118, suggesting that <i>OsSPMS1</i> is an important target for yield enhancement in rice.</p>

The Rubisco Chaperone BSD2 May Regulate Chloroplast Coverage in Maize Bundle Sheath Cells
<p>In maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), Bundle Sheath Defective2 (BSD2) plays an essential role in Rubisco biogenesis and is required for correct bundle sheath (BS) cell differentiation. Yet, BSD2 RNA and protein levels are similar in mesophyll (M) and BS chloroplasts, although Rubisco accumulates only in BS chloroplasts. This raises the possibility of additional BSD2 roles in cell development. To test this hypothesis, transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s were created that overexpress and underexpress BSD2 in both BS and M cells, driven by the cell type-specific Rubisco Small Subunit (RBCS) or Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxylase (PEPC) promoters or the ubiquitin promoter. Genetic crosses showed that each of the transgenes could complement Rubisco deficiency and seedling lethality conferred by the <i>bsd2</i> mutation. This was unexpected, as RBCS-BSD2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s lacked BSD2 in M chloroplasts and PEPC-BSD2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s expressed half the wild-type BSD2 level in BS chloroplasts. We conclude that BSD2 does not play a vital role in M cells and that BS BSD2 is in excess of requirements for Rubisco accumulation. BSD2 levels did affect chloroplast coverage in BS cells. In PEPC-BSD2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s, chloroplast coverage decreased 30% to 50%, whereas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s with increased BSD2 content exhibited a 25% increase. This suggests that BSD2 has an ancillary role in BS cells related to chloroplast size. Gas exchange showed decreased photosynthetic rates in PEPC-BSD2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s despite restored Rubisco function, correlating with reduced chloroplast coverage and pointing to CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion changes. Conversely, increased chloroplast coverage did not result in increased Rubisco abundance or photosynthetic rates. This suggests another limitation beyond chloroplast volume, most likely Rubisco biogenesis and/or turnover rates.</p>

Anterior lateral line nerve encoding to tones and play-back vocalisations in free-swimming oyster toadfish, <i>Opsanus tau</i>
<p>In the underwater environment, sound propagates both as a pressure wave and as particle motion, with particle motion dominating close to the source. At the receptor level, the fish ear and the neuromast hair cells act as displacement detectors, and both are potentially stimulated by the particle motion component of sound. The encoding of the anterior lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong> nerve to acoustic stimuli in freely behaving oyster toadfish, <i>Opsanus tau</i>, was examined. Nerve sensitivity and directional responses were determined using spike rate and vector strength analysis, a measure of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>-locking of spike times to the stimulus waveform. All units showed greatest sensitivity to 100 Hz stimulus. While sensitivity was independent of stimuli orientation, the neuron's ability to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>-lock was correlated with stimuli origin. Two different types of units were classified, type 1 (tonic), and type 2 (phasic). The type 1 fibres were further classified into two sub-types based on their frequency response (type 1–1 and type 1–2), which was hypothesised to be related to canal (type 1–1) and superficial (type 1–2) neuromast innervation. Lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong> units also exhibited sensitivity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> locking to boatwhistle vocalisations, with greatest spike rates exhibited at the onset of the call. These results provide direct evidence that oyster toadfish can use their lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong> to detect behaviourally relevant acoustic stimuli, which could provide a sensory pathway to aid in sound source localisation.</p>

Mexican blind cavefish use mouth suction to detect obstacles
<p>Fish commonly use their lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong> system to detect moving bodies such as prey and predators. A remarkable case is the Mexican blind cavefish <i>Astyanax fasciatus</i>, which evolved the ability to detect non-moving obstacles. The swimming body of <i>A. fasciatus</i> generates fluid disturbances, the alteration of which by an obstacle can be sensed by the fish's lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong> system. It is generally accepted that these alterations can provide information on the distance to the obstacle. We observed that <i>A. fasciatus</i> swimming in an unfamiliar environment open and close their mouths at high frequency (0.7–4.5 Hz) in order to generate suction flows. We hypothesized that repeated mouth suction generates a hydrodynamic velocity field, which is altered by an obstacle, inducing pressure gradients in the neuromasts of the lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong> and corresponding strong lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong> stimuli. We observed that the frequency and rate of mouth-opening events varied with the fish's distance to obstacles, a hallmark of pulse-based navigation mechanisms such as echolocation. We formulated a mathematical model of this hitherto unrecognized mechanism of obstacle detection and parameterized it experimentally. This model suggests that suction flows induce lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong> stimuli that are weakly dependent on the fish's speed, and may be an order of magnitude stronger than the correspondent stimuli induced by the fish's gliding body. We illustrate that <i>A. fasciatus</i> can navigate non-visually using a combination of two deeply ancestral and highly conserved mechanisms of ray-finned fishes: the mechanism of sensing water motion by the lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong> system and the mechanism of generating water motion by mouth suction.</p>

A parity-breaking electronic nematic phase transition in the spin-orbit coupled metal Cd<sub>2</sub>Re<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>
<p>Strong electron interactions can drive metallic systems toward a variety of well-known symmetry-broken <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>s, but the instabilities of correlated metals with strong spin-orbit coupling have only recently begun to be explored. We uncovered a multipolar nematic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> of matter in the metallic pyrochlore Cd<sub>2</sub>Re<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> using spatially resolved second-harmonic optical anisotropy measurements. Like previously discovered electronic nematic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>s, this multipolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> spontaneously breaks rotational symmetry while preserving translational invariance. However, it has the distinguishing property of being odd under spatial inversion, which is allowed only in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. By examining the critical behavior of the multipolar nematic order parameter, we show that it drives the thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> transition near 200 kelvin in Cd<sub>2</sub>Re<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> and induces a parity-breaking lattice distortion as a secondary order.</p>

A Specific Glycogen Mobilization Strategy Enables Rapid Awakening of Dormant Cyanobacteria from Chlorosis
<p>Many organisms survive stressful conditions via entry into a dormant state that can be rapidly exited when the stressor disappears; this ability provides a strong selective advantage. In the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803, the exit from nitrogen chlorosis takes less than 48 h and is enabled by the impressive metabolic flexibility of these cyanobacteria, which pass through heterotrophic and mixotrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>s before reentering photoautotrophic growth. Switching between these states requires delicate coordination of carbohydrate oxidation, CO<sub>2</sub> fixation, and photosynthesis. Here, we investigated the contribution of the different carbon catabolic routes by assessing mutants of these pathways during nitrogen chlorosis and resuscitation. The addition of nitrate to nitrogen-starved cells rapidly starts the awakening program. Metabolism switches from maintenance metabolism, characterized by residual photosynthesis and low cellular ATP levels, to an initial heterotrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>, characterized by respiration and an immediate increase in ATP levels. This respiration relies on glycogen breakdown catalyzed by the glycogen phosphorylase GlgP2. In the following transient mixotrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>, photosynthesis and CO<sub>2</sub> fixation restart and glycogen is consumed. During the mixotrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>, parallel operation of the oxidative pentose phosphate cycle and the Entner-Doudoroff pathway is required for resuscitation to proceed; the glycolytic route via the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway has minor importance. Our data suggest that, during resuscitation, only the Entner-Doudoroff and oxidative pentose phosphate pathways supply the metabolic intermediates necessary for the anabolic reactions required to reconstitute a vegetative cell. Intriguingly, the key enzymes for glycogen catabolism are already expressed during the preceding chlorotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>, in apparent preparation for rapid resuscitation.</p>

Altered Expression of a Malate-Permeable Anion Channel, OsALMT4, Disrupts Mineral Nutrition
<p>Aluminum-activated malate transporters (ALMTs) form a family of anion channels in plants, but little is known about most of its members. This study examined the function of <i>OsALMT4</i> from rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). We show that <i>OsALMT4</i> is expressed in roots and shoots and that the OsALMT4 protein localizes to the plasma membrane. Transgenic rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s overexpressing (OX) <i>OsALMT4</i> released malate from the roots constitutively and had 2-fold higher malate concentrations in the xylem sap than nulls, indicating greater concentrations of malate in the apoplast. OX <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s developed brown necrotic spots on the leaves that did not appear on nulls. These symptoms were not associated with altered concentrations of any mineral element in the leaves, although the OX <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s had higher concentrations of Mn and B in their grain compared with nulls. While total leaf Mn concentrations were not different between the OX and null <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s, Mn concentrations in the apoplast were greater in the OX plants. The OX <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s also displayed increased expression of Mn transporters and were more sensitive to Mn toxicity than null plants. We showed that the growth of wild-type rice was unaffected by 100 µ<sc>m</sc> Mn in hydroponics but, when combined with 1 m<sc>m</sc> malate, this concentration inhibited growth. We conclude that increasing <i>OsALMT4</i> expression affected malate efflux and compartmentation within the tissues, which increased Mn concentrations in the apoplast of leaves and induced the toxicity symptoms. This study reveals new links between malate transport and mineral nutrition.</p>

A Novel Mechanism, Linked to Cell Density, Largely Controls Cell Division in <i>Synechocystis</i>
<p>Many studies have investigated the various genetic and environmental factors regulating cyanobacterial growth. Here, we investigated the growth and metabolism of <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 under different nitrogen sources, light intensities, and CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. Cells grown on urea showed the highest growth rates. However, for all conditions tested, the daily growth rates in batch cultures decreased steadily over time, and stationary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> was obtained with similar cell densities. Unexpectedly, metabolic and physiological analyses showed that growth rates during log <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> were not controlled primarily by the availability of photoassimilates. Further physiological investigations indicated that nutrient limitation, quorum sensing, light quality, and light intensity (self-shading) were not the main factors responsible for the decrease in the growth rate and the onset of the stationary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>. Moreover, cell division rates in fed-batch cultures were positively correlated with the dilution rates. Hence, not only light, CO<sub>2</sub>, and nutrients can affect growth but also a cell-cell interaction. Accordingly, we propose that cell-cell interaction may be a factor responsible for the gradual decrease of growth rates in batch cultures during log <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>, culminating with the onset of stationary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>.</p>

Regulation of Vegetative Phase Change by SWI2/SNF2 Chromatin Remodeling ATPase BRAHMA
<p>Plants progress from a juvenile vegetative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> of development to an adult vegetative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> of development before they enter the reproductive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>. miR156 has been shown to be the master regulator of the juvenile-to-adult transition in plants. However, the mechanism of how miR156 is transcriptionally regulated still remains elusive. In a forward genetic screen, we identified that a mutation in the SWI2/SNF2 chromatin remodeling ATPase BRAHMA (BRM) exhibited an accelerated vegetative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> change phenotype by reducing the expression of miR156, which in turn caused a corresponding increase in the levels of <i>SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN LIKE</i> genes. BRM regulates miR156 expression by directly binding to the <i>MIR156A</i> promoter. Mutations in <i>BRM</i> not only increased occupancy of the −2 and +1 nucleosomes proximal to the transcription start site at the <i>MIR156A</i> locus but also the levels of trimethylated histone H3 at Lys 27. The precocious phenotype of <i>brm</i> mutant was partially suppressed by a second mutation in <i>SWINGER</i> (<i>SWN</i>), but not by a mutation in <i>CURLEY LEAF</i>, both of which are key components of the Polycomb Group Repressive Complex 2 in plants. Our results indicate that BRM and SWN act antagonistically at the nucleosome level to fine-tune the temporal expression of miR156 to regulate vegetative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> change in Arabidopsis.</p>

Tuning superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene
<p>Materials with flat electronic bands often exhibit exotic quantum phenomena owing to strong correlations. An isolated low-energy flat band can be induced in bilayer graphene by simply rotating the layers by 1.1°, resulting in the appearance of gate-tunable superconducting and correlated insulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>s. In this study, we demonstrate that in addition to the twist angle, the interlayer coupling can be varied to precisely tune these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>s. We induce superconductivity at a twist angle larger than 1.1°—in which correlated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>s are otherwise absent—by varying the interlayer spacing with hydrostatic pressure. Our low-disorder devices reveal details about the superconducting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> diagram and its relationship to the nearby insulator. Our results demonstrate twisted bilayer graphene to be a distinctively tunable platform for exploring correlated states.</p>

DNA-induced liquid phase condensation of cGAS activates innate immune signaling
<p>The binding of DNA to cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS) leads to the production of the secondary messenger cyclic GMP–AMP (cGAMP), which activates innate immune responses. We have shown that DNA binding to cGAS robustly induced the formation of liquidlike droplets in which cGAS was activated. The disordered and positively charged cGAS N terminus enhanced cGAS-DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> separation by increasing the valencies of DNA binding. Long DNA was more efficient in promoting cGAS liquid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> separation and cGAS enzyme activity than short DNA. Moreover, free zinc ions enhanced cGAS enzyme activity both in vitro and in cells by promoting cGAS-DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> separation. These results demonstrated that the DNA-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> transition of cGAS promotes cGAMP production and innate immune signaling.</p>

A liquid phase of synapsin and lipid vesicles
<p>Neurotransmitter-containing synaptic vesicles (SVs) form tight clusters at synapses. These clusters act as a reservoir from which SVs are drawn for exocytosis during sustained activity. Several components associated with SVs that are likely to help form such clusters have been reported, including synapsin. Here we found that synapsin can form a distinct liquid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> in an aqueous environment. Other scaffolding proteins could coassemble into this condensate but were not necessary for its formation. Importantly, the synapsin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> could capture small lipid vesicles. The synapsin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> rapidly disassembled upon phosphorylation by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, mimicking the dispersion of synapsin 1 that occurs at presynaptic sites upon stimulation. Thus, principles of liquid-liquid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> separation may apply to the clustering of SVs at synapses.</p>

Phase transitions in a programmable quantum spin glass simulator

RNA buffers the phase separation behavior of prion-like RNA binding proteins
<p>Prion-like RNA binding proteins (RBPs) such as TDP43 and FUS are largely soluble in the nucleus but form solid pathological aggregates when mislocalized to the cytoplasm. What keeps these proteins soluble in the nucleus and promotes aggregation in the cytoplasm is still unknown. We report here that RNA critically regulates the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> behavior of prion-like RBPs. Low RNA/protein ratios promote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> separation into liquid droplets, whereas high ratios prevent droplet formation in vitro. Reduction of nuclear RNA levels or genetic ablation of RNA binding causes excessive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> separation and the formation of cytotoxic solid-like assemblies in cells. We propose that the nucleus is a buffered system in which high RNA concentrations keep RBPs soluble. Changes in RNA levels or RNA binding abilities of RBPs cause aberrant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> transitions.</p>

Phase separation of a yeast prion protein promotes cellular fitness
<p>Despite the important role of prion domains in neurodegenerative disease, their physiological function has remained enigmatic. Previous work with yeast prions has defined prion domains as sequences that form self-propagating aggregates. Here, we uncovered an unexpected function of the canonical yeast prion protein Sup35. In stressed conditions, Sup35 formed protective gels via pH-regulated liquid-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> separation followed by gelation. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> separation was mediated by the N-terminal prion domain and regulated by the adjacent pH sensor domain. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> separation promoted yeast cell survival by rescuing the essential Sup35 translation factor from stress-induced damage. Thus, prion-like domains represent conserved environmental stress sensors that facilitate rapid adaptation in unstable environments by modifying protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> behavior.</p>

Quantized electric multipole insulators

We extend this concept to higher electric multipole moments and determine the necessary conditions and minimal models for which the quadrupole and octupole moments are topologically quantized electromagnetic observables. Such systems exhibit gapped boundaries that are themselves lower-dimensional topological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>s. Furthermore, they host topologically protected corner states carrying fractional charge, exhibiting fractionalization at the boundary of the boundary. To characterize these insulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>s of matter, we introduce a paradigm in which “nested” Wilson loops give rise to topological invariants that have been overlooked. We propose three realistic experimental implementations of this topological behavior that can be immediately tested.

Senescence and Defense Pathways Contribute to Heterosis
<p>Hybrids are used extensively in agriculture due to their superior performance in seed yield and plant growth, yet the molecular mechanisms underpinning hybrid performance are not well understood. Recent evidence has suggested that a decrease in basal defense response gene expression regulated by reduced levels of salicylic acid (SA) may be important for vigor in certain hybrid combinations. Decreasing levels of SA in the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) accession C24 through the introduction of the SA catabolic enzyme salicylate1 hydroxylase (NahG) increases plant size, phenocopying the large-sized C24/Landsberg <i>erecta</i> (L<i>er</i>) F1 hybrids. C24♀ × L<i>er</i>♂ F1 hybrids and C24 NahG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s shared differentially expressed genes and pathways associated with plant defense and leaf senescence including decreased expression of SA biosynthetic genes and SA response genes. The expression of <i>TL1 BINDING TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR1</i>, a key regulator in resource allocation between growth and defense, was decreased in both the F1 hybrid and the C24 NahG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s, which may promote growth. Both C24 NahG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s and the F1 hybrids showed decreased expression of the key senescence-associated transcription factors <i>WRKY53</i>, <i>NAC</i>-<i>CONTAINING PROTEIN29</i>, and <i>ORESARA1</i> with a delayed onset of senescence compared to C24 plants. The delay in senescence resulted in an extension of the photosynthetic period in the leaves of F1 hybrids compared to the parental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s, potentially allowing each leaf to contribute more resources toward growth.</p>

Growth at Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> Requires Acclimation of the Respiratory Chain to Support Photosynthesis
<p>Plants will experience an elevated atmospheric concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> (ECO<sub>2</sub>) in the future. Growth of tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) at ECO<sub>2</sub> more than doubled the leaf protein amount of alternative oxidase (AOX), a non-energy-conserving component of mitochondrial respiration. To test the functional significance of this AOX increase, wild-type tobacco was compared with AOX knockdown and overexpression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s, following growth at ambient CO<sub>2</sub> or ECO<sub>2</sub>. The ECO<sub>2</sub>-grown AOX knockdowns had a reduced capacity for triose phosphate use (TPU) during photosynthesis compared with the other plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s. This TPU limitation of CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation was associated with an increased accumulation of glucose-6-phosphate, sucrose, and starch in the leaves of the knockdowns. Under TPU-limiting conditions, the size of the proton gradient and proton motive force across the thylakoid membrane was enhanced in the knockdowns relative to the other plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s, suggesting a restriction of chloroplast ATP synthase activity. This restriction was not due to a dec<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong> in ATP synthase (AtpB) protein amount. The knockdowns also displayed a photosystem stoichiometry adjustment at ECO<sub>2</sub>, which was absent in the other plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s. Additional experiments showed that the way in which AOX supports photosynthesis at ECO<sub>2</sub> is distinct from its previously described role in supporting photosynthesis during water deficit. The results are discussed in terms of how AOX contributes to TPU capacity and the maintenance of chloroplast ATP synthase activity at ECO<sub>2</sub>. Overall, the evidence suggests that AOX respiration is needed to maintain both the carbon and energy balance in photosynthetic tissues during growth at ECO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

A Comprehensive Toolkit for Inducible, Cell Type-Specific Gene Expression in Arabidopsis
<p>Understanding the context-specific role of gene function is a key objective of modern biology. To this end, we generated a resource for inducible cell type-specific transactivation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) based on the well-established combination of the chimeric GR-LhG4 transcription factor and the synthetic <i>pOp</i> promoter. Harnessing the flexibility of the GreenGate cloning system, we produced a comprehensive set of transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s termed GR-LhG4 driver <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s targeting most tissues in the Arabidopsis shoot and root with a strong focus on the indeterminate meristems. When we combined these transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s with effectors under the control of the <i>pOp</i> promoter, we observed tight temporal and spatial control of gene expression. In particular, inducible expression in F1 plants obtained from crosses of driver and effector <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s allows for rapid assessment of the cell type-specific impact of an effector with high temporal resolution. Thus, our comprehensive and flexible method is suitable for overcoming the limitations of ubiquitous genetic approaches, the outputs of which often are difficult to interpret due to the widespread existence of compensatory mechanisms and the integration of diverging effects in different cell types.</p>

Genetic Architecture and Molecular Networks Underlying Leaf Thickness in Desert-Adapted Tomato <i>Solanum pennellii</i>
<p>Thicker leaves allow plants to grow in water-limited conditions. However, our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of this highly functional leaf shape trait is poor. We used a custom-built confocal profilometer to directly measure leaf thickness in a set of introgression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s (ILs) derived from the desert tomato <i>Solanum pennellii</i> and identified quantitative trait loci. We report evidence of a complex genetic architecture of this trait and roles for both genetic and environmental factors. Several ILs with thick leaves have dramatically elongated palisade mesophyll cells and, in some cases, increased leaf ploidy. We characterized the thick IL2-5 and IL4-3 in detail and found increased mesophyll cell size and leaf ploidy levels, suggesting that endoreduplication underpins leaf thickness in tomato. Next, we queried the transcriptomes and inferred dynamic Bayesian networks of gene expression across early leaf ontogeny in these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s to compare the molecular networks that pattern leaf thickness. We show that thick ILs share <i>S. pennellii</i>-like expression profiles for putative regulators of cell shape and meristem determinacy as well as a general signature of cell cycle-related gene expression. However, our network data suggest that leaf thickness in these two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s is patterned at least partially by distinct mechanisms. Consistent with this hypothesis, double homozygote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s combining introgression segments from these two ILs show additive phenotypes, including thick leaves, higher ploidy levels, and larger palisade mesophyll cells. Collectively, these data establish a framework of genetic, anatomical, and molecular mechanisms that pattern leaf thickness in desert-adapted tomato.</p>

Redox Control of Aphid Resistance through Altered Cell Wall Composition and Nutritional Quality
<p>The mechanisms underpinning plant perception of phloem-feeding insects, particularly aphids, remain poorly characterized. Therefore, the role of apoplastic redox state in controlling aphid infestation was explored using transgenic tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) plants that have either high (PAO) or low (TAO) ascorbate oxidase (AO) activities relative to the wild type. Only a small number of leaf transcripts and metabolites were changed in response to genotype, and cell wall composition was largely unaffected. Aphid fecundity was decreased significantly in TAO plants compared with other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s. Leaf sugar levels were increased and maximum extractable AO activities were decreased in response to aphids in all genotypes. Transcripts encoding the Respiratory Burst Oxidase Homolog F, signaling components involved in ethylene and other hormone-mediated pathways, photosynthetic electron transport components, sugar, amino acid, and cell wall metabolism, were increased significantly in the TAO plants in response to aphid perception relative to other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s. The levels of galactosylated xyloglucan were decreased significantly in response to aphid feeding in all the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s, the effect being the least in the TAO plants. Similarly, all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s exhibited increases in tightly bound (1→4)-β-galactan.

Mitochondrial ABC Transporter ATM3 Is Essential for Cytosolic Iron-Sulfur Cluster Assembly
<p>The mitochondrial ATP-binding cassette transporter ATM3 has been studied in Arabidopsis. Its function, however, is poorly understood in other model plant species. This study reports that the ATM3 is required for cytosolic iron-sulfur cluster assembly and is essential for meristem maintenance in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). The loss of function of <i>OsATM3</i> is lethal in rice at the four-leaf stage. In the <i>osatm3</i> T-DNA insertion mutant, the fourth leaf fails to develop and the lateral roots are short. Cytosolic iron-sulfur protein activities were significantly reduced in both <i>osatm3</i> and RNA interference transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s. The expression profiles of many iron metabolism genes were altered in the <i>osatm3</i> and RNA interference <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s. Glutathione metabolism was impaired and reactive oxygen species, particularly superoxide, accumulated in <i>osatm3</i>. Promoter-β-glucuronidase staining of the transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong> indicated that <i>OsATM3</i> is highly expressed in lateral root primordia, root tip meristem zones, and shoot apical meristem regions. The average cell size was significantly greater in <i>osatm3</i> than in the wild type. Massive cell death occurred in the <i>osatm3</i> root tip meristem zone. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed transcriptional reprogramming of the genes in the <i>osatm3</i> and RNAi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s involved in DNA repair and cell cycle arrest. Our results suggest that the mitochondrial ATM3 is essential for iron homeostasis in rice.</p>

Long-term pattern and magnitude of soil carbon feedback to the climate system in a warming world

Several factors combine to affect the timing, magnitude, and thermal acclimation of soil carbon loss. These include depletion of microbially accessible carbon pools, reductions in microbial biomass, a shift in microbial carbon use efficiency, and changes in microbial community composition. Our results support projections of a long-term, self-reinforcing carbon feedback from mid-latitude forests to the climate system as the world warms.</p>

Mutations in the promoter of the telomerase gene <i>TERT</i> contribute to tumorigenesis by a two-step mechanism
<p><i>TERT</i> promoter mutations (TPMs) are the most common noncoding mutations in cancer. The timing and consequences of TPMs have not been fully established. Here, we show that TPMs acquired at the transition from benign nevus to malignant melanoma do not support telomere maintenance. In vitro experiments revealed that TPMs do not prevent telomere attrition, resulting in cells with critically short and unprotected telomeres. Immortalization by TPMs requires a gradual up-regulation of telomerase, coinciding with telomere fusions. These data suggest that TPMs contribute to tumorigenesis by promoting immortalization and genomic instability in two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>s. In an initial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>, TPMs do not prevent bulk telomere shortening but extend cellular life span by healing the shortest telomeres. In the second <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>, the critically short telomeres lead to genome instability and telomerase is further up-regulated to sustain cell proliferation.</p>

<p>We show nanoscale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> stabilization of CsPbI<sub>3</sub> quantum dots (QDs) to low temperatures that can be used as the active component of efficient optoelectronic devices. CsPbI<sub>3</sub> is an all-inorganic analog to the hybrid organic cation halide perovskites, but the cubic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> of bulk CsPbI<sub>3</sub> (α-CsPbI<sub>3</sub>)—the variant with desirable band gap—is only stable at high temperatures. We describe the formation of α-CsPbI<sub>3</sub> QD films that are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>-stable for months in ambient air. The films exhibit long-range electronic transport and were used to fabricate colloidal perovskite QD photovoltaic cells with an open-circuit voltage of 1.23 volts and efficiency of 10.77%. These devices also function as light-emitting diodes with low turn-on voltage and tunable emission.</p>

Disproportionation of (Mg,Fe)SiO<sub>3</sub> perovskite in Earth’s deep lower mantle
<p>The mineralogical constitution of the Earth’s mantle dictates the geophysical and geochemical properties of this region. Previous models of a perovskite-dominant lower mantle have been built on the assumption that the entire lower mantle down to the top of the D″ layer contains ferromagnesian silicate [(Mg,Fe)SiO<sub>3</sub>] with nominally 10 mole percent Fe. On the basis of experiments in laser-heated diamond anvil cells, at pressures of 95 to 101 gigapascals and temperatures of 2200 to 2400 kelvin, we found that such perovskite is unstable; it loses its Fe and disproportionates to a nearly Fe-free MgSiO<sub>3</sub> perovskite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> and an Fe-rich <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> with a hexagonal structure. This observation has implications for enigmatic seismic features beyond ~2000 kilometers depth and suggests that the lower mantle may contain previously unidentified major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>s.</p>

Gibberellin Acts Positively Then Negatively to Control Onset of Flower Formation in <i>Arabidopsis</i>
<sec><title>One Hormone, Two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>s</title><p>The switch from vegetative growth to flowering in the plant <i>Arabidopsis</i> involves two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong>s—inflorescence branching and flowering. <bold>Yamaguchi <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 638) examined how the phytohormone gibberellin regulates each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> differently. First, gibberellin levels increase and stimulate production of key flowering factors, one of which degrades gibberellin. As gibberellin levels then fall, the next <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phase</span></strong> of flowering factors is released from gibberellin repression. By regulating inflorescence branching separately from flowering, this system determines overall seed yield.</p></sec>

A Transcription Factor, OsMADS57, Regulates Long-Distance Nitrate Transport and Root Elongation
<p>Root nitrate uptake adjusts to the plant’s nitrogen demand for growth. Here, we report that OsMADS57, a MADS-box transcription factor, modulates nitrate translocation from rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) roots to shoots under low-nitrate conditions. <i>OsMADS57</i> is abundantly expressed in xylem parenchyma cells of root stele and is induced by nitrate. Compared with wild-type rice plants supplied with 0.2 mM nitrate, <i>osmads57</i> mutants had 31% less xylem loading of nitrate, while overexpression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s had 2-fold higher levels. Shoot-root <sup>15</sup>N content ratios were 40% lower in the mutants and 76% higher in the overexpression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s. Rapid NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> root influx experiments showed that mutation of <i>OsMADS57</i> did not affect root nitrate uptake. Reverse transcription quantitative PCR analysis of <i>OsNRT2</i> nitrate transporter genes showed that after 5 min in 0.2 mM nitrate, only <i>OsNRT2.3a</i> (a vascular-specific high-affinity nitrate transporter) had reduced (by two-thirds) expression levels. At 60 min of nitrate treatment, lower expression levels were also observed for three additional <i>NRT2</i> genes (<i>OsNRT2.1/2.2/2.4</i>). Conversely, in the overexpression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s, four <i>NRT2</i> genes had much higher expression profiles at all time points tested. As previously reported, <i>OsNRT2.3a</i> functions in nitrate translocation, indicating the possible interaction between <i>OsMADS57</i> and <i>OsNRT2.3a</i>. Yeast one-hybrid and transient expression assays demonstrated that OsMADS57 binds to the CArG motif (CATTTTATAG) within the <i>OsNRT2.3a</i> promoter. Moreover, seminal root elongation was inhibited in <i>osmads57</i> mutants, which may be associated with higher auxin levels in and auxin polar transport to root tips of mutant plants. Taken together, these results suggest that OsMADS57 has a role in regulating nitrate translocation from root to shoot via OsNRT2.3a.</p>

An Efficient System for <i>Ds</i> Transposon Tagging in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>
<p>Transposon tagging is a powerful tool that has been widely applied in several species for insertional mutagenesis in plants. Several efforts have aimed to create transfer-DNA (T-DNA) insertional mutant populations in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>, a monocot plant used as a model system to study temperate cereals, but there has been a lack of research aimed at using transposon strategies. Here, we describe the application of a maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) <i>Dissociation</i> (<i>Ds</i>) transposon tagging system in <i>B</i>. <i>distachyon</i>. The <i>35S</i>::<i>AcTPase</i> cassette and <i>Ds</i> element were constructed within the same T-DNA and transformed into <i>B</i>. <i>distachyon</i> plants. The <i>Ds</i> element was readily transposed to other chromosomes or to the same chromosome under the function of <i>Activator</i> (<i>Ac</i>) transposase. Through homologous chromosome synapsis, recombination, and segregation, the <i>Ds</i> element separated from the <i>Ac</i> element. We selected stable <i>Ds</i>-only plants using G418 and GFP assays and analyzed 241 T<sub>0</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s, some of which were highly efficient at producing <i>Ds</i>-only progeny. Through thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR, we isolated 710 independent <i>Ds</i> flanking sequences from <i>Ds</i>-only plants. Furthermore, we identified a large collection of mutants with visible developmental phenotypes via this transposon tagging system. The system is relatively simple and rapid in comparison to traditional T-DNA insertion strategies, because once efficiency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s are obtained they can be reused to generate more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s from nontransposed plants without the use of time-consuming tissue culture steps.</p>

The <i>PILNCR1</i>-miR399 Regulatory Module Is Important for Low Phosphate Tolerance in Maize
<p>The regulation of adaptive responses to phosphorus (P) deficiency by the <i>microRNA399</i> (<i>miR399</i>)/<i>PHOSPHATE2</i> (<i>PHO2</i>) pathway has been well studied in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) but not in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). Here, we show that miR399 transcripts are strongly induced in maize by phosphate (Pi) deficiency. Transgenic maize plants that overexpressed <i>MIR399b</i> accumulated excessive amounts of P in their shoots and displayed typical Pi-toxicity phenotypes. We reannotated <i>ZmPHO2</i> with an additional 1,165 bp of the 5′ untranslated region. miR399-guided posttranscriptional repression of <i>ZmPHO2</i> was mainly observed in the P-efficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s. We identified Pi-deficiency-induced long-noncoding RNA1 (<i>PILNCR1</i>) from our strand-specific RNA libraries. Transient expression assays in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> and maize leaf protoplasts demonstrated that <i>PILNCR1</i> inhibits ZmmiR399-guided cleavage of <i>ZmPHO2</i>. The abundance of <i>PILNCR1</i> was significantly higher in P-inefficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s than in P-efficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s, which is consistent with the abundance of ZmmiR399 transcripts. These results indicate that the interaction between <i>PILNCR1</i> and miR399 is important for tolerance to low Pi in maize.</p>

The <i>MicroRNA390</i>/<i>TRANS-ACTING SHORT INTERFERING RNA3</i> Module Mediates Lateral Root Growth under Salt Stress via the Auxin Pathway
<p>Salt-induced developmental plasticity in a plant root system strongly depends on auxin signaling. However, the molecular events underlying this process are poorly understood. <i>MicroRNA390</i> (<i>miR390</i>), <i>trans-actin small interfering RNA</i>s (<i>tasiRNA</i>s), and <i>AUXIN RESPONSE FACTORs</i> (<i>ARFs</i>) form a regulatory module involved in controlling lateral root (LR) growth. Here, we found that <i>miR390</i> expression was strongly induced by exposure to salt during LR formation in poplar (<i>Populus</i> spp.) plants. <i>miR390</i> overexpression stimulated LR development and increased salt tolerance, whereas <i>miR390</i> knockdown caused by a short tandem target mimic repressed LR growth and compromised salt resistance. <i>ARF3.1</i>, <i>ARF3.2</i>, and <i>ARF4</i> expression was inhibited significantly by the presence of salt, and transcript abundance was decreased dramatically in the <i>miR390</i>-overexpressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong> but increased in the <i>miR390</i>-knockdown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>. Constitutive expression of <i>ARF4m</i> harboring mutated <i>trans-acting small interfering ARF</i>-binding sites removed the salt resistance of the <i>miR390</i> overexpressors. <i>miR390</i> positively regulated auxin signaling in LRs subjected to salt, but <i>ARF4</i> inhibited auxin signaling. Salinity stabilized the poplar Aux/IAA repressor INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID17.1, and overexpression of an auxin/salt-resistant form of this repressor suppressed LR growth in <i>miR390</i>-overexpressing and <i>ARF4</i>-RNA interfering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s in the presence of salt. Thus, the <i>miR390/TAS3/ARFs</i> module is a key regulator, via modulating the auxin pathway, of LR growth in poplar subjected to salt stress.</p>

A Genetic Network for Systemic RNA Silencing in Plants
<p>Non-cell autonomous RNA silencing can spread from cell to cell and over long distances in animals and plants. However, the genetic requirements and signals involved in plant mobile gene silencing are poorly understood. Here, we identified a <i>DICER-LIKE2</i> (<i>DCL2</i>)<i>-</i>dependent mechanism for systemic spread of posttranscriptional RNA silencing, also known as posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS), in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. Using a suite of transgenic <i>DCL</i> RNAi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s coupled with a GFP reporter, we demonstrated that <i>N. benthamiana</i> DCL1, DCL2, DCL3, and DCL4 are required to produce microRNAs and 22, 24, and 21nt small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), respectively. All investigated siRNAs produced in local incipient cells were present at low levels in distal tissues. Inhibition of <i>DCL2</i> expression reduced the spread of gene silencing, while suppression of <i>DCL3</i> or <i>DCL4</i> expression enhanced systemic PTGS. In contrast to <i>DCL4</i> RNAi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s, <i>DCL2</i>-<i>DCL4</i> double-RNAi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s developed systemic PTGS similar to that observed in <i>DCL2</i> RNAi. We further showed that the 21 or 24 nt local siRNAs produced by DCL4 or DCL3 were not involved in long-distance gene silencing. Grafting experiments demonstrated that <i>DCL2</i> was required in the scion to respond to the signal, but not in the rootstock to produce/send the signal. These results suggest a coordinated <i>DCL</i> genetic pathway in which <i>DCL2</i> plays an essential role in systemic PTGS in <i>N. benthamiana</i>, while both <i>DCL4</i> and <i>DCL3</i> attenuate systemic PTGS. We discuss the potential role of 21, 22, and 24 nt siRNAs in systemic PTGS.</p>

Knockdown of Rice MicroRNA166 Confers Drought Resistance by Causing Leaf Rolling and Altering Stem Xylem Development
<p>MicroRNAs are 19- to 22-nucleotide small noncoding RNAs that have been implicated in abiotic stress responses. In this study, we found that knockdown of microRNA166, using the Short Tandem Target Mimic (STTM) system, resulted in morphological changes that confer drought resistance in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). From a large-scale screen for miRNA knockdown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s in rice, we identified miR166 knockdown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s (STTM166); these plants exhibit a rolled-leaf phenotype, which is normally displayed by rice plants under drought stress. The leaves of STTM166 rice plants had smaller bulliform cells and abnormal sclerenchymatous cells, likely causing the rolled-leaf phenotype. The STTM166 plants had reduced stomatal conductance and showed decreased transpiration rates. The STTM166 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s also exhibited altered stem xylem and decreased hydraulic conductivity, likely due to the reduced diameter of the xylem vessels. Molecular analyses identified rice <i>HOMEODOMAIN CONTAINING PROTEIN4</i> (<i>OsHB4</i>), a member of HD-Zip III gene family, as a major target of miR166; moreover, rice plants overexpressing a miR166-resistant form of <i>OsHB4</i> resembled the STTM166 plants, including leaf rolling and higher drought resistance. The genes downstream of miR166-<i>OsHB4</i> consisted of polysaccharide synthesis-related genes that may contribute to cell wall formation and vascular development. Our results suggest that drought resistance in rice can be increased by manipulating miRNAs, which leads to developmental changes, such as leaf rolling and reduced diameter of the xylem, that mimic plants’ natural responses to water-deficit stress.</p>

Host-Induced Gene Silencing of the MAPKK Gene <i>PsFUZ7</i> Confers Stable Resistance to Wheat Stripe Rust<sup><xref>1</xref></sup>
<p>RNA interference (RNAi) is a powerful genetic tool to accelerate research in plant biotechnology and control biotic stresses by manipulating target gene expression. However, the potential of RNAi in wheat to efficiently and durably control the devastating stripe rust fungus <i>Puccinia striiformis</i> f. sp. <i>tritici</i> (<i>Pst</i>) remained largely under explored so far. To address this issue, we generated transgenic wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s expressing dsRNA targeting <i>PsFUZ7</i> transcripts of <i>Pst</i>. We analyzed expression of <i>PsFUZ7</i> and related genes, and resistance traits of the transgenic wheat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s. We show that <i>PsFUZ7</i> is an important pathogenicity factor that regulates infection and development of <i>Pst</i>. A <i>PsFUZ7</i> RNAi construct stably expressed in two independent transgenic wheat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s confers strong resistance to <i>Pst</i>. <i>Pst</i> hyphal development is strongly restricted, and necrosis of plant cells in resistance responses was significantly induced. We conclude that trafficking of RNA molecules from wheat plants to <i>Pst</i> may lead to a complex molecular dialogue between wheat and the rust pathogen. Moreover, we confirm the RNAi-based crop protection approaches can be used, to our knowledge, as a novel control strategy against rust pathogens in wheat.</p>

Selinene Volatiles Are Essential Precursors for Maize Defense Promoting Fungal Pathogen Resistance
<p>To ensure food security, maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) is a model crop for understanding useful traits underlying stress resistance. In contrast to foliar biochemicals, root defenses limiting the spread of disease remain poorly described. To better understand belowground defenses in the field, we performed root metabolomic profiling and uncovered unexpectedly high levels of the sesquiterpene volatile β-se<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>ne and the corresponding nonvolatile antibiotic derivative β-costic acid. The application of metabolite-based quantitative trait locus mapping using biparental populations, genome-wide association studies, and near-isogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s enabled the identification of terpene synthase21 (<i>ZmTps21</i>) on chromosome 9 as a β-costic acid pathway candidate gene. Numerous closely examined β-costic acid-deficient inbred <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s were found to harbor <i>Zmtps21</i> pseudogenes lacking conserved motifs required for farnesyl diphosphate cyclase activity. For biochemical validation, a full-length <i>ZmTps21</i> was cloned, heterologously expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, and demonstrated to cyclize farnesyl diphosphate, yielding β-se<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>ne as the dominant product. Consistent with microbial defense pathways, <i>ZmTps21</i> transcripts strongly accumulate following fungal elicitation. Challenged field roots containing functional <i>ZmTps21</i> alleles displayed β-costic acid levels over 100 μg g<sup>−1</sup> fresh weight, greatly exceeding in vitro concentrations required to inhibit the growth of five different fungal pathogens and rootworm larvae (<i>Diabrotica balteata</i>). In vivo disease resistance assays, using <i>ZmTps21</i> and <i>Zmtps21</i> near-isogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s, further support the endogenous antifungal role of se<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>ne-derived metabolites. Involved in the biosynthesis of nonvolatile antibiotics, <i>ZmTps21</i> exists as a useful gene for germplasm improvement programs targeting optimized biotic stress resistance.</p>

The Genetic Basis of Plant Architecture in 10 Maize Recombinant Inbred Line Populations
<p>Plant architecture is a key factor affecting planting density and grain yield in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). However, the genetic mechanisms underlying plant architecture in diverse genetic backgrounds have not been fully addressed. Here, we performed a large-scale phenotyping of 10 plant architecture-related traits and dissected the genetic loci controlling these traits in 10 recombinant inbred <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong> populations derived from 14 diverse genetic backgrounds. Nearly 800 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with major and minor effects were identified as contributing to the phenotypic variation of plant architecture-related traits. Ninety-two percent of these QTLs were detected in only one population, confirming the diverse genetic backgrounds of the mapping populations and the prevalence of rare alleles in maize. The numbers and effects of QTLs are positively associated with the phenotypic variation in the population, which, in turn, correlates positively with parental phenotypic and genetic variations. A large proportion (38.5%) of QTLs was associated with at least two traits, suggestive of the frequent occurrence of pleiotropic loci or closely linked loci. Key developmental genes, which previously were shown to affect plant architecture in mutant studies, were found to colocalize with many QTLs. Five QTLs were further validated using the segregating populations developed from residual heterozygous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s present in the recombinant inbred <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong> populations. Additionally, one new plant height QTL, <i>qPH3</i>, has been fine-mapped to a 600-kb genomic region where three candidate genes are located. These results provide insights into the genetic mechanisms controlling plant architecture and will benefit the selection of ideal plant architecture in maize breeding.</p>

The Conserved and Unique Genetic Architecture of Kernel Size and Weight in Maize and Rice
<p>Maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) is a major staple crop. Maize kernel size and weight are important contributors to its yield. Here, we measured kernel length, kernel width, kernel thickness, hundred kernel weight, and kernel test weight in 10 recombinant inbred <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong> populations and dissected their genetic architecture using three statistical models. In total, 729 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were identified, many of which were identified in all three models, including 22 major QTLs that each can explain more than 10% of phenotypic variation. To provide candidate genes for these QTLs, we identified 30 maize genes that are orthologs of 18 rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) genes reported to affect rice seed size or weight. Interestingly, 24 of these 30 genes are located in the identified QTLs or within 1 Mb of the significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We further confirmed the effects of five genes on maize kernel size/weight in an independent association mapping panel with 540 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s by candidate gene association analysis. Lastly, the function of <i>ZmINCW1</i>, a homolog of rice <i>GRAIN INCOMPLETE FILLING1</i> that affects seed size and weight, was characterized in detail. <i>ZmINCW1</i> is close to QTL peaks for kernel size/weight (less than 1 Mb) and contains significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms affecting kernel size/weight in the association panel. Overexpression of this gene can rescue the reduced weight of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) homozygous mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong> in the <i>AtcwINV2</i> gene (Arabidopsis ortholog of <i>ZmINCW1</i>). These results indicate that the molecular mechanisms affecting seed development are conserved in maize, rice, and possibly Arabidopsis.</p>

Two Glycerol-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases from <i>Chlamydomonas</i> Have Distinct Roles in Lipid Metabolism
<p>The metabolism of glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) is important for environmental stress responses by eukaryotic microalgae. G3P is an essential precursor for glycerolipid synthesis and the accumulation of triacylglycerol (TAG) in response to nutrient starvation. G3P dehydrogenase (GPDH) mediates G3P synthesis, but the roles of specific GPDH isoforms are currently poorly understood. Of the five GPDH enzymes in the model alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, <i>GPD2</i> and <i>GPD3</i> were shown to be induced by nutrient starvation and/or salt stress. Heterologous expression of GPD2, a putative chloroplastic GPDH, and GPD3, a putative cytosolic GPDH, in a yeast <i>gpd1</i>Δ mutant demonstrated the functionality of both enzymes. <i>C. reinhardtii</i> knockdown mutants for <i>GPD2</i> and <i>GPD3</i> showed no difference in growth but displayed significant reduction in TAG concentration compared with the wild type in response to phosphorus or nitrogen starvation. Overexpression of <i>GPD2</i> and <i>GPD3</i> in <i>C. reinhardtii</i> gave distinct phenotypes. <i>GPD2</i> overexpression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s showed only subtle metabolic phenotypes and no significant alteration in growth. In contrast, <i>GPD3</i> overexpression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s displayed significantly inhibited growth and chlorophyll concentration, reduced glycerol concentration, and changes to lipid composition compared with the wild type, including increased abundance of phosphatidic acids but reduced abundance of diglycerides, triglycerides, and phosphatidylglycerol lipids. This may indicate a block in the downstream glycerolipid metabolism pathway in <i>GPD3</i> overexpression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s. Thus, lipid engineering by GPDH modification may depend on the activities of other downstream enzyme steps. These results also suggest that GPD2 and GPD3 GPDH isoforms are important for nutrient starvation-induced TAG accumulation but have distinct metabolic functions.</p>

Two Acyltransferases Contribute Differently to Linolenic Acid Levels in Seed Oil
<p>Acyltransferases are key contributors to triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis and, thus, are of great importance for seed oil quality. The effects of increased or decreased expression of <i>ACYL-COENZYME A:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1</i> (<i>DGAT1</i>) or <i>PHOSPHOLIPID:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE</i> (<i>PDAT</i>) on seed lipid composition were assessed in several <i>Camelina sativa</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s. Furthermore, in vitro assays of acyltransferases in microsomal fractions prepared from developing seeds of some of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s were performed. Decreased expression of <i>DGAT1</i> led to an increased percentage of 18:3<i>n</i>-3 without any change in total lipid content of the seed. The tri-18:3 TAG increase occurred predominantly in the cotyledon, as determined with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry, whereas species with two 18:3<i>n</i>-3 acyl groups were elevated in both cotyledon and embryonal axis. <i>PDAT</i> overexpression led to a relative increase of 18:2<i>n</i>-6 at the expense of 18:3<i>n</i>-3, also without affecting the total lipid content. Differential distributions of TAG species also were observed in different parts of the seed. The microsomal assays revealed that <i>C.</i> <i>sativa</i> seeds have very high activity of diacylglycerol-phosphatidylcho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong> interconversion. The combination of analytical and biochemical data suggests that the higher 18:2<i>n</i>-6 content in the seed oil of the <i>PDAT</i> overexpressors is due to the channeling of fatty acids from phosphatidylcho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong> into TAG before being desaturated to 18:3<i>n</i>-3, caused by the high activity of PDAT in general and by PDAT specificity for 18:2<i>n</i>-6. The higher levels of 18:3<i>n</i>-3 in <i>DGAT1</i>-silencing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>s are likely due to the compensatory activity of a TAG-synthesizing enzyme with specificity for this acyl group and more desaturation of acyl groups occurring on phosphatidylcho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">line</span></strong>.</p>

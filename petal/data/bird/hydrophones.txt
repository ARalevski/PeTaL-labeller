Adaptive sonar call timing supports target tracking in echolocating bats
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Echolocating bats increase production of temporally clustered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sonar</span></strong> calls when tracking targets with unpredictable trajectories, providing evidence that bats control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sonar</span></strong> signal timing for increased spatiotemporal resolution and sensorimotor planning.</p>

Echolocating bats inspect and discriminate landmark features to guide navigation
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> The echolocating bat controls the directional aim and temporal patterning of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sonar</span></strong> calls to inspect and discriminate objects in a spatial navigation task.</p>

Behavioral responses of individual blue whales (<i>Balaenoptera musculus</i>) to mid-frequency military sonar
<p><bold>Highlighted Article:</bold> Controlled exposure experiments using simulated mid-frequency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sonar</span></strong> and pseudo-random noise revealed individual variation in behavioral responses of blue whales. Responses depended on contextual factors, including behavioral state, proximity and prey.</p>

Directionality of nose-emitted echolocation calls from bats without a nose leaf (<i>Plecotus auritus</i>)
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Nose-emitting bats without an obvious means of emitting a narrow bio-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sonar</span></strong> beam still emit a highly directional beam, potentially by emitting sound through the mouth as well as the nostrils.</p>

Lack of behavioural responses of humpback whales (<i>Megaptera novaeangliae</i>) indicate limited effectiveness of sonar mitigation
<p><bold>Highlighted Article:</bold> Variation in behavioural responses of humpback whales limits the effectiveness of a ramp-up procedure used to mitigate physiological effects of naval <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sonar</span></strong> on marine animals.</p>

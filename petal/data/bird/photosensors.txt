Photoelectrical imaging and coherent spin-state readout of single nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond
<p>Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have become an important instrument for quantum sensing and quantum information science. However, the readout of NV spin state requires bulky optical setups, limiting fabrication of miniaturized compact devices for practical use. Here we realized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoelectr</span></strong>ical detection of magnetic resonance as well as Rabi oscillations on a single-defect level. Furthermore, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoelectr</span></strong>ical imaging of individual NV centers at room temperature was demonstrated, surpassing conventional optical readout methods by providing high imaging contrast and signal-to-noise ratio. These results pave the way toward fully integrated quantum diamond devices.</p>

Orientation-dependent stereo Wigner time delay and electron localization in a small molecule
<p>Attosecond metrology of atoms has accessed the time scale of the most fundamental processes in quantum mechanics. Transferring the time-resolved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoelectr</span></strong>ic effect from atoms to molecules considerably increases experimental and theoretical challenges. Here we show that orientation- and energy-resolved measurements characterize the molecular stereo Wigner time delay. This observable provides direct information on the localization of the excited electron wave packet within the molecular potential. Furthermore, we demonstrate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoelectr</span></strong>ons resulting from the dissociative ionization process of the CO molecule are preferentially emitted from the carbon end for dissociative <sup>2</sup>Σ states and from the center and oxygen end for the <sup>2</sup>Π states of the molecular ion. Supported by comprehensive theoretical calculations, this work constitutes a complete spatially and temporally resolved reconstruction of the molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoelectr</span></strong>ic effect.</p>

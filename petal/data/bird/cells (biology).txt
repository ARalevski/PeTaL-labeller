Truncation- and motif-based pan-cancer analysis reveals tumor-suppressing kinases
<p>A major challenge in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> genomics is identifying “driver” <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions from the many neutral “passenger” <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions within a given tumor. To identify driver <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions that would otherwise be lost within <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional noise, we filtered genomic data by motifs that are critical for kinase activity. In the first step of our screen, we used data from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> Line Encyclopedia and The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> Genome Atlas to identify kinases with truncation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions occurring within or before the kinase domain. The top 30 tumor-suppressing kinases were aligned, and hotspots for loss-of-function (LOF) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions were identified on the basis of amino acid conservation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional frequency. The functional consequences of new LOF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions were biochemically validated, and the top 15 hotspot LOF residues were used in a pan-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> analysis to define the tumor-suppressing kinome. A ranked list revealed MAP2K7, an essential mediator of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, as a candidate tumor suppressor in gastric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>, despite its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional frequency falling within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional noise for this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> type. The majority of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in MAP2K7 abolished its catalytic activity, and reactivation of the JNK pathway in gastric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s harboring LOF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in MAP2K7 or the downstream kinase JNK suppressed clonogenicity and growth in soft agar, demonstrating the functional relevance of inactivating the JNK pathway in gastric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>. Together, our data highlight a broadly applicable strategy to identify functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> driver <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions and define the JNK pathway as tumor-suppressive in gastric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>.</p>

CHLOROPLAST RIBOSOME ASSOCIATED Supports Translation under Stress and Interacts with the Ribosomal 30S Subunit
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>es, which originated from cyanobacteria, comprise a large subunit (50S) and a small subunit (30S) containing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>al RNAs (rRNAs) and various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>al proteins. Genes for many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>al proteins, as well as proteins with auxiliary roles in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>e biogenesis or functioning, reside in the nucleus. Here, we identified Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>E ASSOCIATED (CRASS), a member of the latter class of proteins, based on the tight coexpression of its mRNA with transcripts for nucleus-encoded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>al proteins. CRASS was acquired during the evolution of embryophytes and is localized to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> stroma. Loss of CRASS results in minor defects in development, photosynthetic efficiency, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> translation activity under controlled growth conditions, but these phenotypes are greatly exacerbated under stress conditions induced by the translational inhibitors lincomycin and chloramphenicol or by cold treatment. The CRASS protein comigrates with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>al particles and coimmunoprecipitates with the 16S rRNA and several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>al proteins, particularly the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>al proteins of the 30S subunit (PRPS1 and PRPS5). The association of CRASS with PRPS1 and PRPS5 is independent of rRNA and is not detectable in yeast two-hybrid experiments, implying that either CRASS interacts indirectly with PRPS1 and PRPS5 via another component of the small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>al subunit or that it recognizes structural features of the multiprotein/rRNA particle. CRASS plays a role in the biogenesis and/or stability of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>e that becomes critical under certain stressful conditions when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>al activity is compromised.</p>

Intercellular transmission of the unfolded protein response promotes survival and drug resistance in cancer cells
<p>Increased protein translation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s and various factors in the tumor microenvironment can induce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">endoplasmic reticulum</span></strong> (ER) stress, which initiates the unfolded protein response (UPR). We have previously reported that factors released from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s mounting a UPR induce a de novo UPR in bone marrow–derived myeloid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">macrophag</span></strong>es, and dendritic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s that facilitates protumorigenic characteristics in culture and tumor growth in vivo. We investigated whether this inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular signaling, which we have termed transmissible ER stress (TERS), also operates between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s and what its functional consequences were within the tumor. We found that TERS signaling induced a UPR in recipient human prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s that included the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> surface expression of the chaperone GRP78. TERS also activated Wnt signaling in recipient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s and enhanced resistance to nutrient starvation and common chemotherapies such as the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib and the microtubule inhibitor paclitaxel. TERS-induced activation of Wnt signaling required the UPR kinase and endonuclease IRE1. However, TERS-induced enhancement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> survival was predominantly mediated by the UPR kinase PERK and a reduction in the abundance of the transcription factor ATF4, which prevented the activation of the transcription factor CHOP and, consequently, the induction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apoptosi</span></strong>s. When implanted in mice, TERS-primed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s gave rise to faster growing tumors than did vehicle-primed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. Collectively, our data demonstrate that TERS is a mechanism of inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular communication through which tumor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s can adapt to stressful environments.</p>

Myosin IIA deficient cells migrate efficiently despite reduced traction forces at cell periphery
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> motility is a cornerstone of embryogenesis, tissue remodeling and repair, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> invasion. It is generally thought that migrating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s grab and exert traction force onto the extra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular matrix in order to pull the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> body forward. While previous studies have shown that myosin II deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s migrate efficiently, whether these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s exert traction forces during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> migration in the absence of the major contractile machinery is currently unknown. Using an array of micron-sized pillars as a force sensor and shRNA specific to each myosin II isoform (A and B), we analyzed how myosin IIA and IIB individually regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> migration and traction force generation. Myosin IIA and IIB localized preferentially to the leading edge where traction force was greatest, and the trailing edge, respectively. When individual myosin II isoforms were depleted by shRNA, myosin IIA deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s lost actin stress fibers and focal adhesions, whereas myosin IIB deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s maintained similar actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ization and focal adhesions as wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. Interestingly, myosin IIA deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s migrated faster than wild-type or myosin IIB deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s on both a rigid surface and a pillar array, yet myosin IIA deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s exerted significantly less traction force at the leading edge than wild-type or myosin IIB deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. These results suggest that, in the absence of myosin IIA mediated force-generating machinery, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s move with minimal traction forces at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> periphery, thus demonstrating the remarkable ability of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s to adapt and migrate.</p>

TSLP signaling in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells programs a pathogenic T helper 2 cell state
<p>Pathogenic T helper 2 (T<sub>H</sub>2) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, which produce increased amounts of the cytokines <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interleukin</span></strong>-5 (IL-5) and IL-13, promote allergic disorders, including asthma. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), a cytokine secreted by epithelial and innate immune <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, stimulates such pathogenic T<sub>H</sub>2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> responses. We found that TSLP signaling in mouse CD4<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s initiated transcriptional changes associated with T<sub>H</sub>2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> programming. IL-4 signaling amplified and stabilized the genomic response of T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s to TSLP, which increased the frequency of T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s producing IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. Furthermore, the TSLP- and IL-4–programmed T<sub>H</sub>2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s had a pathogenic phenotype, producing greater amounts of IL-5 and IL-13 and other proinflammatory cytokines than did T<sub>H</sub>2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s stimulated with IL-4 alone. TSLP-mediated T<sub>H</sub>2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> induction involved distinct molecular pathways, including activation of the transcription factor STAT5 through the kinase JAK2 and repression of the transcription factor BCL6. Mice that received wild-type CD4<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s had exacerbated pathogenic T<sub>H</sub>2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> responses upon exposure to house dust mites compared to mice that received TSLP receptor–deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s.

Compared to healthy controls, asthmatic children showed enhancement of such T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> responses in peripheral blood. Our data support a sequential cytokine model for pathogenic T<sub>H</sub>2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> differentiation and provide a mechanistic basis for the therapeutic targeting of TSLP signaling in human allergic diseases.</p>

IL-2Rβ abundance differentially tunes IL-2 signaling dynamics in CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells
<p>Interleukin-2 (IL-2) stimulates both activated CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s to proliferate. IL-2 signals through an identical receptor complex and promotes the same dose-dependent phosphorylation of the canonical transcription factor STAT5 in both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> types. Despite this, CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s enter the S phase earlier and proliferate to a greater extent than do CD4<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s in response to IL-2. We identified distinct IL-2 signaling dynamics in CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. In IL-2–stimulated CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, STAT5 phosphorylation increased rapidly and was sustained for 6 hours. In contrast, CD4<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s had a biphasic response, with maxima at 15 min and 2 to 4 hours after stimulation. Both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> types required vesicular trafficking, but only CD4<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s required new protein synthesis to maintain high phosphorylation of STAT5. Two subunits of the IL-2 receptor, IL-2Rβ and IL-2Rγ, were twice as abundant in CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s than in CD4<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. Reduction of IL-2Rβ abundance by 50% was sufficient to convert CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s to a CD4<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>–like signaling pattern and delay S phase entry. These results suggest that the larger pool of IL-2Rβ chains in CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s is required to sustain IL-2 signaling and contributes to the quantitatively greater proliferative response to IL-2 relative to that of CD4<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> type–specific difference in IL-2Rβ abundance appears to tune responses, potentially preventing extensive, autoimmune proliferation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, while still enabling sufficient proliferation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s to control viral infections.</p>

The paradox of mutations and cancer
<p>The past decade has witnessed the cataloging of genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> genomes, providing new insights into how and in what ways <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> can develop and spread (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). The focus has been on defining specific “driver” <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions, genetic errors in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s that reveal basic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical processes gone awry that are required for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> initiation and progression. These drivers are the target of new therapies—this concept is central to precision oncology efforts to treat patients according to the genetic changes that are present in their tumors (<i>3</i>). Along the way, it has also become apparent that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> genomes harbor many additional “passenger” <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions (<i>4</i>). Patterns of driver and passenger DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions derived from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> genomes have provided clues about the different ways that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> can manifest as a disease of genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions (<i>5</i>, <i>6</i>). In some circumstances, they can be linked to strong environmental carcinogens (for example, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion patterns caused by tobacco smoke, ultraviolet radiation, or the fungal toxin aflatoxin) (<i>7</i>). Moreover, these forensic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional patterns can be used to estimate how long it has taken for a tumor to develop (<i>5</i>). On page 911 of this issue, Martincorena <i>et al.</i> (<i>8</i>) turned their attention toward the detection of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in normal tissue, addressing a long-standing paradox that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions arise in normal tissues but do not necessarily lead to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>.</p>

Selective Elimination of Membrane-Damaged Chloroplasts via Microautophagy
<p>Plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s constantly accumulate damage caused by visible wavelengths of light during photosynthesis. Our previous study revealed that entire photodamaged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s are subjected to vacuolar digestion through an autophagy process termed chlorophagy; however, how this process is induced and executed remained poorly understood. In this study, we monitored intra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular induction of chlorophagy in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves and found that mesophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s damaged by high visible light displayed abnormal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s with a swollen shape and 2.5 times the volume of normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s. In wild-type plants, the activation of chlorophagy decreased the number of swollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s. In the autophagy-deficient <i>autophagy</i> mutants, the swollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s persisted, and dysfunctional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s that had lost <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l fluorescence accumulated in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong>. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> swelling and subsequent induction of chlorophagy were suppressed by the application of exogenous mannitol to increase the osmotic pressure outside <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s or by overexpression of VESICLE INDUCING PROTEIN IN PLASTID1, which maintains <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> envelope integrity. Microscopic observations of autophagy-related membranes showed that swollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s were partly surrounded by autophagosomal structures and were engulfed directly by the tonoplast, as in microautophagy. Our results indicate that an elevation in osmotic potential inside the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> due to high visible light-derived envelope damage results in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> swelling and serves as an induction factor for chlorophagy, and this process mobilizes entire <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s via tonoplast-mediated sequestering to avoid the cytosolic accumulation of dysfunctional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s.</p>

Here, we report that the extra <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e is a ring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e termed extra circular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e carrying amplified <i>EPSPS</i> (ECCAE). The ECCAE is heterochromatic, harbors four major <i>EPSPS</i> amplified foci, and is sexually transmitted to 35% of the progeny. Two highly glyphosate resistant (HGR) <i>A. tuberculatus</i> plants with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e constitution of 2n = 32+1 ECCAE displayed soma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> heterogeneity. Some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s had secondary ECCAEs, which displayed size polymorphisms and produced novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>al variants with multiple gene amplification foci. We hypothesize that the ECCAE in the soma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s of HGR <i>A. tuberculatus</i> plants underwent breakage-fusion-bridge cycles to generate the observed soma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> heterogeneity, including de novo <i>EPSPS</i> gene integration into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es. Resistant soma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s with stable <i>EPSPS</i> amplification events as de novo insertions into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es may survive glyphosate selection pressure during the sporophytic phase and are plausibly transmitted to germ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s leading to durable glyphosate resistance in <i>A. tuberculatus</i>. This is the first report of early events in aneuploidy-triggered de novo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e integration by an as yet unknown mechanism, which may drive rapid adaptive evolution of herbicide resistance in common waterhemp.</p>

The Rubisco Chaperone BSD2 May Regulate Chloroplast Coverage in Maize Bundle Sheath Cells
<p>In maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), Bundle Sheath Defective2 (BSD2) plays an essential role in Rubisco biogenesis and is required for correct bundle sheath (BS) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> differentiation. Yet, BSD2 RNA and protein levels are similar in mesophyll (M) and BS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s, although Rubisco accumulates only in BS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s. This raises the possibility of additional BSD2 roles in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> development. To test this hypothesis, transgenic lines were created that overexpress and underexpress BSD2 in both BS and M <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, driven by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> type-specific Rubisco Small Subunit (RBCS) or Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxylase (PEPC) promoters or the ubiquitin promoter. Genetic crosses showed that each of the transgenes could complement Rubisco deficiency and seedling lethality conferred by the <i>bsd2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion. This was unexpected, as RBCS-BSD2 lines lacked BSD2 in M <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s and PEPC-BSD2 lines expressed half the wild-type BSD2 level in BS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s. We conclude that BSD2 does not play a vital role in M <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s and that BS BSD2 is in excess of requirements for Rubisco accumulation. BSD2 levels did affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> coverage in BS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. In PEPC-BSD2 lines, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> coverage decreased 30% to 50%, whereas lines with increased BSD2 content exhibited a 25% increase. This suggests that BSD2 has an ancillary role in BS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s related to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> size. Gas exchange showed decreased photosynthetic rates in PEPC-BSD2 lines despite restored Rubisco function, correlating with reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> coverage and pointing to CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion changes. Conversely, increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> coverage did not result in increased Rubisco abundance or photosynthetic rates. This suggests another limitation beyond <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> volume, most likely Rubisco biogenesis and/or turnover rates.</p>

Cytoskeletal adaptivity regulates T cell receptor signaling
<p>The factors that govern T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> activation control the initiation and progression of adaptive immune responses. T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s recognize their cognate antigen on the surface of antigen-presenting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s (APCs) through the T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> receptor, which results in the formation of a contact region (immune synapse) between the two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s and the activation of the T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. Activated T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s proliferate and differentiate into effector T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s that secrete cytokines, provide help to B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, and kill target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. We asked whether the actin cytoskeleton governs differences in signaling in effector T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s versus naive (unstimulated) T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. Using atomic force microscopy and quantitative confocal microscopy, we found that naive T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s had a mechanically stiffer cortical cytoskeleton than that of effector <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, which resulted in naive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s forming smaller immune synapses with APCs. This suggests that the cytoskeletal stiffness of the T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> before it undergoes antigen stimulation predicts its subsequent dynamic engagement with APCs and its activation potential. Cytoskeletal rigidity depended on the activity of the actin-severing enzyme cofilin through a pathway requiring the small guanosine triphosphatase RhoA and the kinases ROCK (Rho-activated kinase) and LIMK. These findings suggest that the baseline cytoskeletal state controls T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> responses and that the underlying pathway could be a therapeutic target for modulating adaptive immunity.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Reassessing the Roles of PIN Proteins and Anticlinal Microtubules during Pavement Cell Morphogenesis
<p>The leaf epidermis is a biomechanical shell that influences the size and shape of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>. Its morphogenesis is a multiscale process in which nanometer-scale cytoskeletal protein complexes, individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, and groups of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s pattern growth and define macroscopic leaf traits. Interdigitated growth of neighboring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s is an evolutionarily conserved developmental strategy. Understanding how signaling pathways and cytoskeletal proteins pattern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> walls during this form of tissue morphogenesis is an important research challenge. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular and molecular control of a lobed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> morphology is currently thought to involve PIN-FORMED (PIN)-type plasma membrane efflux carriers that generate sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular auxin gradients. Auxin gradients were proposed to function across <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> boundaries to encode stable offset patterns of cortical microtubules and actin filaments between adjacent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. Many models suggest that long-lived microtubules along the anticlinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> wall generate local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> wall heterogeneities that restrict local growth and specify the timing and location of lobe formation. Here, we used Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) reverse genetics and multivariate long-term time-lapse imaging to test current <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> shape control models. We found that neither PIN proteins nor long-lived microtubules along the anticlinal wall predict the patterns of lobe formation. In fields of lobing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, anticlinal microtubules are not correlated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> shape and are unstable at the time scales of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> expansion. Our analyses indicate that anticlinal microtubules have multiple functions in pavement <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s and that lobe initiation is likely controlled by complex interactions among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> geometry, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> wall stress patterns, and transient microtubule networks that span the anticlinal and periclinal walls.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Old but Not (So) Degenerated—Slow Evolution of Largely Homomorphic Sex Chromosomes in Ratites
<p>Degeneration of the nonrecombining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e is a common feature of sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e evolution, readily evident by the presence of a pair of largely heteromorphic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es, like in eutherian mammals and birds. However, in ratites (order Palaeognathae, including, e.g., ostrich), the Z and W <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es are similar in size and largely undifferentiated, despite avian sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e evolution was initiated > 130 Ma. To better understand what may limit sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e evolution, we performed ostrich transcriptome sequencing and studied genes from the nonrecombining region of the W <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e. Fourteen gametologous gene pairs present on the W <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e and Z <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e were identified, with synonymous sequence divergence of 0.027–0.177. The location of these genes on the Z <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e was consistent with a sequential increase in divergence, starting 110–157 and ending 24–30 Ma. On the basis of the occurrence of Z-linked genes hemizygous in females, we estimate that about one-third of the Z <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e does not recombine with the W <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e in female meiosis. Pairwise <i>d</i><sub>N</sub><i>/d</i><sub>S</sub> between gametologs decreased with age, suggesting strong evolutionary constraint in old gametologs. Lineage-specific <i>d</i><sub>N</sub><i>/d</i><sub>S</sub> was consistently higher in W-linked genes, in accordance with the lower efficacy of selection expected in nonrecombining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es. A higher ratio of GC > AT:AT > GC substitutions in W-linked genes supports a role for GC-biased gene conversion in differentially driving base composition on the two sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es. A male-to-female (M:F) expression ratio of close to one for recombining genes and close to two for Z-linked genes lacking a W copy show that dosage compensation is essentially absent. Some gametologous genes have retained active expression of the W copy in females (giving a M:F ratio of 1 for the gametologous gene pair), whereas for others W expression has become severely reduced resulting in a M:F ratio of close to 2. These observations resemble the patterns of sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e evolution seen in other avian and mammalian lineages, suggesting similar underlying evolutionary processes, although the rate of sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e differentiation has been atypically low. Lack of dosage compensation may be a factor hindering sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e evolution in this lineage.</p>

A dynamic cell adhesion surface regulates tissue architecture in growth plate cartilage
<p>The architecture and morphogenetic properties of tissues are founded in the tissue-specific regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> behaviors. In endochondral bones, the growth plate cartilage promotes bone elongation via regulated chondrocyte maturation within an ordered, three-dimensional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> array. A key event in the process that generates this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> array is the transformation of disordered resting chondrocytes into clonal columns of discoid proliferative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s aligned with the primary growth vector. Previous analysis showed that column-forming chondrocytes display planar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> divisions, and the resulting daughter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s rearrange by ∼90° to align with the lengthening column. However, these previous studies provided limited information about the mechanisms underlying this dynamic process. Here we present new mechanistic insights generated by application of a novel time-lapse confocal microscopy method along with immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. We show that, during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> division, daughter chondrocytes establish a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> adhesion surface enriched in cadherins and β-catenin. Rearrangement into columns occurs concomitant with expansion of this adhesion surface in a process more similar to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> spreading than to migration. Column formation requires <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> adhesion, as reducing cadherin binding via chelation of extra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular calcium inhibits chondrocyte rearrangement. Importantly, physical indicators of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> polarity, such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> body alignment, are not prerequisites for oriented <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> behavior. Our results support a model in which regulation of adhesive surface dynamics and cortical tension by extrinsic signaling modifies the thermodynamic landscape to promote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ization of daughter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s in the context of the three-dimensional growth plate tissue.</p>

We used genetic approaches to study the contribution of mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) to MVD in this model. Specifically, we generated K/B.g7 mice in which either CX3CR1 or CD301b/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">macrophag</span></strong>e galactose <i>N</i>-acetylgalactosamine–specific lectin 2 (MGL2)–expressing MNPs were ablated. Using K/B.g7 mice expressing <i>Cx3Cr1</i>-Cre, we conditionally deleted critical inflammatory molecules from MNPs, including the Fc-receptor signal-transducing tyrosine kinase Syk and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> adhesion molecule very late antigen–4. We performed complementary studies using monoclonal antibodies to block key inflammatory molecules. We generated bone marrow chimeric mice to define the origin of the inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s present in the MV and to determine which valve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s respond to the proinflammatory cytokine tumor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">necrosi</span></strong>s factor (TNF).

K/B.g7 mice lacking CX3CR1 or in which CD301b/MGL2-expressing MNPs were ablated were protected from MVD.

A TGFβ–miR-182–BRCA1 axis controls the mammary differentiation hierarchy
<p>Maintenance of mammary functional capacity during cycles of proliferation and regression depends on appropriate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> fate decisions of mammary progenitor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s to populate an epithelium consisting of secretory luminal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s and contractile myoepithelial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. It is well established that transforming growth factor–β (TGFβ) restricts mammary epithelial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> proliferation and that sensitivity to TGFβ is decreased in breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>. We show that TGFβ also exerts control of mammary progenitor self-renewal and lineage commitment decisions by stringent regulation of breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> associated 1 (BRCA1), which controls <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stem cel</span></strong>l self-renewal and lineage commitment.

Ectopic expression of BRCA1 or antagonism of miR-182 in cultured TGFβ-deficient mammary epithelial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s restored luminal lineage commitment. These findings reveal that TGFβ modulation of BRCA1 directs mammary epithelial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> fate and, because stem or progenitor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s are thought to be the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> of origin for aggressive breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> subtypes, suggest that TGFβ dysregulation during tumorigenesis may promote distinct breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> subtypes.</p>

<p>Upon antigen recognition within peripheral lymphoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>s, B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s interact with T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s and other immune <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s to transiently form morphological structures called germinal centers (GCs), which are required for B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> clonal expansion, immunoglobulin class switching, and affinity maturation. This process, known as the GC response, is an energetically demanding process that requires the metabolic reprogramming of B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. We showed that the Ras-related guanosine triphosphate hydrolase (GTPase) R-Ras2 (also known as TC21) plays an essential, nonredundant, and B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>–intrinsic role in the GC response. Both the conversion of B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s into GC B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s and their expansion were impaired in mice lacking R-Ras2, but not in those lacking a highly related R-Ras subfamily member or both the classic H-Ras and N-Ras GTPases. In the absence of R-Ras2, activated B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s did not exhibit increased oxidative phosphorylation or aerobic glycolysis. We showed that R-Ras2 was an effector of both the B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> receptor (BCR) and CD40 and that, in its absence, B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s exhibited impaired activation of the PI3K-Akt-mTORC1 pathway, reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitochondria</span></strong>l DNA replication, and decreased expression of genes involved in glucose metabolism. Because most human B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> lymphomas originate from GC B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s or B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s that have undergone the GC response, our data suggest that R-Ras2 may also regulate metabolism in B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> malignancies.</p>

Educated natural killer cells show dynamic movement of the activating receptor NKp46 and confinement of the inhibitory receptor Ly49A
<p>Educated natural killer (NK) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s have inhibitory receptors specific for self major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules and kill <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s more efficiently than do NK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s that do not have such receptors (hyporesponsive NK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s). The mechanism behind this functional empowerment through education has so far not been fully described. In addition, distinctive phenotypic markers of educated NK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s at the single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> level are lacking. We developed a refined version of the image mean square displacement (iMSD) method (called iMSD carpet analysis) and used it in combination with single-particle tracking to characterize the dynamics of the activating receptor NKp46 and the inhibitory receptor Ly49A on resting educated versus hyporesponsive murine NK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. Most of the NKp46 and Ly49A molecules were restricted to microdomains; however, individual NKp46 molecules resided in these domains for shorter periods and diffused faster on the surface of educated, compared to hyporesponsive, NK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. In contrast, the movement of Ly49A was more constrained in educated NK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s compared to hyporesponsive NK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. Either disrupting the actin cytoskeleton or adding cholesterol to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s prohibited activating signaling, suggesting that the dynamics of receptor movements within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> membrane are critical for the proper activation of NK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. The faster and more dynamic movement of NKp46 in educated NK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s may facilitate a swifter response to interactions with target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s.</p>

Tim-3 signaling in peripheral NK cells promotes maternal-fetal immune tolerance and alleviates pregnancy loss
<p>Pregnancy loss occurs in about 15% of clinically recognized pregnancies, and defective maternal-fetal immune tolerance contributes to more than 50% of these events. We found that signaling by the type I membrane protein T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> immunoglobulin and mucin-containing protein 3 (Tim-3) in natural killer (NK) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s had an essential protective role during early pregnancy. Tim-3 on peripheral NK (pNK) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s was transiently increased in abundance during the first trimester of pregnancy, which depended on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interleukin</span></strong>-4 (IL-4)–signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) and progesterone signaling. Tim-3<sup>+</sup> pNK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s displayed immunosuppressive activities, including the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines and the induction of regulatory T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s (T<sub>regs</sub>) in a transforming growth factor–β1 (TGF-β1)–dependent manner. Tim-3 on pNK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s was stimulated by its ligand galectin-9 (Gal-9), leading to signaling by the kinases c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and AKT. In recurrent miscarriage (RM) patients, Tim-3 abundance on pNK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s was reduced and the immunosuppressive activity of Tim-3<sup>+</sup> pNK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s was impaired. Compared to Tim-3<sup>+</sup> pNK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s from donors with normal pregnancies, RM patient Tim-3<sup>+</sup> pNK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s exhibited changes in DNA accessibility in certain genetic loci, which were reversed by inhibiting accessible chromatin reader proteins. Furthermore, Tim-3<sup>+</sup> pNK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, but not Tim-3<sup>−</sup> pNK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, reduced fetal loss in abortion-prone and NK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>–deficient mice. Together, our findings reveal a critical role for Tim-3–Gal-9 signaling–mediated immunoregulation by pNK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s in maternal-fetal immune tolerance and suggest that Tim-3 abundance on pNK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s is a potential biomarker for RM diagnosis.</p>

The conformational state of hERG1 channels determines integrin association, downstream signaling, and cancer progression
<p>Ion channels regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> proliferation, differentiation, and migration in normal and neoplastic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>–extra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular matrix (ECM) transmembrane receptors called integrins. K<sup>+</sup> flux through the human ether-à-go-go–related gene 1 (hERG1) channel shapes action potential firing in excitable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s such as cardiomyocytes. Its abundance is often aberrantly high in tumors, where it modulates integrin-mediated signaling. We found that hERG1 interacted with the β<sub>1</sub> integrin subunit at the plasma membrane of human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. This interaction was not detected in cardiomyocytes because of the presence of the hERG1 auxiliary subunit KCNE1 (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily E regulatory subunit 1), which blocked the β<sub>1</sub> integrin–hERG1 interaction. Although open hERG1 channels did not interact as strongly with β<sub>1</sub> integrins as did closed channels, current flow through hERG1 channels was necessary to activate the integrin-dependent phosphorylation of Tyr<sup>397</sup> in focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in both normal and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. In immunodeficient mice, proliferation was inhibited in breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s expressing forms of hERG1 with impaired K<sup>+</sup> flow, whereas metastasis of breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s was reduced when the hERG1/β<sub>1</sub> integrin interaction was disrupted. We conclude that the interaction of β<sub>1</sub> integrins with hERG1 channels in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s stimulated distinct signaling pathways that depended on the conformational state of hERG1 and affected different aspects of tumor progression.</p>

Plasticity in the Neurotransmitter Repertoire
<p>In the earliest days of neuroscience, it was thought that a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> made and released only a single chemical, known as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>er, to send a signal across a synapse to an adjacent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> (<i>1</i>). At the same time, it was deeply mysterious why so many signaling molecules were used in nervous systems. Subsequently, it became clear that many, if not most, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s (including those in mammals) make and release two or more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>ers including small-molecules and neuropeptides (<i>2</i>–<i>4</i>). As the list of these potential cotransmitters and their receptors has increased, we are faced with understanding the functional relevance of this embarrassment of riches for neural circuits and behavior. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>ers and neuromodulators (substances often released with small-molecule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>ers) can elicit a variety of different actions on their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> targets, including directly opening ion channels or acting through signal transduction pathways to alter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al excitability or synaptic transmission. Thus, characterizing the mixture of cotransmitters released by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong> is important for understanding how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>al circuits operate. The mechanisms that change the profile of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>er release provide opportunities for plastic changes in circuit function, and consequently in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ism behavior. On page 449 of this issue, Dulcis <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) report changes in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>er profile of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s that underlie photoperiod-triggered changes in animal behavior. The findings argue that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>er switching is a new mechanism for neuroplasticity (<i>6</i>) in adult nervous systems.</p>

Stage-Specific Gene Profiling of Germinal Cells Helps Delineate the Mitosis/Meiosis Transition
<p>In flowering plants, germ lines are induced from somatic meristems within reproductive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>s. Within anthers, germinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> initials first undergo several rounds of mitotic proliferation before synchronously entering meiosis. Our understanding of the progression and the molecular basis of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s to meiosis transition is still limited. Taking advantage of the correlation between anther length and premeiotic germinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> development in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), we studied the transcriptome dynamics of germinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s at three sequential stages, mitotic archesporial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, enlarging pollen mother <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s at the premeiosis interphase, and pollen mother <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s at the early prophase of meiosis, using laser microdissection-based expression profiling. Our analysis showed that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s undergoing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s-meiosis switch exhibit robust transcriptional changes. The three stages are distinguished by the expression of genes encoding transcription factor subsets, meiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e recombination proteins, and distinct E3 ubiquitin ligases, respectively. The transcription level of genes encoding protein turnover machinery was significantly higher in these three stages of germinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s than in mature pollen, parenchyma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, or seedlings. Our experimental results further indicate that many meiotic genes are not only transcribed, but also translated prior to meiosis. We suggest that the enlarging pollen mother <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s stage represents a crucial turning point from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s to meiosis for developing germinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s.</p>

Cell-Fate Specification in Arabidopsis Roots Requires Coordinative Action of Lineage Instruction and Positional Reprogramming
<p>Tissue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ization and pattern formation within a multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ism rely on coordinated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> division and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>-fate determination. In animals, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> fates are mainly determined by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> lineage-dependent mechanism, whereas in plants, positional information is thought to be the primary determinant of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> fates. However, our understanding of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>-fate regulation in plants mostly relies on the histological and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anatomi</span></strong>cal studies on Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) roots, which contain a single layer of each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> type in nonvascular tissues. Here, we investigate the dynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>-fate acquisition in modified Arabidopsis roots with additional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> layers that are artificially generated by the misexpression of <i>SHORT-ROOT</i> (<i>SHR</i>). We found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>-fate determination in Arabidopsis roots is a dimorphic cascade with lineage inheritance dominant in the early stage of pattern formation. The inherited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> identity can subsequently be removed or modified by positional information. The instruction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>-fate conversion is not a fast readout during root development. The final identity of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> type is determined by the synergistic contribution from multiple layers of regulation, including symplastic communication across tissues. Our findings underline the collaborative inputs during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>-fate instruction.</p>

Importance of Translocon Subunit Tic56 for rRNA Processing and Chloroplast Ribosome Assembly
<p>Toc159-containing complexes at the outer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> envelope membrane form stable supercomplexes with a 1-MD translocon at the inner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> envelope membrane of which Tic56 is one essential subunit. While the single mutants <i>tic56-1</i> and <i>ppi2</i> (<i>toc159</i>) have an albino phenotype and are able to grow heterotrophically, we find the double mutant to be embryo lethal. Comprehensive quantitative proteome profiling with both single mutants in combination with GeneChip analyses identified a posttranscriptional defect in the accumulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>al proteins and diminished expression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> encoded proteins. In the <i>tic56-1</i> mutant, the assembly of functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>es is furthermore hampered by a processing defect of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> 23S rRNA. Spectinomycin-treatment of wild-type plants phenocopies the molecular phenotype of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> proteome accumulation in <i>tic56-1</i> and to a smaller degree also <i>ppi2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>s, suggesting that a defect in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> translation is largely responsible for the phenotype of both import mutants. Import experiments with the <i>tic56-3</i> mutant revealed no significant defect in the import of small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>al protein 16 in the absence of full-length Tic56, suggesting that the defect in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>e assembly in <i>tic56-1</i> may be independent of a function of Tic56 in protein import. Our data establish a previously unknown link between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> protein import, the processing of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> rRNAs, and the assembly of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>es and provide further knowledge on the function of the translocon components and the molecular basis for their albino phenotype.</p>

CD73 on T Cells Orchestrates Cardiac Wound Healing After Myocardial Infarction by Purinergic Metabolic Reprogramming
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s are required for proper healing after myocardial infarction. The mechanism of their beneficial action, however, is unknown. The proinflammatory danger signal ATP, released from damaged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, is degraded by the ectonucleotidases CD39 and CD73 to the anti-inflammatory mediator adenosine. Here, we investigate the contribution of CD73-derived adenosine produced by T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s to cardiac remodeling after ischemia/reperfusion and define its mechanism of action.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Myocardial ischemia (50 minutes followed by reperfusion) was induced in global CD73<sup>−/−</sup> and CD4-CD73<sup>−</sup><sup>/−</sup> mice. Tissue injury, T-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> purinergic signaling, cytokines, and cardiac function (magnetic resonance tomography at 9.4 T over 4 weeks) were analyzed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Changes in functional parameters of CD4-CD73<sup>−/−</sup> mice were identical to those in global CD73 knockouts (KOs). T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s infiltrating the injured heart significantly upregulated at the gene (quantitative polymerase chain reaction) and protein (enzymatic activity) levels critical transporters and enzymes (connexin43, connexin37, pannexin-1, equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1, CD39, CD73, ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterases 1 and 3, CD157, CD38) for the accelerated release and hydrolysis of ATP, cAMP, AMP, and NAD to adenosine. It is surprising that a lack of CD39 on T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s (from CD39<sup>−/−</sup> mice) did not alter ATP hydrolysis and very likely involves pyrophosphatases (ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterases 1 and 3). Circulating T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s predominantly expressed A<sub>2a</sub> receptor (A<sub>2a</sub>R) transcripts. After myocardial infarction, A<sub>2b</sub> receptor (A<sub>2b</sub>R) transcription was induced in both T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s and myeloid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s in the heart. Thus, A<sub>2a</sub>R and A<sub>2b</sub>R signaling may contribute to myocardial responses after myocardial infarction. In the case of T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, this was associated with an accelerated secretion of proinflammatory and profibrotic cytokines (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interleukin</span></strong>-2, interferon-γ, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interleukin</span></strong>-17) when CD73 was lacking. Cytokine production by T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s from peripheral lymph nodes was inhibited by A<sub>2a</sub>R activation (CGS-21680). The A<sub>2b</sub>R agonist BAY 60-6583 showed off-target effects. The adenosine receptor agonist NECA inhibited interferon-γ and stimulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interleukin</span></strong>-6 production, each of which was antagonized by a specific A<sub>2b</sub>R antagonist (PSB-603).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This work demonstrates that CD73 on T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s plays a crucial role in the cardiac wound healing process after myocardial infarction.

A defect in KCa3.1 channel activity limits the ability of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from cancer patients to infiltrate an adenosine-rich microenvironment
<p>The limited ability of cytotoxic T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s to infiltrate solid tumors hampers immune surveillance and the efficacy of immunotherapies in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>. Adenosine accumulates in solid tumors and inhibits tumor-specific T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. Adenosine inhibits T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> motility through the A<sub>2A</sub> receptor (A<sub>2A</sub>R) and suppression of KCa3.1 channels. We conducted three-dimensional chemotaxis experiments to elucidate the effect of adenosine on the migration of peripheral blood CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s from head and neck squamous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> carcinoma (HNSCC) patients. The chemotaxis of HNSCC CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s was reduced in the presence of adenosine, and the effect was greater on HNSCC CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s than on healthy donor (HD) CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. This response correlated with the inability of CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s to infiltrate tumors. The effect of adenosine was mimicked by an A<sub>2A</sub>R agonist and prevented by an A<sub>2A</sub>R antagonist. We found no differences in A<sub>2A</sub>R expression, 3′,5′-cyclic adenosine monophosphate abundance, or protein kinase A type 1 activity between HNSCC and HD CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. We instead detected a decrease in KCa3.1 channel activity, but not expression, in HNSCC CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. Activation of KCa3.1 channels by 1-EBIO restored the ability of HNSCC CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s to chemotax in the presence of adenosine. Our data highlight the mechanism underlying the increased sensitivity of HNSCC CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s to adenosine and the potential therapeutic benefit of KCa3.1 channel activators, which could increase infiltration of these T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s into tumors.</p>

Blockade of surface-bound TGF-β on regulatory T cells abrogates suppression of effector T cell function in the tumor microenvironment
<p>Regulatory T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s (T<sub>regs</sub>) suppress antitumor immunity by inhibiting the killing of tumor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s by antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. To better understand the mechanisms involved, we used ex vivo three-dimensional collagen-fibrin gel cultures of dissociated B16 melanoma tumors. This system recapitulated the in vivo suppression of antimelanoma immunity, rendering the dissociated tumor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s resistant to killing by cocultured activated, antigen-specific T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. Immunosuppression was not observed when tumors excised from T<sub>reg</sub>-depleted mice were cultured in this system. Experiments with neutralizing antibodies showed that blocking transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) also prevented immunosuppression. Immunosuppression depended on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> contact or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular proximity because soluble factors from the collagen-fibrin gel cultures did not inhibit tumor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> killing by T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. Moreover, intravital, two-photon microscopy showed that tumor-specific Pmel-1 effector T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s physically interacted with tumor-resident T<sub>regs</sub> in mice. T<sub>regs</sub> isolated from B16 tumors alone were sufficient to suppress CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>–mediated killing, which depended on surface-bound TGF-β on the T<sub>regs</sub>. Immunosuppression of CD8<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s correlated with a decrease in the abundance of the cytolytic protein granzyme B and an increase in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> surface amount of the immune checkpoint receptor programmed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> death protein 1 (PD-1). These findings suggest that contact between T<sub>regs</sub> and antitumor T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s in the tumor microenvironment inhibits antimelanoma immunity in a TGF-β–dependent manner and highlight potential ways to inhibit intratumoral T<sub>regs</sub> therapeutically.</p>

We focused on the dynamics of the tumor suppressor protein p53, which regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> cycle arrest and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apoptosi</span></strong>s in response to DNA damage. We established live-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> reporters for 12 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> lines expressing wild-type p53 and quantified p53 dynamics in response to double-strand break–inducing DNA damage. In many of the tested <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> lines, we found that p53 abundance oscillated in response to ionizing radiation or the DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic neocarzinostatin and that the periodicity of the oscillations was fixed. In other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> lines, p53 abundance dynamically changed in different ways, such as a single broad pulse or a continuous induction. By combining single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> assays of p53 signaling dynamics, small-molecule screening in live <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, and mathematical modeling, we identified molecules that perturbed p53 dynamics and determined that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>-specific variation in the efficiency of DNA repair and the activity of the kinase ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ed) controlled the signaling landscape of p53 dynamics. Because the dynamics of wild-type p53 varied substantially between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> lines, our study highlights the limitation of using one line as a model system and emphasizes the importance of studying the dynamics of other signaling pathways across different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> lines and genetic backgrounds.</p>

Supracellular contractions propel migration
<p>Constructing multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular bodies, starting from a single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> zygote, often requires the movement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s across considerable distances, which is achieved through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> migration. During embryonic development, as well as in healing and regeneration, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s travel across diverse terrains, which dictates the character of navigation (<i>1</i>). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s metastasize and migrate into healthy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>s, and knowledge of their migration strategies could be important to identify targets to treat advanced disease (<i>2</i>). Some migratory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s cover large distances individually (<i>3</i>), whereas others migrate in groups, with leaders and followers being directed by chemical signals (chemotaxis) (<i>4</i>, <i>5</i>). The exchange of information and resulting motility of such groups has been enigmatic. Moreover, the driving force of collective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> migration has been considered a sum of migratory and signaling activities of individually participating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. However, according to a study on page 339 of this issue by Shellard <i>et al.</i> (<i>6</i>), collective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> migration requires formation of cytoskeletal structures that span through adjoining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s at the rear of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> group to coordinate, orient, and propel the entire group. This mechanism of collective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> migration could be applicable to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> metastasis and wound healing and might change our understanding of developmental migration.</p>

Stem cell divisions, somatic mutations, cancer etiology, and cancer prevention
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s are caused by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions that may be inherited, induced by environmental factors, or result from DNA replication errors (R). We studied the relationship between the number of normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stem cel</span></strong>l divisions and the risk of 17 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> types in 69 countries throughout the world. The data revealed a strong correlation (median = 0.80) between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> incidence and normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stem cel</span></strong>l divisions in all countries, regardless of their environment. The major role of R <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> etiology was supported by an independent approach, based solely on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> genome sequencing and epidemiological data, which suggested that R <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions are responsible for two-thirds of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s. All of these results are consistent with epidemiological estimates of the fraction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s that can be prevented by changes in the environment. Moreover, they accentuate the importance of early detection and intervention to reduce deaths from the many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s arising from unavoidable R <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions.</p>

One brain, many genomes
<p>We each begin life as a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> harboring a single genome, which—over the course of development—gives rise to the trillions of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s that make up the body. From skin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s to heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s of the brain, each bears a copy of the original <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>'s genome. But as anyone who has used a copy machine or played the childhood game of “telephone” knows, copies are never perfect. Every <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> in an individual actually has a unique genome, an imperfect copy of its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular ancestor differentiated by inevitable somatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions arising from errors in DNA replication and other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutagen</span></strong>ic forces (<i>1</i>).

Yet how many and what kinds of somatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions accumulate in our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s as we develop and age has long been unknown and a blind spot in our understanding of the origins of genetic disease.</p>

Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Resolves Molecular Relationships Among Individual Plant Cells
<p>Single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been used extensively to study <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>-specific gene expression in animals, but it has not been widely applied to plants. Here, we describe the use of a commercially available droplet-based microfluidics platform for high-throughput scRNA-seq to obtain single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> transcriptomes from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protoplast</span></strong>s of more than 10,000 Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. We find that all major tissues and developmental stages are represented in this single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> transcriptome population. Further, distinct subpopulations and rare <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> types, including putative quiescent center <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, were identified. A focused analysis of root epidermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> transcriptomes defined developmental trajectories for individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s progressing from meristematic through mature stages of root-hair and nonhair <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> differentiation. In addition, single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> transcriptomes were obtained from root epidermis mutants, enabling a comparative analysis of gene expression at single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> resolution and providing an unprecedented view of the impact of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ed genes. Overall, this study demonstrates the feasibility and utility of scRNA-seq in plants and provides a first-generation gene expression map of the Arabidopsis root at single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> resolution.</p>

Revisiting the Algal “Chloroplast Lipid Droplet”: The Absence of an Entity That Is Unlikely to Exist
<p>The precise localization of the lipid droplets and the metabolic pathways associated with oil production are crucial to the engineering of microalgae for biofuel production. Several studies have reported detecting lipid droplets within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> of the microalga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, which accumulates considerable amounts of triacylglycerol and starch within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> under nitrogen deprivation or high-light stress conditions. Starch undoubtedly accumulates within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>, but there have been debates on the localization of the lipid droplets, which are cytosolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ell</span></strong>es in other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>isms. Although it is impossible to prove an absence, we tried to repeat experiments that previously indicated the presence of lipid droplets in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s. Here, we present microscopic results showing no evidence for the presence of lipid droplets within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> stroma, even though some lipid droplets existed in close association with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> or were largely engulfed by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s. These lipid droplets are cytosolic structures, distinct from the plastoglobules present in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> stroma. These results not only contrast with the old ideas but also point out that what were previously thought to be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> lipid droplets are likely to be embedded within <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> invaginations in association with the outer envelope of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> without intervention of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">endoplasmic reticulum</span></strong>. These findings point to the intriguing possibility of a tight metabolic flow from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> to the lipid droplet through a close association rather than direct contact of both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ell</span></strong>es.</p>

Efficient Plastid Transformation in Arabidopsis
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> transformation is routine in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) but 100-fold less frequent in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), preventing its use in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y. A recent study revealed that null <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in <i>ACC2</i>, encoding a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>-targeted acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase, cause hypersensitivity to spectinomycin. We hypothesized that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> transformation efficiency should increase in the <i>acc2</i> background, because when ACC2 is absent, fatty acid biosynthesis becomes dependent on translation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong>-encoded ACC β-carboxylase subunit. We bombarded <i>ACC2</i>-defective Arabidopsis leaves with a vector carrying a selectable spectinomycin resistance (<i>aadA</i>) gene and <i>gfp</i>, encoding the green fluorescence protein GFP. Spectinomycin-resistant clones were identified as green <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> clusters on a spectinomycin medium. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> transformation was confirmed by GFP accumulation from the second open reading frame of a polycistronic messenger RNA, which would not be translated in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong>. We obtained one to two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> transformation events per bombarded sample in spectinomycin-hypersensitive Slavice and Columbia <i>acc2</i> knockout backgrounds, an approximately 100-fold enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> transformation frequency. Slavice and Columbia are accessions in which plant regeneration is uncharacterized or difficult to obtain. A practical system for Arabidopsis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> transformation will be obtained by creating an <i>ACC2</i> null background in a regenerable Arabidopsis accession. The recognition that the duplicated ACCase in Arabidopsis is an impediment to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> transformation provides a rational template to implement <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastid</span></strong> transformation in related recalcitrant crops.</p>

Pericardial Adipose Tissue Regulates Granulopoiesis, Fibrosis, and Cardiac Function After Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The pericardial adipose tissue (AT) contains a high density of lymphoid clusters. It is unknown whether these clusters play a role in post–myocardial infarction (MI) inflammatory responses and cardiac outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Lymphoid clusters were examined in epicardial AT of humans with or without coronary artery disease. Murine pericardial lymphoid clusters were visualized in mice subjected to coronary artery ligation. To study the relevance of pericardial clusters during inflammatory responses after MI, we surgically removed the pericardial AT and performed B-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> depletion and granulocyte-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">macrophag</span></strong>e colony-stimulating factor blockade. Leukocytes in murine hearts, pericardial AT, spleen, mediastinal lymph nodes, and bone marrow were quantified by flow cytometry. Cannabinoid receptor CB2 (CB2<sup>–/–</sup>) mice were used as a model for enhanced B-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> responses. The effect of impaired dendritic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> (DC) trafficking on pericardial AT inflammatory responses was tested in CCR7<sup>–/–</sup> mice subjected to MI. Cardiac fibrosis and ventricular function were assessed by histology and echocardiography.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified larger B-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> clusters in epicardial AT of human patients with coronary artery disease in comparison with controls without coronary artery disease. Infarcted mice also had larger pericardial clusters and 3-fold upregulated numbers of granulocyte-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">macrophag</span></strong>e colony-stimulating factor–producing B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s within pericardial AT, but not spleen or lymph nodes. This was associated with higher DC and T-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> counts in pericardial AT, which outnumbered DCs and T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s in lymph nodes. Analysis of DC maturation markers, tracking experiments with fluorescently labeled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, and use of CCR7-deficient mice suggested that activated DCs migrate from infarcts into pericardial AT via CCR7. B-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> depletion or granulocyte-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">macrophag</span></strong>e colony-stimulating factor neutralization inhibited DC and T-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> expansion within pericardial AT, and translated into reduced bone marrow granulopoiesis and cardiac neutrophil infiltration 3 days after MI. The relevance of the pericardial AT in mediating all these effects was confirmed by removal of pericardial AT and ex vivo coculture with pericardial AT and granulocyte progenitors. Finally, enhanced fibrosis and worsened ejection fraction in CB2<sup>–/–</sup> mice were limited by pericardial AT removal.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings unveil a new mechanism by which the pericardial AT coordinates immune <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> activation, granulopoiesis, and outcome after MI.</p></sec>

Inhibition of JAK-STAT Signaling Suppresses Pathogenic Immune Responses in Medium and Large Vessel Vasculitis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Giant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> arteritis, a chronic autoimmune disease of the aorta and its large branches, is complicated by aneurysm formation, dissection, and arterial occlusions. Arterial wall dendritic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s attract CD4<sup>+</sup> T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">macrophag</span></strong>es to form prototypic granulomatous infiltrates. Vasculitic lesions contain a diverse array of effector T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s that persist despite corticosteroid therapy and sustain chronic, smoldering vasculitis. Transmural inflammation induces microvascular neoangiogenesis and results in lumen-occlusive intimal hyperplasia.

Mice carrying inflamed human arteries were treated with tofacitinib or vehicle.

How harmful they are depends on which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ed genes they contain. On page 970 of this issue, Yizhak <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) add to the evidence that normal tissues are not so normal after all. Examining a substantial number of healthy tissues from almost 500 individuals, they found a large number of acquired (somatic) DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions—some of which are typically associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>—and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional clones of macroscopic size, in the absence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> pathology.

Somatic mutant clones colonize the human esophagus with age
<p>The extent to which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s in normal tissues accumulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions throughout life is poorly understood. Some mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s expand into clones that can be detected by genome sequencing. We mapped mutant clones in normal esophageal epithelium from nine donors (age range, 20 to 75 years). Somatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions accumulated with age and were caused mainly by intrinsic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional processes. We found strong positive selection of clones carrying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in 14 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> genes, with tens to hundreds of clones per square centimeter. In middle-aged and elderly donors, clones with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions covered much of the epithelium, with <i>NOTCH1</i> and <i>TP53</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions affecting 12 to 80% and 2 to 37% of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, respectively.

Osteoblasts remotely supply lung tumors with cancer-promoting SiglecF<sup>high</sup> neutrophils
<p>Bone marrow–derived myeloid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s can accumulate within tumors and foster <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> outgrowth. Local immune-neoplastic interactions have been intensively investigated, but the contribution of the systemic host environment to tumor growth remains poorly understood. Here, we show in mice and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> patients (<i>n</i> = 70) that lung adenocarcinomas increase bone stromal activity in the absence of bone metastasis. Animal studies reveal that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>-induced bone phenotype involves bone-resident osteocalcin-expressing (Ocn<sup>+</sup>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">osteoblast</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s promote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> by remotely supplying a distinct subset of tumor-infiltrating SiglecF<sup>high</sup> neutrophils, which exhibit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>-promoting properties. Experimentally reducing Ocn<sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> numbers suppresses the neutrophil response and lung tumor outgrowth. These observations posit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">osteoblast</span></strong>s as remote regulators of lung <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> and identify SiglecF<sup>high</sup> neutrophils as myeloid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> effectors of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">osteoblast</span></strong>-driven protumoral response.</p>

ER-mitochondria tethering by PDZD8 regulates Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in mammalian neurons
<p>Interfaces between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ell</span></strong>es are emerging as critical platforms for many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical responses in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eukaryot</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. In yeast, the ERMES complex is an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">endoplasmic reticulum</span></strong> (ER)–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitochondria</span></strong> tether composed of four proteins, three of which contain a SMP (synaptotagmin-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitochondria</span></strong>l-lipid binding protein) domain. No functional ortholog for any ERMES protein has been identified in metazoans. Here, we identified PDZD8 as an ER protein present at ER-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitochondria</span></strong> contacts. The SMP domain of PDZD8 is functionally orthologous to the SMP domain found in yeast Mmm1. PDZD8 was necessary for the formation of ER-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitochondria</span></strong> contacts in mammalian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s, PDZD8 was required for calcium ion (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) uptake by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitochondria</span></strong> after synaptically induced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-release from ER and thereby regulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytoplasm</span></strong>ic Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics. Thus, PDZD8 represents a critical ER-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitochondria</span></strong> tethering protein in metazoans. We suggest that ER-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitochondria</span></strong> coupling is involved in the regulation of dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in mammalian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuron</span></strong>s.</p>

The microanatomic segregation of selection by apoptosis in the germinal center
<p>B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s undergo rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> division and affinity maturation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anatomi</span></strong>cally distinct sites in lymphoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>s called germinal centers (GCs). Homeostasis is maintained in part by B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apoptosi</span></strong>s. However, the precise contribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apoptosi</span></strong>s to GC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y and selection is not well defined. We developed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apoptosi</span></strong>s-indicator mice and used them to visualize, purify, and characterize dying GC B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">apoptosi</span></strong>s is prevalent in the GC, with up to half of all GC B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s dying every 6 hours. Moreover, programmed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> death is differentially regulated in the light zone and the dark zone: Light-zone B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s die by default if they are not positively selected, whereas dark-zone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s die when their antigen receptors are damaged by activation-induced cytidine deaminase.</p>

The Receptor-Like Kinase AtVRLK1 Regulates Secondary Cell Wall Thickening
<p>During the growth and development of land plants, some specialized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, such as tracheary elements, undergo secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> wall thickening. Secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> walls contain additional lignin, compared with primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> walls, thus providing mechanical strength and potentially improving defenses against pathogens. However, the molecular mechanisms that initiate wall thickening are unknown. In this study, we identified an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase, encoded by <i>AtVRLK1</i> (<i>Vascular-Related Receptor-Like Kinase1</i>), that is expressed specifically in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s undergoing secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> wall thickening. Suppression of <i>AtVRLK1</i> expression resulted in a range of phenotypes that included retarded early elongation of the inflorescence stem, shorter fibers, slower root growth, and shorter flower filaments. In contrast, up-regulation of <i>AtVRLK1</i> led to longer fiber <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, reduced secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> wall thickening in fiber and vessel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s, and defects in anther dehiscence. Molecular and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>ular analyses showed that down-regulation of <i>AtVRLK1</i> promoted secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> wall thickening and up-regulation of <i>AtVRLK1</i> enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> elongation and inhibited secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> wall thickening. We propose that AtVRLK1 functions as a signaling component in coordinating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> elongation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> wall thickening during growth and development.</p>

Mitochondria Affect Photosynthetic Electron Transport and Photosensitivity in a Green Alga
<p>Photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>isms use sunlight as the primary source of energy to support their metabolism. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eukaryot</span></strong>es, reactions responsible of the conversion of light into chemical energy occur in specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>ell</span></strong>es, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong>s. In this study, we showed that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitochondria</span></strong> also have a seminal influence on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s’ energy metabolism and on photosynthetic reactions. This is illustrated by the observation that the strong photosensitivity of <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s depleted of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> protein PGRL1 was rescued by the introduction of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitochondria</span></strong>l <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion affecting respiratory complex I. Functional analysis showed that such a reduced respiratory activity influenced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chloroplast</span></strong> electron transport with consequent overreduction of plastoquinone and donor-side limitation of photosystem I (PSI). As a consequence, damage due to excess light affected more photosystem II (PSII) rather than PSI. Double mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s are able to grow under excess illumination, while single <i>pgrl1</i> are not, thanks to the presence of an efficient repair mechanism of PSII. These results also underline the seminal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical relevance of the regulation of electron transport reactions within the photosynthetic complexes. Photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>isms evolved a strategy to respond to excess light where damage is targeting preferentially to a specific complex, PSII. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s are able to endure extensive damage targeting this complex thanks to an efficient repair mechanisms, while if PSI is affected, there are drastic consequences on growth.</p>

Branched Pectic Galactan in Phloem-Sieve-Element Cell Walls: Implications for Cell Mechanics
<p>A major question in plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y concerns the specification and functional differentiation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> types. This is in the context of constraints imposed by networks of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> walls that both adhere <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s and contribute to the form and function of developing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">organ</span></strong>s. Here, we report the identification of a glycan epitope that is specific to phloem sieve element <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> walls in several systems. A monoclonal antibody, designated LM26, binds to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> wall of phloem sieve elements in stems of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), <i>Miscanthus</i> x <i>giganteus</i>, and notably sugar beet (<i>Beta vulgaris</i>) roots where phloem identification is an important factor for the study of phloem unloading of Suc. Using microarrays of synthetic oligosaccharides, the LM26 epitope has been identified as a β-1,6-galactosyl substitution of β-1,4-galactan requiring more than three backbone residues for optimized recognition. This branched galactan structure has previously been identified in garlic (<i>Allium sativum</i>) bulbs in which the LM26 epitope is widespread throughout most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> walls including those of phloem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong>s. Garlic bulb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> wall material has been used to confirm the association of the LM26 epitope with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> wall pectic rhamnogalacturonan-I polysaccharides. In the phloem tissues of grass stems, the LM26 epitope has a complementary pattern to that of the LM5 linear β-1,4-galactan epitope, which is detected only in companion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> walls. Mechanical probing of transverse sections of <i>M</i>. x <i>giganteus</i> stems and leaves by atomic force microscopy indicates that phloem sieve element <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> walls have a lower indentation modulus (indicative of higher elasticity) than companion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell</span></strong> walls.</p>

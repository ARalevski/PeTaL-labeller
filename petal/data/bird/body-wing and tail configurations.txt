Insect Morphological Diversification Through the Modification of Wing Serial Homologs
<sec><title>A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wing</span></strong> by Another Name?</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wing</span></strong>s and their derivatives on the second and third thoracic segments represent the only known dorsal appendages in modern insects; however, the existence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wing</span></strong> homologs in non-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wing</span></strong>ed segments has been suggested from fossil insects. <bold>Ohde <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 495, published online 14 March) identify part of the body wall on the first thoracic segment and pupal dorsolateral outgrowths as modified pairs of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wing</span></strong>s in the mealworm beetle.

Bioinspired spring origami
<p>Origami enables folding of objects into a variety of shapes in arts, engineering, and biological systems. In contrast to well-known paper-folded objects, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wing</span></strong> of the earwig has an exquisite natural folding system that cannot be sufficiently described by current origami models. Such an unusual biological system displays incompatible folding patterns, remains open by a bistable locking mechanism during flight, and self-folds rapidly without muscular actuation. We show that these notable functionalities arise from the protein-rich joints of the earwig <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wing</span></strong>, which work as extensional and rotational springs between facets. Inspired by this biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wing</span></strong>, we establish a spring origami model that broadens the folding design space of traditional origami and allows for the fabrication of precisely tunable, four-dimensional–printed objects with programmable bioinspired morphing functionalities.</p>

Dynamic clonal analysis based on chronic <i>in vivo</i> imaging allows multiscale quantification of growth in the <i>Drosophila</i> wing disc
<p>In the course of morphogenesis, tissues change shape and grow. How this is orchestrated is largely unknown, partly o<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wing</span></strong> to the lack of experimental methods to visualize and quantify growth. Here, we describe a novel experimental approach to investigate the growth of tissues <i>in vivo</i> on a time-scale of days, as employed to study the <i>Drosophila</i> larval imaginal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wing</span></strong> disc, the precursor of the adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wing</span></strong>. We developed a protocol to image <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wing</span></strong> discs at regular intervals in living anesthetized larvae so as to follow the growth of the tissue over extended periods of time. This approach can be used to image cells at high resolution <i>in vivo</i>. At intermediate scale, we tracked the increase in cell number within clones as well as the changes in clone area and shape. At scales extending to the tissue level, clones can be used as landmarks for measuring strain, as a proxy for growth. We developed general computational tools to extract strain maps from clonal shapes and landmark displacements in individual tissues, and to combine multiple datasets into a mean strain. In the disc, we use these to compare properties of growth at the scale of clones (a few cells) and at larger regional scales.</p>

Glutamate signaling at cytoneme synapses
<p>We investigated the roles of components of neuronal synapses for development of the <i>Drosophila</i> air sac primordium (ASP). The ASP, an epithelial tube, extends specialized signaling filopodia called cytonemes that take up signals such as Dpp (Decapentaplegic, a homolog of the vertebrate bone morphogenetic protein) from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wing</span></strong> imaginal disc. Dpp signaling in the ASP was compromised if disc cells lacked Synaptobrevin and Synaptotagmin-1 (which function in vesicle transport at neuronal synapses), the glutamate transporter, and a voltage-gated calcium channel, or if ASP cells lacked Synaptotagmin-4 or the glutamate receptor GluRII. Transient elevations of intracellular calcium in ASP cytonemes correlate with signaling activity. Calcium transients in ASP cells depend on GluRII, are activated by <sc>l</sc>-glutamate and by stimulation of an optogenetic ion channel expressed in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wing</span></strong> disc, and are inhibited by EGTA and by the GluR inhibitor NASPM (1-naphthylacetyl spermine trihydrochloride). Activation of GluRII is essential but not sufficient for signaling. Cytoneme-mediated signaling is glutamatergic.</p>

Morphology, muscle capacity, skill, and maneuvering ability in hummingbirds
<p>How does agility evolve? This question is challenging because natural movement has many degrees of freedom and can be influenced by multiple traits. We used computer vision to record thousands of translations, rotations, and turns from more than 200 hummingbirds from 25 species, revealing that distinct performance metrics are correlated and that species diverge in their maneuvering style. Our analysis demonstrates that the enhanced maneuverability of larger species is explained by their proportionately greater muscle capacity and lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wing</span></strong> loading. Fast acceleration maneuvers evolve by recruiting changes in muscle capacity, whereas fast rotations and sharp turns evolve by recruiting changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wing</span></strong> morphology. Both species and individuals use turns that play to their strengths. These results demonstrate how both skill and biomechanical traits shape maneuvering behavior.</p>

Quantized chiral edge conduction on domain walls of a magnetic topological insulator
<p>Electronic ordering in magnetic and dielectric materials forms domains with different signs of order parameters. The control of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">configur</span></strong>ation and motion of the domain walls (DWs) enables nonvolatile responses against minute external fields. Here, we realize chiral edge states (CESs) on the magnetic DWs of a magnetic topological insulator. We design and fabricate the magnetic domains in the quantum anomalous Hall state with the tip of a magnetic force microscope and prove the existence of the chiral one-dimensional edge conduction along the prescribed DWs through transport measurements. The proof-of-concept devices based on re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">configur</span></strong>able CESs and Landauer-Buttiker formalism are realized for multiple-domain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">configur</span></strong>ations with well-defined DW channels.

The Vertebral Column of <i>Australopithecus sediba</i>
<p>Two partial vertebral columns of <i>Australopithecus sediba</i> grant insight into aspects of early hominin spinal mobility, lumbar curvature, vertebral formula, and transitional vertebra position. <i>Au. sediba</i> likely possessed five non–rib-bearing lumbar vertebrae and five sacral elements, the same <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">configur</span></strong>ation that occurs modally in modern humans. This finding contrasts with other interpretations of early hominin regional vertebral numbers. Importantly, the transitional vertebra is distinct from and above the last rib-bearing vertebra in <i>Au. sediba</i>, resulting in a functionally longer lower back. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">configur</span></strong>ation, along with a strongly wedged last lumbar vertebra and other indicators of lordotic posture, would have contributed to a highly flexible spine that is derived compared with earlier members of the genus <i>Australopithecus</i> and similar to that of the Nariokotome <i>Homo erectus</i> skeleton.</p>

Immunogene and viral transcript dynamics during parasitic <i>Varroa destructor</i> mite infection of developing honey bee (<i>Apis mellifera</i>) pupae
<p>The ectoparasitic <i>Varroa destructor</i> mite is a major contributor to the ongoing honey bee health crisis. <i>Varroa</i> interacts with honey bee viruses, exacerbating their pathogenicity. In addition to vectoring viruses, immunosuppression of the developing honey bee hosts by <i>Varroa</i> has been proposed to explain the synergy between viruses and mites. However, the evidence for honey bee immune suppression by <i>V. destructor</i> is contentious. We systematically studied the quantitative effects of experimentally introduced <i>V. destructor</i> mites on immune gene expression at five specific time points during the development of the honey bee hosts. Mites reproduced normally and were associated with increased titers of deformed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wing</span></strong> virus in the developing bees. Our data on different immune genes show little evidence for immunosuppression of honey bees by <i>V. destructor</i>. Experimental wounding of developing bees increases relative immune gene expression and deformed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wing</span></strong> virus titers. Combined, these results suggest that mite feeding activity itself and not immunosuppression may contribute to the synergy between viruses and mites. However, our results also suggest that increased expression of honey bee immune genes decreases mite reproductive success, which may be explored to enhance mite control strategies. Finally, our expression data for multiple immune genes across developmental time and different experimental treatments indicates co-regulation of several of these genes and thus improves our understanding of the understudied honey bee immune system.</p>

Flexible strategies for flight control: an active role for the abdomen
<p>Moving animals orchestrate myriad motor systems in response to multimodal sensory inputs. Coordinating movement is particularly challenging in flight control, where animals deal with potential instability and multiple degrees of freedom of movement. Prior studies have focused on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wing</span></strong>s as the primary flight control structures, for which changes in angle of attack or shape are used to modulate lift and drag forces. However, other actuators that may impact flight performance are reflexively activated during flight. We investigated the visual–abdominal reflex displayed by the hawkmoth <i>Manduca sexta</i> to determine its role in flight control. We measured the open-loop stimulus–response characteristics (measured as a transfer function) between the visual stimulus and abdominal response in tethered moths. The transfer function reveals a 41 ms delay and a high-pass filter behavior with a pass band starting at ~0.5 Hz. We also developed a simplified mathematical model of hovering flight wherein articulation of the thoracic–abdominal joint redirects an average lift force provided by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wing</span></strong>s. We show that control of the joint, subject to a high-pass filter, is sufficient to maintain stable hovering, but with a slim stability margin. Our experiments and models suggest a novel mechanism by which articulation of the body or ‘airframe’ of an animal can be used to redirect lift forces for effective flight control. Furthermore, the small stability margin may increase flight agility by easing the transition from stable flight to a more maneuverable, unstable regime.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
Elevated expression of the V-ATPase C subunit triggers JNK-dependent cell invasion and overgrowth in a <i>Drosophila</i> epithelium
<p>The C subunit of the vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase or V-ATPase regulates the activity and assembly of the proton pump at cellular membranes. It has been shown to be strongly upregulated in oral squamous cell carcinoma, a highly metastatic epithelial cancer. In addition, increased V-ATPase activity appears to correlate with invasiveness of cancer cells, but the underlying mechanism is largely unknown. Using the <i>Drosophila</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wing</span></strong> imaginal epithelium as an <i>in vivo</i> model system, we demonstrate that overexpression of Vha44, the <i>Drosophila</i> orthologue of the C subunit, causes a tumor-like tissue transformation in cells of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wing</span></strong> epithelium. Overexpressing cells are excluded from the epithelium and acquire invasive properties while displaying high apoptotic rates. Blocking apoptosis in these cells unmasks a strong proliferation stimulus, leading to overgrowth. Furthermore, we show that excess Vha44 greatly increases acidification of endocytic compartments and interferes with endosomal trafficking. As a result, cargoes such as GFP-Lamp1 and Notch accumulate in highly acidified enlarged endolysosomal compartments. Consistent with previous reports on the endocytic activation of Eiger/JNK signaling, we find that V-ATPase stimulation by Vha44 causes JNK signaling activation whereas downmodulation of JNK signaling rescues the invasive phenotypes. In summary, our <i>in vivo-</i>findings demonstrate that increased levels of V-ATPase C subunit induce a Eiger/JNK-dependent cell transformation within an epithelial organ that recapitulates early carcinoma stages.</p>

Scaling morphogen gradients during tissue growth by a cell division rule
<p>Morphogen gradients guide the patterning of tissues and organs during the development of multicellular organisms. In many cases, morphogen signaling is also required for tissue growth. The consequences of this interplay between growth and patterning are not well understood. In the <i>Drosophila</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wing</span></strong> imaginal disc, the morphogen Dpp guides patterning and is also required for tissue growth. In particular, it was recently reported that cell division in the disc correlates with the temporal increase in Dpp signaling. Here we mathematically model morphogen gradient formation in a gro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wing</span></strong> tissue, accounting also for morphogen advection and dilution. Our analysis defines a new scaling mechanism, which we term the morphogen-dependent division rule (MDDR): when cell division depends on the temporal increase in morphogen signaling, the morphogen gradient scales with the gro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wing</span></strong> tissue size, tissue growth becomes spatially uniform and the tissue naturally attains a finite size. This model is consistent with many properties of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wing</span></strong> disc. However, we find that the MDDR is not consistent with the phenotype of scaling-defective mutants, supporting the view that temporal increase in Dpp signaling is not the driver of cell division during late phases of disc development. More generally, our results show that local coupling of cell division with morphogen signaling can lead to gradient scaling and uniform growth even in the absence of global feedbacks. The MDDR scaling mechanism might be particularly beneficial during rapid proliferation, when global feedbacks are hard to implement.</p>

If these trends   continue, we predict this rising to 128 in 100 000 in 2030. We found   that these patients are becoming older and increasingly frail, as   assessed by the American Association of Anesthesiology grade. Complex extracapsular   fractures have become more common since 2009, which may explain   the increased use of cephalomedullary nails. Despite increasing   frailty, the 30-day and 12-month rates of mortality fell significantly   (p = 0.002 and 0.001, respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Fractures of the hip are becoming more common and more complex   in an aging, increasingly frail population. We expect these trends   to continue. This will place an increasing economic and clinical   strain on healthcare systems. Forward planning is essential to put   systems in place that can deal with the increasing demand.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1223–31.</p></sec>

The effect of operating lights on laminar flow
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The interaction between surgical lighting and laminar airflow   is poorly understood. We undertook an experiment to identify any   effect contemporary surgical lights have on laminar flow and recommend   practical strategies to limit any negative effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Neutrally buoyant bubbles were introduced into the surgical field   of a simulated setup for a routine total knee arthroplasty in a   laminar flow theatre. Patterns of airflow were observed and the   number of bubbles remaining above the surgical field over time identified.   Five different lighting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">configur</span></strong>ations were assessed. Data were analysed   using simple linear regression after logarithmic transformation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In the absence of surgical lights, laminar airflow was observed,   bubbles were cleared rapidly and did not accumulate. If lights were   placed above the surgical field laminar airflow was abolished and   bubbles rose from the surgical field to the lights then circulated   back to the surgical field. The value of the decay parameter (slope)   of the two setups differed significantly; no light (b = -1.589) <i>versus</i> one   light (b = -0.1273, p < 0.001).</p><p>Two lights touching (b = -0.1191) above the surgical field had   a similar effect to that of a single light (p = 0. 2719). Two lights   positioned by arms outstretched had a similar effect    (b = -0.1204) to two lights touching (p = 0.998) and one light (p   = 0.444). When lights were separated widely (160 cm), laminar airflow   was observed but the rate of clearance of the bubbles remained slower   (b = -1.1165) than with no lights present (p = 0.004). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Surgical lights have a significantly negative effect on laminar   airflow. Lights should be positioned as far away as practicable   from the surgical field to limit this effect.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1061–6.</p></sec>

High prevalence of acetabular retroversion in asymptomatic adults
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>This study sought to establish the prevalence of the cross over   sign (COS) and posterior wall sign (PWS) in relation to the anterior   pelvic plane (APP) in an asymptomatic population through reliable   and accurate 3D-CT based assessment.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Data from pelvic CT scans of 100 asymptomatic subjects (200 hips)   undertaken for conditions unrelated to disorders of the hip were   available for analysis in this study. A previously established 3D   analysis method was applied to assess the prevalence of the COS   and PWS in relation to the APP.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of the 200 included hips, 24% (48) presented a positive COS and   5.5% (11) presented a positive PWS. A combination of COS and PWS   was observed in 1% (two) of all hips (1%). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The high incidence of acetabular retroversion, determined by   the COS, shows that this anatomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">configur</span></strong>ation may not differ in   frequency between asymptomatic individuals and patients with symptomatic   femoroacetabular impingement (FAI).</p><p>Patients presenting with hip pain and evidence of FAI should   be subjected to strict diagnostic scrutiny and evaluated in the   sum of their clinical and radiological presentation.

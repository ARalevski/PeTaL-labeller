<i>ELIGULUM-A</i> Regulates Lateral Branch and Leaf Development in Barley
<p>The shoot apical and axillary meristems control shoot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, effectively influencing lateral branch and leaf formation. The barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) <i>uniculm2</i> (<i>cul2</i>) mutation blocks axillary meristem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, and mutant plants lack lateral branches (tillers) that normally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong> from the crown. A genetic screen for <i>cul2</i> suppressors recovered two recessive alleles of <i>ELIGULUM-A</i> (<i>ELI-A</i>) that partially rescued the <i>cul2</i> tillering phenotype. Mutations in <i>ELI-A</i> produce shorter plants with fewer tillers and disrupt the leaf blade-sheath boundary, producing liguleless leaves and reduced secondary cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in stems and leaves. <i>ELI-A</i> is predicted to encode an unannotated protein containing an RNaseH-like domain that is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed in land plants. <i>ELI-A</i> transcripts accumulate at the preligule boundary, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing ligule, leaf margins, cells destined to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong> secondary cell walls, and cells surrounding leaf vascular bundles. Recent studies have identified regulatory similarities between boundary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in leaves and lateral organs. Interestingly, we observed <i>ELI-A</i> transcripts at the preligule boundary, suggesting that <i>ELI-A</i> contributes to boundary formation between the blade and sheath. However, we did not observe <i>ELI-A</i> transcripts at the axillary meristem boundary in leaf axils, suggesting that <i>ELI-A</i> is not involved in boundary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment for axillary meristem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Our results show that <i>ELI-A</i> contributes to leaf and lateral branch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment by acting as a boundary gene during ligule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment but not during lateral branch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment.</p>

Tight junction protein gene expression patterns and changes in transcript abundance during development of model fish gill epithelia
<p>In vertebrates, tight junction (TJ) proteins play an important role in epithelium formation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, the maintenance of tissue integrity and regulation of TJ permeability. In this study, primary cultured model gill epithelia composed of pavement cells (PVCs) were used to exa<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mine</span></strong> TJ protein transcript <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance during the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of epithelium confluence and epithelium resistive properties. Differences in TJ protein expression patterns and transcript <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance between gill models composed of PVCs and models composed of PVCs and mitochondrion-rich cells (MRCs) were also exa<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mine</span></strong>d. Marked alterations in TJ protein transcript <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance were observed as cells <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ed to confluence in flask-cultured model gill epithelia. In contrast, during the formation of tissue resistance in insert-cultured epithelia (i.e. epithelia cultured on a permeable substrate), changes in TJ protein mRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ative, despite paracellular marker flux decreasing by orders of magnitude. In both cases significant changes in <i>claudin-8b, -8d, -27b, -28b</i> and -<i>32a</i> transcript <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance were observed, suggesting that temporal alterations in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of these genes are important end points of model gill epithelium integrity. When MRCs were present in cultured gill models, the mRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of several TJ proteins significantly altered and <i>claudin-10c, -10d</i> and -<i>33b</i> were only detected in preparations that included MRCs. These data provide insight into the role of select TJ proteins in the formation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of gill epithelia and the maintenance of gill barrier properties. In addition, observations reveal a heterogeneous distribution of claudin TJ proteins in the gill epithelial cells of rainbow trout.</p>

Non-invasive long-term fluorescence live imaging of <i>Tribolium castaneum</i> embryos
<p>Insect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment has contributed significantly to our understanding of metazoan <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. However, most information has been obtained by analyzing a single species, the fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Embryonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of the red flour beetle <i>Tribolium castaneum</i> differs fundamentally from that of <i>Drosophila</i> in aspects such as short-germ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, embryonic leg <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, extensive extra-embryonic membrane formation and non-involuted head <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Although <i>Tribolium</i> has become the second most important insect model organism, previous live imaging attempts have addressed only specific questions and no long-term live imaging data of <i>Tribolium</i> embryogenesis have been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>able. By combining light sheet-based fluorescence microscopy with a novel mounting method, we achieved complete, continuous and non-invasive fluorescence live imaging of <i>Tribolium</i> embryogenesis at high spatiotemporal resolution. The embryos survived the 2-day or longer imaging process, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ed into adults and produced fertile progeny. Our data document all morphogenetic processes from the rearrangement of the uniform blastoderm to the onset of regular muscular movement in the same embryo and in four orientations, contributing significantly to the understanding of <i>Tribolium</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Furthermore, we created a comprehensive chronological table of <i>Tribolium</i> embryogenesis, integrating most previous work and providing a reference for future studies. Based on our observations, we provide evidence that serosa window closure and serosa opening, although deferred by more than 1 day, are linked. All our long-term imaging datasets are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>able as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resourc</span></strong>e for the community. <i>Tribolium</i> is only the second insect species, after <i>Drosophila</i>, for which non-invasive long-term fluorescence live imaging has been achieved.</p>

Effect of source/sink ratios on yield components, growth dynamics and structural characteristics of oil palm (<i>Elaeis guineensis</i>) bunches
<p>Source/sink ratios are known to be one of the main determinants of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> palm growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. A long-term experiment (9 years) was conducted in Indonesia on mature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> palms subjected to continuous bunch ablation and partial defoliation treatments to artificially modify source/sink ratios. During the experiment, all harvested bunches were dissected and phenological measurements were carried out to analyse the effect of source/sink ratios on yield components explaining variations in bunch number, the number of fruits per bunch and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> dry weight per fruit. An integrative variable (supply/demand ratio) describing the ratio between the assimilate supply from sources and the growing organ demand for carbohydrate was computed for each plant on a daily basis from observations of the number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing organs and their sink strength, and of climate variables. Defoliation and bunch ablation affected the bunch number and the fruit number per bunch. Variations in bunch number per month were mainly due to variations in the fraction of aborted inflorescence and in the ratio between female and male inflorescences. Under fluctuating trophic conditions, variations in fruit number per bunch resulted both from changes in fruit-set and in the number of branches (rachillae) per inflorescence. For defoliated plants, the decrease in the number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing reproductive sinks appeared to be sufficient to maintain fruit weight and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> concentration at the control level, without any major decrease in the concentration of non-structural carbohydrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reserv</span></strong>es. Computation of the supply/demand ratio revealed that each yield component had a specific phase of sensitivity to supply/demand ratios during inflorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Establishing quantitative relationships between supply/demand ratios, competition and yield components is the first step towards a functional model for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> palm.</p>

<i>PINOID</i> Is Required for Formation of the Stigma and Style in Rice
<p>The stigma is the entry point for sexual reproduction in plants, but the mechanisms underlying stigma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment are largely unknown. Here, we disrupted putative auxin biosynthetic and signaling genes to evaluate their roles in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Disruption of the rice <i>PINOID</i> (<i>OsPID</i>) gene completely eliminated the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of stigmas, and overexpression of <i>OsPID</i> led to overproliferation of stigmas, suggesting that <i>OsPID</i> is a key determinant for stigma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Interestingly, <i>ospid</i> mutants did not display defects in flower initiation, nor did they <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong> any pin-like inflorescences, a characteristic phenotype observed in <i>pid</i> mutants in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). We constructed double mutants of <i>OsPID</i> and its closest homolog, <i>OsPIDb</i>, yet the double mutants still did not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong> any pin-like inflorescences, indicating that either <i>ospid</i> is compensated by additional homologous genes or <i>OsPID</i> has different functions in rice compared with <i>PID</i> in other organisms. We then knocked out one of the <i>NAKED PINS IN YUC MUTANTS</i> (<i>NPY</i>) genes, which cause the formation of pin-like inflorescences in Arabidopsis when compromised, in the <i>ospid</i> background. The <i>ospid osnpy2</i> double mutants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ed pin-like inflorescences, which were phenotypically similar to <i>pid</i> mutants in Arabidopsis and maize, demonstrating that the roles of <i>OsPID</i> in inflorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment are likely masked by redundant partners. This work identified a key determinant for stigma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in rice and revealed a complex picture of the <i>PID</i> gene in rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Furthermore, the stigma-less <i>ospid</i> mutants are potentially useful in producing hybrid rice.</p>

Transcription Factor OsTGA10 Is a Target of the MADS Protein OsMADS8 and Is Required for Tapetum Development
<p>This study aimed at elucidating regulatory components behind floral organ identity determination and tissue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. It remains unclear how organ identity proteins facilitate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of organ primordia into tissues with a deter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mine</span></strong>d identity, even though it has long been accepted that floral organ identity is genetically deter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mine</span></strong>d by interaction of identity genes according to the ABC model. Using the chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing technique, we identified <i>OsTGA10</i>, encoding a bZIP transcription factor, as a target of the MADS box protein OsMADS8, which is annotated as an E-class organ identity protein. We characterized the function of OsTGA10 using genetic and molecular analyses. <i>OsTGA10</i> was preferentially expressed during stamen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, and mutation of <i>OsTGA10</i> resulted in male sterility. OsTGA10 was required for tapetum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and functioned by interacting with known tapetum genes. In addition, in <i>ostga10</i> stamens, the hallmark cell wall thickening of the endothecium was defective. Our findings suggest that OsTGA10 plays a mediator role between organ identity determination and tapetum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in rice stamen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, between tapetum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and microspore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, and between various regulatory components required for tapetum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Furthermore, the defective endothecium in <i>ostga10</i> implies that cell wall thickening of endothecium is dependent on tapetum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment.</p>

MYB89 Transcription Factor Represses Seed Oil Accumulation
<p>In many higher plants, seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> accumulation is precisely controlled by intricate multilevel regulatory networks, among which transcriptional regulation mainly influences <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> biosynthesis. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the master positive transcription factors, <i>WRINKLED1</i> (<i>WRI1</i>) and <i>LEAFY COTYLEDON1-LIKE</i> (<i>L1L</i>), are important for seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> accumulation. We found that an R2R3-MYB transcription factor, MYB89, was expressed predominantly in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing seeds during maturation. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> and major fatty acid biosynthesis in seeds was significantly promoted by <i>myb89-1</i> mutation and <i>MYB89</i> knockdown; thus, MYB89 was an important repressor during seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> accumulation. RNA sequencing revealed remarkable up-regulation of numerous genes involved in seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> accumulation in <i>myb89</i> seeds at 12 d after pollination. Posttranslational activation of a MYB89-glucocorticoid receptor fusion protein and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that MYB89 inhibited seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> accumulation by directly repressing <i>WRI1</i> and five key genes and by indirectly suppressing <i>L1L</i> and 11 key genes involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> biosynthesis during seed maturation. These results help us to understand the novel function of MYB89 and provide new insights into the regulatory network of transcriptional factors controlling seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> accumulation in Arabidopsis.</p>

Draft genome sequence of an elite <i>Dura</i> palm and whole-genome patterns of DNA variation in oil palm
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> palm is the world’s leading source of vegetable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> and fat. <i>Dura, Pisifera</i> and <i>Tenera</i> are three forms of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> palm. The genome sequence of <i>Pisifera</i> is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>able whereas the <i>Dura</i> form has not been sequenced yet. We sequenced the genome of one elite <i>Dura</i> palm, and re-sequenced 17 palm genomes. The assemble genome sequence of the elite <i>Dura</i> tree contained 10,971 scaffolds and was 1.701 Gb in length, covering 94.49% of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> palm genome. 36,105 genes were predicted. Re-sequencing of 17 additional palm trees identified 18.1 million SNPs. We found high genetic variation among palms from different geographical regions, but lower variation among Southeast Asian <i>Dura</i> and <i>Pisifera</i> palms. We mapped 10,000 SNPs on the linkage map of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> palm. In addition, high linkage disequilibrium (LD) was detected in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> palms used in breeding populations of Southeast Asia, suggesting that LD mapping is likely to be practical in this important <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> crop.

Selection for a Zinc-Finger Protein Contributes to Seed Oil Increase during Soybean Domestication
<p>Seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> is a momentous agronomical trait of soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) targeted by domestication in breeding. Although multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong>-related genes have been uncovered, knowledge of the regulatory mechanism of seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> biosynthesis is currently limited. We demonstrate that the seed-preferred gene <i>GmZF351</i>, encoding a tandem CCCH zinc finger protein, is selected during domestication. Further analysis shows that <i>GmZF351</i> facilitates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> accumulation by directly activating <i>WRINKLED1</i>, <i>BIOTIN CARBOXYL CARRIER PROTEIN2</i>, <i>3-KETOACYL-ACYL CARRIER PROTEIN SYNTHASE III</i>, <i>DIACYLGLYCEROL O-ACYLTRANSFERASE1</i>, and <i>OLEOSIN2</i> in transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seeds. Overexpression of <i>GmZF351</i> in transgenic soybean also activates lipid biosynthesis genes, thereby accelerating seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> accumulation. The <i>ZF351</i> haplotype from the cultivated soybean group and the wild soybean (<i>Glycine soja</i>) subgroup III correlates well with high gene expression level, seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> contents and promoter activity, suggesting that selection of <i>GmZF351</i> expression leads to increased seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> content in cultivated soybean. Our study provides novel insights into the regulatory mechanism for seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> accumulation, and the manipulation of <i>GmZF351</i> may have great potential in the improvement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> production in soybean and other related crops.</p>

Giberellic Acid-Stimulated Transcript Proteins Evolved through Successive Conjugation of Novel Motifs and Their Subfunctionalization
<p><i>Gibberellic Acid Stimulated Transcript</i> (<i>GAST</i>)-like genes encode small polypeptides, some of which have been implicated in diverse biological processes regulating plant growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. However, the occurrence of GASTs among plants, their protein structures, and the mechanisms by which they evolved remain elusive. Here, using a customized workflow, we report genes encoding GAST proteins, identify novel motifs and evolutionary patterns contributing to the subfunctionalization of GAST domains, and explore functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation across diverse plant groups. We show that <i>GAST</i>-like sequences evolved initially in the vascular plant <i>Selaginella moellendorffii</i>, after the divergence from bryophytes, and later emerged in gymnosperms and angiosperms. GASTs in angiosperms are characterized by four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed novel motifs; however, relatively fewer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed motifs exist in pteridophytes and gymnosperms. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the GAST-Cysteine Rich1 motif evolved early in the <i>S. moellendorffii</i> GAST, which further acquired subfunctionalization through successive conjugation of other motifs and remained <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed across plants, as supported by their collinearity. Functional characterization of two orthologs from the dicot Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>; <i>Gibberellic Acid-Stimulated Arabidopsis 10</i>) and the monocot rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>; <i>Gibberellic Acid Stimulated Transcript-Related 9</i>) suggests hormonal regulation, novel roles in seed germination, and functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation among diverse plant groups. Computational modeling predicts that these <i>GAST</i> genes are regulated by several factors, including the phytohormones gibberellin and abscisic acid, through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed cis-motifs present in their promoters, and that they might act as signaling molecules in a complex feedback loop. Thus, our study identifies <i>GAST</i>s and their encoded proteins, uncovers their structure, novel motifs, and evolutionary pattern among plants, and suggests their functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation.</p>

Tri-Hydroxy-Triacylglycerol Is Efficiently Produced by Position-Specific Castor Acyltransferases
<p>Understanding the biochemistry of triacylglycerol (TAG) assembly is critical in tailoring seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong>s to produce high-value products. Hydroxy-fatty acid (HFA) is one such valuable modified fatty acid, which can be produced at low levels in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed through transgenic expression of the castor (<i>Ricinus communis</i>) hydroxylase. The resulting plants have low seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> content and poor seedling establishment, indicating that Arabidopsis lacks efficient metabolic networks for biosynthesis and catabolism of hydroxy-containing TAG. To improve utilization of such substrates, we expressed three castor acyltransferase enzymes that incorporate HFA at each stereochemical position during TAG synthesis. This produced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ant tri-HFA TAG and concentrated 44% of seed HFA moieties into this one TAG species. Ricinoleic acid was more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ant than any other fatty acid in these seeds, which had 3-fold more HFA by weight than that in seeds following simple hydroxylase expression, the highest yet measured in a nonnative plant. Efficient utilization of hydroxy-containing lipid substrates increased the rate of TAG synthesis 2-fold, leading to complete relief of the low-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> phenotype. Partition of HFA into specific TAG molecules increased the storage lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>able for mobilization during seedling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, resulting in a 1.9-fold increase in seedling establishment. Expression of a complete acyltransferase pathway to efficiently process HFA establishes a benchmark in the quest to successfully produce modified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong>s in plants.</p>

Importin β4 Mediates Nuclear Import of GRF-Interacting Factors to Control Ovule Development in Arabidopsis
<p>Ovule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment is critical for seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and plant reproduction. Multiple transcription factors (TFs) have been reported to mediate ovule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. However, it is not clear which intracellular components regulate these TFs during ovule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. After their synthesis, TFs are transported into the nucleus a process regulated by karyopherins commonly known as importin alpha and β. Around half of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) importin β-coding genes have been functionally characterized but only two with specific cargos have been identified. We report here that Arabidopsis IMPORTIN β4 (IMB4) regulates ovule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment through nucleocytoplasmic transport of transcriptional coactivator growth regulating factors–interacting factors (GIFs). Mutations in <i>IMB4</i> impaired ovule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment by affecting integument growth. <i>imb4</i> mutants were also defective in embryo sac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, leading to partial female sterility. IMB4 directly interacts with GIFs and is critical for the nucleocytoplasmic transport of GIF1. Finally, functional loss of <i>GIF</i>s resulted in ovule defects similar to those in <i>imb4</i> mutants, whereas enhanced expression of <i>GIF1</i> partially restored the fertility of <i>imb4</i>. The results presented here uncover a novel genetic pathway regulating ovule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and reveal the upstream regulator of GIFs.</p>

Development Defects of Hydroxy-Fatty Acid-Accumulating Seeds Are Reduced by Castor Acyltransferases
<p>Researchers have long endeavored to produce modified fatty acids in easily managed crop plants where they are not natively found. An important step toward this goal has been the biosynthesis of these valuable products in model <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong>seeds. The successful production of such fatty acids has revealed barriers to the broad application of this technology, including low seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> and low proportion of the introduced fatty acid and reduced seed vigor. Here, we analyze the impact of producing hydroxy-fatty acids on seedling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. We show that germinating seeds of a hydroxy-fatty acid-accumulating Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) line produce chlorotic cotyledons and suffer reduced photosynthetic capacity. These seedlings retain hydroxy-fatty acids in polar lipids, including chloroplast lipids, and exhibit decreased fatty acid synthesis. Triacylglycerol mobilization in seedling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment also is reduced, especially for lipids that include hydroxy-fatty acid moieties. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>mental defects are ameliorated by increased flux of hydroxy-fatty acids into seed triacylglycerol created through the expression of either castor (<i>Ricinus communis</i>) acyltransferase enzyme ACYL-COA:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE2 or PHOSPHOLIPID:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1A. Such expression increases both the level of total stored triacylglycerol and the rate at which it is mobilized, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuel</span></strong>ing fatty acid synthesis and restoring photosynthetic capacity. Our results suggest that further improvements in seedling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment may require the specific mobilization of triacylglycerol-containing hydroxy-fatty acids. Understanding the defects in early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment caused by the accumulation of modified fatty acids and providing mechanisms to circumvent these defects are vital steps in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of tailored <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> crops.</p>

Jasmonate Negatively Regulates Stomatal Development in Arabidopsis Cotyledons
<p>Stomata are ports that facilitate gas and water vapor exchange between plants and their environment. Stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment is strictly regulated by endogenous signals and environmental cues. Jasmonate is an important signal that modulates multiple physiological processes in plants, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying its interactions with other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>mental signaling pathways remain poorly understood. Here, we show that jasmonate negatively regulates stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) cotyledons. Cotyledons of the wild type and stomata-overproliferating mutants (such as <i>too many mouths-1</i> and <i>stomatal density and distribution1-1</i>) treated with methyl jasmonate exhibit a clear reduction in stomata number. By contrast, blocking endogenous jasmonate biosynthesis or perception enhanced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Moreover, three MYC transcription factors involved in jasmonate signaling, MYC2, MYC3, and MYC4, were found to redundantly modulate jasmonate-inhibited stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. A genetic analysis showed that these MYC proteins act upstream of the SPEECHLESS and FAMA transcription factors to mediate stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Furthermore, jasmonate repression of stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment is dependent on these three MYC transcription factors, as stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of the <i>myc2 myc3 myc4</i> triple mutant was insensitive to methyl jasmonate treatment. Collectively, our study demonstrates that jasmonate and MYC transcription factors negatively regulate stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in Arabidopsis cotyledons.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
A Rice Ca<sup>2+</sup> Binding Protein Is Required for Tapetum Function and Pollen Formation
<p>In flowering plants, successful male reproduction requires the sophisticated interaction between somatic anther wall layers and reproductive cells. Timely degradation of the innermost tissue of the anther wall layer, the tapetal layer, is critical for pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a well-known stimulus for plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, but whether it plays a role in affecting male reproduction remains elusive. Here we report a role of Defective in Exine Formation 1 (OsDEX1) in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), a Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding protein, in regulating rice tapetal cell degradation and pollen formation. In <i>osdex1</i> anthers, tapetal cell degeneration is delayed and degradation of the callose wall surrounding the microspores is compromised, leading to aborted pollen formation and complete male sterility. <i>OsDEX1</i> is expressed in tapetal cells and microspores during early anther <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Recombinant OsDEX1 is able to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> and regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in vitro, and <i>osdex1</i> exhibited disturbed Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in tapetal cells. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that OsDEX1 may have a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed function in binding Ca<sup>2+</sup> in flowering plants, and genetic complementation of pollen wall defects of an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>dex1</i> mutant confirmed its evolutionary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation in pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Collectively, these findings suggest that OsDEX1 plays a fundamental role in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of tapetal cells and pollen formation, possibly via modulating the Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis during pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment.</p>

WT1 regulates the development of the posterior taste field
<p>Despite the importance of taste in determining nutrient intake, our understanding of the processes that control the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of the peripheral taste system is lacking. Several early regulators of taste <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment have been identified, including sonic hedgehog, bone morphogenetic protein 4 and multiple members of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. However, the regulation of these factors, including their induction, remains poorly understood. Here, we identify a crucial role for the Wilms' tumor 1 protein (WT1) in circumvallate (CV) papillae <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. WT1 is a transcription factor that is important in the normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of multiple tissues, including both the olfactory and visual systems. In mice, WT1 expression is detectable by E12.5, when the CV taste placode begins to form. In mice lacking WT1, the CV fails to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong> normally and markers of early taste <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment are dysregulated compared with wild type. We demonstrate that expression of the WT1 target genes <i>Lef1</i>, <i>Ptch1</i> and <i>Bmp4</i> is significantly reduced in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing tongue tissue derived from <i>Wt1</i> knockout mice and that, in normal tongue, WT1 is bound to the promoter regions of these genes. Moreover, siRNA knockdown of WT1 in cultured taste cells leads to a reduction in the expression of <i>Lef1</i> and <i>Ptch1</i>. Our data identify WT1 as a crucial transcription factor in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of the CV through the regulation of multiple signaling pathways that have established roles in the formation and patterning of taste placodes.</p>

Tree Physiology
Revisiting the sequencing of the first tree genome: <i>Populus trichocarpa</i>
<p>Ten years ago, it was announced that the Joint Genome Institute with funds provided by the Department of Energy, Office of Science, Biological and Environmental Research would sequence the black cottonwood (<i>Populus trichocarpa</i> Torr. & Gray) genome. This landmark decision was the culmination of work by the forest science community to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong> <i>Populus</i> as a model system. Since its public release in late 2006, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>ability of the <i>Populus</i> genome has spawned research in plant biology, morphology, genetics and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ecolog</span></strong>y. Here we address how the tree physio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">logist</span></strong> has used this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resourc</span></strong>e. More specifically, we revisit our earlier contention that the rewards of sequencing the <i>Populus</i> genome would depend on how quickly scientists working with woody perennials could adopt molecular approaches to investigate the mechanistic underpinnings of basic physiological processes. Several examples illustrate the integration of functional and comparative genomics into the forest sciences, especially in areas that target improved understanding of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>mental differences between woody perennials and herbaceous annuals (e.g., phase transitions). Sequencing the <i>Populus</i> genome and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>ability of genetic and genomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resourc</span></strong>es has also been instrumental in identifying candidate genes that underlie physiological and morphological traits of interest. Genome-enabled research has advanced our understanding of how phenotype and genotype are related and provided insights into the genetic mechanisms whereby woody perennials adapt to environmental stress. In the future, we anticipate that low-cost, high-throughput sequencing will continue to facilitate research in tree physiology and enhance our understanding at scales of individual organisms and populations. A challenge remains, however, as to how genomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resourc</span></strong>es, including the <i>Populus</i> genome, can be used to understand ecosystem function. Although examples are limited, progress in this area is encouraging and will undoubtedly improve as future research targets the many unique aspects of <i>Populus</i> as a keystone species in terrestrial ecosystems.</p>

RORγt limits the amount of the cytokine receptor γc through the prosurvival factor Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> in developing thymocytes
<p>The cytokine receptor subunit γc provides critical signals for T cell survival and differentiation. We investigated the molecular mechanism that controls the cell surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of γc during T cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in the thymus. We found that the amount of γc was low on CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> double-positive (DP) thymocytes before their positive selection to become mature T cells. The transcription factor RORγt was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ant in immature DP thymocytes, and its loss resulted in an increase in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of surface γc, specifically on preselection DP cells. Rather than directly repressing expression of the gene encoding γc, RORγt acted through the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> to reduce the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of surface γc, which resulted in decreased cytokine signaling and was associated with inhibition of cell metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis. Accordingly, overexpression of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> in RORγt-deficient thymocytes restored the amount of surface γc to that present on normal preselection DP cells. Together, these data highlight a previously unappreciated role for RORγt and Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> in limiting γc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance at the cell surface and reveal a signaling circuit in which survival factors control cytokine signaling by limiting the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance and surface distribution of a receptor subunit shared by several cytokines.</p>

Toward a chemical vaccine for malaria
<p>Despite considerable progress in combating malaria, it remains one of the world's most important infectious diseases, with 50% of the world population at risk of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing the disease and a mortality rate of ∼0.5 million annually (<i>1</i>). The lack of an effective vaccine and the relentless ability of the <i>Plasmodium</i> parasite responsible for malaria to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong> drug resistance has contributed to the continuing disease burden (<i>2</i>–<i>4</i>). Artemisinin-combination therapies (ACTs) are the mainstay of current treatment regimens, but decreased effectiveness, particularly in Southeast Asia, threatens our ability to control this disease. A global effort to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong> new drugs for the treatment and prevention of malaria is under way but not guaranteed to succeed (<i>3</i>, <i>5</i>, <i>6</i>). These efforts include a systematic attempt to target all life-cycle stages of the parasite to allow combination therapies to be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ed, which are also likely to reduce the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of resistance. High-throughput screens (HTSs) designed to identify small drug-like molecules that prevent growth of blood-stage parasites (<i>7</i>, <i>8</i>) and target-based approaches have identified new compounds that are currently in preclinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and/or various stages of human clinical trials for treatment of malaria (<i>3</i>). Missing from these efforts has been a high-throughput technology to find liver stage–specific chemotypes. On page 1129 of this issue, Antonova-Koch <i>et al.</i> (<i>9</i>) report an HTS effort that has filled this gap. They identify a substantial number of new chemical starting points with potent liver-stage antimalarial activity, promising a new capacity to feed compounds through the drug <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment pipeline for chemoprotection.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
FLOURY SHRUNKEN ENDOSPERM1 Connects Phospholipid Metabolism and Amyloplast Development in Rice
<p>Starch synthesized and stored in amyloplasts serves as the major energy storage molecule in cereal endosperm. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying amyloplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and starch synthesis, we isolated a series of floury endosperm mutants in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). We identified the rice mutant <i>floury shrunken endosperm1</i> (<i>fse1</i>), which exhibited obvious defects in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of compound starch grains, decreased starch content, and altered starch physicochemical features. Map-based cloning showed that <i>FSE1</i> encodes a phospholipase-like protein homologous to phosphatidic acid-preferring phospholipase A<sub>1</sub>. <i>FSE1</i> was expressed ubiquitously with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ant levels observed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing seeds and roots. FSE1 was localized to both the cytosol and intracellular membranes. Lipid profiling indicated that total extra-plastidic lipids and phosphatidic acid were increased in <i>fse1</i> plants, suggesting that FSE1 may exhibit in vivo phospholipase A<sub>1</sub> activity on phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidyl-Ser, phosphatidylethanola<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mine</span></strong>, and, in particular, phosphatidic acid. Additionally, the total galactolipid content in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing <i>fse1</i> endosperm was significantly reduced, which may cause abnormal amyloplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Our results identify FSE1 as a phospholipase-like protein that controls the synthesis of galactolipids in rice endosperm and provide a novel connection between lipid metabolism and starch synthesis in rice grains during endosperm <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment.</p>

Transcriptome Profiling of Wheat Inflorescence Development from Spikelet Initiation to Floral Patterning Identified Stage-Specific Regulatory Genes
<p>Early reproductive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in cereals is crucial for final grain number per spike and hence the yield potential of the crop. To date, however, no systematic analyses of gene expression profiles during this important process have been conducted for common wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>). Here, we studied the transcriptome profiles at four stages of early wheat reproductive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, from spikelet initiation to floral organ differentiation. <i>K</i>-means clustering and stage-specific transcript identification detected dynamically expressed homeologs of important transcription regulators in spikelet and floral meristems that may be involved in spikelet initiation, floret meristem specification, and floral organ patterning, as inferred from their homologs in model plants. Small RNA transcriptome sequencing discovered key microRNAs that were differentially expressed during wheat inflorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment alongside their target genes, suggesting that miRNA-mediated regulatory mechanisms for floral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment may be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed in cereals and Arabidopsis. Our analysis was further substantiated by the functional characterization of the <i>ARGONAUTE1d</i> (<i>AGO1d</i>) gene, which was initially expressed in stamen primordia and later in the tapetum during anther maturation. In agreement with its stage-specific expression pattern, the loss of function of the predominantly expressed B homeolog of <i>AGO1d</i> in a tetraploid durum wheat mutant resulted in smaller anthers with more infertile pollens than the wild type and a reduced grain number per spike. Together, our work provides a first glimpse of the gene regulatory networks in wheat inflorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment that may be pivotal for floral and grain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, highlighting potential targets for genetic manipulation to improve future wheat yields.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Source of CpG Depletion in the HIV-1 Genome
<p>The dinucleotide CpG is highly underrepresented in the genome of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). To identify the source of CpG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deplet</span></strong>ion in the HIV-1 genome, we investigated two biological mechanisms: (1) CpG methylation-induced transcriptional silencing and (2) CpG recognition by Toll-like receptors (TLRs). We hypothesized that HIV-1 has been under selective evolutionary pressure by these mechanisms leading to the reduction of CpG in its genome. A CpG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deplet</span></strong>ed genome would enable HIV-1 to avoid methylation-induced transcriptional silencing and/or to avoid recognition by TLRs that identify foreign CpG sequences. We investigated these two hypotheses by determining the sequence context dependency of CpG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deplet</span></strong>ion and comparing it with that of CpG methylation and TLR recognition. We found that in both human and HIV-1 genomes the CpG motifs flanked by T/A were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deplet</span></strong>ed most and those flanked by C/G were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deplet</span></strong>ed least. Similarly, our analyses of human methylome data revealed that the CpG motifs flanked by T/A were methylated most and those flanked by C/G were methylated least. Given that a similar CpG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deplet</span></strong>ion pattern was observed for the human genome within which CpGs are not likely to be recognized by TLRs, we argue that the main source of CpG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deplet</span></strong>ion in HIV-1 is likely host-induced methylation. Analyses of CpG motifs in over 100 viruses revealed that this unique CpG representation pattern is specific to the human and simian immunodeficiency viruses.</p>

Skeletal muscle fuel selection occurs at the mitochondrial level
<p>Mammals exponentially increase the rate of carbohydrate oxidation as exercise intensity rises, while birds combust lipid almost exclusively while flying at high percentages of aerobic capacity. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuel</span></strong> oxidized by contracting muscle depends on many factors: whole-body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuel</span></strong> storage mass, mobilization, blood transport, cellular uptake, and substrate selection at the level of the mitochondrion. We exa<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mine</span></strong>d the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuel</span></strong> preferences of mitochondria isolated from mammalian and avian locomotory muscles using two approaches. First, the influence of substrates on the kinetics of respiration (<i>K</i><sub>m,ADP</sub> and <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>) was evaluated. For all substrates and combinations, <i>K</i><sub>m,ADP</sub> was generally twofold higher in avian mitochondria. Second, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuel</span></strong> competition between pyruvate, glutamate and/or palmitoyl-<sc>l</sc>-carnitine at three levels of ATP free energy was deter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mine</span></strong>d using the principle of mass balance and the measured rates of O<sub>2</sub> consumption and metabolite accumulation/utilization. Avian mitochondria strongly spared pyruvate from oxidation when another substrate was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>able and fatty acid was the dominant substrate, regardless of energy state. Mammalian mitochondria exhibited some preference for fatty acid over pyruvate at lower flux (higher energy state), but exhibited a much greater tendency to select pyruvate and glutamate when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>able. Studies in sonicated mitochondria revealed twofold higher electron transport chain electron conductance in avian mitochondria. We conclude that substantial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fuel</span></strong> selection occurs at the level of the mitochondrial matrix and that avian flight muscle mitochondria are particularly biased toward the selection of fatty acid, possibly by facilitating high β-oxidation flux by maintaining a more oxidized matrix.</p>

The mean follow-up was 10.3 years (3 to 25) for OFD, 9.2 years (3.0   to 26.3) for OFD-like and 11.6 years (0.25 to 33) for adamantinoma.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean age at diagnosis for OFD was 13.5 years (1 to 49), 10.5   years (6 to 28) for OFD-like and 34 years (14 to 86) for adamantinoma.   A total of 24 of the 42 patients with OFD (57%) have not required   any treatment and have been managed with observation. A total of   18 of the 42 patients with OFD underwent surgery, 13 with curettage   and five with resection.

<i>De novo</i> formation of nucleoli in developing mouse embryos originating from enucleolated zygotes
<p>The large, compact oocyte nucleoli, sometimes referred to as nucleolus precursor bodies (NPBs), are essential for embryonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in mammals; in their absence, the oocytes complete maturation and can be fertilized, but no nucleoli are formed in the zygote or embryo, leading to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>mental failure. It has been convincingly documented that zygotes inherit the oocyte nucleolar material and form NPBs again in pronuclei. It is commonly accepted that during early embryonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, the original compact zygote NPBs gradually transform into reticulated nucleoli of somatic cells. Here, we show that zygote NPBs are not required for embryonic and full-term <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in the mouse. When NPBs were removed from late-stage zygotes by micromanipulation, the enucleolated zygotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ed to the blastocyst stage and, after transfer to recipients, live pups were obtained. We also describe <i>de novo</i> formation of nucleoli in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing embryos. After removal of NPBs from zygotes, they formed new nucleoli after several divisions. These results indicate that the zygote NPBs are not used in embryonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and that the nucleoli in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing embryos originate from <i>de novo</i> synthesized materials.</p>

Cells alter their tRNA abundance to selectively regulate protein synthesis during stress conditions
<p>Decoding the information in mRNA during protein synthesis relies on tRNA adaptors, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of which can affect the decoding rate and translation efficiency. To deter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mine</span></strong> whether cells alter tRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance to selectively regulate protein expression, we quantified changes in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of individual tRNAs at different time points in response to diverse stress conditions in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. We found that the tRNA pool was dynamic and rearranged in a manner that facilitated selective translation of stress-related transcripts. Through genomic analysis of multiple data sets, stochastic simulations, and experiments with designed sequences of proteins with identical amino acids but altered codon usage, we showed that changes in tRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance affected protein expression independently of factors such as mRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance.

Autonomous vehicles: No driver…no regulation?
<p>According to the latest statistics from the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), 37,461 people were killed on the nation's roads in 2016 (<i>1</i>).

Methane production from coal by a single methanogen
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coal</span></strong>-bed methane is one of the largest unconventional natural gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resourc</span></strong>es. Although microbial activity may greatly contribute to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coal</span></strong>-bed methane formation, it is unclear whether the complex aromatic organic compounds present in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coal</span></strong> can be used for methanogenesis. We show that deep subsurface–derived <i>Methermicoccus</i> methanogens can produce methane from more than 30 types of methoxylated aromatic compounds (MACs) as well as from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coal</span></strong>s containing MACs. In contrast to known methanogenesis pathways involving one- and two-carbon compounds, this “methoxydotrophic” mode of methanogenesis couples <i>O</i>-demethylation, CO<sub>2</sub> reduction, and possibly acetyl–coenzyme A metabolism. Because MACs derived from lignin may occur widely in subsurface sediments, methoxydotrophic methanogenesis would play an important role in the formation of natural gas not limited to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coal</span></strong>-bed methane and in the global carbon cycle.</p>

Timing and Order of the Molecular Events Marking the Onset of Berry Ripening in Grapevine
<p>Grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) is a model for the investigation of physiological and biochemical changes during the formation and ripening of nonclimacteric fleshy fruits. However, the order and complexity of the molecular events during fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment remain poorly understood. To identify the key molecular events controlling berry formation and ripening, we created a highly detailed transcriptomic and metabolomic map of berry <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, based on samples collected every week from fruit set to maturity in two grapevine genotypes for three consecutive years, resulting in 219 samples. Major transcriptomic changes were represented by coordinated waves of gene expression associated with early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, veraison (onset of ripening)/midripening, and late-ripening and were consistent across vintages. The two genotypes were clearly distinguished by metabolite profiles and transcriptional changes occurring primarily at the veraison/midripening phase. Coexpression analysis identified a core network of transcripts as well as variations in the within-module connections representing varietal differences. By focusing on transcriptome rearrangements close to veraison, we identified two rapid and successive shared transitions involving genes whose expression profiles precisely locate the timing of the molecular reprogramming of berry <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Functional analyses of two transcription factors, markers of the first transition, suggested that they participate in a hierarchical cascade of gene activation at the onset of ripening. This study defined the initial transcriptional events that mark and trigger the onset of ripening and the molecular network that characterizes the whole process of berry <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, providing a framework to model fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and maturation in grapevine.</p>

Consensus Coexpression Network Analysis Identifies Key Regulators of Flower and Fruit Development in Wild Strawberry
<p>The diploid strawberry, <i>Fragaria vesca</i>, is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing model system for the economically important Rosaceae family. Strawberry fleshy fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>s from the floral receptacle and its ripening is nonclimacteric. The external seed configuration of strawberry fruit facilitates the study of seed-to-fruit cross tissue communication, particularly phytohormone biosynthesis and transport. To investigate strawberry fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, we previously generated spatial and temporal transcriptome data profiling <i>F. vesca</i> flower and fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment pre- and postfertilization. In this study, we combined 46 of our existing RNA-seq libraries to generate coexpression networks using the Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis package in R. We then applied a post-hoc consensus clustering approach and used bootstrapping to demonstrate consensus clustering’s ability to produce robust and reproducible clusters. Further, we experimentally tested hypotheses based on the networks, including increased iron transport from the receptacle to the seed postfertilization and characterized a <i>F. vesca</i> floral mutant and its candidate gene. To increase their utility, the networks are presented in a web interface (<ext-link>www.fv.rosaceaefruits.org</ext-link>) for easy exploration and identification of coexpressed genes. Together, the work reported here illustrates ways to generate robust networks optimized for the mining of large transcriptome data sets, thereby providing a useful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resourc</span></strong>e for hypothesis generation and experimental design in strawberry and related Rosaceae fruit crops.</p>

Transcriptomic Insights into Phenological Development and Cold Tolerance of Wheat Grown in the Field
<p>Cold acclimation and winter survival in cereal species is deter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mine</span></strong>d by complicated environmentally regulated gene expression. However, studies investigating these complex cold responses are mostly conducted in controlled environments that only consider the responses to single environmental variables. In this study, we have comprehensively profiled global transcriptional responses in crowns of field-grown spring and winter wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) genotypes and their near-isogenic lines with the <i>VRN-A1</i> alleles swapped. This in-depth analysis revealed multiple signaling, interactive pathways that influence cold tolerance and phenological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment to optimize plant growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in preparation for a wide range of over-winter stresses. Investigation of genetic differences at the <i>VRN-A1</i> locus revealed that a vernalization requirement maintained a higher level of cold response pathways while <i>VRN-A1</i> genetically promoted floral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Our results also demonstrated the influence of genetic background on the expression of cold and flowering pathways. The link between delayed shoot apex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and the induction of cold tolerance was reflected by the gradual up-regulation of abscisic acid-dependent and C-REPEAT-BINDING FACTOR pathways. This was accompanied by the down-regulation of key genes involved in meristem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment as the autumn progressed. The chromosome location of differentially expressed genes between the winter and spring wheat genetic backgrounds showed a striking pattern of biased gene expression on chromosomes 6A and 6D, indicating a transcriptional regulation at the genome level. This finding adds to the complexity of the genetic cascades and gene interactions that deter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mine</span></strong> the evolutionary patterns of both phenological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and cold tolerance traits in wheat.</p>

Two SUMO Proteases SUMO PROTEASE RELATED TO FERTILITY1 and 2 Are Required for Fertility in Arabidopsis
<p>In plants, the posttranslational modification small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) is involved in regulating several important <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>mental and cellular processes, including flowering time control and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. Here, we report two proteases, SUMO PROTEASE RELATED TO FERTILITY1 (SPF1) and SPF2, that regulate male and female gamete and embryo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and remove SUMO from proteins in vitro and in vivo. <i>spf1</i> mutants exhibit abnormal floral structures and embryo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, while <i>spf2</i> mutants exhibit largely a wild-type phenotype. However, <i>spf1 spf2</i> double mutants exhibit severe abnormalities in microgametogenesis, megagametogenesis, and embryo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, suggesting that the two genes are functionally redundant. Mutation of <i>SPF1</i> and <i>SPF2</i> genes also results in misexpression of generative- and embryo-specific genes. In vitro, SPF1 and SPF2 process SUMO1 precursors into a mature form, and as expected in vivo, <i>spf1</i> and <i>spf2</i> mutants accumulate SUMO conjugates. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified EMBRYO SAC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>MENT ARREST9 (EDA9) as an SPF1-interacting protein. In vivo, we demonstrate that EDA9 is sumolyated and that, in <i>spf1</i> mutants, EDA9-SUMO conjugates increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance, demonstrating that EDA9 is a substrate of SPF1. Together, our results demonstrate that SPF1 and SPF2 are two SUMO proteases important for plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>).</p>

Root Cortical Senescence Improves Growth under Suboptimal Availability of N, P, and K
<p>Root cortical senescence (RCS) in Triticeae reduces nutrient uptake, nutrient content, respiration, and radial hydraulic conductance of root tissue. We used the functional-structural model <i>SimRoot</i> to evaluate the functional implications of RCS in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) under suboptimal nitrate, phosphorus, and potassium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>ability. The utility of RCS was evaluated using sensitivity analyses in contrasting nutrient regimes. At flowering (80 d), RCS increased simulated plant growth by up to 52%, 73%, and 41% in nitrate-, phosphorus-, and potassium-limiting conditions, respectively. Plants with RCS had reduced nutrient requirement of root tissue for optimal plant growth, reduced total cumulative cortical respiration, and increased total carbon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reserv</span></strong>es. Nutrient reallocation during RCS had a greater effect on simulated plant growth than reduced respiration or nutrient uptake. Under low nutrient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>ability, RCS had greater benefit in plants with fewer tillers. RCS had greater benefit in phenotypes with fewer lateral roots at low nitrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>ability, but the opposite was true in low phosphorus or potassium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>ability. Additionally, RCS was quantified in field-grown barley in different nitrogen regimes. Field and virtual s<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> coring simulation results demonstrated that living cortical volume per root length (an indicator of RCS) decreased with depth in younger plants, while roots of older plants had very little living cortical volume per root length. RCS may be an adaptive trait for nutrient acquisition by reallocating nutrients from senescing tissue and secondarily by reducing root respiration. These simulated results suggest that RCS merits investigation as a breeding target for enhanced s<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oil</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resourc</span></strong>e acquisition and edaphic stress tolerance.</p>

<i>Small kernel2</i> Encodes a Glutaminase in Vitamin B<sub>6</sub> Biosynthesis Essential for Maize Seed Development
<p>Vitamin B<sub>6</sub>, an essential cofactor for a range of biochemical reactions and a potent antioxidant, plays important roles in plant growth, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, and stress tolerance. Vitamin B<sub>6</sub> deficiency causes embryo lethality in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), but the specific role of vitamin B<sub>6</sub> biosynthesis in endosperm <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment has not been fully addressed, especially in monocot crops, where endosperm constitutes the major portion of the grain. Through molecular characterization of a <i>small kernel2</i> (<i>smk2</i>) mutant in maize, we reveal that vitamin B<sub>6</sub> has differential effects on embryogenesis and endosperm <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in maize. The B<sub>6</sub> vitamer pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) is drastically reduced in both the <i>smk2</i> embryo and the endosperm. However, whereas embryogenesis of the <i>smk2</i> mutant is arrested at the transition stage, endosperm formation is nearly normal. Cloning reveals that <i>Smk2</i> encodes the glutaminase subunit of the PLP synthase complex involved in vitamin B<sub>6</sub> biosynthesis de novo. <i>Smk2</i> partially complements the Arabidopsis vitamin B<sub>6</sub>-deficient mutant <i>pdx2.1</i> and <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> pyridoxine auxotrophic mutant MML21. <i>Smk2</i> is constitutively expressed in the maize plant, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing embryos. Analysis of B<sub>6</sub> vitamers indicates that the endosperm accumulates a large amount of pyridoxa<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mine</span></strong> 5′-phosphate (PMP). These results indicate that vitamin B<sub>6</sub> is essential to embryogenesis but has a reduced role in endosperm <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in maize. The vitamin B<sub>6</sub> required for seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment is synthesized in the seed, and the endosperm accumulates PMP probably as a storage form of vitamin B<sub>6</sub>.</p>

Shoot Removal Induces Chloroplast Development in Roots via Cytokinin Signaling
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of plant chloroplasts is regulated by various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>mental, environmental, and hormonal cues. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment is repressed in roots via auxin signaling. However, roots <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong> chloroplasts when they are detached from the shoot. In contrast to auxin, cytokinin positively affects chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in roots, but the role and signaling pathway of cytokinin in the root greening response remain unclear. To understand the regulatory pathways of chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in the plant stress response, we exa<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mine</span></strong>d the mechanisms underlying the conditional greening of detached roots. In wild-type Arabidopsis roots, shoot removal activates type B ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR (ARR)-mediated cytokinin signaling and induces chlorophyll accumulation and photosynthetic remodeling. ARR1 and ARR12 are essential for up-regulating nucleus- and plastid-encoded genes associated with chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in detached roots. In this process, WOUND INDUCED DEDIFFERENTIATION1 and class B GATA transcription factors (B-GATAs) act upstream and downstream of ARRs, respectively. Overexpression of B-GATAs promotes root greening, as does shoot removal, dependent on a light signaling transcription factor, LONG HYPOCOTYL5. Auxin represses the root greening response independent of ARR signaling. <i>GNC-LIKE</i> (<i>GNL</i>), a B-GATA, is strongly up-regulated in detached roots via ARR1 and ARR12 but is repressed by auxin, so <i>GNL</i> may function at the point of convergence of cytokinin and auxin signaling in the root greening response.</p>

The Genetic Control of Reproductive Development under High Ambient Temperature<xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>Ambient temperature has a large impact on reproductive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and grain yield in temperate cereals. However, little is known about the genetic control of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment under different ambient temperatures. Here, we demonstrate that in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), high ambient temperatures accelerate or delay reproductive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment depending on the photoperiod response gene <i>PHOTOPERIOD1</i> (<i>Ppd-H1</i>) and its upstream regulator <i>EARLY FLOWERING3</i> (<i>HvELF3</i>). A natural mutation in <i>Ppd-H1</i> prevalent in spring barley delayed floral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and reduced the number of florets and seeds per spike, while the wild-type <i>Ppd-H1</i> or a mutant <i>Hvelf3</i> allele accelerated floral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and maintained the seed number under high ambient temperatures. High ambient temperature delayed the expression phase and reduced the amplitude of clock genes and repressed the floral integrator gene <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T1</i> independently of the genotype. <i>Ppd-H1</i>-dependent variation in flowering time under different ambient temperatures correlated with relative expression levels of the <i>BARLEY MADS</i>-box genes <i>VERNALIZATION1</i> (<i>HvVRN1</i>), <i>HvBM3</i>, and <i>HvBM8</i> in the leaf. Finally, we show that <i>Ppd-H1</i> interacts with regulatory variation at <i>HvVRN1. Ppd-H1</i> only accelerated floral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in the background of a spring <i>HvVRN1</i> allele with a deletion in the regulatory intron. The full-length winter <i>Hvvrn1</i> allele was strongly down-regulated, and flowering was delayed by high temperatures irrespective of <i>Ppd-H1</i>. Our findings demonstrate that the photoperiodic and vernalization pathways interact to control flowering time and floret fertility in response to ambient temperature in barley.</p>

Gibberellins Regulate Ovule Integument Development by Interfering with the Transcription Factor ATS
<p>Gibberellins (GAs) are plant hormones that regulate most plant life cycle aspects, including flowering and fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Here, we demonstrate the implication of GAs in ovule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. DELLA proteins, negative GA response regulators, act as positive factors for ovule integument <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in a mechanism that involves transcription factor ABERRANT TESTA SHAPE (ATS). The seeds of the <i>della global</i> mutant, a complete loss-of-function of DELLA, and the <i>ats-1</i> mutant are remarkably similar, with a round shape, a disorganized testa, and viviparism. These defects are the result of an alteration in integuments that fail to fully <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong> and are shorter than in wild-type plants. <i>ats-1</i> also shows some GA-related phenotypes, for example, higher germination rates and early flowering. In fact, <i>ats-1</i> has elevated GA levels due to the activation of GA biosynthesis genes, which indicates that ATS inhibits GA biosynthesis. Moreover, DELLAs and ATS proteins interact, which suggests the formation of a transcriptional complex that regulates the expression of genes involved in integument growth. Therefore, the repression of GA biosynthesis by ATS would result in the stabilization of DELLAs to ensure correct ATS-DELLA complex formation. The requirement of both activities to coordinate proper ovule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment strongly argues that the ATS-DELLA complex acts as a key molecular factor. This work provides the first evidence for a role of GAs in ovule and seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment.</p>

Based on these results, we propose a model of starch synthesis within the pollen grain and discuss the nutrient transport route feeding the embryo within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing seed.</p>

The Developmental Brain Gene <i>NPAS3</i> Contains the Largest Number of Accelerated Regulatory Sequences in the Human Genome
<p>To identify the evolutionary genetic novelties that contributed to shape human-specific traits such as the use of a complex language, long-term planning and exceptional learning abilities is one of the ultimate frontiers of modern biology. Evolutionary signatures of functional shifts could be detected by comparing noncoding regions that are highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed across mammals or primates and rapidly accumulated nucleotide substitutions only in the lineage leading to humans. As gene loci densely populated with human-accelerated elements (HAEs) are more likely to have contributed to human-specific novelties, we sought to identify the transcriptional units and genomic 1 Mb intervals of the entire human genome carrying the highest number of HAEs. To this end, we took advantage of four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>able data sets of human genomic accelerated regions obtained through different comparisons and algorithms and performed a meta-analysis of the combined data. We found that the brain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>mental transcription factor <i>neuronal PAS domain-containing protein 3</i> (<i>NPAS3</i>) contains the largest cluster of noncoding-accelerated regions in the human genome with up to 14 elements that are highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed in mammals, including primates, but carry human-specific nucleotide substitutions. We then tested the ability of the 14 HAEs identified at the <i>NPAS3</i> locus to act as transcriptional regulatory sequences in a reporter expression assay performed in transgenic zebrafish. We found that 11 out of the 14 HAEs present in <i>NPAS3</i> act as transcriptional enhancers during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, particularly within the nervous system. As <i>NPAS3</i> is known to play a crucial role during mammalian brain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, our results indicate that the high density of HAEs present in the human <i>NPAS3</i> locus could have modified the spatiotemporal expression pattern of <i>NPAS3</i> in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing human brain and, therefore, contributed to human brain evolution.</p>

Moreover, soybean can form symbiotic relationships with <i>Rhizobium</i> bacteria to fix atmospheric nitrogen. Soybean has a complex paleopolyploid genome and exhibits many vegetative and floral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment complexities. Soybean cultivars have photoperiod requirements restricting its use and productivity. Molecular regulators of these legume-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>mental processes remain enigmatic. Long noncoding RNAs may play important regulatory roles in soybean growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. In this study, over one billion RNA-seq read pairs from 37 samples representing nine tissues were used to discover 6,018 lincRNA loci. The lincRNAs were shorter than protein-coding transcripts and had lower expression levels and more sample specific expression. Few of the loci were found to be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed in two other legume species (chickpea [<i>Cicer arietinum</i>] and <i>Medicago truncatula</i>), but almost 200 homeologous lincRNAs in the soybean genome were detected. Protein-coding gene-lincRNA coexpression analysis suggested an involvement of lincRNAs in stress response, signal transduction, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>mental processes. Positional analysis of lincRNA loci implicated involvement in transcriptional regulation. lincRNA expression from centromeric regions was observed especially in actively dividing tissues, suggesting possible roles in cell division. Integration of publicly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>able genome-wide association data with the lincRNA map of the soybean genome uncovered 23 lincRNAs potentially associated with agronomic traits.</p>

Characterization of Multiple C2 Domain and Transmembrane Region Proteins in Arabidopsis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Multiple C2 domain and transmembrane region proteins (MCTPs) are evolutionarily <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed in eukaryotic organisms and may function as signaling molecules that mediate trafficking of other regulators. Although there are a large number of MCTPs found in the plant lineage, biological information on most plant MCTPs remains unknown. Here, we report systematic characterization of 16 members in the entire Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) MCTP family. Using GUS and GFP reporter assays, we reveal their distinct or overlapping patterns of gene expression and protein localization in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing Arabidopsis plants and <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaf epidermal cells. We further analyze in vivo effects of three C2 domains on the regulatory role of MCTP1 (FTIP1) in flowering time control in Arabidopsis, demonstrating that these C2 domains may be cooperative to mediate FTIP1 function during the floral transition. Through examining all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>able T-DNA insertional mutants of Arabidopsis <i>MCTPs</i>, we further reveal that <i>mctp6-1</i> significantly enhances the late-flowering phenotype of <i>ftip1-1</i> possibly through affecting FLOWERING LOCUS T in different manners, exemplifying that different MCTPs additively regulate a specific plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>mental process. Taken together, our results suggest functional divergence or redundancy of MCTP members in Arabidopsis and provide a community <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resourc</span></strong>e for further understanding various MCTP functions in plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment.</p>

Converging Light, Energy and Hormonal Signaling Control Meristem Activity, Leaf Initiation, and Growth<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of leaf primordia is subject to light control of meristematic activity. Light regulates the expression of thousands of genes with roles in cell proliferation, organ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, and differentiation of photosynthetic cells. Previous work has highlighted roles for hormone homeostasis and the energy-dependent Target of Rapamycin (TOR) kinase in meristematic activity, yet a picture of how these two regulatory mechanisms depend on light perception and interact with each other has yet to emerge. Their relevance beyond leaf initiation also is unclear. Here, we report the discovery that the dark-arrested meristematic region of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) experiences a local energy deprivation state and confirm previous findings that the PIN1 auxin transporter is diffusely localized in the dark. Light triggers a rapid removal of the starvation state and the establishment of PIN1 polar membrane localization consistent with auxin export, both preceding the induction of cell cycle- and cytoplasmic growth-associated genes. We demonstrate that shoot meristematic activity can occur in the dark through the manipulation of auxin and cytokinin activity as well as through the activation of energy signaling, both targets of photomorphogenesis action, but the organ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>mental outcomes differ: while TOR-dependent energy signals alone stimulate cell proliferation, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of a normal leaf lamina requires photomorphogenesis-like hormonal responses. We further show that energy signaling adjusts the extent of cell cycle activity and growth of young leaves non-cellautonomously to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>able photosynthates and leads to organs constituted of a greater number of cells <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing under higher irradiance. This makes energy signaling perhaps the most important biomass growth determinant under natural, unstressed conditions.</p>

Arabidopsis <i>LORELEI</i>, a Maternally Expressed Imprinted Gene, Promotes Early Seed Development
<p>In flowering plants, the female gametophyte controls pollen tube reception immediately before fertilization and regulates seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment immediately after fertilization, although the controlling mechanisms remain poorly understood. Previously, we showed that <i>LORELEI</i> (<i>LRE</i>), which encodes a putative glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane protein, is critical for pollen tube reception by the female gametophyte before fertilization and the initiation of seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment after fertilization. Here, we show that <i>LRE</i> is expressed in the synergid, egg, and central cells of the female gametophyte and in the zygote and proliferating endosperm of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed. Interestingly, <i>LRE</i> expression in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing seeds was primarily from the matrigenic <i>LRE</i> allele, indicating that <i>LRE</i> expression is imprinted. However, <i>LRE</i> was biallelically expressed in 8-d-old seedlings, indicating that the patrigenic allele does not remain silenced throughout the sporophytic generation. Regulation of imprinted <i>LRE</i> expression is likely novel, as <i>LRE</i> was not expressed in pollen or pollen tubes of mutants defective for MET1, DDM1, RNA-dependent DNA methylation, or MSI-dependent histone methylation. Additionally, the patrigenic <i>LRE</i> allele inherited from these mutants was not expressed in seeds. Surprisingly, and contrary to the predictions of the parental conflict hypothesis, LRE promotes growth in seeds, as loss of the matrigenic but not the patrigenic <i>LRE</i> allele caused delayed initiation of seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Our results showed that <i>LRE</i> is a rare imprinted gene that functions immediately after double fertilization and supported the model that a passage through the female gametophyte establishes monoalleleic expression of <i>LRE</i> in seeds and controls early seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment.</p>

Six-Rowed Spike3 (VRS3) Is a Histone Demethylase That Controls Lateral Spikelet Development in Barley
<p>The complex nature of crop genomes has long prohibited the efficient isolation of agronomically relevant genes. However, recent advances in next-generation sequencing technologies provide new ways to accelerate fine-mapping and gene isolation in crops. We used RNA sequencing of allelic <i>six-rowed spike3</i> (<i>vrs3</i>) mutants with altered spikelet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment for gene identification and functional analysis in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>). Variant calling in two allelic <i>vrs3</i> mutants revealed that <i>VRS3</i> encodes a putative histone Lys demethylase with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed zinc finger and Jumonji C and N domain. Sanger sequencing of this candidate gene in independent allelic <i>vrs3</i> mutants revealed a series of mutations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed domains, thus confirming our candidate as the <i>VRS3</i> gene and suggesting that the row type in barley is deter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mine</span></strong>d epigenetically. Global transcriptional profiling in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing shoot apical meristems of <i>vrs3</i> suggested that VRS3 acts as a transcriptional activator of the row-type genes <i>VRS1</i> (<i>Hv.HOMEOBOX1</i>) and <i>INTERMEDIUM-C</i> (<i>INT-C</i>; <i>Hv.TEOSINTE BRANCHED1</i>). Comparative transcriptome analysis of the row-type mutants <i>vrs3</i>, <i>vrs4</i> (<i>Hv.RAMOSA2</i>), and <i>int-c</i> confirmed that all three genes act as transcriptional activators of <i>VRS1</i> and quantitative variation in the expression levels of <i>VRS1</i> in these mutants correlated with differences in the number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ed lateral spikelets. The identification of genes and pathways affecting seed number in small grain cereals will enable to further unravel the transcriptional networks controlling this important yield component.</p>

Diversification of Root Hair Development Genes in Vascular Plants
<p>The molecular genetic program for root hair <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment has been studied intensively in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). To understand the extent to which this program might operate in other plants, we conducted a large-scale comparative analysis of root hair <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment genes from diverse vascular plants, including eudicots, monocots, and a lycophyte. Combining phylogenetics and transcriptomics, we discovered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation of a core set of root hair genes across all vascular plants, which may derive from an ancient program for unidirectional cell growth coopted for root hair <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment during vascular plant evolution. Interestingly, we also discovered preferential diversification in the structure and expression of root hair <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment genes, relative to other root hair- and root-expressed genes, among these species. These differences enabled the definition of sets of genes and gene functions that were acquired or lost in specific lineages during vascular plant evolution. In particular, we found substantial divergence in the structure and expression of genes used for root hair patterning, suggesting that the Arabidopsis transcriptional regulatory mechanism is not shared by other species. To our knowledge, this study provides the first comprehensive view of gene expression in a single plant cell type across multiple species.</p>

Stearoyl-Acyl Carrier Protein Desaturase Mutations Uncover an Impact of Stearic Acid in Leaf and Nodule Structure
<p>Stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturase (SACPD-C) has been reported to control the accumulation of seed stearic acid; however, no study has previously reported its involvement in leaf stearic acid content and impact on leaf structure and morphology. A subset of an ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenized population of soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) ‘Forrest’ was screened to identify mutants within the <i>GmSACPD-C</i> gene. Using a forward genetics approach, one nonsense and four missense <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutants were identified to have high levels of seed, nodule, and leaf stearic acid content. Homology modeling and in silico analysis of the GmSACPD-C enzyme revealed that most of these mutations were localized near or at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed residues essential for diiron ion coordination. Soybeans carrying <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutations at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed residues showed the highest stearic acid content, and these mutations were found to have deleterious effects on nodule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and function. Interestingly, mutations at non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed residues show an increase in stearic acid content yet retain healthy nodules. Thus, random mutagenesis and mutational analysis allows for the achievement of high seed stearic acid content with no associated negative agronomic characteristics. Additionally, expression analysis demonstrates that nodule leghemoglobin transcripts were significantly more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ant in soybeans with deleterious mutations at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed residues of GmSACPD-C. Finally, we report that <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutations cause an increase in leaf stearic acid content and an alteration of leaf structure and morphology in addition to differences in nitrogen-fixing nodule structure.</p>

Origins and Evolution of Stomatal Development
<p>The fossil record suggests stomata-like pores were present on the surfaces of land plants over 400 million years ago. Whether stomata arose once or whether they arose independently across newly evolving land plant lineages has long been a matter of debate. In Arabidopsis, a genetic toolbox has been identified that tightly controls stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and patterning. This includes the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors <i>SPEECHLESS</i> (<i>SPCH</i>), <i>MUTE</i>, <i>FAMA</i>, and <i>ICE/SCREAMs</i> (<i>SCRMs</i>), which promote stomatal formation. These factors are regulated via a signaling cascade, which includes mobile <i>EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR</i> (<i>EPF</i>) peptides to enforce stomatal spacing. Mosses and hornworts, the most ancient extant lineages to possess stomata, possess orthologs of these Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) stomatal toolbox genes, and manipulation in the model bryophyte <i>Physcomitrella patens</i> has shown that the bHLH and EPF components are also required for moss stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and patterning. This supports an ancient and tightly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed genetic origin of stomata. Here, we review recent discoveries and, by interrogating newly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">avail</span></strong>able plant genomes, we advance the story of stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and patterning across land plant evolution. Furthermore, we identify potential orthologs of the key toolbox genes in a hornwort, further supporting a single ancient genetic origin of stomata in the ancestor to all stomatous land plants.</p>

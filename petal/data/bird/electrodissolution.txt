Experimentally realized mechanochemistry distinct from force-accelerated scission of loaded bonds
<p>Stretching polymer chains accelerates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ation of a variety of internal covalent bonds, to an extent that correlates well with the force experienced by the scissile bond. Recent theory has also predicted scenarios in which applied force accelerates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ation of unloaded bonds and kinetically strengthens strained bonds. We report here unambiguous experimental validation of this hypothesis: Detailed kinetic measurements demonstrate that stretching phosphotriesters accelerates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ation of the unloaded phosphorus-oxygen bond orthogonal to the pulling axis, whereas stretching organosiloxanes inhibits <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ation of the aligned loaded silicon-oxygen bonds. Qualitatively, the outcome is determined by phosphoester elongation and siloxane contraction along the pulling axis in the respective rate-determining transition states. Quantitatively, the results agree with a simple mechanochemical kinetics model.</p>

Site-specific reactivity of molecules with surface defects—the case of H<sub>2</sub> dissociation on Pt
<p>The classic system that describes weakly activated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ation in heterogeneous catalysis has been explained by two dynamical models that are fundamentally at odds. Whereas one model for hydrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ation on platinum(111) invokes a preequilibrium and diffusion toward defects, the other is based on direct and local reaction. We resolve this dispute by quantifying site-specific reactivity using a curved platinum single-crystal surface. Reactivity is step-type dependent and varies linearly with step density. Only the model that relies on localized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ation is consistent with our results. Our approach provides absolute, site-specific reaction cross sections.</p>

Blockade of surface-bound TGF-β on regulatory T cells abrogates suppression of effector T cell function in the tumor microenvironment
<p>Regulatory T cells (T<sub>regs</sub>) suppress antitumor immunity by inhibiting the killing of tumor cells by antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. To better understand the mechanisms involved, we used ex vivo three-dimensional collagen-fibrin gel cultures of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ated B16 melanoma tumors. This system recapitulated the in vivo suppression of antimelanoma immunity, rendering the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ated tumor cells resistant to killing by cocultured activated, antigen-specific T cells. Immunosuppression was not observed when tumors excised from T<sub>reg</sub>-depleted mice were cultured in this system. Experiments with neutralizing antibodies showed that blocking transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) also prevented immunosuppression. Immunosuppression depended on cell-cell contact or cellular proximity because soluble factors from the collagen-fibrin gel cultures did not inhibit tumor cell killing by T cells. Moreover, intravital, two-photon microscopy showed that tumor-specific Pmel-1 effector T cells physically interacted with tumor-resident T<sub>regs</sub> in mice. T<sub>regs</sub> isolated from B16 tumors alone were sufficient to suppress CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell–mediated killing, which depended on surface-bound TGF-β on the T<sub>regs</sub>. Immunosuppression of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells correlated with a decrease in the abundance of the cytolytic protein granzyme B and an increase in the cell surface amount of the immune checkpoint receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). These findings suggest that contact between T<sub>regs</sub> and antitumor T cells in the tumor microenvironment inhibits antimelanoma immunity in a TGF-β–dependent manner and highlight potential ways to inhibit intratumoral T<sub>regs</sub> therapeutically.</p>

Phosphorylation of the exocyst protein Exo84 by TBK1 promotes insulin-stimulated GLUT4 trafficking
<p>Insulin stimulates glucose uptake through the translocation of the glucose transporter GLUT4 to the plasma membrane. The exocyst complex tethers GLUT4-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane, a process that requires the binding of the G protein (heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide–binding protein) RalA to the exocyst complex. We report that upon activation of RalA, the protein kinase TBK1 phosphorylated the exocyst subunit Exo84. Knockdown of TBK1 blocked insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation; knockout of TBK1 in adipocytes blocked insulin-stimulated glucose uptake; and ectopic overexpression of a kinase-inactive mutant of TBK1 reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The phosphorylation of Exo84 by TBK1 reduced its affinity for RalA and enabled its release from the exocyst. Overexpression of a kinase-inactive mutant of TBK1 blocked the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ation of the TBK1/RalA/exocyst complex, and treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with specific inhibitors of TBK1 reduced the rate of complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ation. Introduction of phosphorylation-mimicking or nonphosphorylatable mutant forms of Exo84 blocked insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. Thus, these data indicate that TBK1 controls GLUT4 vesicle engagement and disengagement from the exocyst, suggesting that exocyst components not only constitute a tethering complex for the GLUT4 vesicle but also act as “gatekeepers” controlling vesicle fusion at the plasma membrane.</p>

Orientation-dependent stereo Wigner time delay and electron localization in a small molecule
<p>Attosecond metrology of atoms has accessed the time scale of the most fundamental processes in quantum mechanics. Transferring the time-resolved photoelectric effect from atoms to molecules considerably increases experimental and theoretical challenges. Here we show that orientation- and energy-resolved measurements characterize the molecular stereo Wigner time delay. This observable provides direct information on the localization of the excited electron wave packet within the molecular potential. Furthermore, we demonstrate that photoelectrons resulting from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ative ionization process of the CO molecule are preferentially emitted from the carbon end for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ative <sup>2</sup>Σ states and from the center and oxygen end for the <sup>2</sup>Π states of the molecular ion. Supported by comprehensive theoretical calculations, this work constitutes a complete spatially and temporally resolved reconstruction of the molecular photoelectric effect.</p>

SAMTOR is an <i>S</i>-adenosylmethionine sensor for the mTORC1 pathway
<p>mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) regulates cell growth and metabolism in response to multiple environmental cues. Nutrients signal via the Rag guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) to promote the localization of mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface, its site of activation. We identified SAMTOR, a previously uncharacterized protein, which inhibits mTORC1 signaling by interacting with GATOR1, the GTPase activating protein (GAP) for RagA/B. We found that the methyl donor <i>S</i>-adenosylmethionine (SAM) disrupts the SAMTOR-GATOR1 complex by binding directly to SAMTOR with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ation constant of approximately 7 μM. In cells, methionine starvation reduces SAM levels below this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ation constant and promotes the association of SAMTOR with GATOR1, thereby inhibiting mTORC1 signaling in a SAMTOR-dependent fashion. Methionine-induced activation of mTORC1 requires the SAM binding capacity of SAMTOR. Thus, SAMTOR is a SAM sensor that links methionine and one-carbon metabolism to mTORC1 signaling.</p>

The bacterial Ras/Rap1 site-specific endopeptidase RRSP cleaves Ras through an atypical mechanism to disrupt Ras-ERK signaling
<p>The Ras–extracellular signal–regulated kinase pathway is critical for controlling cell proliferation, and its aberrant activation drives the growth of various cancers. Because many pathogens produce toxins that inhibit Ras activity, efforts to develop effective Ras inhibitors to treat cancer could be informed by studies of Ras inhibition by pathogens. <i>Vibrio vulnificus</i> causes fatal infections in a manner that depends on multifunctional autoprocessing repeats-in-toxin, a toxin that releases bacterial effector domains into host cells. One such domain is the Ras/Rap1-specific endopeptidase (RRSP), which site-specifically cleaves the Switch I domain of the small GTPases Ras and Rap1. We solved the crystal structure of RRSP and found that its backbone shares a structural fold with the EreA/ChaN-like superfamily of enzymes. Unlike other proteases in this family, RRSP is not a metalloprotease. Through nuclear magnetic resonance analysis and nucleotide exchange assays, we determined that the processing of KRAS by RRSP did not release any fragments or cause KRAS to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ate from its bound nucleotide but instead only locally affected its structure. However, this structural alteration of KRAS was sufficient to disable guanine nucleotide exchange factor–mediated nucleotide exchange and prevent KRAS from binding to RAF. Thus, RRSP is a bacterial effector that represents a previously unrecognized class of protease that disconnects Ras from its signaling network while inducing limited structural disturbance in its target.</p>

Tomosyn functions as a PKCδ-regulated fusion clamp in mast cell degranulation
<p>Soluble <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide–sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) family proteins mediate membrane fusion critical for vesicular transport and cellular secretion. Mast cells rely on SNARE-mediated membrane fusion for degranulation stimulated by crosslinking of immunoglobulin E (IgE) bound to the Fcε receptor (FcεRI). We investigated the mechanisms downstream of receptor activation that control degranulation. We found that the SNARE binding protein tomosyn-1 (also known as STXBP5) inhibited FcεRI-stimulated degranulation of mast cells. After mast cell activation, tomosyn-1 was phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ated from the SNARE protein syntaxin 4 (STX4), and associated with STX3. We identified PKCδ as the major kinase required for tomosyn-1 threonine phosphorylation and for regulation of the interaction with STXs. Incubation with high IgE concentrations increased tomosyn-1 abundance in cultured mast cells. Similarly, in basophils from allergic patients with high amounts of serum IgE, the abundance of tomosyn-1 was increased as compared to that in patients with normal IgE concentrations. Our findings identified tomosyn-1 as an inhibitor of mast cell degranulation that required PKCδ to switch its interaction with STX partners during fusion. We suggest that the IgE-mediated increase in tomosyn-1 abundance in allergic patients may represent a counterregulatory mechanism to limit disease development.</p>

Convergence of Wnt, growth factor, and heterotrimeric G protein signals on the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Daple
<p>Cellular proliferation, differentiation, and morphogenesis are shaped by multiple signaling cascades, and their dysregulation plays an integral role in cancer progression. Three cascades that contribute to oncogenic potential are those mediated by Wnt proteins and the receptor Frizzled (FZD), growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), and heterotrimeric G proteins and associated GPCRs. Daple is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the G protein G<sub>αi</sub>. Daple also binds to FZD and the Wnt/FZD mediator Dishevelled (Dvl), and it enhances β-catenin–independent Wnt signaling in response to Wnt5a-FZD7 signaling. We identified Daple as a substrate of multiple RTKs and non-RTKs and, hence, as a point of convergence for the three cascades. We found that phosphorylation near the Dvl-binding motif in Daple by both RTKs and non-RTKs caused Daple/Dvl complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ation and augmented the ability of Daple to bind to and activate G<sub>αi</sub>, which potentiated β-catenin–independent Wnt signals and stimulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) similarly to Wnt5a/FZD7 signaling. Although Daple acts as a tumor suppressor in the healthy colon, the concurrent increased abundance of Daple and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in colorectal tumors was associated with poor patient prognosis. Thus, the Daple-dependent activation of G<sub>αi</sub> and the Daple-dependent enhancement of β-catenin–independent Wnt signals are not only stimulated by Wnt5a/FZD7 to suppress tumorigenesis but also hijacked by growth factor–activated RTKs to enhance tumor progression. These findings identify a cross-talk paradigm among growth factor RTKs, heterotrimeric G proteins, and the Wnt/FZD pathway in cancer.</p>

Hedgehog reciprocally controls trafficking of Smo and Ptc through the Smurf family of E3 ubiquitin ligases
<p>Hedgehog (Hh) induces signaling by promoting the reciprocal trafficking of its receptor Patched (Ptc) and the signal transducer Smoothened (Smo), which is inhibited by Ptc, at the cell surface. We identified Smurf family E3 ubiquitin ligases as essential for Smo ubiquitylation and cell surface clearance and demonstrated that Smurf family members mediate the reciprocal trafficking of Ptc and Smo in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. G protein–coupled receptor kinase 2 (Gprk2)–mediated phosphorylation of Smurf promoted Smo ubiquitylation by increasing the recruitment of Smurf to Smo, whereas protein kinase A (PKA)–mediated phosphorylation of Smo caused Smurf to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ate from Smo, thereby inhibiting Smo ubiquitylation. Smo and Ptc competed for the same pool of Smurf family E3 ubiquitin ligases, and Hh promoted Ptc ubiquitylation and degradation by disrupting the association of Smurf family E3 ubiquitin ligases with Smo and stimulating their binding to Ptc. Our study identifies the E3 ubiquitin ligases that target Smo and provides insight into how Hh regulates the reciprocal trafficking of its receptor and signal transducer.</p>

MARK3-mediated phosphorylation of ARHGEF2 couples microtubules to the actin cytoskeleton to establish cell polarity
<p>The PAR-1–MARK pathway controls cell polarity through the phosphorylation of microtubule-associated proteins. Rho-Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor 2 (ARHGEF2), which activates Ras homolog family member A (RHOA), is anchored to the microtubule network and sequestered in an inhibited state through binding to dynein light chain Tctex-1 type 1 (DYNLT1). We showed in mammalian cells that liver kinase B1 (LKB1) activated the microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 3 (MARK3), which in turn phosphorylated ARHGEF2 at Ser<sup>151</sup>. This modification disrupted the interaction between ARHGEF2 and DYNLT1 by generating a 14-3-3 binding site in ARHGEF2, thus causing ARHGEF2 to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ate from microtubules. Phosphorylation of ARHGEF2 by MARK3 stimulated RHOA activation and the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions, and was required for organized cellular architecture in three-dimensional culture. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) dephosphorylated Ser<sup>151</sup> in ARHGEF2 to restore the inhibited state. Thus, we have identified a regulatory switch controlled by MARK3 that couples microtubules to the actin cytoskeleton to establish epithelial cell polarity through ARHGEF2.</p>

Mechanism of 5′ splice site transfer for human spliceosome activation

Here, we report cryo–electron microscopy structures of the human pre–B complex captured before U1 snRNP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ation at 3.3-angstrom core resolution and the human tri-snRNP at 2.9-angstrom resolution. U1 snRNP inserts the 5′SS–U1 snRNA helix between the two RecA domains of the Prp28 DEAD-box helicase. Adenosine 5′-triphosphate–dependent closure of the Prp28 RecA domains releases the 5′SS to pair with the nearby U6 ACAGAGA-box sequence presented as a mobile loop. The structures suggest that formation of the 5′SS-ACAGAGA helix triggers remodeling of an intricate protein-RNA network to induce Brr2 helicase relocation to its loading sequence in U4 snRNA, enabling Brr2 to unwind the U4/U6 snRNA duplex to allow U6 snRNA to form the catalytic center of the spliceosome.</p>

Building one molecule from a reservoir of two atoms

Subsequently, photoassociation forms an excited-state NaCs molecule.

Redox-sensitive alteration of replisome architecture safeguards genome integrity
<p>DNA replication requires coordination between replication fork progression and deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP)–generating metabolic pathways. We find that perturbation of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) in humans elevates reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are detected by peroxiredoxin 2 (PRDX2). In the oligomeric state, PRDX2 forms a replisome-associated ROS sensor, which binds the fork accelerator TIMELESS when exposed to low levels of ROS. Elevated ROS levels generated by RNR attenuation disrupt oligomerized PRDX2 to smaller subunits, whose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ation from chromatin enforces the displacement of TIMELESS from the replisome. This process instantly slows replication fork progression, which mitigates pathological consequences of replication stress. Thus, redox signaling couples fluctuations of dNTP biogenesis with replisome activity to reduce stress during genome duplication. We propose that cancer cells exploit this pathway to increase their adaptability to adverse metabolic conditions.</p>

These results suggest that in general, it is impossible to form flat two-dimensional nanocrystalline films of copper and other metals exhibiting small stacking fault energies and/or large elastic anisotropy, which induce a large anisotropy in the dislocation-line energy.</p>

Low-temperature activation of methane on the IrO<sub>2</sub>(110) surface
<p>Methane undergoes highly facile C–H bond cleavage on the stoichiometric IrO<sub>2</sub>(110) surface. From temperature-programmed reaction spectroscopy experiments, we found that methane molecularly adsorbed as a strongly bound σ complex on IrO<sub>2</sub>(110) and that a large fraction of the adsorbed complexes underwent C–H bond cleavage at temperatures as low as 150 kelvin (K). The initial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ation probability of methane on IrO<sub>2</sub>(110) decreased from 80 to 20% with increasing surface temperature from 175 to 300 K. We estimate that the activation energy for methane C–H bond cleavage is 9.5 kilojoule per mole (kJ/mol) lower than the binding energy of the adsorbed precursor on IrO<sub>2</sub>(110), and equal to a value of ~28.5 kJ/mol. Low-temperature activation may avoid unwanted side reactions in the development of catalytic processes to selectively convert methane to value-added products.</p>

Reovirus infection triggers inflammatory responses to dietary antigens and development of celiac disease
<p>Viral infections have been proposed to elicit pathological processes leading to the initiation of T helper 1 (T<sub>H</sub>1) immunity against dietary gluten and celiac disease (CeD). To test this hypothesis and gain insights into mechanisms underlying virus-induced loss of tolerance to dietary antigens, we developed a viral infection model that makes use of two reovirus strains that infect the intestine but differ in their immunopathological outcomes. Reovirus is an avirulent pathogen that elicits protective immunity, but we discovered that it can nonetheless disrupt intestinal immune homeostasis at inductive and effector sites of oral tolerance by suppressing peripheral regulatory T cell (pT<sub>reg</sub>) conversion and promoting T<sub>H</sub>1 immunity to dietary antigen. Initiation of T<sub>H</sub>1 immunity to dietary antigen was dependent on interferon regulatory factor 1 and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ated from suppression of pT<sub>reg</sub> conversion, which was mediated by type-1 interferon. Last, our study in humans supports a role for infection with reovirus, a seemingly innocuous virus, in triggering the development of CeD.</p>

Extremely efficient internal exciton dissociation through edge states in layered 2D perovskites
<p>Understanding and controlling charge and energy flow in state-of-the-art semiconductor quantum wells has enabled high-efficiency optoelectronic devices. Two-dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites are solution-processed quantum wells wherein the band gap can be tuned by varying the perovskite-layer thickness, which modulates the effective electron-hole confinement. We report that, counterintuitive to classical quantum-confined systems where photogenerated electrons and holes are strongly bound by Coulomb interactions or excitons, the photophysics of thin films made of Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites with a thickness exceeding two perovskite-crystal units (>1.3 nanometers) is dominated by lower-energy states associated with the local intrinsic electronic structure of the edges of the perovskite layers. These states provide a direct pathway for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ating excitons into longer-lived free carriers that substantially improve the performance of optoelectronic devices.</p>

The [4Fe4S] cluster of human DNA primase functions as a redox switch using DNA charge transport
<p>DNA charge transport chemistry offers a means of long-range, rapid redox signaling. We demonstrate that the [4Fe4S] cluster in human DNA primase can make use of this chemistry to coordinate the first steps of DNA synthesis. Using DNA electrochemistry, we found that a change in oxidation state of the [4Fe4S] cluster acts as a switch for DNA binding. Single-atom mutations that inhibit this charge transfer hinder primase initiation without affecting primase structure or polymerization. Generating a single base mismatch in the growing primer duplex, which attenuates DNA charge transport, inhibits primer truncation. Thus, redox signaling by [4Fe4S] clusters using DNA charge transport regulates primase binding to DNA and illustrates chemistry that may efficiently drive substrate handoff between polymerases during DNA replication.</p>

Optical control of cell signaling by single-chain photoswitchable kinases
<p>Protein kinases transduce signals to regulate a wide array of cellular functions in eukaryotes. A generalizable method for optical control of kinases would enable fine spatiotemporal interrogation or manipulation of these various functions.

We engineered a dimeric protein, pdDronpa, that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ates in cyan light and reassociates in violet light. Attaching two pdDronpa domains at rationally selected locations in the kinase domain, we created the photoswitchable kinases psRaf1, psMEK1, psMEK2, and psCDK5. Using these photoswitchable kinases, we established an all-optical cell-based assay for screening inhibitors, uncovered a direct and rapid inhibitory feedback loop from ERK to MEK1, and mediated developmental changes and synaptic vesicle transport in vivo using light.</p>

Observation of the Wigner-Huntington transition to metallic hydrogen
<p>Producing metallic hydrogen has been a great challenge in condensed matter physics. Metallic hydrogen may be a room-temperature superconductor and metastable when the pressure is released and could have an important impact on energy and rocketry. We have studied solid molecular hydrogen under pressure at low temperatures. At a pressure of 495 gigapascals, hydrogen becomes metallic, with reflectivity as high as 0.91. We fit the reflectance using a Drude free-electron model to determine the plasma frequency of 32.5 ± 2.1 electron volts at a temperature of 5.5 kelvin, with a corresponding electron carrier density of 7.7 ± 1.1 × 10<sup>23</sup> particles per cubic centimeter, which is consistent with theoretical estimates of the atomic density. The properties are those of an atomic metal. We have produced the Wigner-Huntington <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ative transition to atomic metallic hydrogen in the laboratory.</p>

Mechanistic basis for a molecular triage reaction
<p>Newly synthesized proteins are triaged between biosynthesis and degradation to maintain cellular homeostasis, but the decision-making mechanisms are unclear. We reconstituted the core reactions for membrane targeting and ubiquitination of nascent tail-anchored membrane proteins to understand how their fate is determined. The central six-component triage system is divided into an uncommitted client-SGTA complex, a self-sufficient targeting module, and an embedded but self-sufficient quality control module. Client-SGTA engagement of the targeting module induces rapid, private, and committed client transfer to TRC40 for successful biosynthesis. Commitment to ubiquitination is dictated primarily by comparatively slower client <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ation from SGTA and nonprivate capture by the BAG6 subunit of the quality control module.

Causal neural network of metamemory for retrospection in primates
<p>We know how confidently we know: Metacognitive self-monitoring of memory states, so-called “metamemory,” enables strategic and efficient information collection based on past experiences. However, it is unknown how metamemory is implemented in the brain. We explored causal neural mechanism of metamemory in macaque monkeys performing metacognitive confidence judgments on memory. By whole-brain searches via functional magnetic resonance imaging, we discovered a neural correlate of metamemory for temporally remote events in prefrontal area 9 (or 9/46d), along with that for recent events within area 6. Reversible inactivation of each of these identified loci induced doubly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ated selective impairments in metacognitive judgment performance on remote or recent memory, without impairing recognition performance itself. The findings reveal that parallel metamemory streams supervise recognition networks for remote and recent memory, without contributing to recognition itself.</p>

Structure of a yeast step II catalytically activated spliceosome
<p>Each cycle of precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) splicing comprises two sequential reactions, first freeing the 5′ exon and generating an intron lariat–3′ exon and then ligating the two exons and releasing the intron lariat. The second reaction is executed by the step II catalytically activated spliceosome (known as the C* complex). Here, we present the cryo–electron microscopy structure of a C* complex from <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> at an average resolution of 4.0 angstroms. Compared with the preceding spliceosomal complex (C complex), the lariat junction has been translocated by 15 to 20 angstroms to vacate space for the incoming 3′-exon sequences. The step I splicing factors Cwc25 and Yju2 have been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ated from the active site. Two catalytic motifs from Prp8 (the 1585 loop and the β finger of the ribonuclease H–like domain), along with the step II splicing factors Prp17 and Prp18 and other surrounding proteins, are poised to assist the second transesterification. These structural features, together with those reported for other spliceosomal complexes, yield a near-complete mechanistic picture on the splicing cycle.</p>

Coordination-induced weakening of ammonia, water, and hydrazine X–H bonds in a molybdenum complex

This bond weakening enables spontaneous dihydrogen evolution upon gentle heating, as well as the hydrogenation of styrene. Analogous molybdenum complexes promote dihydrogen evolution from coordinated water and hydrazine. Electrochemical and theoretical studies elucidate the contributions of metal redox potential and ammonia acidity to this effect.</p>

Pathological α-synuclein transmission initiated by binding lymphocyte-activation gene 3
<p>Emerging evidence indicates that the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD) may be due to cell-to-cell transmission of misfolded preformed fibrils (PFF) of α-synuclein (α-syn). The mechanism by which α-syn PFF spreads from neuron to neuron is not known. Here, we show that LAG3 (lymphocyte-activation gene 3) binds α-syn PFF with high affinity (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ation constant = 77 nanomolar), whereas the α-syn monomer exhibited minimal binding. α-Syn-biotin PFF binding to LAG3 initiated α-syn PFF endocytosis, transmission, and toxicity. Lack of LAG3 substantially delayed α-syn PFF–induced loss of dopamine neurons, as well as biochemical and behavioral deficits in vivo. The identification of LAG3 as a receptor that binds α-syn PFF provides a target for developing therapeutics designed to slow the progression of PD and related α-synucleinopathies.</p>

An Efficient System for <i>Ds</i> Transposon Tagging in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>
<p>Transposon tagging is a powerful tool that has been widely applied in several species for insertional mutagenesis in plants. Several efforts have aimed to create transfer-DNA (T-DNA) insertional mutant populations in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>, a monocot plant used as a model system to study temperate cereals, but there has been a lack of research aimed at using transposon strategies. Here, we describe the application of a maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) <i>Dissociation</i> (<i>Ds</i>) transposon tagging system in <i>B</i>. <i>distachyon</i>. The <i>35S</i>::<i>AcTPase</i> cassette and <i>Ds</i> element were constructed within the same T-DNA and transformed into <i>B</i>. <i>distachyon</i> plants. The <i>Ds</i> element was readily transposed to other chromosomes or to the same chromosome under the function of <i>Activator</i> (<i>Ac</i>) transposase. Through homologous chromosome synapsis, recombination, and segregation, the <i>Ds</i> element separated from the <i>Ac</i> element. We selected stable <i>Ds</i>-only plants using G418 and GFP assays and analyzed 241 T<sub>0</sub> lines, some of which were highly efficient at producing <i>Ds</i>-only progeny. Through thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR, we isolated 710 independent <i>Ds</i> flanking sequences from <i>Ds</i>-only plants. Furthermore, we identified a large collection of mutants with visible developmental phenotypes via this transposon tagging system. The system is relatively simple and rapid in comparison to traditional T-DNA insertion strategies, because once efficiency lines are obtained they can be reused to generate more lines from nontransposed plants without the use of time-consuming tissue culture steps.</p>

PROTEIN PHOSHATASE 2A B’<i>α</i> and <i>β</i> Maintain Centromeric Sister Chromatid Cohesion during Meiosis in Arabidopsis
<p>The correct separation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis I, and sister chromatids during meiosis II, relies on the tight control of the cohesion complex. The phosphorylation and subsequent cleavage of the meiotic recombination protein REC8 (REC8-like family protein [SYN1] in Arabidopsis [<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>]), the α-kleisin subunit of the cohesion ring, along the chromosome arms at meiosis I allows crossovers and separation of homologous chromosomes without chromatid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ation. REC8 continues to localize and function at the centromeres up to metaphase II and, in yeast and vertebrates, is protected from cleavage by means of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)-mediated dephosphorylation. Here, we show that, in plants, centromeric sister chromatid cohesion until meiosis II also requires the activity of a PP2A-type phosphatase complex. The combined absence of the regulatory subunits PP2AB′α and PP2AB′β leads to the premature loss of chromosome cohesion in meiosis I. Male meiocytes of the <i>pp2ab′αβ</i> double mutant display premature depletion of SYN1. The PP2AA1 structural and B′α regulatory subunit localize specifically to centromeres until metaphase II, supporting a role for the PP2A complex in the SYN1-mediated maintenance of centromeric cohesion in plant meiosis.</p>

Molecular Mechanisms of Photoadaptation of Photosystem I Supercomplex from an Evolutionary Cyanobacterial/Algal Intermediate
<p>The monomeric photosystem I-light-harvesting antenna complex I (PSI-LHCI) supercomplex from the extremophilic red alga <i>Cyanidioschyzon merolae</i> represents an intermediate evolutionary link between the cyanobacterial PSI reaction center and its green algal/higher plant counterpart. We show that the <i>C. merolae</i> PSI-LHCI supercomplex is characterized by robustness in various extreme conditions. By a combination of biochemical, spectroscopic, mass spectrometry, and electron microscopy/single particle analyses, we dissected three molecular mechanisms underlying the inherent robustness of the <i>C. merolae</i> PSI-LHCI supercomplex: (1) the accumulation of photoprotective zeaxanthin in the LHCI antenna and the PSI reaction center; (2) structural remodeling of the LHCI antenna and adjustment of the effective absorption cross section; and (3) dynamic readjustment of the stoichiometry of the two PSI-LHCI isomers and changes in the oligomeric state of the PSI-LHCI supercomplex, accompanied by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ation of the PsaK core subunit. We show that the largest low light-treated <i>C. merolae</i> PSI-LHCI supercomplex can bind up to eight Lhcr antenna subunits, which are organized as two rows on the PsaF/PsaJ side of the core complex. Under our experimental conditions, we found no evidence of functional coupling of the phycobilisomes with the PSI-LHCI supercomplex purified from various light conditions, suggesting that the putative association of this antenna with the PSI supercomplex is absent or may be lost during the purification procedure.</p>

Structure of eIF4E in Complex with an eIF4G Peptide Supports a Universal Bipartite Binding Mode for Protein Translation
<p>The association-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ation of the cap-binding protein eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) with eIF4G is a key control step in eukaryotic translation. The paradigm on the eIF4E-eIF4G interaction states that eIF4G binds to the dorsal surface of eIF4E through a single canonical alpha-helical motif, while metazoan eIF4E-binding proteins (m4E-BPs) advantageously compete against eIF4G via bimodal interactions involving this canonical motif and a second noncanonical motif of the eIF4E surface. Metazoan eIF4Gs share this extended binding interface with m4E-BPs, with significant implications on the understanding of translation regulation and the design of therapeutic molecules. Here we show the high-resolution structure of melon (<i>Cucumis melo</i>) eIF4E in complex with a melon eIF4G peptide and propose the first eIF4E-eIF4G structural model for plants. Our structural data together with functional analyses demonstrate that plant eIF4G binds to eIF4E through both the canonical and noncanonical motifs, similarly to metazoan eIF4E-eIF4G complexes. As in the case of metazoan eIF4E-eIF4G, this may have very important practical implications, as plant eIF4E-eIF4G is also involved in a significant number of plant diseases. In light of our results, a universal eukaryotic bipartite mode of binding to eIF4E is proposed.</p>

Regulatory Phosphorylation of Bacterial-Type PEP Carboxylase by the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-Dependent Protein Kinase RcCDPK1 in Developing Castor Oil Seeds
<p>Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) is a tightly controlled cytosolic enzyme situated at a crucial branch point of central plant metabolism. In developing castor oil seeds (<i>Ricinus communis</i>) a novel, allosterically desensitized 910-kD Class-2 PEPC hetero-octameric complex, arises from a tight interaction between 107-kD plant-type PEPC and 118-kD bacterial-type (BTPC) subunits. The native Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein kinase (CDPK) responsible for in vivo inhibitory phosphorylation of Class-2 PEPC’s BTPC subunit’s at Ser-451 was highly purified from COS and identified as RcCDPK1 (XP_002526815) by mass spectrometry. Heterologously expressed RcCDPK1 catalyzed Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent, inhibitory phosphorylation of BTPC at Ser-451 while exhibiting: (<i>i</i>) a pair of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding sites with identical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ation constants of 5.03 μM, (<i>ii</i>) a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent electrophoretic mobility shift, and (<i>iii</i>) a marked Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent hydrophobicity. Pull-down experiments established the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent interaction of N-terminal GST-tagged RcCDPK1 with BTPC. RcCDPK1-Cherry localized to the cytosol and nucleus of tobacco bright yellow-2 cells, but colocalized with mitochondrial-surface associated BTPC-enhanced yellow fluorescent protein when both fusion proteins were coexpressed. Deletion analyses demonstrated that although its N-terminal variable domain plays an essential role in optimizing Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent RcCDPK1 autophosphorylation and BTPC transphosphorylation activity, it is not critical for in vitro or in vivo target recognition. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) CPK4 and soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) CDPKβ are RcCDPK1 orthologs that effectively phosphorylated castor BTPC at Ser-451. Overall, the results highlight a potential link between cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and the posttranslational control of respiratory CO<sub>2</sub> refixation and anaplerotic photosynthate partitioning in support of storage oil and protein biosynthesis in developing COS.</p>

Heat Shock Protein HSP101 Affects the Release of Ribosomal Protein mRNAs for Recovery after Heat Shock
<p>Heat shock (HS) is known to have a profound impact on gene expression at different levels, such as inhibition of protein synthesis, in which HS blocks translation initiation and induces the sequestration of mRNAs into stress granules (SGs) or P-bodies for storage and/or decay. SGs prevent the degradation of the stored mRNAs, which can be reengaged into translation in the recovery period. However, little is known on the mRNAs stored during the stress, how these mRNAs are released from SGs afterward, and what the functional importance is of this process. In this work, we report that Arabidopsis <i>HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN101</i> (<i>HSP101</i>) knockout mutant (<i>hsp101</i>) presented a defect in translation recovery and SG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ation after HS. Using RNA sequencing and RNA immunoprecipitation approaches, we show that mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins (RPs) were preferentially stored during HS and that these mRNAs were released and translated in an HSP101-dependent manner during recovery. By <sup>15</sup>N incorporation and polysome profile analyses, we observed that these released mRNAs contributed to the production of new ribosomes to enhance translation. We propose that, after HS, HSP101 is required for the efficient release of RP mRNAs from SGs resulting in a rapid restoration of the translation machinery by producing new RPs.</p>

The Microtubule-Associated Protein MAP18 Affects ROP2 GTPase Activity during Root Hair Growth
<p>Establishment and maintenance of the polar site are important for root hair tip growth. We previously reported that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN18 (MAP18) functions in controlling the direction of pollen tube growth and root hair elongation. Additionally, the Rop GTPase ROP2 was reported as a positive regulator of both root hair initiation and tip growth in Arabidopsis. Both loss of function of <i>ROP2</i> and knockdown of <i>MAP18</i> lead to a decrease in root hair length, whereas overexpression of either <i>MAP18</i> or <i>ROP2</i> causes multiple tips or a branching hair phenotype. However, it is unclear whether MAP18 and ROP2 coordinately regulate root hair growth. In this study, we demonstrate that MAP18 and ROP2 interact genetically and functionally. MAP18 interacts physically with ROP2 in vitro and in vivo and preferentially binds to the inactive form of the ROP2 protein. MAP18 promotes ROP2 activity during root hair tip growth. Further investigation revealed that MAP18 competes with RhoGTPase GDP DISSOCIATION INHIBITOR1/SUPERCENTIPEDE1 for binding to ROP2, in turn affecting the localization of active ROP2 in the plasma membrane of the root hair tip. These results reveal a novel function of MAP18 in the regulation of ROP2 activation during root hair growth.</p>

Development of the prethalamus is crucial for thalamocortical projection formation and is regulated by Olig2
<p>Thalamocortical axons (TCAs) pass through the prethalamus in the first step of their neural circuit formation. Although it has been supposed that the prethalamus is an intermediate target for thalamocortical projection formation, much less is known about the molecular mechanisms of this targeting. Here, we demonstrated the functional implications of the prethalamus in the formation of this neural circuit. We show that Olig2 transcription factor, which is expressed in the ventricular zone (VZ) of prosomere 3, regulates prethalamus formation, and loss of Olig2 results in reduced prethalamus size in early development, which is accompanied by expansion of the thalamic eminence (TE). Extension of TCAs is disorganized in the <i>Olig2-KO</i> dorsal thalamus, and initial elongation of TCAs is retarded in the <i>Olig2-KO</i> forebrain. Microarray analysis demonstrated upregulation of several axon guidance molecules, including <i>Epha3</i> and <i>Epha5</i>, in the <i>Olig2-KO</i> basal forebrain. <i>In situ</i> hybridization showed that the prethalamus in the wild type excluded the expression of <i>Epha3</i> and <i>Epha5</i>, whereas loss of Olig2 resulted in reduction of this Ephas-negative area and the corresponding expansion of the Ephas-positive TE. Dissociated cultures of thalamic progenitor cells demonstrated that substrate-bound EphA3 suppresses neurite extension from dorsal thalamic neurons. These results indicate that Olig2 is involved in correct formation of the prethalamus, which leads to exclusion of the EphA3-expressing region and is crucial for proper TCA formation. Our observation is the first report showing the molecular mechanisms underlying how the prethalamus acts on initial thalamocortical projection formation.</p>

Overexpression of FAM19A5 markedly inhibited vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration and neointima formation in the carotid arteries of balloon-injured rats. Accordingly, FAM19A5 silencing in adipocytes significantly promoted vascular smooth muscle cell activation. Adipose-specific FAM19A5 transgenic mice showed greater attenuation of neointima formation compared with wild-type littermates fed with or without Western-style diet. We further revealed that sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 was the functional receptor for FAM19A5, with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ation constant (<i>K</i><sub>d</sub>) of 0.634 nmol/L. Inhibition of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 or its downstream G12/13-RhoA signaling circumvented the suppressive effects of FAM19A5 on vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We revealed that a novel adipokine, FAM19A5, was capable of inhibiting postinjury neointima formation via sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2-G12/13-RhoA signaling.

Multicellular Transcriptional Analysis of Mammalian Heart Regeneration
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The inability of the adult mammalian heart to regenerate following injury represents a major barrier in cardiovascular medicine. In contrast, the neonatal mammalian heart retains a transient capacity for regeneration, which is lost shortly after birth. Defining the molecular mechanisms that govern regenerative capacity in the neonatal period remains a central goal in cardiac biology. Here, we assemble a transcriptomic framework of multiple cardiac cell populations during postnatal development and following injury, which enables comparative analyses of the regenerative (neonatal) versus nonregenerative (adult) state for the first time.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, leukocytes, and endothelial cells from infarcted and noninfarcted neonatal (P1) and adult (P56) mouse hearts were isolated by enzymatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissoci</span></strong>ation and fluorescence-activated cell sorting at day 3 following surgery. RNA sequencing was performed on these cell populations to generate the transcriptome of the major cardiac cell populations during cardiac development, repair, and regeneration. To complement our transcriptomic data, we also surveyed the epigenetic landscape of cardiomyocytes during postnatal maturation by performing deep sequencing of accessible chromatin regions by using the Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin from purified mouse cardiomyocyte nuclei (P1, P14, and P56).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Profiling of cardiomyocyte and nonmyocyte transcriptional programs uncovered several injury-responsive genes across regenerative and nonregenerative time points. However, the majority of transcriptional changes in all cardiac cell types resulted from developmental maturation from neonatal stages to adulthood rather than activation of a distinct regeneration-specific gene program. Furthermore, adult leukocytes and fibroblasts were characterized by the expression of a proliferative gene expression network following infarction, which mirrored the neonatal state. In contrast, cardiomyocytes failed to reactivate the neonatal proliferative network following infarction, which was associated with loss of chromatin accessibility around cell cycle genes during postnatal maturation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This work provides a comprehensive framework and transcriptional resource of multiple cardiac cell populations during cardiac development, repair, and regeneration. Our findings define a regulatory program underpinning the neonatal regenerative state and identify alterations in the chromatin landscape that could limit reinduction of the regenerative program in adult cardiomyocytes.</p></sec>

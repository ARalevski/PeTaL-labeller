Loss of LOFSEP Transcription Factor Function Converts Spikelet to Leaf-Like Structures in Rice
<p><i>SEPALLATA</i> (<i>SEP</i>)-like genes, which encode a subfamily of MADS-box transcription factors, are essential for specifying floral organ and meristem identity in angiosperms. Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) has five <i>SEP</i>-like genes with partial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">redund</span></strong>ancy and overlapping expression domains, yet their functions and evolutionary conservation are only partially known. Here, we describe the biological role of one of the <i>SEP</i> genes of rice, <i>OsMADS5</i>, in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">redund</span></strong>antly controlling spikelet morphogenesis. <i>OsMADS5</i> belongs to the conserved <i>LOFSEP</i> subgroup along with <i>OsMADS1</i> and <i>OsMADS34</i>. <i>OsMADS5</i> was expressed strongly across a broad range of reproductive stages and tissues. No obvious phenotype was observed in the <i>osmads5</i> single mutants when compared with the wild type, which was largely due to the functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">redund</span></strong>ancy among the three <i>LOFSEP</i> genes. Genetic and molecular analyses demonstrated that <i>OsMADS1</i>, <i>OsMADS5</i>, and <i>OsMADS34</i> together regulate floral meristem determinacy and specify the identities of spikelet organs by positively regulating the other MADS-box floral homeotic genes. Experiments conducted in yeast also suggested that OsMADS1, OsMADS5, and OsMADS34 form protein-protein interactions with other MADS-box floral homeotic members, which seems to be a typical, conserved feature of plant SEP proteins.</p>

Can we predict which dysplastic hips will require acetabular augmentation during total hip arthroplasty based on pre-operative radiographs?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether an innovative   templating technique could predict the need for acetabular augmentation   during primary total hip arthroplasty for patients with dysplastic   hips.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We developed a simple templating technique to estimate acetabular   component coverage at total hip arthroplasty, the True Cup: False   Cup (TC:FC) ratio. We reviewed all patients with dysplastic hips   who underwent primary total hip arthroplasty between 2005 and 2012.   Traditional radiological methods of assessing the degree of acetabular dysplasia   (Sharp’s angle, Tönnis angle, centre-edge angle) as well as the   TC:FC ratio were measured from the pre-operative radiographs. A   comparison of augmented and non-augmented hips was undertaken to   determine any difference in pre-operative radiological indices between   the two cohorts. The intra- and inter-observer reliability for all   radiological indices used in the study were also calculated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of the 128 cases reviewed, 33 (26%) needed acetabular augmentation.   We found no difference in the median Sharp’s angle (p = 0.10), Tönnis   angle (p = 0.28), or centre-edge angle (p = 0.07) between the two   groups. A lower TC:FC ratio was observed in the augmented group   compared with the non-augmented group (median = 0.66 <i>versus</i> 0.88, p < 0.001).   Intra-observer reliability was found to be high for all radiological   indices analysed (interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) > 0.7).   However, inter-observer reliability was more variable and was only   high for the TC: FC ratio (ICC > 0.7).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The TC: FC ratio gives an accurate estimate of acetabular component   coverage. It can help predict which dysplastic hips are likely to   need acetabular augmentation at primary total hip arthroplasty.

A new and reliable classification system for fractures of the navicular and associated injuries to the midfoot
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Fractures of the navicular can occur in isolation but, owing   to the intimate anatomical and biomechanical relationships, are   often associated with other injuries to the neighbouring bones and   joints in the foot. As a result, they can lead to long-term morbidity   and poor function. Our aim in this study was to identify patterns   of injury in a new classification system of traumatic fractures   of the navicular, with consideration being given to the commonly associated   injuries to the midfoot.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We undertook a retrospective review of 285 consecutive patients   presenting over an eight- year period with a fracture of the navicular.   Five common patterns of injury were identified and classified according   to the radiological features. Type 1 fractures are dorsal avulsion   injuries related to the capsule of the talonavicular joint. Type   2 fractures are isolated avulsion injuries to the tuberosity of   the navicular. Type 3 fractures are a variant of tarsometatarsal   fracture/dislocations creating instability of the medial ray. Type   4 fractures involve the body of the navicular with no associated   injury to the lateral column and type 5 fractures occur in conjunction   with disruption of the midtarsal joint with crushing of the medial   or lateral, or both, columns of the foot.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In order to test the reliability and reproducibility of this   new classification, a cohort of 30 patients with a fracture of the   navicular were classified by six independent assessors at two separate   times, six months apart. Interobserver reliability and intraobserver   reproducibility both had substantial agreement, with kappa values   of 0.80 and 0.72, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We propose a logical, all-inclusive, and mutually exclusive classification   system for fractures of the navicular that gives associated injuries   involving the lateral column due consideration.

Unique BIR domain sets determine inhibitor of apoptosis protein–driven cell death and NOD2 complex signal specificity
<p>The mammalian IAPs, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 and 2 (cIAP1 and cIAP2), play pivotal roles in innate immune signaling and inflammatory homeostasis, often working in parallel or in conjunction at a signaling complex. IAPs direct both nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing 2 (NOD2) signaling complexes and cell death mechanisms to appropriately regulate inflammation. Although it is known that XIAP is critical for NOD2 signaling and that the loss of cIAP1 and cIAP2 blunts NOD2 activity, it is unclear whether these three highly related proteins can compensate for one another in NOD2 signaling or in mechanisms governing apoptosis or necroptosis. This potential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">redund</span></strong>ancy is critically important, given that genetic loss of XIAP causes both very early onset inflammatory bowel disease and X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome 2 (XLP-2) and that the overexpression of cIAP1 and cIAP2 is linked to both carcinogenesis and chemotherapeutic resistance. Given the therapeutic interest in IAP inhibition and the potential toxicities associated with disruption of inflammatory homeostasis, we used synthetic biology techniques to examine the functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">redund</span></strong>ancies of key domains in the IAPs. From this analysis, we defined the features of the IAPs that enable them to function at overlapping signaling complexes but remain independent and functionally exclusive in their roles as E3 ubiquitin ligases in innate immune and inflammatory signaling.</p>

Multiplex quantitative assays indicate a need for reevaluating reported small-molecule TrkB agonists
<p>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor, tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB), have emerged as key regulators of brain plasticity and represent disease-modifying targets for several brain disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease and major depressive disorder. Because of poor pharmacokinetic properties of BDNF, the interest in small-molecule TrkB agonists and modulators is high. Several compounds have been reported to act as TrkB agonists, and their increasing use in various nervous system disorder models creates the perception that these are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reliabl</span></strong>e probes. To examine key pharmacological parameters of these compounds in detail, we have developed and optimized a series of complementary quantitative assays that measure TrkB receptor activation, TrkB-dependent downstream signaling, and gene expression in different cellular contexts. Although BDNF and other neurotrophic factors elicited robust and dose-dependent receptor activation and downstream signaling, we were unable to reproduce these activities using the reported small-molecule TrkB agonists. Our findings indicate that experimental results obtained with these compounds must be carefully interpreted and highlight the challenge of developing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reliabl</span></strong>e pharmacological activators of this key molecular target.</p>

Anatomy of STEM teaching in North American universities
<p>A large body of evidence demonstrates that strategies that promote student interactions and cognitively engage students with content (<i>1</i>) lead to gains in learning and attitudinal outcomes for students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). Many educational and governmental bodies have called for and supported adoption of these student-centered strategies throughout the undergraduate STEM curriculum. But to the extent that we have pictures of the STEM undergraduate instructional landscape, it has mostly been provided through self-report surveys of faculty members, within a particular STEM discipline [e.g., (<i>3</i>–<i>6</i>)]. Such surveys are prone to reliability threats and can underestimate the complexity of classroom environments, and few are implemented nationally to provide valid and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reliabl</span></strong>e data (<i>7</i>). Reflecting the limited state of these data, a report from the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine called for improved data collection to understand the use of evidence-based instructional practices (<i>8</i>). We report here a major step toward a characterization of STEM teaching practices in North American universities based on classroom observations from over 2000 classes taught by more than 500 STEM faculty members across 25 institutions.</p>

Precursor processing for plant peptide hormone maturation by subtilisin-like serine proteinases
<p>Peptide hormones that regulate plant growth and development are derived from larger precursor proteins by proteolytic processing. Our study addressed the role of subtilisin-like proteinases (SBTs) in this process. Using tissue-specific expression of proteinase inhibitors as a tool to overcome functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">redund</span></strong>ancy, we found that SBT activity was required for the maturation of IDA (INFLORESCENCE DEFICIENT IN ABSCISSION), a peptide signal for the abscission of floral organs in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. We identified three SBTs that process the IDA precursor in vitro, and this processing was shown to be required for the formation of mIDA (the mature and bioactive form of IDA) as the endogenous signaling peptide in vivo. Hence, SBTs act as prohormone convertases in plants, and several functionally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">redund</span></strong>ant SBTs contribute to signal biogenesis.</p>

Sugar Transporter STP7 Specificity for <sc>l</sc>-Arabinose and <sc>d</sc>-Xylose Contrasts with the Typical Hexose Transporters STP8 and STP12
<p>The controlled distribution of sugars between assimilate-exporting source tissues and sugar-consuming sink tissues is a key element for plant growth and development. Monosaccharide transporters of the SUGAR TRANSPORT PROTEIN (STP) family contribute to the uptake of sugars into sink cells. Here, we report on the characterization of STP7, STP8, and STP12, three previously uncharacterized members of this family in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Heterologous expression in yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) revealed that STP8 and STP12 catalyze the high-affinity proton-dependent uptake of glucose and also accept galactose and mannose. STP12 additionally transports xylose. <i>STP8</i> and <i>STP12</i> are highly expressed in reproductive organs, where their protein products might contribute to sugar uptake into the pollen tube and the embryo sac. <i>stp8.1</i> and <i>stp12.1</i> T-DNA insertion lines developed normally, which may point toward functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">redund</span></strong>ancy with other STPs. In contrast to all other STPs, STP7 does not transport hexoses but is specific for the pentoses <sc>l</sc>-arabinose and <sc>d</sc>-xylose. <i>STP7-</i>promoter-reporter gene plants showed an expression of <i>STP7</i> especially in tissues with high cell wall turnover, indicating that STP7 might contribute to the uptake and recycling of cell wall sugars. Uptake analyses with radioactive <sc>l</sc>-arabinose revealed that 11 other STPs are able to transport <sc>l</sc>-arabinose with high affinity. Hence, functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">redund</span></strong>ancy might explain the missing-mutant phenotype of two <i>stp7</i> T-DNA insertion lines. Together, these data complete the characterization of the STP family and present the STPs as new <sc>l</sc>-arabinose transporters for potential biotechnological applications.</p>

Dynamics of Ethylene Production in Response to Compatible Nod Factor
<p>Establishment of symbiotic nitrogen-fixation in legumes is regulated by the plant hormone ethylene, but it has remained unclear whether and how its biosynthesis is regulated by the symbiotic pathway. We established a sensitive ethylene detection system for <i>Lotus japonicus</i> and found that ethylene production increased as early as 6 hours after inoculation with <i>Mesorhizobium loti</i>. This ethylene response was dependent on Nod factor production by compatible rhizobia. Analyses of nodulation mutants showed that perception of Nod factor was required for ethylene emission, while downstream transcription factors including CYCLOPS, NIN, and ERN1 were not required for this response. Activation of the nodulation signaling pathway in spontaneously nodulating mutants was also sufficient to elevate ethylene production. Ethylene signaling is controlled by EIN2, which is duplicated in <i>L. japonicus</i>. We obtained a <i>L. japonicus Ljein2a Ljein2b</i> double mutant that exhibits complete ethylene insensitivity and confirms that these two genes act <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">redund</span></strong>antly in ethylene signaling. Consistent with this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">redund</span></strong>ancy, both <i>LjEin2a</i> and <i>LjEin2b</i> are required for negative regulation of nodulation and <i>Ljein2a Ljein2b</i> double mutants are hypernodulating and hyperinfected. We also identified an unexpected role for ethylene in the onset of nitrogen fixation, with the <i>Ljein2a Ljein2b</i> double mutant showing severely reduced nitrogen fixation. These results demonstrate that ethylene production is an early and sustained nodulation response that acts at multiple stages to regulate infection, nodule organogenesis, and nitrogen fixation in <i>L. japonicus</i>.</p>

Roles of miR319 and TCP Transcription Factors in Leaf Development
<p>Sophisticated regulation of gene expression, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and their target genes, is required for leaf differentiation, growth, and senescence. The impact of miR319 and its target <i>TEOSINTE BRANCHED1</i>, <i>CYCLOIDEA</i>, and <i>PROLIFERATING CELL NUCLEAR ANTIGEN BINDING FACTOR</i> (<i>TCP</i>) genes on leaf development has been extensively investigated, but the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">redund</span></strong>ancies of these gene families often interfere with the evaluation of their function and regulation in the developmental context. Here, we present the genetic evidence of the involvement of the <i>MIR319</i> and <i>TCP</i> gene families in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaf development. Single mutations in <i>MIR319A</i> and <i>MIR319B</i> genes moderately inhibited the formation of leaf serrations, whereas double mutations increased the extent of this inhibition and resulted in the formation of smooth leaves. Mutations in <i>MIR319</i> and gain-of-function mutations in the <i>TCP4</i> gene conferred resistance against miR319 and impaired the cotyledon boundary and leaf serration formation. These mutations functionally associated with <i>CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON</i> genes, which regulate the cotyledon boundary and leaf serration formation. In contrast, loss-of-function mutations in miR319-targeted and nontargeted <i>TCP</i> genes cooperatively induced the formation of serrated leaves in addition to changes in the levels of their downstream gene transcript. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the <i>MIR319</i> and <i>TCP</i> gene families underlie robust and multilayer control of leaf development. This study also provides a framework toward future researches on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">redund</span></strong>ant miRNAs and transcription factors in Arabidopsis and crop plants.</p>

Optical Measurement of Stem Xylem Vulnerability
<p>The vulnerability of plant water transport tissues to a loss of function by cavitation during water stress is a key indicator of the survival capabilities of plant species during drought. Quantifying this important metric has been greatly advanced by noninvasive techniques that allow embolisms to be viewed directly in the vascular system. Here, we present a new method for evaluating the spatial and temporal propagation of embolizing bubbles in the stem xylem during imposed water stress. We demonstrate how the optical method, used previously in leaves, can be adapted to measure the xylem vulnerability of stems. Validation of the technique is carried out by measuring the xylem vulnerability of 13 conifers and two short-vesseled angiosperms and comparing the results with measurements made using the cavitron centrifuge method. Very close agreement between the two methods confirms the reliability of the new optical technique and opens the way to simple, efficient, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reliabl</span></strong>e assessment of stem vulnerability using standard flatbed scanners, cameras, or microscopes.</p>

<i>ATX3</i>, <i>ATX4</i>, and <i>ATX5</i> Encode Putative H3K4 Methyltransferases and Are Critical for Plant Development
<p>Methylation of Lys residues in the tail of the H3 histone is a key regulator of chromatin state and gene expression, conferred by a large family of enzymes containing an evolutionarily conserved SET domain. One of the main types of SET domain proteins are those controlling H3K4 di- and trimethylation. The genome of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) encodes 12 such proteins, including five ARABIDOPSIS TRITHORAX (ATX) proteins and seven ATX-Related proteins. Here, we examined three until-now-unexplored ATX proteins, ATX3, ATX4, and ATX5. We found that they exhibit similar domain structures and expression patterns and are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">redund</span></strong>antly required for vegetative and reproductive development. Concurrent disruption of the <i>ATX3</i>, <i>ATX4</i>, and <i>ATX5</i> genes caused marked reduction in H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 levels genome-wide and resulted in thousands of genes expressed ectopically. Furthermore, <i>atx3</i>/<i>atx4</i>/<i>atx5</i> triple mutants resulted in exaggerated phenotypes when combined with the <i>atx2</i> mutant but not with <i>atx1</i>. Together, we conclude that <i>ATX3</i>, <i>ATX4</i>, and <i>ATX5</i> are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">redund</span></strong>antly required for H3K4 di- and trimethylation at thousands of sites located across the genome, and genomic features associated with targeted regions are different from the <i>ATXR3</i>/<i>SDG2</i>-controlled sites in Arabidopsis.</p>

Transcription Factor Interplay between LEAFY and APETALA1/CAULIFLOWER during Floral Initiation<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The transcription factors LEAFY (LFY) and APETALA1 (AP1), together with the AP1 paralog CAULIFLOWER (CAL), control the onset of flower development in a partially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">redund</span></strong>ant manner. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">redund</span></strong>ancy is thought to be mediated, at least in part, through the regulation of a shared set of target genes. However, whether these genes are independently or cooperatively regulated by LFY and AP1/CAL is currently unknown. To better understand the regulatory relationship between LFY and AP1/CAL and to obtain deeper insights into the control of floral initiation, we monitored the activity of LFY in the absence of AP1/CAL function. We found that the regulation of several known LFY target genes is unaffected by AP1/CAL perturbation, while others appear to require AP1/CAL activity. Furthermore, we obtained evidence that LFY and AP1/CAL control the expression of some genes in an antagonistic manner. Notably, these include key regulators of floral initiation such as <i>TERMINAL FLOWER1</i> (<i>TFL1</i>), which had been previously reported to be directly repressed by both LFY and AP1. We show here that <i>TFL1</i> expression is suppressed by AP1 but promoted by LFY. We further demonstrate that LFY has an inhibitory effect on flower formation in the absence of AP1/CAL activity. We propose that LFY and AP1/CAL act as part of an incoherent feed-forward loop, a network motif where two interconnected pathways or transcription factors act in opposite directions on a target gene, to control the establishment of a stable developmental program for the formation of flowers.</p>

The RopGEF2-ROP7/ROP2 Pathway Activated by phyB Suppresses Red Light-Induced Stomatal Opening<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Circadian rhythm of stomatal aperture is mainly regulated by light/darkness. Blue and red light induce stomatal opening through different mechanisms that are mediated by special receptors. ROP2, a member of Rho GTPase family in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis</i> <i>thaliana</i>), has been found to negatively regulate light-induced stomatal opening. However, the upstream guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) RopGEFs have not been revealed, and it is unclear which photoreceptor is required for the action of RopGEFs-ROPs. Here, we showed that RopGEF2 acted as a negative regulator in phytochrome B (phyB)-mediated red light-induced stomatal opening. Meanwhile, ROP7, another member of ROP family, acting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">redund</span></strong>antly with ROP2, was regulated by RopGEF2 in this process. RopGEF2 interacted with ROP7 and ROP2 and enhanced their intrinsic nucleotide exchange rates. Furthermore, the direct interactions between phyB and RopGEF2 were detected in vitro and in plants, and phyB enhanced the GEF activity of RopGEF2 toward both ROP7 and ROP2 under light. In addition, RopGEF4 functioned <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">redund</span></strong>antly with RopGEF2 in red light-induced stomatal opening by activating both ROP7 and ROP2, and <i>RopGEF2</i>/<i>RopGEF4</i> acted genetically downstream of <i>phyB</i>; however, the GEF activity of RopGEF4 was not directly enhanced by phyB. These results revealed that red light-activated phyB enhances the GEF activities of RopGEF2 and RopGEF4 directly or indirectly, and then activate both ROP7 and ROP2 in guard cells. The negative mechanism triggered by phyB prevents the excessive stomatal opening under red light.</p>

Transcriptional Analysis of <i>serk1</i> and <i>serk3</i> Coreceptor Mutants
<p>Somatic embryogenesis receptor kinases (SERKs) are ligand-binding coreceptors that are able to combine with different ligand-perceiving receptors such as BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1 (BRI1) and FLAGELLIN-SENSITIVE2. Phenotypical analysis of <i>serk</i> single mutants is not straightforward because multiple pathways can be affected, while <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">redund</span></strong>ancy is observed for a single phenotype. For example, <i>serk1serk3</i> double mutant roots are insensitive toward brassinosteroids but have a phenotype different from <i>bri1</i> mutant roots. To decipher these effects, 4-d-old Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) roots were studied using microarray analysis. A total of 698 genes, involved in multiple biological processes, were found to be differentially regulated in <i>serk1-3serk3-2</i> double mutants. About half of these are related to brassinosteroid signaling. The remainder appear to be unlinked to brassinosteroids and related to primary and secondary metabolism. In addition, methionine-derived glucosinolate biosynthesis genes are up-regulated, which was verified by metabolite profiling. The results also show that the gene expression pattern in <i>serk3-2</i> mutant roots is similar to that of the <i>serk1-3serk3-2</i> double mutant roots. This confirms the existence of partial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">redund</span></strong>ancy between SERK3 and SERK1 as well as the promoting or repressive activity of a single coreceptor in multiple simultaneously active pathways.</p>

A new morphological classification for greater tuberosity fractures of the proximal humerus
<p>In this study, we describe a morphological classification   for greater tuberosity fractures of the proximal humerus. We divided   these fractures into three types: avulsion, split and depression.   We retrospectively reviewed all shoulder radiographs showing isolated   greater tuberosity fractures in a Level I trauma centre between   July 2007 and July 2012. We identified 199 cases where records and   radiographs were reviewed and included 79 men and 120 women with   a mean age of 58 years (23 to 96). The morphological classification   was applied to the first 139 cases by three reviewers on two occasions   using the Kappa statistic and compared with the AO and Neer classifications.   The inter- and intra-observer reliability of the morphological classification   was 0.73 to 0.77 and 0.69 to 0.86, respectively. This was superior   to the Neer (0.31 to 0.35/0.54 to 0.63) and AO (0.30 to 0.32/0.59   to 0.65) classifications. The distribution of avulsion, split and   depression type fractures was 39%, 41%, and 20%, respectively. This   classification of greater tuberosity fractures is more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reliabl</span></strong>e   than the Neer or AO classifications.

<p>Several radiological methods of measuring anteversion   of the acetabular component after total hip replacement (THR) have   been described. These studies used different definitions and reference   planes to compare methods, allowing for misinterpretation of the   results. We compared the reliability and accuracy of five current   methods using plain radiographs (those of Lewinnek, Widmer, Liaw,   Pradhan, and Woo and Morrey) with CT measurements, using the same   definition and reference plane. We retrospectively studied the plain   radiographs and CT scans in 84 hips of 84 patients who underwent   primary THR. Intra- and inter-observer reliability were high for   the measurement of inclination and anteversion with all methods   on plain radiographs and CT scans. The measurements of inclination on   plain radiographs were similar to the measurements using CT (p =   0.043). The mean difference between CT measurements was 0.6° (-5.9°   to 6.8°).</p><p>Measurements using Widmer’s method were the most similar to those   using CT (p = 0.088), with a mean difference between CT measurements   of -0.9° (-10.4° to 9.1°), whereas the other four methods differed   significantly from those using CT (p < 0.001).</p><p>This study has shown that Widmer’s method is the best for evaluating   the anteversion of the acetabular component on plain radiographs.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014; 96-B:597–603.</p>

Analysis of Arabidopsis Accessions Hypersensitive to a Loss of Chloroplast Translation
<p>Natural accessions of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) differ in their ability to tolerate a loss of chloroplast translation. These differences can be attributed in part to variation in a duplicated nuclear gene (<i>ACC2</i>) that targets homomeric acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACCase) to plastids. This functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">redund</span></strong>ancy allows limited fatty acid biosynthesis to occur in the absence of heteromeric ACCase, which is encoded in part by the plastid genome. In the presence of functional <i>ACC2</i>, tolerant alleles of several nuclear genes, not yet identified, enhance the growth of seedlings and embryos disrupted in chloroplast translation. <i>ACC2</i> knockout mutants, by contrast, are hypersensitive. Here we describe an expanded search for hypersensitive accessions of Arabidopsis, evaluate whether all of these accessions are defective in <i>ACC2</i>, and characterize genotype-to-phenotype relationships for homomeric ACCase variants identified among 855 accessions with sequenced genomes. Null alleles with <i>ACC2</i> nonsense mutations, frameshift mutations, small deletions, genomic rearrangements, and defects in RNA splicing are included among the most sensitive accessions examined. By contrast, most missense mutations affecting highly conserved residues failed to eliminate ACC2 function. Several accessions were identified where sensitivity could not be attributed to a defect in either ACC2 or Tic20-IV, the chloroplast membrane channel required for ACC2 uptake. Overall, these results underscore the central role of <i>ACC2</i> in mediating Arabidopsis response to a loss of chloroplast translation, highlight future applications of this system to analyzing chloroplast protein import, and provide valuable insights into the mutational landscape of an important metabolic enzyme that is highly conserved throughout eukaryotes.</p>

Reconstruction of Haplotype-Blocks Selected during Experimental Evolution
<p>The genetic analysis of experimentally evolving populations typically relies on short reads from pooled individuals (Pool-Seq). While this method provides <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reliabl</span></strong>e allele frequency estimates, the underlying haplotype structure remains poorly characterized. With small population sizes and adaptive variants that start from low frequencies, the interpretation of selection signatures in most Evolve and Resequencing studies remains challenging. To facilitate the characterization of selection targets, we propose a new approach that reconstructs selected haplotypes from replicated time series, using Pool-Seq data. We identify selected haplotypes through the correlated frequencies of alleles carried by them. Computer simulations indicate that selected haplotype-blocks of several Mb can be reconstructed with high confidence and low error rates, even when allele frequencies change only by 20% across three replicates. Applying this method to real data from <i>D. melanogaster</i> populations adapting to a hot environment, we identify a selected haplotype-block of 6.93 Mb. We confirm the presence of this haplotype-block in evolved populations by experimental haplotyping, demonstrating the power and accuracy of our haplotype reconstruction from Pool-Seq data. We propose that the combination of allele frequency estimates with haplotype information will provide the key to understanding the dynamics of adaptive alleles.</p>

TCS: A New Multiple Sequence Alignment Reliability Measure to Estimate Alignment Accuracy and Improve Phylogenetic Tree Reconstruction
<p>Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is a key modeling procedure when analyzing biological sequences. Homology and evolutionary modeling are the most common applications of MSAs. Both are known to be sensitive to the underlying MSA accuracy. In this work, we show how this problem can be partly overcome using the transitive consistency score (TCS), an extended version of the T-Coffee scoring scheme. Using this local evaluation function, we show that one can identify the most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reliabl</span></strong>e portions of an MSA, as judged from BAliBASE and PREFAB structure-based reference alignments. We also show how this measure can be used to improve phylogenetic tree reconstruction using both an established simulated data set and a novel empirical yeast data set. For this purpose, we describe a novel lossless alternative to site filtering that involves overweighting the trustworthy columns. Our approach relies on the T-Coffee framework; it uses libraries of pairwise alignments to evaluate any third party MSA. Pairwise projections can be produced using fast or slow methods, thus allowing a trade-off between speed and accuracy. We compared TCS with Heads-or-Tails, GUIDANCE, Gblocks, and trimAl and found it to lead to significantly better estimates of structural accuracy and more accurate phylogenetic trees. The software is available from <ext-link>www.tcoffee.org/Projects/tcs</ext-link>.</p>

The Evolution of Genes within Genes and the Control of DNA Replication in Microviruses
<p>Single-stranded DNA(ssDNA) viral life cycles must balance double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and ssDNA biosynthesis. Previously published in vitro results suggest that microvirus C and host cell SSB proteins play antagonistic roles to achieve this balance. To investigate this in vivo, microvirus DNA replication was characterized in cells expressing cloned C or <i>ssb</i> genes, which would presumably alter the C:SSB protein ratios. Representatives of each microvirus clade (φX174, G4, and α3) were used in these studies. α3 DNA replication was significantly more complex. Results suggested that the recognized α3 C gene (C<sub>S</sub>: small) is one of two C genes. A larger 5′ extended gene could be translated from an upstream GTG start codon (C<sub>B</sub>: big). Wild-type α3 acquired resistance to elevated SSB levels by mutations that exclusively frameshifted the C<sub>B</sub> reading frame, whereas mutations in the origin of replication conferred resistance to elevated C protein levels. Expression of either the cloned C<sub>B</sub> or C<sub>S</sub> gene complemented <i>am(C)</i> mutants, demonstrating functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">redund</span></strong>ancy. When the C<sub>S</sub> start codon was eliminated, strains were only viable if an additional amber mutation was placed in gene C and propagated in an informational suppressing host. Thus, C<sub>B</sub> protein likely reaches toxic levels in the absence of C<sub>S</sub> translation. This phenomenon may have driven the evolution of the C<sub>S</sub> gene within the larger C<sub>B</sub> gene and could constitute a unique mechanism of regulation. Furthermore, cross-complementation data suggested that interactions between the α3 C and other viral proteins have evolved enough specificity to biochemically isolate its DNA replication from G4 and φX174.</p>

Heart rate as a predictor of metabolic rate in heterothermic bats
<p>While heart rate (<i>f</i><sub>H</sub>) has been used as an indicator of energy expenditure, quantitative data showing the relationship between these variables are only available for normothermic animals. To determine whether <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> also predicts oxygen consumption ([Formula]) during torpor, we simultaneously measured [Formula], <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> and subcutaneous body temperature (<i>T</i><sub>sub</sub>) of a hibernator, Gould's long-eared bats (<i>Nyctophilus gouldi</i>, 9 g, <i>N</i>=18), at ambient temperatures (<i>T</i><sub>a</sub>) between 0 and 25°C. At rest, <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> of normothermic resting bats was negatively correlated with <i>T</i><sub>a</sub>, with maximum <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> of 803 beats min<sup>−1</sup> (<i>T</i><sub>a</sub>=5°C). During torpor, the relationship between <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> and <i>T</i><sub>a</sub> was curvilinear, and at low <i>T</i><sub>sub</sub> (~6°C), <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> fell to a minimum average of 8 beats min<sup>−1</sup>. The minimum average values for both [Formula] and <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> in torpor reported here were among the lowest recorded for bats. The relationship between <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> and [Formula] was significant for both resting (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>=0.64, <i>P</i><0.001) and torpid bats (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>=0.84, <i>P</i><0.001), with no overlap between the two states. These variables were also significantly correlated (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>=0.44, <i>P</i><0.001) for entire torpor bouts. Moreover, estimates of [Formula] from <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> did not differ significantly from measured values during the different physiological states. Our study is the first to investigate the accuracy of <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> as a predictor of [Formula] during torpor and indicates the reliability of this method as a potential measure of energy expenditure in the field. Nevertheless, <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> should only be used to predict [Formula] within the range of activities for which robust correlations have been established.</p>

<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Computer hexapod assisted orthopaedic surgery (CHAOS), is a method   to achieve the intra-operative correction of long bone deformities   using a hexapod external fixator before definitive internal fixation   with minimally invasive stabilisation techniques.</p><p>The aims of this study were to determine the reliability of this   method in a consecutive case series of patients undergoing femoral   deformity correction, with a minimum six-month follow-up, to assess   the complications and to define the ideal group of patients for   whom this treatment is appropriate.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The medical records and radiographs of all patients who underwent   CHAOS for femoral deformity at our institution between 2005 and   2011 were retrospectively reviewed. Records were available for all   55 consecutive procedures undertaken in 49 patients with a mean   age of 35.6 years (10.9 to 75.3) at the time of surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Patients were assessed at a mean interval of 44 months (6 to   90) following surgery. The indications were broad; the most common   were vitamin D resistant rickets (n = 10), growth plate arrest (n   = 6) and post-traumatic deformity (n = 20).</p><p>Multi-planar correction was required in 33 cases. A single level   osteotomy was performed in 43 cases. Locking plates were used to   stabilise the osteotomy in 33 cases and intramedullary nails in   the remainder. Complications included two nonunions, one death,   one below-knee deep vein thrombosis, one deep infection and one   revision procedure due to initial under-correction. There were no   neurovascular injuries or incidence of compartment syndrome.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This is the largest reported series of femoral deformity corrections   using the CHAOS technique. This series demonstrates that precise   intra-operative realignment is possible with a hexapod external   fixator prior to definitive stabilisation with contemporary internal   fixation. This combination allows reproducible correction of complex femoral   deformity from a wide variety of diagnoses and age range with a   low complication rate.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:283–8.</p></sec>

High prevalence of acetabular retroversion in asymptomatic adults
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>This study sought to establish the prevalence of the cross over   sign (COS) and posterior wall sign (PWS) in relation to the anterior   pelvic plane (APP) in an asymptomatic population through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reliabl</span></strong>e   and accurate 3D-CT based assessment.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Data from pelvic CT scans of 100 asymptomatic subjects (200 hips)   undertaken for conditions unrelated to disorders of the hip were   available for analysis in this study. A previously established 3D   analysis method was applied to assess the prevalence of the COS   and PWS in relation to the APP.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of the 200 included hips, 24% (48) presented a positive COS and   5.5% (11) presented a positive PWS. A combination of COS and PWS   was observed in 1% (two) of all hips (1%). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The high incidence of acetabular retroversion, determined by   the COS, shows that this anatomic configuration may not differ in   frequency between asymptomatic individuals and patients with symptomatic   femoroacetabular impingement (FAI).</p><p>Patients presenting with hip pain and evidence of FAI should   be subjected to strict diagnostic scrutiny and evaluated in the   sum of their clinical and radiological presentation. In our cohort   of asymptomatic adults, the COS showed a higher incidence than the   PWS or a combined COS/PWS.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1584–9.</p></sec>

Measuring the migration of the components and polyethylene wear after total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>This paper describes the methodology, validation and reliability   of a new computer-assisted method which uses models of the patient’s   bones and the components to measure their migration and polyethylene   wear from radiographs after total hip arthroplasty (THA).</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Models of the patient’s acetabular and femoral component obtained   from the manufacturer and models of the patient’s pelvis and femur   built from a single computed tomography (CT) scan, are used by a   computer program to measure the migration of the components and   the penetration of the femoral head from anteroposterior and lateral radiographs   taken at follow-up visits. The program simulates the radiographic   setup and matches the position and orientation of the models to   outlines of the pelvis, the acetabular and femoral component, and   femur on radiographs. Changes in position and orientation reflect   the migration of the components and the penetration of the femoral   head. Validation was performed using radiographs of phantoms simulating   known migration and penetration, and the clinical feasibility of   measuring migration was assessed in two patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Migration of the acetabular and femoral components can be measured   with limits of agreement (LOA) of 0.37 mm and 0.33 mm, respectively.   Penetration of the femoral head can be measured with LOA of 0.161   mm.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The migration of components and polyethylene wear can be measured   without needing specialised radiographs. Accurate measurement may   allow earlier prediction of failure after THA.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1290–7.</p></sec>

The use of ultra-low-dose CT scans for the evaluation of limb fractures
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To evaluate whether an ultra-low-dose CT protocol can diagnose   selected limb fractures as well as conventional CT (C-CT).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We prospectively studied 40 consecutive patients with a limb   fracture in whom a CT scan was indicated. These were scanned using   an ultra-low-dose CT Reduced Effective Dose Using Computed Tomography   In Orthopaedic Injury (REDUCTION) protocol. Studies from 16 selected   cases were compared with 16 C-CT scans matched for age, gender and   type of fracture. Studies were assessed for diagnosis and image   quality. Descriptive and reliability statistics were calculated.   The total effective radiation dose for each scanned site was compared.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean estimated effective dose (ED) for the REDUCTION protocol   was 0.03 milliSieverts (mSv) and 0.43 mSv (p < 0.005) for C-CT.   The sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value   (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the REDUCTION protocol   to detect fractures were 0.98, 0.89, 0.98 and 0.89 respectively   when two occult fractures were excluded. Inter- and intra-observer   reliability for diagnosis using the REDUCTION protocol (κ = 0.75, κ =   0.71) were similar to those of C-CT (κ = 0.85, κ = 0.82). Using   the REDUCTION protocol, 3D CT reconstructions were equivalent in   quality and diagnostic information to those generated by C-CT (κ =   0.87, κ = 0.94).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>With a near 14-fold reduction in estimated ED compared with C-CT,   the REDUCTION protocol reduces the amount of CT radiation substantially   without significant diagnostic decay. It produces images that appear   to be comparable with those of C-CT for evaluating fractures of   the limbs.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2016;98-B:1668-73.</p></sec>

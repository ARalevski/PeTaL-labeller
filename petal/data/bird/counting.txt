Use of a Single Baseline Versus Multiyear 24-Hour Urine Collection for Estimation of Long-Term Sodium Intake and Associated Cardiovascular and Renal Risk
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>A decrease in sodium intake has been shown to lower blood pressure, but data from cohort studies on the association with cardiovascular and renal outcomes are inconsistent. In these studies, sodium intake was often <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated with a single baseline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement, which may be inaccurate considering day-to-day changes in sodium intake and sodium excretion. We compared the effects of single versus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">repetit</span></strong>ive follow-up 24-hour urine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es on the relation between sodium intake and long-term cardiorenal outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We selected adult subjects with an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated glomerular filtration rate >60 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>, an outpatient 24-hour urine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e between 1998 and 1999, and at least 1 collection during a 17-year follow-up. Sodium intake was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated with a single baseline collection and the average of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es collected during a 1-, 5-, and 15-year follow-up. We used Cox regression analysis and the landmark approach to investigate the relation between sodium intake and cardiovascular (cardiovascular events or mortality) and renal (end-stage renal disease: dialysis, transplantation, and/or >60% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated glomerular filtration rate decline, or mortality) outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We included 574 subjects with 9776 twenty-four–hour urine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es. Average age was 47 years, and 46% were male. Median follow-up was 16.2 years. Average 24-hour sodium excretion, ranging from 3.8 to 3.9 g (165–170 mmol), was equal among all methods (<i>P</i>=0.88). However, relative to a single baseline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement, 50% of the subjects had a >0.8-g (>34-mmol) difference in sodium intake with long-term <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ations. As a result, 45%, 49%, and 50% of all subjects switched between tertiles of sodium intake when the 1-, 5-, or 15-year average was used, respectively. Consequently, hazard ratios for cardiorenal outcome changed up to 85% with the use of sodium intake <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ations from short-term (1-year) and long-term (5-year) follow-up instead of baseline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ations.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Relative to a single baseline 24-hour sodium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement, the use of subsequent 24-hour urine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es resulted in different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ations of an individual’s sodium intake, whereas population averages remained similar. This finding had significant consequences for the association between sodium intake and long-term cardiovascular and renal outcomes.</p></sec>

Fasting Versus Nonfasting and Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Accuracy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Recent recommendations favoring nonfasting lipid assessment may affect low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ation. The novel method of LDL-C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ation (LDL-C<sub>N</sub>) uses a flexible approach to derive patient-specific ratios of triglycerides to very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. This adaptability may confer an accuracy advantage in nonfasting patients over the fixed approach of the classic Friedewald method (LDL-C<sub>F</sub>).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used a US cross-sectional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e of 1 545  634 patients (959 153 fasting ≥10–12 hours; 586 481 nonfasting) from the second harvest of the Very Large Database of Lipids study to assess for the first time the impact of fasting status on novel LDL-C accuracy.

For low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated LDL-C (<70 mg/dL), we evaluated accuracy by triglyceride levels. The magnitude of absolute and percent differences between LDL-C<sub>D</sub> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated LDL-C (LDL-C<sub>N</sub> or LDL-C<sub>F</sub>) was stratified by LDL-C and triglyceride categories.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In both fasting and nonfasting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es, accuracy was higher with the novel method across all clinical LDL-C categories (range, 87%–94%) compared with the Friedewald <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ation (range, 71%–93%; <i>P</i>≤0.001). With LDL-C <70 mg/dL, nonfasting LDL-C<sub>N</sub> accuracy (92%) was superior to LDL-C<sub>F</sub> accuracy (71%; <i>P</i><0.001). In this LDL-C range, 19% of fasting and 30% of nonfasting patients had differences ≥10 mg/dL between LDL-C<sub>F</sub> and LDL-C<sub>D</sub>, whereas only 2% and 3% of patients, respectively, had similar differences with novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ation.

Measuring the ratio of CO<sub>2</sub> efflux to O<sub>2</sub> influx in tree stem respiration
<p>In recent studies, the ratio of tree stem CO<sub>2</sub> efflux to O<sub>2</sub> influx has been defined as the apparent respiratory quotient (ARQ). The metabolism of carbohydrates, the putative respiratory substrate in trees, is expected to yield an ARQ of 1.0. However, previous studies have reported ARQ values ranging between 0.23 and 0.90. These interesting results may indicate internal transport of respired CO<sub>2</sub> within stems; yet no simple field applicable methods for ARQ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement have been available. Here, we report on the assembly of a closed circulating system called ‘<i>Hampadah</i>’, which uses CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> analyzers to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e air <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es from stem chambers. We tested the performance of the <i>Hampadah</i> with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es from 36 trees (<i>Tetragastris panamensis</i> (Engl.) Kuntze). Additionally, we showed the feasibility of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ing ARQ directly from stem chambers, using portable CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> sensors, in both discrete and continuous modes of operation. The <i>Hampadah</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement proved to be consistent with CO<sub>2</sub> gas standards (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.999) and with O<sub>2</sub> determined by O<sub>2</sub>/Ar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements with a mass spectrometer (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.998). The <i>Hampadah</i> gave highly reproducible results for ARQ determination of field <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es (±0.01 for duplicates). The portable sensors <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement showed good correlation with the <i>Hampadah</i> in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ing CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub> and ARQ (<i>n</i> = 5, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.97, 0.98 and 0.91, respectively). We have demonstrated here that the <i>Hampadah</i> and the sensors’ methods enable accurate ARQ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements for both laboratory and field research.</p>

Effect of source/sink ratios on yield components, growth dynamics and structural characteristics of oil palm (<i>Elaeis guineensis</i>) bunches
<p>Source/sink ratios are known to be one of the main determinants of oil palm growth and development. A long-term experiment (9 years) was conducted in Indonesia on mature oil palms subjected to continuous bunch ablation and partial defoliation treatments to artificially modify source/sink ratios. During the experiment, all harvested bunches were dissected and phenological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements were carried out to analyse the effect of source/sink ratios on yield components explaining variations in bunch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong>, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> of fruits per bunch and oil dry weight per fruit. An integrative variable (supply/demand ratio) describing the ratio between the assimilate supply from sources and the growing organ demand for carbohydrate was computed for each plant on a daily basis from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ations of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> of developing organs and their sink strength, and of climate variables. Defoliation and bunch ablation affected the bunch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> and the fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> per bunch. Variations in bunch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> per month were mainly due to variations in the fraction of aborted inflorescence and in the ratio between female and male inflorescences. Under fluctuating trophic conditions, variations in fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> per bunch resulted both from changes in fruit-set and in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> of branches (rachillae) per inflorescence. For defoliated plants, the decrease in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> of developing reproductive sinks appeared to be sufficient to maintain fruit weight and oil concentration at the control level, without any major decrease in the concentration of non-structural carbohydrate reserves. Computation of the supply/demand ratio revealed that each yield component had a specific phase of sensitivity to supply/demand ratios during inflorescence development. Establishing quantitative relationships between supply/demand ratios, competition and yield components is the first step towards a functional model for oil palm.</p>

Measurement of a superconducting qubit with a microwave photon counter
<p>Fast, high-fidelity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement is a key ingredient for quantum error correction. Conventional approaches to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement of superconducting qubits, involving linear amplification of a microwave probe tone followed by heterodyne detection at room temperature, do not scale well to large system sizes. We introduce an approach to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement based on a microwave photon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">counter</span></strong> demonstrating raw single-shot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement fidelity of 92%. Moreover, the intrinsic damping of the photon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">counter</span></strong> is used to extract the energy released by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement process, allowing repeated high-fidelity quantum nondemolition <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements. Our scheme provides access to the classical outcome of projective quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement at the millikelvin stage and could form the basis for a scalable quantum-to-classical interface.</p>

An analysis of the best method for evaluating anteversion of the acetabular component after total hip replacement on plain radiographs
<p>Several radiological methods of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ing anteversion   of the acetabular component after total hip replacement (THR) have   been described. These studies used different definitions and reference   planes to compare methods, allowing for misinterpretation of the   results. We compared the reliability and accuracy of five current   methods using plain radiographs (those of Lewinnek, Widmer, Liaw,   Pradhan, and Woo and Morrey) with CT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements, using the same   definition and reference plane. We retrospectively studied the plain   radiographs and CT scans in 84 hips of 84 patients who underwent   primary THR.

Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Frequencies of Known Haplotypes from Pooled Sequence Data
<p>DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es are often pooled, either by experimental design or because the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e itself is a mixture. For example, when population allele frequencies are of primary interest, individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es may be pooled together to lower the cost of sequencing. Alternatively, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e itself may be a mixture of multiple species or strains (e.g., bacterial species comprising a microbiome or pathogen strains in a blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e). We present an expectation–maximization algorithm for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ating haplotype frequencies in a pooled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e directly from mapped sequence reads, in the case where the possible haplotypes are known. This method is relevant to the analysis of pooled sequencing data from selection experiments, as well as the calculation of proportions of different species within a metagenomics <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e. Our method outperforms existing methods based on single-site allele frequencies, as well as simple approaches using sequence read data. We have implemented the method in a freely available open-source software tool.</p>

Particulate Matter Air Pollution Exposure and Heart Disease Mortality Risks by Race and Ethnicity in the United States
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Most US studies of mortality and air pollution have been conducted on largely non-Hispanic white study populations.

An empirical study of the wound effect on sap flux density measured with thermal dissipation probes
<p>The insertion of thermal dissipation (TD) sensors on tree stems for sap flux density (SFD) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements can lead to SFD under<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ations due to a wound formation close to the drill hole. However, the wound effect has not been assessed experimentally for this method yet. Here, we propose an empirical approach to investigate the effect of the wound healing on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed sap flux with TD probes. The approach was performed for both, diffuse-porous (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i> (Linnaeus)) and ring-porous (<i>Quercus petraea</i> (Lieblein)) species. Thermal dissipation probes were installed on different dates along the growing season to document the effects of the dynamic wound formation. The trees were cut in autumn and additional sensors were installed in the cut stems, therefore, without potential effects of wound development. A range of water pressures was applied to the stem segments and SFDs were simultaneously <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed by TD sensors as well as gravimetrically in the laboratory. The formation of wounds around sensors installed in living tree stems led to under<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ation of SFD by 21.4 ± 3 and 47.5 ± 3.8% in beech and oak, respectively. The differences between SFD under<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ations of diffuse-porous beech and ring-porous oak were, however, not statistically significant. Sensors with 5-, 11- and 22-week-old wounds also showed no significant differences, which implies that the influence of wound formation on SFD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ates was completed within the first few weeks after perforation. These results were confirmed by time courses of SFD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements in the field. Field SFD values decreased immediately after sensor installation and reached stable values after ~2 weeks with similar under<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ations to the ones <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed in the laboratory. We therefore propose a feasible approach to correct directly field <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ations of SFD for potential under<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ations due to the wound effect.</p>

Spatial entanglement patterns and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering in Bose-Einstein condensates
<p>Many-particle entanglement is a fundamental concept of quantum physics that still presents conceptual challenges. Although nonclassical states of atomic ensembles were used to enhance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement precision in quantum metrology, the notion of entanglement in these systems was debated because the correlations among the indistinguishable atoms were witnessed by collective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements only.

We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>e entanglement that is strong enough for Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering: We can predict <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement outcomes for noncommuting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ables in one spatial region on the basis of corresponding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements in another region with an inferred uncertainty product below the Heisenberg uncertainty bound.

Quantum correlations from a room-temperature optomechanical cavity
<p>The act of position <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement alters the motion of an object being <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed. This quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement backaction is typically much smaller than the thermal motion of a room-temperature object and thus difficult to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>e.

Light Sheet Microscopy Imaging of Light Absorption and Photosynthesis Distribution in Plant Tissue
<p>In vivo variable chlorophyll fluorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements of photosystem II (PSII) quantum yields in optically dense systems are complicated by steep tissue light gradients due to scattering and absorption. Consequently, externally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed effective PSII quantum yields may be composed of signals derived from cells differentially exposed to actinic light, where cells located deeper inside tissues receive lower irradiance than cells closer to the surface and can display distinct photophysiological status. We demonstrate how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed distributions of PSII quantum yields in plant tissue change under natural tissue light gradients as compared with conventionally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed quantum yields with even exposure to actinic light. This was achieved by applying actinic irradiance perpendicular to one side of thallus cross sections of the aquatic macrophyte <i>Fucus vesiculosus</i> with laser light sheets of defined spectral composition, while imaging variable chlorophyll fluorescence from cross sections with a microscope-mounted pulse amplitude-modulated imaging system. We show that quantum yields are highly affected by light gradients and that traditional surface-based variable chlorophyll fluorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements result in substantial under<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ations and/or over<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ations, depending on incident actinic irradiance. We present a method for using chlorophyll fluorescence profiles in combination with integrating sphere <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements of reflectance and transmittance to calculate depth-resolved photon absorption profiles, which can be used to correct apparent PSII electron transport rates to photons absorbed by PSII. Absorption profiles of the investigated aquatic macrophyte were different in shape from what is typically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed in terrestrial leaves, and based on this finding, we discuss strategies for optimizing photon absorption via modulation of the structural organization of phytoelements according to in situ light environments.</p>

Seasonal Regulation of Petal Number
<p>Four petals characterize the flowers of most species in the Brassicaceae family, and this phenotype is generally robust to genetic and environmental variation. A variable petal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> distinguishes the flowers of <i>Cardamine hirsuta</i> from those of its close relative Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), and allelic variation at many loci contribute to this trait. However, it is less clear whether <i>C. hirsuta</i> petal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> varies in response to seasonal changes in environment. To address this question, we assessed whether petal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> responds to a suite of environmental and endogenous cues that regulate flowering time in <i>C. hirsuta</i>. We found that petal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> showed seasonal variation in <i>C. hirsuta</i>, such that spring flowering plants developed more petals than those flowering in summer. Conditions associated with spring flowering, including cool ambient temperature, short photoperiod, and vernalization, all increased petal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> in <i>C. hirsuta</i>. Cool temperature caused the strongest increase in petal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> and lengthened the time interval over which floral meristems matured. We performed live imaging of early flower development and showed that floral buds developed more slowly at 15°C versus 20°C. This extended phase of floral meristem formation, coupled with slower growth of sepals at 15°C, produced larger intersepal regions with more space available for petal initiation.

Population Parameters Underlying an Ongoing Soft Sweep in Southeast Asian Malaria Parasites
<p>Multiple <i>kelch13</i> alleles conferring artemisinin resistance (ART-R) are currently spreading through Southeast Asian malaria parasite populations, providing a unique opportunity to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>e an ongoing soft selective sweep, investigate why resistance alleles have evolved multiple times and determine fundamental population genetic parameters for <i>Plasmodium</i>. We sequenced <i>kelch13</i> (<i>n</i> = 1,876), genotyped 75 flanking SNPs, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed clearance rate (<i>n</i> = 3,552) in parasite infections from Western Thailand (2001–2014). We describe 32 independent coding mutations including common mutations outside the <i>kelch13</i> propeller associated with significant reductions in clearance rate. Mutations were first <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed in 2003 and rose to 90% by 2014, consistent with a selection coefficient of ∼0.079. ART-R allele diversity rose until 2012 and then dropped as one allele (C580Y) spread to high frequency. The frequency with which adaptive alleles arise is determined by the rate of mutation and the population size. Two factors drive this soft sweep: (1) multiple <i>kelch13</i> amino-acid mutations confer resistance providing a large mutational target—we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate the target is 87–163 bp. (2) The population mutation parameter (<i>Θ</i> = 2<i>N</i><sub>e</sub><i>μ</i>) can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated from the frequency distribution of ART-R alleles and is ∼5.69, suggesting that short term effective population size is 88 thousand to 1.2 million. This is 52–705 times greater than <i>N</i><sub>e</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated from fluctuation in allele frequencies, suggesting that we have previously under<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated the capacity for adaptive evolution in <i>Plasmodium</i>. Our central conclusions are that retrospective studies may under<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate the complexity of selective events and the <i>N</i><sub>e</sub> relevant for adaptation for malaria is considerably higher than previously <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated.</p>

Can we predict which dysplastic hips will require acetabular augmentation during total hip arthroplasty based on pre-operative radiographs?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether an innovative   templating technique could predict the need for acetabular augmentation   during primary total hip arthroplasty for patients with dysplastic   hips.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We developed a simple templating technique to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate acetabular   component coverage at total hip arthroplasty, the True Cup: False   Cup (TC:FC) ratio. We reviewed all patients with dysplastic hips   who underwent primary total hip arthroplasty between 2005 and 2012.   Traditional radiological methods of assessing the degree of acetabular dysplasia   (Sharp’s angle, Tönnis angle, centre-edge angle) as well as the   TC:FC ratio were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed from the pre-operative radiographs. A   comparison of augmented and non-augmented hips was undertaken to   determine any difference in pre-operative radiological indices between   the two cohorts.

Outcome of the Swedish Nationwide Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Screening Program
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>A general abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening program, targeting 65-year-old men, has gradually been introduced in Sweden since 2006 and reached nationwide coverage in 2015. The aim of this study was to determine the outcome of this program.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> of invited and examined men, screening-detected AAAs, AAAs operated on, and surgical outcome were retrieved from all 21 Swedish counties for the years 2006 through 2014. AAA-specific mortality data were retrieved from the Swedish Cause of Death Registry. A linear regression analysis was used to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate the effect on AAA-specific mortality among all men ≥65 years of age for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed time period. The long-term effects were projected by using a validated Markov model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 302 957 men aged 65 years invited, 84% attended. The prevalence of screening-detected AAA was 1.5%. After a mean of 4.5 years, 29% of patients with AAA had been operated on, with a 30-day mortality rate of 0.9% (1.3% after open repair and 0.3% after endovascular repair, <i>P</i><0.001). The introduction of screening was associated with a significant reduction in AAA-specific mortality (mean, 4.0% per year of screening, <i>P</i>=0.020). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> needed to screen and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> needed to operate on to prevent 1 premature death were 667 and 1.5, respectively. With a total population of 9.5 million, the Swedish national AAA-screening program was predicted to annually prevent 90 premature deaths from AAA and to gain 577 quality-adjusted life-years.

Partitioning of vessel resistivity in three liana species
<p>Vessels with simple perforation plates, found in the majority of angiosperms, are considered the evolutionarily most advanced conduits, least impeding the xylem sap flow. Nevertheless, when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed, their hydraulic resistivity (<i>R</i>, i.e., inverse value of hydraulic conductivity) is significantly higher than resistivity predicted using Hagen–Poiseuille equation (<i>R</i><sub>HP</sub>). In our study we aimed (i) to quantify two basic components of the total vessel resistivity – vessel lumen resistivity and end wall resistivity, and (ii) to analyze how the variable inner diameter of the vessel along its longitudinal axis affects resistivity. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed flow rates through progressively shortened stems of hop (<i>Humulus lupulus</i> L.), grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i> L.), and clematis (<i>Clematis vitalba</i> L.) and used elastomer injection for identification of open vessels and for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement of changing vessel inner diameters along its axis. The relative contribution of end wall resistivity to total vessel resistivity was 0.46 for hop, 0.55 for grapevine, and 0.30 for clematis. Vessel lumen resistivity calculated from our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements was substantially higher than theoretical resistivity – about 43% for hop, 58% for grapevine, and 52% for clematis. We identified variation in the vessel inner diameter as an important source of vessel resistivity. The coefficient of variation of vessel inner diameter was a good predictor for the increase of the ratio of integral <i>R</i><sub>HP</sub> to <i>R</i><sub>HP</sub> calculated from the mean value of inner vessel diameter. We discuss the fact that we dealt with the longest vessels in a given stem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e, which may lead to the over<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ation of vessel lumen resistivity, which consequently precludes decision whether the variable vessel inner diameter explains fully the difference between vessel lumen resistivity and <i>R</i><sub>HP</sub> we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed.</p>

Temporal and spatial patterns of internal and external stem CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes in a sub-Mediterranean oak
<p>To accurately <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate stem respiration (<i>R</i><sub>S</sub>), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements of both carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) efflux to the atmosphere (<i>E</i><sub>A</sub>) and internal CO<sub>2</sub> flux through xylem (<i>F</i><sub>T</sub>) are needed because xylem sap transports respired CO<sub>2</sub> upward. However, reports of seasonal dynamics of <i>F</i><sub>T</sub> and <i>E</i><sub>A</sub> are scarce and no studies exist in Mediterranean species under drought stress conditions. Internal and external CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes at three stem heights, together with radial stem growth, temperature, sap flow and shoot water potential, were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed in <i>Quercus pyrenaica</i> Willd. in four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement campaigns during one growing season. Substantial daytime depressions in temperature-normalized <i>E</i><sub>A</sub> were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed throughout the experiment, including prior to budburst, indicating that diel hysteresis between stem temperature and <i>E</i><sub>A</sub> cannot be uniquely ascribed to diversion of CO<sub>2</sub> in the transpiration stream. Low internal [CO<sub>2</sub>] (<0.5%) resulted in low contributions of <i>F</i><sub>T</sub> to <i>R</i><sub>S</sub> throughout the growing season, and <i>R</i><sub>S</sub> was mainly explained by <i>E</i><sub>A</sub> (>90%). Internal [CO<sub>2</sub>] was found to vary vertically along the stems. Seasonality in resistance to radial CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion was related to shoot water potential. The low internal [CO<sub>2</sub>] and <i>F</i><sub>T</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed in our study may result from the downregulation of xylem respiration in response to a legacy of coppicing as well as high radial diffusion of CO<sub>2</sub> through cambium, phloem and bark tissues, which was related to low water content of stems. Long-term studies analyzing temporal and spatial variation in internal and external CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes and their interactions are needed to mechanistically understand and model respiration of woody tissues.</p>

Phylogenetic Signal Variation in the Genomes of <i>Medicago</i> (Fabaceae)
<p>Genome-scale data offer the opportunity to clarify phylogenetic relationships that are difficult to resolve with few loci, but they can also identify genomic regions with evolutionary history distinct from that of the species history. We collected whole-genome sequence data from 29 taxa in the legume genus <i>Medicago</i>, then aligned these sequences to the <i>Medicago truncatula</i> reference genome to confidently identify 87 596 variable homologous sites. We used this data set to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate phylogenetic relationships among <i>Medicago</i> species, to investigate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> of sites needed to provide robust phylogenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ates and to identify specific genomic regions supporting topologies in conflict with the genome-wide phylogeny. Our full genomic data set resolves relationships within the genus that were previously intractable. Sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>ing the data reveals considerable variation in phylogenetic signal and power in smaller subsets of the data. Even when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>ing 5000 sites, no random <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e of the data supports a topology identical to that of the genome-wide phylogeny. Phylogenetic relationships <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated from 500-site sliding windows revealed genome regions supporting several alternative species relationships among recently diverged taxa, consistent with the expected effects of deep coalescence or introgression in the recent history of <i>Medicago</i>.

Lateral Gene Transfer from the Dead
<p>In phylogenetic studies, the evolution of molecular sequences is assumed to have taken place along the phylogeny traced by the ancestors of extant species. In the presence of lateral gene transfer, however, this may not be the case, because the species lineage from which a gene was transferred may have gone extinct or not have been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>ed. Because it is not feasible to specify or reconstruct the complete phylogeny of all species, we must describe the evolution of genes outside the represented phylogeny by modeling the speciation dynamics that gave rise to the complete phylogeny. We demonstrate that if the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>ed species is small compared with the total <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> of existing species, the overwhelming majority of gene transfers involve speciation to and evolution along extinct or un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>ed lineages. We show that the evolution of genes along extinct or un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>ed lineages can to good approximation be treated as those of independently evolving lineages described by a few global parameters. Using this result, we derive an algorithm to calculate the probability of a gene tree and recover the maximum-likelihood reconciliation given the phylogeny of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>ed species. Examining 473 near-universal gene families from 36 cyanobacteria, we find that nearly a third of transfer events (28%) appear to have topological signatures of evolution along extinct species, but only approximately 6% of transfers trace their ancestry to before the common ancestor of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>ed cyanobacteria.

Second Chern number of a quantum-simulated non-Abelian Yang monopole
<p>Topological order is often quantified in terms of Chern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong>s, each of which classifies a topological singularity. Here, inspired by concepts from high-energy physics, we use quantum simulation based on the spin degrees of freedom of atomic Bose-Einstein condensates to characterize a singularity present in five-dimensional non-Abelian gauge theories—a Yang monopole. We quantify the monopole in terms of Chern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong>s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed on enclosing manifolds: Whereas the well-known first Chern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> vanishes, the second Chern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> does not.

Using climate models to estimate the quality of global observational data sets

We show that this question not only rests on solid theoretical grounds but also offers insightful applications in practice. By comparing four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ational products of sea surface temperature with a large multimodel climate forecast ensemble, we find compelling evidence that models systematically score better against the most recent, advanced, but also most independent product.

Diffusion of CO<sub>2</sub> across the Mesophyll-Bundle Sheath Cell Interface in a C<sub>4</sub> Plant with Genetically Reduced PEP Carboxylase Activity
<p>Phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), localized to the cytosol of the mesophyll cell, catalyzes the first carboxylation step of the C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic pathway. Here, we used RNA interference to target the cytosolic photosynthetic PEPC isoform in <i>Setaria viridis</i> and isolated independent transformants with very low PEPC activities. These plants required high ambient CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations for growth, consistent with the essential role of PEPC in C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. The combination of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ating direct CO<sub>2</sub> fixation by the bundle sheath using gas-exchange <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements and modeling C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis with low PEPC activity allowed the calculation of bundle sheath conductance to CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion (<i>g<sub>bs</sub></i>) in the progeny of these plants. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements made at a range of temperatures suggested no or negligible effect of temperature on <i>g<sub>bs</sub></i> depending on the technique used to calculate <i>g<sub>bs</sub></i>. Anatomical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements revealed that plants with reduced PEPC activity had reduced cell wall thickness and increased plasmodesmata (PD) density at the mesophyll-bundle sheath (M-BS) cell interface, whereas we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed little difference in these parameters at the mesophyll-mesophyll cell interface. The increased PD density at the M-BS interface was largely driven by an increase in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> of PD pit fields (cluster of PDs) rather than an increase in PD per pit field or the size of pit fields. The correlation of <i>g<sub>bs</sub></i> with bundle sheath surface area per leaf area and PD area per M-BS area showed that these parameters and cell wall thickness are important determinants of <i>g<sub>bs</sub></i>. It is intriguing to speculate that PD development is responsive to changes in C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic flux.</p>

Measurement of Gross Photosynthesis, Respiration in the Light, and Mesophyll Conductance Using H<sub>2</sub><sup>18</sup>O Labeling
<p>A fundamental challenge in plant physiology is independently determining the rates of gross O<sub>2</sub> production by photosynthesis and O<sub>2</sub> consumption by respiration, photorespiration, and other processes. Previous studies on isolated chloroplasts or leaves have separately constrained net and gross O<sub>2</sub> production (NOP and GOP, respectively) by labeling ambient O<sub>2</sub> with <sup>18</sup>O while leaf water was unlabeled. Here, we describe a method to accurately <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e GOP and NOP of whole detached leaves in a cuvette as a routine gas-exchange <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement. The petiole is immersed in water enriched to a δ<sup>18</sup>O of ∼9,000‰, and leaf water is labeled through the transpiration stream. Photosynthesis transfers <sup>18</sup>O from H<sub>2</sub>O to O<sub>2</sub>. GOP is calculated from the increase in δ<sup>18</sup>O of O<sub>2</sub> as air passes through the cuvette. NOP is determined from the increase in O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>. Both terms are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed by isotope ratio mass spectrometry. CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation and other standard gas-exchange parameters also were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed. Reproducible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements are made on a single leaf for more than 15 h. We used this method to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e the light response curve of NOP and GOP in French bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) at 21% and 2% O<sub>2</sub>. We then used these data to examine the O<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> ratio of net photosynthesis, the light response curve of mesophyll conductance, and the apparent inhibition of respiration in the light (Kok effect) at both oxygen levels. The results are discussed in the context of evaluating the technique as a tool to study and understand leaf physiological traits.</p>

High-Throughput Phenotyping of Maize Leaf Physiological and Biochemical Traits Using Hyperspectral Reflectance
<p>High-throughput, noninvasive field phenotyping has revealed genetic variation in crop morphological, developmental, and agronomic traits, but rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements of the underlying physiological and biochemical traits are needed to fully understand genetic variation in plant-environment interactions. This study tested the application of leaf hyperspectral reflectance (λ = 500–2,400 nm) as a high-throughput phenotyping approach for rapid and accurate assessment of leaf photosynthetic and biochemical traits in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). Leaf traits were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed with standard wet-laboratory and gas-exchange approaches alongside <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements of leaf reflectance. Partial least-squares regression was used to develop a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e of leaf chlorophyll content, nitrogen content, sucrose content, specific leaf area, maximum rate of phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate carboxylation, [CO<sub>2</sub>]-saturated rate of photosynthesis, and leaf oxygen radical absorbance capacity from leaf reflectance spectra. Partial least-squares regression models accurately predicted five out of seven traits and were more accurate than previously used simple spectral indices for leaf chlorophyll, nitrogen content, and specific leaf area. Correlations among leaf traits and statistical inferences about differences among genotypes and treatments were similar for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed and modeled data. The hyperspectral reflectance approach to phenotyping was dramatically faster than traditional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements, enabling over 1,000 rows to be phenotyped during midday hours over just 2 to 4 d, and offers a nondestructive method to accurately assess physiological and biochemical trait responses to environmental stress.</p>

Direct Determination of the Mutation Rate in the Bumblebee Reveals Evidence for Weak Recombination-Associated Mutation and an Approximate Rate Constancy in Insects
<p>Accurate knowledge of the mutation rate provides a base line for inferring expected rates of evolution, for testing evolutionary hypotheses and for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ation of key parameters. Advances in sequencing technology now permit direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ates of the mutation rate from sequencing of close relatives. Within insects there have been three prior such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ates, two in nonsocial insects (<i>Drosophila</i>: 2.8 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> per bp per haploid genome per generation; <i>Heliconius</i>: 2.9 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>) and one in a social species, the honeybee (3.4 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>). Might the honeybee’s rate be ∼20% higher because it has an exceptionally high recombination rate and recombination may be directly or indirectly mutagenic? To address this possibility, we provide a direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate of the mutation rate in the bumblebee (<i>Bombus terrestris</i>), this being a close relative of the honeybee but with a much lower recombination rate. We confirm that the crossover rate of the bumblebee is indeed much lower than honeybees (8.7 cM/Mb vs. 37 cM/Mb). Importantly, we find no significant difference in the mutation rates: we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate for bumblebees a rate of 3.6 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> per haploid genome per generation (95% confidence intervals 2.38 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> and 5.37 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>) which is just 5% higher than the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate that of honeybees. Both genomes have approximately one new mutation per haploid genome per generation. While we find evidence for a direct coupling between recombination and mutation (also seen in honeybees), the effect is so weak as to leave almost no footprint on any between-species differences. The similarity in mutation rates suggests an approximate constancy of the mutation rate in insects.</p>

Do varus or valgus outliers have higher forces in the medial or lateral compartments than those which are in-range after a kinematically aligned total knee arthroplasty?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of this study were to determine the proportion of patients   with outlier varus or valgus alignment in kinematically aligned   total knee arthroplasty (TKA), whether those with outlier varus   or valgus alignment have higher forces in the medial or lateral   compartments of the knee than those with in-range alignment and   whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements of the alignment of the limb, knee and components   predict compartment forces.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The intra-operative forces in the medial and lateral compartments   were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed with an instrumented tibial insert in 67 patients   who underwent a kinematically aligned TKA during passive movement.

High-Target Versus Low-Target Blood Pressure Management During Cardiopulmonary Bypass to Prevent Cerebral Injury in Cardiac Surgery Patients
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cerebral injury is an important complication after cardiac surgery with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. The rate of overt stroke after cardiac surgery is 1% to 2%, whereas silent strokes, detected by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, are found in up to 50% of patients. It is unclear whether a higher versus a lower blood pressure during cardiopulmonary bypass reduces cerebral infarction in these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a patient- and assessor-blinded randomized trial, we allocated patients to a higher (70–80 mm Hg) or lower (40–50 mm Hg) target for mean arterial pressure by the titration of norepinephrine during cardiopulmonary bypass. Pump flow was fixed at 2.4 L·min<sup>−1</sup>·m<sup>−2</sup>. The primary outcome was the total volume of new ischemic cerebral lesions (summed in millimeters cubed), expressed as the difference between diffusion-weighted imaging conducted preoperatively and again postoperatively between days 3 and 6. Secondary outcomes included diffusion-weighted imaging–evaluated total <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> of new ischemic lesions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among the 197 enrolled patients, mean (SD) age was 65.0 (10.7) years in the low-target group (n=99) and 69.4 (8.9) years in the high-target group (n=98). Procedural risk scores were comparable between groups. Overall, diffusion-weighted imaging revealed new cerebral lesions in 52.8% of patients in the low-target group versus 55.7% in the high-target group (<i>P</i>=0.76). The primary outcome of volume of new cerebral lesions was comparable between groups, 25 mm<sup>3</sup> (interquartile range, 0–118 mm<sup>3</sup>; range, 0–25 261 mm<sup>3</sup>) in the low-target group versus 29 mm<sup>3</sup> (interquartile range, 0–143 mm<sup>3</sup>; range, 0–22 116 mm<sup>3</sup>) in the high-target group (median difference <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate, 0; 95% confidence interval, −25 to 0.028; <i>P</i>=0.99), as was the secondary outcome of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> of new lesions (1 [interquartile range, 0–2; range, 0–24] versus 1 [interquartile range, 0–2; range, 0–29] respectively; median difference <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate, 0; 95% confidence interval, 0–0; <i>P</i>=0.71).

Evaluating the Impact and Cost-Effectiveness of Statin Use Guidelines for Primary Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease and Stroke
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Statins are effective in the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guideline expands recommended statin use, but its cost-effectiveness has not been compared with other guidelines.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used the Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate the cost-effectiveness of the ACC/AHA guideline relative to current use, Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines, and universal statin use in all men 45 to 74 years of age and women 55 to 74 years of age over a 10-year horizon from 2016 to 2025. Sensitivity analyses varied costs, risks, and benefits. Main outcomes were incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong>s needed to treat for 10 years per quality-adjusted life-year gained.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Each approach produces substantial benefits and net cost savings relative to the status quo. Full adherence to the Adult Treatment Panel III guideline would result in 8.8 million more statin users than the status quo, at a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> needed to treat for 10 years per quality-adjusted life-year gained of 35. The ACC/AHA guideline would potentially result in up to 12.3 million more statin users than the Adult Treatment Panel III guideline, with a marginal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> needed to treat for 10 years per quality-adjusted life-year gained of 68. Moderate-intensity statin use in all men 45 to 74 years of age and women 55 to 74 years of age would result in 28.9 million more statin users than the ACC/AHA guideline, with a marginal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> needed to treat for 10 years per quality-adjusted life-year gained of 108. In all cases, benefits would be greater in men than women. Results vary moderately with different risk thresholds for instituting statins and statin toxicity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ates but depend greatly on the disutility caused by daily medication use (pill burden).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>At a population level, the ACC/AHA guideline for expanded statin use for primary prevention is projected to treat more people, to save more lives, and to cost less compared with Adult Treatment Panel III in both men and women. Whether individuals benefit from long-term statin use for primary prevention depends more on the disutility associated with pill burden than their degree of cardiovascular risk.</p></sec>

Coronary Artery Calcium to Guide a Personalized Risk-Based Approach to Initiation and Intensification of Antihypertensive Therapy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The use of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk to personalize systolic blood pressure (SBP) treatment goals is a topic of increasing interest. Therefore, we studied whether coronary artery calcium (CAC) can further guide the allocation of anti-hypertensive treatment intensity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We included 3733 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) with SBP between 120 and 179 mm Hg. Within subgroups categorized by both SBP (120–139 mm Hg, 140–159 mm Hg, and 160–179 mm Hg) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated 10-year ASCVD risk (using the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Assocation pooled-cohort equations), we compared multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios for the composite outcome of incident ASCVD or heart failure after further stratifying by CAC (0, 1–100, or >100). We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated 10-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong>-needed-to-treat for an intensive SBP goal of 120 mm Hg by applying the treatment benefit recorded in meta-analyses to event rates within CAC strata.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean age was 65 years, and 642 composite events took place over a median of 10.2 years. In persons with SBP <160 mm Hg, CAC stratified risk for events. For example, among those with an ASCVD risk of <15% and who had an SBP of either 120 to 139 mm Hg or 140 to 159 mm Hg, respectively, we found increasing hazard ratios for events with CAC 1 to 100 (1.7 [95% confidence interval, 1.0–2.6] or 2.0 [1.1–3.8]) and CAC >100 (3.0 [1.8–5.0] or 5.7 [2.9–11.0]), all relative to CAC=0. There appeared to be no statistical association between CAC and events when SBP was 160 to 179 mm Hg, irrespective of ASCVD risk level. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated 10-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong>-needed-to-treat for a SBP goal of 120mmHg varied substantially according to CAC levels when predicted ASCVD risk <15% and SBP <160mmHg (eg, 10-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong>-needed-to-treat of 99 for CAC=0 and 24 for CAC>100, when SBP 120-139mm Hg). However, few participants with ASCVD risk <5% had elevated CAC. Furthermore, 10-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong>-needed-to-treat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ates were consistently low and varied less among CAC strata when SBP was 160 to 179 mm Hg or when ASCVD risk was ≥15% at any SBP level.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Combined CAC imaging and assessment of global ASCVD risk has the potential to guide personalized SBP goals (eg, choosing a traditional goal of 140 or a more intensive goal of 120 mm Hg), particularly among adults with an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated ASCVD risk of 5% to 15% and prehypertension or mild hypertension.</p></sec>

Cholesterol Efflux Capacity, High-Density Lipoprotein Particle Number, and Incident Cardiovascular Events
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Recent failures of drugs that raised high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels to reduce cardiovascular events in clinical trials have led to increased interest in alternative indices of HDL quality, such as cholesterol efflux capacity, and HDL quantity, such as HDL particle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong>. However, no studies have directly compared these metrics in a contemporary population that includes potent statin therapy and low low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>HDL cholesterol levels, apolipoprotein A-I, cholesterol efflux capacity, and HDL particle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> were assessed at baseline and 12 months in a nested case-control study of the JUPITER trial (Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin), a randomized primary prevention trial that compared rosuvastatin treatment to placebo in individuals with normal low-density lipoprotein cholesterol but increased C-reactive protein levels. In total, 314 cases of incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) (myocardial infarction, unstable angina, arterial revascularization, stroke, or cardiovascular death) were compared to age- and gender-matched controls. Conditional logistic regression models adjusting for risk factors evaluated associations between HDL-related biomarkers and incident CVD.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Cholesterol efflux capacity was moderately correlated with HDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein A-I, and HDL particle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> (Spearman <i>r</i>= 0.39, 0.48, and 0.39 respectively; <i>P</i><0.001). Baseline HDL particle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> was inversely associated with incident CVD (adjusted odds ratio per SD increment [OR/SD], 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56–0.86; <i>P</i><0.001), whereas no significant association was found for baseline cholesterol efflux capacity (OR/SD, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.72–1.10; <i>P</i>=0.28), HDL cholesterol (OR/SD, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.66–1.02; <i>P</i>=0.08), or apolipoprotein A-I (OR/SD, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.67–1.03; <i>P</i>=0.08). Twelve months of rosuvastatin (20 mg/day) did not change cholesterol efflux capacity (average percentage change −1.5%, 95% CI, −13.3 to +10.2; <i>P</i>=0.80), but increased HDL cholesterol (+7.7%), apolipoprotein A-I (+4.3%), and HDL particle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> (+5.2%). On-statin cholesterol efflux capacity was inversely associated with incident CVD (OR/SD, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.42–0.92; <i>P</i>=0.02), although HDL particle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> again emerged as the strongest predictor (OR/SD, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.33–0.77; <i>P</i><0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In JUPITER, cholesterol efflux capacity was associated with incident CVD in individuals on potent statin therapy but not at baseline.

Potential Deaths Averted and Serious Adverse Events Incurred From Adoption of the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) Intensive Blood Pressure Regimen in the United States
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) demonstrated a 27% reduction in all-cause mortality with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) goal of <120 versus <140 mm Hg among US adults at high cardiovascular disease risk but without diabetes mellitus, stroke, or heart failure. To quantify the potential benefits and risks of SPRINT intensive goal implementation, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated the deaths prevented and excess serious adverse events incurred if the SPRINT intensive SBP treatment goal were implemented in all eligible US adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>SPRINT eligibility criteria were applied to the 1999 to 2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and linked with the National Death Index through December 2011. SPRINT eligibility included age ≥50 years, SBP of 130 to 180 mm Hg (depending on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> of antihypertensive medications being taken), and high cardiovascular disease risk. Exclusion criteria were diabetes mellitus, history of stroke, >1 g proteinuria, heart failure, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated glomerular filtration rate <20 mL·min<sup>−1</sup>·1.73 m<sup>−2</sup>, or dialysis. Annual mortality rates were calculated by dividing the Kaplan-Meier 5-year mortality by 5. Hazard ratios for all-cause mortality and heart failure and absolute risks for serious adverse events in SPRINT were used to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> of potential deaths and heart failure cases prevented and serious adverse events incurred with intensive SBP treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean age was 68.6 years, and 83.2% and 7.4% were non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black, respectively. The annual mortality rate was 2.20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.91–2.48), and intensive SBP treatment was projected to prevent ≈107 500 deaths per year (95% CI, 93 300–121 200) and give rise to 56 100 (95% CI, 50 800–61 400) episodes of hypotension, 34 400 (95% CI, 31 200–37 600) episodes of syncope, 43 400 (95% CI, 39 400–47 500) serious electrolyte disorders, and 88 700 (95% CI, 80 400–97 000) cases of acute kidney injury per year. The analysis-of-extremes approach indicated that the range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated lower- and upper-bound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> of deaths prevented per year with intensive SBP control was 34 600 to 179 600.

Lack of Concordance Between Empirical Scores and Physician Assessments of Stroke and Bleeding Risk in Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Physicians treating patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) must weigh the benefits of anticoagulation in preventing stroke versus the risk of bleeding. Although empirical models have been developed to predict such risks, the degree to which these coincide with clinicians’ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ates is unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We examined 10 094 AF patients enrolled in the Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of AF (ORBIT-AF) registry between June 2010 and August 2011. Empirical stroke and bleeding risks were assessed by using the congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥75 years, diabetes mellitus, and previous stroke or transient ischemic attack (CHADS<sub>2</sub>) and Anticoagulation and Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation (ATRIA) scores, respectively. Separately, physicians were asked to categorize their patients’ stroke and bleeding risks: low risk (<3%); intermediate risk (3%–6%); and high risk (>6%). Overall, 72% (n=7251) in ORBIT-AF had high-risk CHADS<sub>2</sub> scores (≥2). However, only 16% were assessed as high stroke risk by physicians. Although 17% (n=1749) had high ATRIA bleeding risk (score ≥5), only 7% (n=719) were considered so by physicians. The associations between empirical and physician-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated stroke and bleeding risks were low (weighted Kappa 0.1 and 0.11, respectively). Physicians weighed hypertension, heart failure, and diabetes mellitus less significantly than empirical models in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ating stroke risk; physicians weighted anemia and dialysis less significantly than empirical models when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ating bleeding risks. Anticoagulation use was highest among patients with high stroke risk, assessed by either empirical model or physician <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ates. In contrast, physician and empirical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ates of bleeding had limited impact on treatment choice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>There is little agreement between provider-assessed risk and empirical scores in AF.

Neutral mass spectrometry of virus capsids above 100 megadaltons with nanomechanical resonators
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement of the mass of particles in the mega- to gigadalton range is challenging with conventional mass spectrometry. Although this mass range appears optimal for nanomechanical resonators, nanomechanical mass spectrometers often suffer from prohibitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e loss, extended analysis time, or inadequate resolution. We report on a system architecture combining nebulization of the analytes from solution, their efficient transfer and focusing without relying on electromagnetic fields, and the mass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements of individual particles using nanomechanical resonator arrays. This system determined the mass distribution of ~30-megadalton polystyrene nanoparticles with high detection efficiency and effectively performed molecular mass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements of empty or DNA-filled bacteriophage T5 capsids with masses up to 105 megadaltons using less than 1 picomole of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e and with an instrument resolution above 100.</p>

Assessment of methane emissions from the U.S. oil and gas supply chain
<p>Methane emissions from the U.S. oil and natural gas supply chain were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated by using ground-based, facility-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements and validated with aircraft <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ations in areas accounting for ~30% of U.S. gas production. When scaled up nationally, our facility-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate of 2015 supply chain emissions is 13 ± 2 teragrams per year, equivalent to 2.3% of gross U.S. gas production. This value is ~60% higher than the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency inventory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate, likely because existing inventory methods miss emissions released during abnormal operating conditions. Methane emissions of this magnitude, per unit of natural gas consumed, produce radiative forcing over a 20-year time horizon comparable to the CO<sub>2</sub> from natural gas combustion. Substantial emission reductions are feasible through rapid detection of the root causes of high emissions and deployment of less failure-prone systems.</p>

Observation of three-photon bound states in a quantum nonlinear medium
<p>Bound states of massive particles, such as nuclei, atoms, or molecules, constitute the bulk of the visible world around us. By contrast, photons typically only interact weakly. We report the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ation of traveling three-photon bound states in a quantum nonlinear medium where the interactions between photons are mediated by atomic Rydberg states. Photon correlation and conditional phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements reveal the distinct bunching and phase features associated with three-photon and two-photon bound states. Such photonic trimers and dimers possess shape-preserving wave functions that depend on the constituent photon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong>. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed bunching and strongly nonlinear optical phase are described by an effective field theory of Rydberg-induced photon-photon interactions. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ations demonstrate the ability to realize and control strongly interacting quantum many-body states of light.</p>

Social place-cells in the bat hippocampus
<p>Social animals have to know the spatial positions of conspecifics. However, it is unknown how the position of others is represented in the brain. We designed a spatial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ational-learning task, in which an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>er bat mimicked a demonstrator bat while we recorded hippocampal dorsal-CA1 neurons from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>er bat. A neuronal subpopulation represented the position of the other bat, in allocentric coordinates. About half of these “social place-cells” represented also the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>er’s own position—that is, were place cells. The representation of the demonstrator bat did not reflect self-movement or trajectory planning by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>er. Some neurons represented also the position of inanimate moving objects; however, their representation differed from the representation of the demonstrator bat. This suggests a role for hippocampal CA1 neurons in social-spatial cognition.</p>

A precise measurement of the magnetic field in the corona of the black hole binary V404 Cygni
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ations of binary stars containing an accreting black hole or neutron star often show x-ray emission extending to high energies (>10 kilo­–electron volts), which is ascribed to an accretion disk corona of energetic particles akin to those seen in the solar corona.

Using simultaneous infrared, optical, x-ray, and radio <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ations of the Galactic black hole system V404 Cygni, showing a rapid synchrotron cooling event in its 2015 outburst, we present a precise 461 ± 12 gauss magnetic field <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement in the corona. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement is substantially lower than previous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ates for such systems, providing constraints on physical models of accretion physics in black hole and neutron star binary systems.</p>

Nanoscale nuclear magnetic resonance with chemical resolution
<p>Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a key analytical technique in chemistry, biology, and medicine. However, conventional NMR spectroscopy requires an at least nanoliter-sized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e volume to achieve sufficient signal. We combined the use of a quantum memory and high magnetic fields with a dedicated quantum sensor based on nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond to achieve chemical shift resolution in <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>19</sup>F NMR spectroscopy of 20-zeptoliter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e volumes. We demonstrate the application of NMR pulse sequences to achieve homonuclear decoupling and spin diffusion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements. The best <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed NMR linewidth of a liquid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e was ~1 part per million, mainly limited by molecular diffusion. To mitigate the influence of diffusion, we performed high-resolution solid-state NMR by applying homonuclear decoupling and achieved a 20-fold narrowing of the NMR linewidth.</p>

The extent of forest in dryland biomes
<p>Dryland biomes cover two-fifths of Earth’s land surface, but their forest area is poorly known. Here, we report an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate of global forest extent in dryland biomes, based on analyzing more than 210,000 0.5-hectare <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e plots through a photo-interpretation approach using large databases of satellite imagery at (i) very high spatial resolution and (ii) very high temporal resolution, which are available through the Google Earth platform. We show that in 2015, 1327 million hectares of drylands had more than 10% tree-cover, and 1079 million hectares comprised forest. Our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate is 40 to 47% higher than previous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ates, corresponding to 467 million hectares of forest that have never been reported before.

Independent Regulation of Symbiotic Nodulation by the SUNN Negative and CRA2 Positive Systemic Pathways
<p>Plant systemic signaling pathways allow the integration and coordination of shoot and root organ metabolism and development at the whole-plant level depending on nutrient availability. In legumes, two systemic pathways have been reported in the <i>Medicago truncatula</i> model to regulate root nitrogen-fixing symbiotic nodulation. Both pathways involve leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases acting in shoots and proposed to perceive signaling peptides produced in roots depending on soil nutrient availability. In this study, we characterized in the <i>M. truncatula</i> Jemalong A17 genotype a mutant allelic series affecting the Compact Root Architecture2 (CRA2) receptor. These analyses revealed that this pathway acts systemically from shoots to positively regulate nodulation and is required for the activity of carboxyl-terminally encoded peptides (CEPs). In addition, we generated a double mutant to test genetic interactions of the CRA2 systemic pathway with the CLAVATA3/EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION peptide (CLE)/Super Numeric Nodule (SUNN) receptor systemic pathway negatively regulating nodule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> from shoots, which revealed an intermediate nodule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> phenotype close to the wild type. Finally, we showed that the nitrate inhibition of nodule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong>s was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed in <i>cra2</i> mutants but not in <i>sunn</i> and <i>cra2 sunn</i> mutants. Overall, these results suggest that CEP/CRA2 and CLE/SUNN systemic pathways act independently from shoots to regulate nodule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong>s.</p>

Diurnal Solar Energy Conversion and Photoprotection in Rice Canopies
<p>Genetic improvement of photosynthetic performance of cereal crops and increasing the efficiency with which solar radiation is converted into biomass has recently become a major focus for crop physiologists and breeders. The pulse amplitude modulated chlorophyll fluorescence technique (PAM) allows quantitative leaf level monitoring of the utilization of energy for photochemical light conversion and photoprotection in natural environments, potentially over the entire crop lifecycle. Here, the diurnal relationship between electron transport rate (ETR) and irradiance was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed in five cultivars of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) in canopy conditions with PAM fluorescence under natural solar radiation. This relationship differed substantially from that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed for conventional short term light response curves <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed under controlled actinic light with the same leaves. This difference was characterized by a reduced curvature factor when curve fitting was used to model this diurnal response. The engagement of photoprotective processes in chloroplast electron transport in leaves under canopy solar radiation was shown to be a major contributor to this difference. Genotypic variation in the irradiance at which energy flux into photoprotective dissipation became greater than ETR was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed. Cultivars capable of higher ETR at midrange light intensities were shown to produce greater leaf area over time, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated by noninvasive imaging.</p>

Measuring gill paracellular permeability with polyethylene glycol-4000 in freely swimming trout: proof of principle
<p>The influence of swimming activity on gill paracellular permeability has not been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed previously in fishes. We critically assessed the use of tritium-labeled polyethylene glycol ([<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000) for this purpose, a substance that is also a classic marker for extracellular fluid volume, glomerular filtration rate and drinking rate. Tests (8 h) on resting freshwater trout showed that when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ing [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance from the plasma in the efflux direction, correction for a large excretion via glomerular filtration was essential, necessitating urinary catheterization. When <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ing [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance from the water in the influx direction, correction for a significant uptake by drinking was essential, necessitating terminal gut removal, whereas glomerular filtration losses were minimal. After correction for these alternate routes of loss and uptake, [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance rates by efflux from the plasma and by influx from the water were identical, showing that gill paracellular permeability is not rectified, and can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed in either direction. The influx technique with terminal gut removal was used to assess gill paracellular permeability in trout without urinary catheters freely swimming at 1.2 body lengths s<sup>−1</sup> for 8 h. Branchial [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance rate (by influx from the water) increased significantly by ~80% in accord with a similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed increase in O<sub>2</sub> consumption rate. Thus in trout, gill paracellular permeability does increase during exercise, in accord with the traditional concept of the osmorespiratory compromise.</p>

There were 17 men and 12 women. Their   mean age was 43 years (26 to 65). Seven patients underwent a bilateral   procedure. Thus, 36 THAs were included in the study. Lateral radiographs   and CT scans were obtained post-operatively and radiographs repeated   three weeks later. The anteversion of the acetabular component was   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed using the method described by Woo and Morrey and the ischiolateral   method described by Pulos et al and these were compared with the   results obtained from CT scans.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean anteversion was 18.35° (3° to 38°) using Woo and Morrey’s   method, 51.45° (30° to 85°) using the ischiolateral method and 21.22°   (2° to 48°) using CT scans. The Pearson correlation coefficient   was 0.754 for Woo and Morrey’s method and 0.925 for the ischiolateral   method. There was a linear correlation between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements   using the ischiolateral method and those using CT scans.

<i>In vivo</i> three-dimensional kinematics of normal knees during different high-flexion activities
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>In Asia and the Middle-East, people often flex their knees deeply   in order to perform activities of daily living. The purpose of this   study was to investigate the 3D kinematics of normal knees during   high-flexion activities. Our hypothesis was that the femorotibial   rotation, varus-valgus angle, translations, and kinematic pathway   of normal knees during high-flexion activities, varied according   to activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We investigated the <i>in vivo</i> kinematics of eight   normal knees in four male volunteers (mean age 41.8 years; 37 to   53) using 2D and 3D registration technique, and modelled the knees   with a computer aided design program. Each subject squatted, kneeled,   and sat cross-legged. We evaluated the femoral rotation and varus-valgus   angle relative to the tibia and anteroposterior translation of the   medial and lateral side, using the transepicodylar axis as our femoral   reference relative to the perpendicular projection on to the tibial   plateau. This method evaluates the femur medially from what has   elsewhere been described as the extension facet centre, and differs   from the method classically applied. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>During squatting and kneeling, the knees displayed femoral external   rotation. When sitting cross-legged, femurs displayed internal rotation   from 10° to 100°. From 100°, femoral external rotation was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed.   No significant difference in varus-valgus angle was seen between   squatting and kneeling, whereas a varus position was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed from   140° when sitting cross-legged. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e kinematic pathway using   our methodology found during squatting a medial pivoting pattern   from 0° to 40° and bicondylar rollback from 40° to 150°. During   kneeling, a medial pivot pattern was evident.

Nevertheless, our study was limited to a   small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> of male patients using a different technique to report   the kinematics than previous publications. Accordingly, caution   should be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed in generalizing our findings.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:50–5.</p></sec>

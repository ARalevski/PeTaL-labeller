Variation in functional pelvic tilt in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The pelvis rotates in the sagittal plane during daily activities.   These rotations have a direct effect on the functional orientation   of the acetabulum. The aim of this study was to quantify changes   in pelvic tilt between different functional positions.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Pre-operatively, pelvic tilt was measured in 1517 patients undergoing   total hip arthroplasty (THA) in three functional positions – supine,   standing and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flex</span></strong>ed seated (the moment when patients initiate rising   from a seated position). Supine pelvic tilt was measured from CT   scans, standing and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flex</span></strong>ed seated pelvic tilts were measured from standardised   lateral radiographs. Anterior pelvic tilt was assigned a positive   value.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean pelvic tilt was 4.2° (-20.5° to 24.5°), -1.3° (-30.2°   to 27.9°) and 0.6° (-42.0° to 41.3°) in the three positions, respectively.   The mean sagittal pelvic rotation from supine to standing was -5.5°   (-21.8° to 8.4°), from supine to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flex</span></strong>ed seated was -3.7° (-48.3°   to 38.6°) and from standing to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flex</span></strong>ed seated was 1.8° (-51.8° to   39.5°). In 259 patients (17%), the extent of sagittal pelvic rotation   could lead to functional malorientation of the acetabular component. Factoring   in an intra-operative delivery error of ± 5° extends this risk to   51% of patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Planning and measurement of the intended position of the acetabular   component in the supine position may fail to predict clinically   significant changes in its orientation during functional activities,   as a consequence of individual pelvic kinematics. Optimal orientation   is patient-specific and requires an evaluation of functional pelvic   tilt pre-operatively.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:184–91.</p></sec>

Effects of multilevel surgery on a flexed knee gait in adults with cerebral palsy
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flex</span></strong>ed knee gait is common in patients with bilateral spastic   cerebral palsy and occurs with increased age. There is a risk for   the recurrence of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flex</span></strong>ed knee gait when treated in childhood,   and the aim of this study was to investigate whether multilevel   procedures might also be undertaken in adulthood.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>At a mean of 22.9 months (standard deviation 12.9), after single   event multi level surgery, 3D gait analysis was undertaken pre-   and post-operatively for 37 adult patients with bilateral cerebral   palsy and a fixed knee gait.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was a significant improvement of indices and clinical and   kinematic parameters including extension of the hip and knee, reduction   of knee <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flex</span></strong>ion at initial contact, reduction of minimum and mean   knee <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flex</span></strong>ion in the stance phase of gait, improved range of movement   of the knee and a reduction of mean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flex</span></strong>ion of the hip in the stance phase.   Genu recurvatum occurred in two patients (n = 3 legs, 4%) and an   increase of pelvic tilt (> 5°) was found in 12 patients (n = 23   legs, 31%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Adult patients with bilateral cerebral palsy and a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flex</span></strong>ed knee   gait benefit from multilevel surgery including hamstring lengthening.

The structure and flexibility of conical HIV-1 capsids determined within intact virions
<p>HIV-1 contains a cone-shaped capsid encasing the viral genome. This capsid is thought to follow fullerene geometry—a curved hexameric lattice of the capsid protein, CA, closed by incorporating 12 CA pentamers. Current models for core structure are based on crystallography of hexameric and cross-linked pentameric CA, electron microscopy of tubular CA arrays, and simulations. Here, we report subnanometer-resolution cryo–electron tomography structures of hexameric and pentameric CA within intact HIV-1 particles. Whereas the hexamer structure is compatible with crystallography studies, the pentamer forms using different interfaces. Determining multiple structures revealed how CA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flex</span></strong>es to form the variably curved core shell. We show that HIV-1 CA assembles both aberrant and perfect fullerene cones, supporting models in which conical cores assemble de novo after maturation.</p>

<i>In vivo</i> three-dimensional kinematics of normal knees during different high-flexion activities
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>In Asia and the Middle-East, people often <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flex</span></strong> their knees deeply   in order to perform activities of daily living. The purpose of this   study was to investigate the 3D kinematics of normal knees during   high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flex</span></strong>ion activities. Our hypothesis was that the femorotibial   rotation, varus-valgus angle, translations, and kinematic pathway   of normal knees during high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flex</span></strong>ion activities, varied according   to activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We investigated the <i>in vivo</i> kinematics of eight   normal knees in four male volunteers (mean age 41.8 years; 37 to   53) using 2D and 3D registration technique, and modelled the knees   with a computer aided design program. Each subject squatted, kneeled,   and sat cross-legged. We evaluated the femoral rotation and varus-valgus   angle relative to the tibia and anteroposterior translation of the   medial and lateral side, using the transepicodylar axis as our femoral   reference relative to the perpendicular projection on to the tibial   plateau. This method evaluates the femur medially from what has   elsewhere been described as the extension facet centre, and differs   from the method classically applied. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>During squatting and kneeling, the knees displayed femoral external   rotation. When sitting cross-legged, femurs displayed internal rotation   from 10° to 100°. From 100°, femoral external rotation was observed.   No significant difference in varus-valgus angle was seen between   squatting and kneeling, whereas a varus position was observed from   140° when sitting cross-legged. The measure kinematic pathway using   our methodology found during squatting a medial pivoting pattern   from 0° to 40° and bicondylar rollback from 40° to 150°. During   kneeling, a medial pivot pattern was evident. When sitting cross-legged,   a lateral pivot pattern was seen from 0° to 100°, and a medial pivot   pattern beyond 100°.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The kinematics of normal knees during high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flex</span></strong>ion are variable   according to activity. Nevertheless, our study was limited to a   small number of male patients using a different technique to report   the kinematics than previous publications. Accordingly, caution   should be observed in generalizing our findings.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:50–5.</p></sec>

Aphid-borne Viral Spread Is Enhanced by Virus-induced Accumulation of Plant Reactive Oxygen Species
<p>Most known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> viruses are spread from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> by insect vectors. There is strong evidence that nonpersistently transmitted viruses manipulate the release of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> volatiles to attract insect vectors, thereby promoting virus spread. The mechanisms whereby aphid settling and feeding is altered on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s infected with these viruses, however, are unclear. Here we employed loss-of-function mutations in cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) and one of its host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>), to elucidate such mechanisms. We show that, relative to a CMVΔ2b strain with a deletion of the viral suppressor of RNAi 2b protein in CMV, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s infected with wild-type CMV produce higher concentrations of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> tissues. Aphids on wild-type CMV-infected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s engage in shorter probes, less phloem feeding, and exhibit other changes, as detected by electrical penetration graphing technology, relative to CMVΔ2b-infected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Therefore, the frequency of virus acquisition and the virus load per aphid were greater on CMV-infected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s than on CMVΔ2b-infected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Aphids also moved away from initial feeding sites more frequently on wild-type CMV infected versus CMVΔ2b-infected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. The role of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in eliciting these effects on aphids was corroborated using healthy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s infused with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Finally, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels were not elevated, and aphid behavior was unchanged, on CMV-infected RbohD-silenced tobacco <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, which are deficient in the induction of ROS production. These results suggest that CMV uses its viral suppressor of RNAi protein to increase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> ROS levels, thereby enhancing its acquisition and transmission by vector insects.</p>

Gall induction may benefit host plant: a case of a gall wasp and eucalyptus tree
<p>Gall-inducing insects display intimate interactions with their host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, usually described as parasitic relationships; the galls seem to favor the galler alone. We report on a case in which the presence of the galls induced by <i>Leptocybe invasa</i> Fisher & LaSalle (Hymenoptera; Eulophidae) benefit its host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>, the river red gum <i>Eucalyptus camaldulensis</i> Dehnh. Field observations showed that <i>E. camaldulensis</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s infected by this gall wasp were less susceptible to cold injury than neighboring conspecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s without galls. In the laboratory, frost resistance was compared between galled and non-galled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s which were both divided into two subgroups: cold-acclimated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s that were non-acclimated. Galled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s displayed higher frost resistance than the non-galled ones, and the differences were higher in non-acclimated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s compared with acclimated ones. Physiological changes in host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> were determined by chemical analyses of chlorophylls, proteins, soluble sugars and anthocyanin contents. The results showed higher values of all physiological parameters in the galled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, supporting the hypothesis that the presence of the gall wasp induces physiological changes on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> foliage, which may in turn increase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> defense mechanisms against cold. Therefore, the toll of galling by the herbivore may pay off by the host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> acquiring increased frost resistance. This work provides evidence for physiological changes induced by a herbivore which might have a positive indirect effect on the host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>, promoting frost resistance such as cold acclimation.</p>

Importance of Fluctuations in Light on Plant Photosynthetic Acclimation
<p>The acclimation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s to light has been studied extensively, yet little is known about the effect of dynamic fluctuations in light on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> phenotype and acclimatory responses. We mimicked natural fluctuations in light over a diurnal period to examine the effect on the photosynthetic processes and growth of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). High and low light intensities, delivered via a realistic dynamic fluctuating or square wave pattern, were used to grow and assess <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s subjected to square wave light had thicker leaves and greater photosynthetic capacity compared with fluctuating light-grown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. This, together with elevated levels of proteins associated with electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>, indicates greater investment in leaf structural components and photosynthetic processes. In contrast, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s grown under fluctuating light had thinner leaves, lower leaf light absorption, but maintained similar photosynthetic rates per unit leaf area to square wave-grown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Despite high light use efficiency, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s grown under fluctuating light had a slow growth rate early in development, likely due to the fact that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s grown under fluctuating conditions were not able to fully utilize the light energy absorbed for carbon fixation. Diurnal leaf-level measurements revealed a negative feedback control of photosynthesis, resulting in a decrease in total diurnal carbon assimilated of at least 20%. These findings highlight that growing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s under square wave growth conditions ultimately fails to predict <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> performance under realistic light regimes and stress the importance of considering fluctuations in incident light in future experiments that aim to infer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> productivity under natural conditions in the field.</p>

Plant-soil feedback and the maintenance of diversity in Mediterranean-climate shrublands
<p>Soil biota influence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> performance through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>-soil feedback, but it is unclear whether the strength of such feedback depends on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> traits and whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>-soil feedback drives local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> diversity. We grew 16 co-occurring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> species with contrasting nutrient-acquisition strategies from hyperdiverse Australian shrublands and exposed them to soil biota from under their own or other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> species. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> responses to soil biota varied according to their nutrient-acquisition strategy, including positive feedback for ectomycorrhizal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s and negative feedback for nitrogen-fixing and nonmycorrhizal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Simulations revealed that such strategy-dependent feedback is sufficient to maintain the high taxonomic and functional diversity characterizing these Mediterranean-climate shrublands. Our study identifies nutrient-acquisition strategy as a key trait explaining how different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> responses to soil biota promote local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> diversity.</p>

Improving Plant Nitrogen Use Efficiency through Alteration of Amino Acid Transport Processes
<p>Improving the efficiency of nitrogen (N) uptake and utilization in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s could potentially increase crop yields while reducing N fertilization and, subsequently, environmental pollution. Within most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, N is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ed primarily as amino acids. In this study, pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s overexpressing <i>AMINO ACID PERMEASE1</i> (<i>AAP1</i>) were used to determine if and how genetic manipulation of amino acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> from source to sink affects <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> N use efficiency. The modified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s were grown under low, moderate, or high N fertilization regimes. The results showed that, independent of the N nutrition, the engineered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s allocate more N via the vasculature to the shoot and seeds and produce more biomass and higher seed yields than wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Dependent on the amount of N supplied, the <i>AAP1</i>-overexpressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s displayed improved N uptake or utilization efficiency, or a combination of the two. They also showed significantly increased N use efficiency in N-deficient as well as in N-rich soils and, impressively, required half the amount of N to produce as many fruits and seeds as control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Together, these data support that engineering N allocation from source to sink presents an effective strategy to produce crop <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s with improved productivity as well as N use efficiency in a range of N environments.</p>

Isoscapes resolve species-specific spatial patterns in plant–plant interactions in an invaded Mediterranean dune ecosystem
<p>Environmental heterogeneity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> interactions are key factors shaping <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> communities. However, the spatial dimension of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> interactions has seldom been addressed in field studies. This is at least partially rooted in a lack of methods that can accurately resolve functional processes in a spatially explicit manner. Isoscapes, that is, spatially explicit representations of stable isotope data, provide a versatile means to trace functional changes on spatial scales, for example, related to N-cycling (foliar δ<sup>15</sup>N) and water use efficiency (WUE<sub>i</sub>, foliar δ<sup>13</sup>C). In a case study in a nutrient-depleted Mediterranean dune ecosystem, we analysed the spatial impact of the invasive N<sub>2</sub>-fixing <i>Acacia longifolia</i> on three native species of different functional types using δ<sup>15</sup>N and δ<sup>13</sup>C isoscapes and spatial autocorrelation analyses. Isoscapes revealed strong spatial patterns in δ<sup>15</sup>N and δ<sup>13</sup>C with pronounced species-specific differences, demonstrating distinct spatial ranges of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> interactions. A coniferous tree and an ericaceous dwarf shrub showed significant enrichment in δ<sup>15</sup>N within a range of 5–8 m surrounding the canopy of <i>A. longifolia</i>, indicating input of N originating from symbiotic N<sub>2</sub>-fixation by the invader. In the dwarf shrub, which was most responsive to invader influence, enrichment in δ<sup>13</sup>C additionally demonstrated spatially explicit changes to WUE<sub>i</sub>, while a native N<sub>2</sub>-fixer was unresponsive to the presence of the invader. Furthermore, δ<sup>15</sup>N and δ<sup>13</sup>C isoscapes yielded different patterns, indicating that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> interactions can have distinct spatial distributions and ranges based on the process measured. Additionally, the magnitude of the effect differed between field situations with high and low invasion pressure. This study highlights that the spatial scale must be accounted for when assessing the effects and outcome of species interactions. Functional tracers such as stable isotopes enable us to quantify spatial ranges of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> interactions, providing empirical data that can help to better understand and predict complex species interactions in multifaceted natural environments.</p>

The Potassium Transporter SlHAK10 Is Involved in Mycorrhizal Potassium Uptake
<p>Most terrestrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s form a root symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, which receive fixed carbon from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> and enhance the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>’s uptake of mineral nutrients. AM symbiosis improves the phosphorous and nitrogen nutrition of host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s; however, little is known about the role of AM symbiosis in potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) nutrition. Here, we report that inoculation with the AM fungus <i>Rhizophagus irregularis</i> improved tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth and K<sup>+</sup> acquisition and that K<sup>+</sup> deficiency has a negative effect on root growth and AM colonization. Based on its homology to a <i>Lotus japonicus</i> AM-induced K<sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er, we identified a mycorrhiza-specific tomato K<sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er, SlHAK10 (<i>Solanum lycopersicum High-affinity Potassium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er10</i>), that was exclusively expressed in arbuscule-containing cells. <i>SlHAK10</i> could restore a yeast K<sup>+</sup> uptake-defective mutant in the low-affinity concentration range. Loss of function of <i>SlHAK10</i> led to a significant decrease in mycorrhizal K<sup>+</sup> uptake and AM colonization rate under low-K<sup>+</sup> conditions but did not affect arbuscule development. Overexpressing <i>SlHAK10</i> from the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter or the AM-specific <i>Solanum melongena Phosphate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er4</i> not only improved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth and K<sup>+</sup> uptake but also increased AM colonization efficiency and soluble sugar content in roots supplied with low K<sup>+</sup>. Our results indicate that tomato <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s have a SlHAK10<i>-</i>mediated mycorrhizal K<sup>+</sup> uptake pathway and that improved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> K<sup>+</sup> nutrition could increase carbohydrate accumulation in roots, which facilitates AM fungal colonization.</p>

<i>Trichoderma</i> Histone Deacetylase HDA-2 Modulates Multiple Responses in Arabidopsis
<p><i>Trichoderma</i> spp. are a rich source of secondary metabolites and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which may induce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> defenses and modulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth. In filamentous fungi, chromatin modifications regulate secondary metabolism. In this study we investigated how the absence of histone deacetylase HDA-2 in the <i>Trichoderma atroviride</i> strain Δ<i>hda-2</i> impacts its effect on a host, Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The production of VOCs and their impact on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth and development were assessed as well. The Δ<i>hda-2</i> strain was impaired in its ability to colonize Arabidopsis roots, thus affecting the promotion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth and modulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> defenses against foliar pathogens <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> and <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i>, which normally result from interaction with <i>T. atroviride</i>. Furthermore, Δ<i>hda-2</i> VOCs were incapable of triggering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> defenses to counterattack foliar pathogens. The Δ<i>hda-2</i> overproduced the VOC 6-pentyl-2H-pyran-2-one (6-PP), which resulted in enhanced root branching and differentially regulated phytohormone-related genes. Analysis of ten VOCs (including 6-PP) revealed that three of them positively regulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth, whereas six had the opposite effect. Assessment of secondary metabolites, detoxification, and communication with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>-related genes showed a dual role for HDA-2 in <i>T. atroviride</i> gene expression regulation during its interaction with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Chromatin immunoprecipitation of acetylated histone H3 on the promoters of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>-responsive genes in Δ<i>hda-2</i> showed, in the presence of Arabidopsis, low levels of <i>epl-1</i> and <i>abc-2</i> compared with that in the wild type; whereas <i>ctf-1</i> presented high constitutive levels, supporting a dual role of HDA-2 in gene regulation. This work highlights the importance of HDA-2 as a global regulator in <i>Trichoderma</i> to modulate multiple responses in Arabidopsis.</p>

Plant Phenotyping: An Active Vision Cell for Three-Dimensional Plant Shoot Reconstruction
<p>Three-dimensional (3D) computer-generated models of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s are urgently needed to support both phenotyping and simulation-based studies such as photosynthesis modeling. However, the construction of accurate 3D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> models is challenging, as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s are complex objects with an intricate leaf structure, often consisting of thin and highly reflective surfaces that vary in shape and size, forming dense, complex, crowded scenes. We address these issues within an image-based method by taking an active vision approach, one that investigates the scene to intelligently capture images, to image acquisition. Rather than use the same camera positions for all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, our technique is to acquire the images needed to reconstruct the target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>, tuning camera placement to match the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>’s individual structure. Our method also combines volumetric- and surface-based reconstruction methods and determines the necessary images based on the analysis of voxel clusters. We describe a fully automatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> modeling/phenotyping cell (or module) comprising a six-axis robot and a high-precision turntable. By using a standard color camera, we overcome the difficulties associated with laser-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> reconstruction methods. The 3D models produced are compared with those obtained from fixed cameras and evaluated by comparison with data obtained by x-ray microcomputed tomography across different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> structures. Our results show that our method is successful in improving the accuracy and quality of data obtained from a variety of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> types.</p>

Identification of a Hexenal Reductase That Modulates the Composition of Green Leaf Volatiles
<p>Green leaf volatiles (GLVs), including six-carbon (C6) aldehydes, alcohols, and esters, are formed when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> tissues are damaged. GLVs play roles in direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> defense at wound sites, indirect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> defense via the attraction of herbivore predators, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> communication. GLV components provoke distinctive responses in their target recipients; therefore, the control of GLV composition is important for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s to appropriately manage stress responses. The reduction of C6-aldehydes into C6-alcohols is a key step in the control of GLV composition and also is important to avoid a toxic buildup of C6-aldehydes. However, the molecular mechanisms behind C6-aldehyde reduction remain poorly understood. In this study, we purified an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) NADPH-dependent cinnamaldehyde and hexenal reductase encoded by At4g37980, named here CINNAMALDEHYDE AND HEXENAL REDUCTASE (CHR). <i>CHR</i> T-DNA knockout mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s displayed a normal growth phenotype; however, we observed significant suppression of C6-alcohol production following partial mechanical wounding or herbivore infestation. Our data also showed that the parasitic wasp <i>Cotesia vestalis</i> was more attracted to GLVs emitted from herbivore-infested wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s compared with GLVs emitted from <i>chr</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, which corresponded with reduced C6-alcohol levels in the mutant. Moreover, <i>chr</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s were more susceptible to exogenous high-dose exposure to (<i>Z</i>)-3-hexenal, as indicated by their markedly lowered photosystem II activity. Our study shows that reductases play significant roles in changing GLV composition and, thus, are important in avoiding toxicity from volatile carbonyls and in the attraction of herbivore predators.</p>

Leaf Amino Acid Supply Affects Photosynthetic and Plant Nitrogen Use Efficiency under Nitrogen Stress
<p>The coordinated distribution of nitrogen to source leaves and sinks is essential for supporting leaf metabolism while also supplying sufficient nitrogen to seeds for development. This study aimed to understand how regulated amino acid allocation to leaves affects photosynthesis and overall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> nitrogen use efficiency in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and how soil nitrogen availability influences these processes. Arabidopsis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s with a knockout of <i>AAP2</i>, encoding an amino acid permease involved in xylem-to-phloem transfer of root-derived amino acids, were grown in low-, moderate-, and high-nitrogen environments. We analyzed nitrogen allocation to shoot tissues, photosynthesis, and photosynthetic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> nitrogen use efficiency in these knockout <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Our results demonstrate that, independent of nitrogen conditions, <i>aap2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s allocate more nitrogen to leaves than wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Increased leaf nitrogen supply positively affected chlorophyll and Rubisco levels, photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency, and carbon assimilation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> to sinks. The <i>aap2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s outperformed wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s with respect to growth, seed yield and carbon storage pools, and nitrogen use efficiency in both high and deficient nitrogen environments. Overall, this study demonstrates that increasing nitrogen allocation to leaves represents an effective strategy for improving carbon fixation and photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency. The results indicate that an optimized coordination of nitrogen and carbon partitioning processes is critical for high oilseed production in Arabidopsis, including in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s exposed to limiting nitrogen conditions.</p>

A Group D MAPK Protects Plants from Autotoxicity by Suppressing Herbivore-Induced Defense Signaling
<p>The mechanisms by which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s activate and enhance defense responses have been well studied; however, the regulatory mechanisms that allow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s to avoid excessive defense responses are poorly understood. Here, we identified a group D mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) gene from rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), <i>OsMAPK20-5</i>, whose expression was rapidly induced by infestation of gravid female adults of a destructive rice pest, brown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>hopper (BPH, <i>Nilaparvata lugens</i>), but not by BPH nymphs. Expression silencing of <i>OsMAPK20-5</i> (irMAPK) increased the accumulation of ethylene and nitric oxide (NO) after gravid female BPH infestation, and thereby increased rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> resistance to BPH adults and oviposited eggs. However, when exposed to high densities of gravid BPH females, irMAPK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s wilted earlier than wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, which could be attributed to the hyperaccumulation of ethylene and NO in irMAPK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Interestingly, when released into the field, irMAPK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s displayed broad resistance to BPH and white-backed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>hopper (<i>Sogatella furcifera</i>), the two most destructive pests of rice, and produced higher yield. Taken together, our study shows that although OsMAPK20-5 can reduce the resistance of rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>hoppers, it also enables rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s to control excessive defense responses and thereby prevents defense-response–related autotoxicity.</p>

Massive Tandem Proliferation of ELIPs Supports Convergent Evolution of Desiccation Tolerance across Land Plants
<p>Desiccation tolerance was a critical adaptation for the colonization of land by early nonvascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Resurrection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s have maintained or rewired these ancestral protective mechanisms, and desiccation-tolerant species are dispersed across the land <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> phylogeny. Although common physiological, biochemical, and molecular signatures are observed across resurrection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> lineages, features underlying the recurrent evolution of desiccation tolerance are unknown. Here we used a comparative approach to identify patterns of genome evolution and gene duplication associated with desiccation tolerance. We identified a single gene family with dramatic expansion in all sequenced resurrection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> genomes and no expansion in desiccation-sensitive species. This gene family of early light-induced proteins (ELIPs) expanded in resurrection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s convergent through repeated tandem gene duplication. ELIPs are universally highly expressed during desiccation in all surveyed resurrection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s and may play a role in protecting against photooxidative damage of the photosynthetic apparatus during prolonged dehydration. Photosynthesis is particularly sensitive to dehydration, and the increased abundance of ELIPs may help facilitate the rapid recovery observed for most resurrection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Together, these observations support convergent evolution of desiccation tolerance in land <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s through tandem gene duplication.</p>

BZR1 Mediates Brassinosteroid-Induced Autophagy and Nitrogen Starvation in Tomato
<p>Autophagy, an innate cellular destructive mechanism, plays crucial roles in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> development and responses to stress. Autophagy is known to be stimulated or suppressed by multiple molecular processes, but the role of phytohormone signaling in autophagy is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the transcripts of autophagy-related genes (<i>ATGs</i>) and the formation of autophagosomes are triggered by enhanced levels of brassinosteroid (BR). Furthermore, the BR-activated transcription factor brassinazole-resistant1 (BZR1), a positive regulator of the BR signaling pathway, is involved in BR-induced autophagy. Treatment with BR enhanced the formation of autophagosomes and the transcripts of <i>ATGs</i> in <i>BZR1</i>-overexpressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, while the effects of BR were compromised in <i>BZR1</i>-silenced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Yeast one-hybrid analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with quantitative polymerase chain reaction revealed that BZR1 bound to the promoters of <i>ATG2</i> and <i>ATG6</i>. The BR-induced formation of autophagosomes decreased in <i>ATG2</i>- and <i>ATG6</i>-silenced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Moreover, exogenous application of BR enhanced chlorophyll content and autophagosome formation and decreased the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins under nitrogen starvation. Leaf chlorosis and chlorophyll degradation were exacerbated in <i>BZR1</i>-silenced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s and the BR biosynthetic mutant <i>d<sup>^im</sup></i> but were alleviated in <i>BZR1</i>- and <i>BZR1-1D</i>-overexpressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s under nitrogen starvation. Meanwhile, nitrogen starvation-induced expression of <i>ATGs</i> and autophagosome formation were compromised in both <i>BZR1</i>-silenced and <i>d<sup>^im</sup></i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s but were increased in <i>BZR1</i>- and <i>BZR1-1D</i>-overexpressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Taken together, our results suggest that BZR1-dependent BR signaling up-regulates the expression of <i>ATGs</i> and autophagosome formation, which plays a critical role in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> response to nitrogen starvation in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>).</p>

MicroRNA166 Modulates Cadmium Tolerance and Accumulation in Rice
<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 20- to 24-nucleotide small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression in eukaryotic organisms. Several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> miRNAs, such as miR166, have vital roles in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth, development and responses to environmental stresses. One such environmental stress encountered by crop <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s is exposure to cadmium (Cd), an element highly toxic to most organisms, including humans and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. In this study, we analyzed the role of miR166 in Cd accumulation and tolerance in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). The expression levels of miR166 in both root and leaf tissues were significantly higher in the reproductive stage than in the seedling stage in rice. The expression of miR166 in the roots of rice seedlings was reduced after Cd treatment. Overexpression of miR166 in rice improved Cd tolerance, a result associated with the reduction of Cd-induced oxidative stress in transgenic rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Furthermore, overexpression of miR166 reduced both Cd translocation from roots to shoots and Cd accumulation in the grains. miR166 targets genes encoding the class-III homeodomain-Leu zipper (HD-Zip) family proteins in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. In rice, <i>HOMEODOMAIN CONTAINING PROTEIN4</i> (<i>OsHB4</i>) gene (Os03g43930), which encodes an HD-Zip protein, was up-regulated by Cd treatment but down-regulated by overexpression of miR166 in transgenic rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Overexpression of <i>OsHB4</i> increased Cd sensitivity and Cd accumulation in the leaves and grains of transgenic rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. By contrast, silencing <i>OsHB4</i> by RNA interference enhanced Cd tolerance in transgenic rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. These results indicate a critical role for miR166 in Cd accumulation and tolerance through regulation of its target gene, <i>OsHB4</i>, in rice.</p>

The Genetic Basis of Plant Architecture in 10 Maize Recombinant Inbred Line Populations
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> architecture is a key factor affecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>ing density and grain yield in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). However, the genetic mechanisms underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> architecture in diverse genetic backgrounds have not been fully addressed. Here, we performed a large-scale phenotyping of 10 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> architecture-related traits and dissected the genetic loci controlling these traits in 10 recombinant inbred line populations derived from 14 diverse genetic backgrounds. Nearly 800 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with major and minor effects were identified as contributing to the phenotypic variation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> architecture-related traits. Ninety-two percent of these QTLs were detected in only one population, confirming the diverse genetic backgrounds of the mapping populations and the prevalence of rare alleles in maize. The numbers and effects of QTLs are positively associated with the phenotypic variation in the population, which, in turn, correlates positively with parental phenotypic and genetic variations. A large proportion (38.5%) of QTLs was associated with at least two traits, suggestive of the frequent occurrence of pleiotropic loci or closely linked loci. Key developmental genes, which previously were shown to affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> architecture in mutant studies, were found to colocalize with many QTLs. Five QTLs were further validated using the segregating populations developed from residual heterozygous lines present in the recombinant inbred line populations. Additionally, one new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> height QTL, <i>qPH3</i>, has been fine-mapped to a 600-kb genomic region where three candidate genes are located. These results provide insights into the genetic mechanisms controlling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> architecture and will benefit the selection of ideal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> architecture in maize breeding.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
The Evolution of Silicon Transport in Eukaryotes
<p>Biosilicification (the formation of biological structures from silica) occurs in diverse eukaryotic lineages, plays a major role in global biogeochemical cycles, and has significant biotechnological applications. Silicon (Si) uptake is crucial for biosilicification, yet the evolutionary history of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers involved remains poorly known. Recent evidence suggests that the SIT family of Si <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers, initially identified in diatoms, may be widely distributed, with an extended family of related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers (SIT-Ls) present in some nonsilicified organisms. Here, we identify SITs and SIT-Ls in a range of eukaryotes, including major silicified lineages (radiolarians and chrysophytes) and also bacterial SIT-Ls. Our evidence suggests that the symmetrical 10-transmembrane-domain SIT structure has independently evolved multiple times via duplication and fusion of 5-transmembrane-domain SIT-Ls. We also identify a second gene family, similar to the active Si <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er Lsi2, that is broadly distributed amongst siliceous and nonsiliceous eukaryotes. Our analyses resolve a distinct group of Lsi2-like genes, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> and diatom Si-responsive genes, and sequences unique to siliceous sponges and choanoflagellates. The SIT/SIT-L and Lsi2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er families likely contribute to biosilicification in diverse lineages, indicating an ancient role for Si <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> in eukaryotes. We propose that these Si <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers may have arisen initially to prevent Si toxicity in the high Si Precambrian oceans, with subsequent biologically induced reductions in Si concentrations of Phanerozoic seas leading to widespread losses of SIT, SIT-L, and Lsi2-like genes in diverse lineages. Thus, the origin and diversification of two independent Si <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er families both drove and were driven by ancient ocean Si levels.</p>

Gcorn Plant: A Database for Retrieving Functional and Evolutionary Traits of Plant Genes
<p>Gene homology helps us understand gene function and speciation. The number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> genes and species registered in public databanks is continuously increasing. It is useful to associate homologous genes of various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s to better understand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> speciation. We designed the Gcorn <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> database for the retrieval of information on homology and evolution of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> gene of interest. Amino acid sequences of 73 species (62 land <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s and 11 green algae), containing 2,682,261 sequences, were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Reference Sequence database. Based on NCBI BLAST searches between these sequences, homologous genes were grouped at various thresholds of homology indices devised by the authors. To show functional and evolutionary traits of a gene of interest, a phylogenetic tree, connecting genes with high homology indices, and line charts of the numbers of genes with various homology indices, are depicted. In addition, such indices are projected on a network graph in which species studied are connected based on the ratios of homologous genes, and on a phylogenetic tree for species based on NCBI Taxonomy. Gcorn <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> provides information on homologous genes at various virtual time points along with speciation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s.</p>

Mesophyll Abscisic Acid Restrains Early Growth and Flowering But Does Not Directly Suppress Photosynthesis
<p>Abscisic acid (ABA) levels increase significantly in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s under stress conditions, and ABA is thought to serve as a key stress-response regulator. However, the direct effect of ABA on photosynthesis and the effect of mesophyll ABA on yield under both well-watered and drought conditions are still the subject of debate. Here, we examined this issue using transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s carrying a dominant ABA-signaling inhibitor under the control of a mesophyll-specific promoter (<i>FBPase::abi1-1</i>, abbreviated to <i>fa</i>). Under normal conditions, <i>fa</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s displayed slightly higher stomatal conductance and carbon assimilation than wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s; however, these parameters were comparable following ABA treatment. These observations suggest that ABA does not directly inhibit photosynthesis in the short term. The <i>fa</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s also exhibited a variety of altered phenotypes under optimal conditions, including more vigorous initial growth, earlier flowering, smaller flowers, and delayed chlorophyll degradation. Furthermore, under optimal conditions, <i>fa</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> seed production was less than a third of that observed for the wild type. However, under drought conditions, wild-type and <i>fa</i> seed yields were similar due to a significant reduction in wild-type seed and no reduction in <i>fa</i> seed. These findings suggest that endogenous basal ABA inhibits a stress-escape response under nonstressed conditions, allowing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s to accumulate biomass and maximize yield. The lack of a correlation between flowering time and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> biomass combined with delayed chlorophyll degradation suggests that this stress-escape behavior is regulated independently and upstream of other ABA-induced effects such as rapid growth and flowering.</p>

The R2R3-MYB Transcription Factor MYB49 Regulates Cadmium Accumulation
<p>Abscisic acid (ABA) reduces accumulation of potentially toxic cadmium (Cd) in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. How the ABA signal is transmitted to modulate Cd uptake remains largely unclear. Here, we report that the basic region/Leu zipper transcription factor ABSCISIC ACID-INSENSITIVE5 (ABI5), a central ABA signaling molecule, is involved in ABA-repressed Cd accumulation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s by physically interacting with a previously uncharacterized R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, MYB49. Overexpression of the Cd-induced <i>MYB49</i> gene in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) resulted in a significant increase in Cd accumulation, whereas <i>myb49</i> knockout <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s expressing chimeric repressors of <i>MYB49</i>:ERF-associated amphiphilic repression motif repression domain (<i>SRDX49</i>) exhibited reduced accumulation of Cd. Further investigations revealed that MYB49 positively regulates the expression of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors <i>bHLH38</i> and <i>bHLH101</i> by directly binding to their promoters, leading to activation of <i>IRON-REGULATED <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ER1</i>, which encodes a metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er involved in Cd uptake. MYB49 also binds to the promoter regions of the heavy metal-associated isoprenylated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> proteins (<i>HIPP22</i>) and <i>HIPP44</i>, resulting in up-regulation of their expression and subsequent Cd accumulation. On the other hand, as a feedback mechanism to control Cd uptake and accumulation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> cells, Cd-induced ABA up-regulates the expression of <i>ABI5</i>, whose protein product interacts with MYB49 and prevents its binding to the promoters of downstream genes, thereby reducing Cd accumulation. Our results provide new insights into the molecular feedback mechanisms underlying ABA signaling-controlled Cd uptake and accumulation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s.</p>

Auxin Function in the Brown Alga <i>Dictyota dichotoma</i>
<p>Auxin controls body plan patterning in land <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s and has been proposed to play a similar role in the development of brown algae (Phaeophyta) despite their distant evolutionary relationship with land <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. The mechanism of auxin action in brown algae remains controversial because of contradicting conclusions derived from pharmacological studies on <i>Fucus</i>. In this study, we used <i>Dictyota</i> <i>dichotoma</i> as a model system to show that auxin plays a role during the apical-basal patterning of the embryo of brown algae. Indole-3-acetic acid was detectable in <i>D. dichotoma</i> germlings and mature tissue. Although two-celled <i>D. dichotoma</i> zygotes normally develop a rhizoid from one pole and a thallus meristem from the other, addition of exogenous auxins to one-celled embryos affected polarization, and both poles of the spheroidal embryo developed into rhizoids instead. The effect was strongest at lower pH and when variable extrinsic informational cues were applied. 2-[4-(diethylamino)-2-hydroxybenzoyl]benzoic acid, an inhibitor of the ABC-B/multidrug resistance/P-glycoprotein subfamily of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers in land <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, affected rhizoid formation by increasing rhizoid branching and inducing ectopic rhizoids. An in silico survey of auxin genes suggested that a diverse range of biosynthesis genes and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> genes, such as PIN-LIKES, and the ATP-binding cassette subfamily (ABC-B/multidrug resistance/P-glycoprotein) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers from land <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s have homologs in <i>D. dichotoma</i> and <i>Ectocarpus siliculosus</i>.

Components of Water Use Efficiency Have Unique Genetic Signatures in the Model C<sub>4</sub> Grass <i>Setaria</i>
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth and water use are interrelated processes influenced by genetically controlled morphological and biochemical characteristics. Improving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> water use efficiency (WUE) to sustain growth in different environments is an important breeding objective that can improve crop yields and enhance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">agricultur</span></strong>al sustainability. However, genetic improvement of WUE using traditional methods has proven difficult due to the low throughput and environmental heterogeneity of field settings. To overcome these limitations, this study utilizes a high-throughput phenotyping platform to quantify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> size and water use of an interspecific <i>Setaria italica</i> × <i>Setaria viridis</i> recombinant inbred line population at daily intervals in both well-watered and water-limited conditions. Our findings indicate that measurements of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> size and water use are correlated strongly in this system; therefore, a linear modeling approach was used to partition this relationship into predicted values of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> size given water use and deviations from this relationship at the genotype level. The resulting traits describing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> size, water use, and WUE all were heritable and responsive to soil water availability, allowing for a genetic dissection of the components of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> WUE under different watering treatments. Linkage mapping identified major loci underlying two different pleiotropic components of WUE. This study indicates that alleles controlling WUE derived from both wild and domesticated accessions can be utilized to predictably modulate trait values given a specified precipitation regime in the model C<sub>4</sub> genus <i>Setaria</i>.</p>

Boron Alleviates Aluminum Toxicity by Promoting Root Alkalization in Transition Zone via Polar Auxin Transport
<p>Boron (B) alleviates aluminum (Al) toxicity in higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s; however, the underlying mechanisms behind this phenomenon remain unknown. Here, we used bromocresol green pH indicator, noninvasive microtest, and microelectrode ion flux estimation techniques to demonstrate that B promotes root surface pH gradients in pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) roots, leading to alkalization in the root transition zone and acidification in the elongation zone, while Al inhibits these pH gradients. B significantly decreased Al accumulation in the transition zone (∼1.0–2.5 mm from the apex) of lateral roots, thereby alleviating Al-induced inhibition of root elongation. Net indole acetic acid (IAA) efflux detected by an IAA-sensitive platinum microelectrode showed that polar auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>, which peaked in the root transition zone, was inhibited by Al toxicity, while it was partially recovered by B. Electrophysiological experiments using the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er mutants (<i>auxin resistant1-7</i>; <i>pin-formed2</i> [<i>pin2</i>]) and the specific polar auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er inhibitor1-naphthylphthalamic acid showed that PIN2-based polar auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> is involved in root surface alkalization in the transition zone. Our results suggest that B promotes polar auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> driven by the auxin efflux <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er PIN2 and leads to the downstream regulation of the plasma membrane-H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, resulting in elevated root surface pH, which is essential to decrease Al accumulation in this Al-targeted apical root zone. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the role of exogenous B in alleviation of Al accumulation and toxicity in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s.</p>

The Tomato Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase SlMPK1 Is as a Negative Regulator of the High-Temperature Stress Response
<p>High-temperature (HT) stress is a major environmental stress that limits <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth and development. MAPK cascades play key roles in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth and stress signaling, but their involvement in the HT stress response is poorly understood. Here, we describe a 47-kD MBP-phosphorylated protein (p47-MBPK) activated in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) leaves under HT and identify it as SlMPK1 by tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Silencing of <i>SlMPK1</i> in transgenic tomato <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s resulted in enhanced tolerance to HT, while overexpression resulted in reduced tolerance. Proteomic analysis identified a set of proteins involved in antioxidant defense that are significantly more abundant in RNA interference-<i>SlMPK1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s than nontransgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s under HT stress. RNA interference-<i>SlMPK1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s also showed changes in membrane lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzyme activities. Furthermore, using yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified a serine-proline-rich protein homolog, SlSPRH1, which interacts with SlMPK1 in yeast, in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> cells, and in vitro. We demonstrate that SlMPK1 can directly phosphorylate SlSPRH1. Furthermore, the serine residue serine-44 of SlSPRH1 is a crucial phosphorylation site in the SlMPK1-mediated antioxidant defense mechanism activated during HT stress. We also demonstrate that heterologous expression of <i>SlSPRH1</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) led to a decrease in thermotolerance and lower antioxidant capacity. Taken together, our results suggest that SlMPK1 is a negative regulator of thermotolerance in tomato <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. SlMPK1 acts by regulating antioxidant defense, and its substrate SlSPRH1 is involved in this pathway.</p>

Whereas <i>R</i>-genes have been well characterized in angiosperms, little is known about their origin and early diversification.

The MtDMI2-MtPUB2 Negative Feedback Loop Plays a Role in Nodulation Homeostasis
<p>DOES NOT MAKE INFECTION 2 (MtDMI2) is a Leu rich repeat-type receptor kinase required for signal transduction in the <i>Medicago truncatula/Sinorhizobium meliloti</i> symbiosis pathway. However, the mechanisms through which MtDMI2 participates in nodulation homeostasis are poorly understood. In this study, we identified MtPUB2—a novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> U-box (PUB)–type E3 ligase—and showed that it interacts with MtDMI2. MtDMI2 and MtPUB2 accumulation were shown to be similar in various tissues. Roots of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s in which <i>MtPUB2</i> was silenced by RNAi (<i>MtPUB2-</i>RNAi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s) exhibited impaired infection threads, fewer nodules, and shorter primary root lengths compared to those of control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s transformed with empty vector. Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, we showed that MtDMI2 phosphorylates MtPUB2 at Ser-316, Ser-421, and Thr-488 residues. When <i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s were transformed with <i>MtPUB2<sup>S421D</sup></i>, which mimics the phosphorylated state, MtDMI2 was persistently ubiquitinated and degraded by MtPUB2<sup>S421D</sup>, resulting in fewer nodules than observed in <i>MtPUB2</i>/<i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi-complemented <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. However, <i>MtPUB2<sup>S421A</sup></i>/<i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi-complemented <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s showed no MtPUB2 ubiquitination activity, and their nodulation phenotype was similar to that of <i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s transformed with empty vector. Further studies demonstrated that these proteins form a negative feedback loop of the prey (MtDMI2)-predator (MtPUB2) type. Our results suggest that the MtDMI2-MtPUB2 negative feedback loop, which displays crosstalk with the long-distance autoregulation of nodulation via MtNIN, plays an important role in nodulation homeostasis.</p>

Uptake analyses with radioactive <sc>l</sc>-arabinose revealed that 11 other STPs are able to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> <sc>l</sc>-arabinose with high affinity. Hence, functional redundancy might explain the missing-mutant phenotype of two <i>stp7</i> T-DNA insertion lines.

Outside-Xylem Vulnerability, Not Xylem Embolism, Controls Leaf Hydraulic Decline during Dehydration<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[CC-BY]</sup></xref>
<p>Leaf hydraulic supply is crucial to maintaining open stomata for CO<sub>2</sub> capture and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth. During drought-induced dehydration, the leaf hydraulic conductance (<i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub>) declines, which contributes to stomatal closure and, eventually, to leaf death. Previous studies have tended to attribute the decline of <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> to embolism in the leaf vein xylem. We visualized at high resolution and quantified experimentally the hydraulic vulnerability of xylem and outside-xylem pathways and modeled their respective influences on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>. Evidence from all approaches indicated that the decline of <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> during dehydration arose first and foremost due to the vulnerability of outside-xylem tissues. In vivo x-ray microcomputed tomography of dehydrating leaves of four diverse angiosperm species showed that, at the turgor loss point, only small fractions of leaf vein xylem conduits were embolized, and substantial xylem embolism arose only under severe dehydration. Experiments on an expanded set of eight angiosperm species showed that outside-xylem hydraulic vulnerability explained 75% to 100% of <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> decline across the range of dehydration from mild water stress to beyond turgor loss point. Spatially explicit modeling of leaf water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> pointed to a role for reduced membrane conductivity consistent with published data for cells and tissues. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>-scale modeling suggested that outside-xylem hydraulic vulnerability can protect the xylem from tensions that would induce embolism and disruption of water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> under mild to moderate soil and atmospheric droughts. These findings pinpoint outside-xylem tissues as a central locus for the control of leaf and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> during progressive drought.</p>

cis-Cinnamic Acid Is a Novel, Natural Auxin Efflux Inhibitor That Promotes Lateral Root Formation
<p>Auxin steers numerous physiological processes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, making the tight control of its endogenous levels and spatiotemporal distribution a necessity. This regulation is achieved by different mechanisms, including auxin biosynthesis, metabolic conversions, degradation, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>. Here, we introduce cis-cinnamic acid (<i>c</i>-CA) as a novel and unique addition to a small group of endogenous molecules affecting in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>a auxin concentrations. <i>c-CA</i> is the photo-isomerization product of the phenylpropanoid pathway intermediate trans-CA (<i>t</i>-CA). When grown on <i>c</i>-CA-containing medium, an evolutionary diverse set of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> species were shown to exhibit phenotypes characteristic for high auxin levels, including inhibition of primary root growth, induction of root hairs, and promotion of adventitious and lateral rooting. By molecular docking and receptor binding assays, we showed that <i>c</i>-CA itself is neither an auxin nor an anti-auxin, and auxin profiling data revealed that <i>c</i>-CA does not significantly interfere with auxin biosynthesis. Single cell-based auxin accumulation assays showed that <i>c</i>-CA, and not <i>t</i>-CA, is a potent inhibitor of auxin efflux. Auxin signaling reporters detected changes in spatiotemporal distribution of the auxin response along the root of <i>c</i>-CA-treated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, and long-distance auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> assays showed no inhibition of rootward auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>. Overall, these results suggest that the phenotypes of <i>c</i>-CA-treated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s are the consequence of a local change in auxin accumulation, induced by the inhibition of auxin efflux. This work reveals a novel mechanism how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s may regulate auxin levels and adds a novel, naturally occurring molecule to the chemical toolbox for the studies of auxin homeostasis.</p>

SULTR3s Function in Chloroplast Sulfate Uptake and Affect ABA Biosynthesis and the Stress Response
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s are major sulfur reducers in the global sulfur cycle. Sulfate, the major natural sulfur source in soil, is absorbed by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> roots and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ed into plastids, where it is reduced and assimilated into Cys for further metabolic processes. Despite its importance, how sulfate is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ed into plastids is poorly understood. We previously demonstrated using single Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) genetic mutants that each member of the sulfate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er (SULTR) subfamily 3 was able to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> sulfate across the chloroplast envelope membrane. To resolve the function of SULTR3s, we constructed a <i>sultr3</i> quintuple mutant completely knocking out all five members of the subfamily. Here we report that all members of the <i>SULTR3</i> subfamily show chloroplast membrane localization. Sulfate uptake by chloroplasts of the quintuple mutant is reduced by more than 50% compared with the wild type. Consequently, Cys and abscisic acid (ABA) content are reduced to ∼67 and ∼20% of the wild-type level, respectively, and strong positive correlations are found among sulfate, Cys, and ABA content. The <i>sultr3</i> quintuple mutant shows obvious growth retardation with smaller rosettes and shorter roots. Seed germination of the <i>sultr3</i> quintuple mutant is hypersensitive to exogenous ABA and salt stress, but is rescued by sulfide supplementation. Furthermore, sulfate-induced stomatal closure is abolished in the quintuple mutant, strongly suggesting that chloroplast sulfate is required for stomatal closure. Our genetic analyses unequivocally demonstrate that sulfate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er subfamily 3 is responsible for more than half of the chloroplast sulfate uptake and influences downstream sulfate assimilation and ABA biosynthesis.</p>

12-Oxo-Phytodienoic Acid Acts as a Regulator of Maize Defense against Corn Leaf Aphid
<p>The corn leaf aphid (CLA; <i>Rhopalosiphum maidis</i>) is a phloem sap-sucking insect that attacks many cereal crops, including maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). We previously showed that the maize inbred line Mp708, which was developed by classical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> breeding, provides enhanced resistance to CLA. Here, using electrophysiological monitoring of aphid feeding behavior, we demonstrate that Mp708 provides phloem-mediated resistance to CLA. Furthermore, feeding by CLA on Mp708 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s enhanced callose deposition, a potential defense mechanism utilized by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s to limit aphid feeding and subsequent colonization. In maize, benzoxazinoids (BX) or BX-derived metabolites contribute to enhanced callose deposition by providing heightened resistance to CLA. However, BX and BX-derived metabolites were not significantly altered in CLA-infested Mp708 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, indicating BX-independent defense against CLA. Evidence presented here suggests that the constitutively higher levels of 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA) in Mp708 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s contributed to enhanced callose accumulation and heightened CLA resistance. OPDA enhanced the expression of ethylene biosynthesis and receptor genes, and the synergistic interactions of OPDA and CLA feeding significantly induced the expression of the transcripts encoding Maize insect resistance1-Cysteine Protease, a key defensive protein against insect pests, in Mp708 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Furthermore, exogenous application of OPDA on maize jasmonic acid-deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s caused enhanced callose accumulation and heightened resistance to CLA, suggesting that the OPDA-mediated resistance to CLA is independent of the jasmonic acid pathway. We further demonstrate that the signaling function of OPDA, rather than a direct toxic effect, contributes to enhanced CLA resistance in Mp708.</p>

The Role of Gβ Protein in Controlling Cell Expansion via Potential Interaction with Lipid Metabolic Pathways
<p>Heterotrimeric G-proteins influence almost all aspects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth, development, and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, likely via their interaction with specific effectors. However, the identity of such effectors and their mechanism of action are mostly unknown. While investigating the roles of different G-protein subunits in modulating the oil content in Camelina (<i>Camelina sativa</i>), an oil seed crop, we uncovered a role of Gβ proteins in controlling anisotropic cell expansion. Knockdown of <i>Gβ</i> genes causes reduced longitudinal and enhanced transverse expansion, resulting in altered cell, tissue, and organ shapes in transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s during vegetative and reproductive development. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s also exhibited substantial changes in their fatty acid and phospholipid profiles, which possibly leads to the increased oil content of the transgenic seeds. This increase is potentially caused by the direct interaction of Gβ proteins with a specific patatin-like phospholipase, pPLAIIIδ. Camelina <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s with suppressed <i>Gβ</i> expression exhibit higher lipase activity, and show phenotypes similar to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s overexpressing <i>pPLAIIIδ</i>, suggesting that the Gβ proteins are negative regulators of pPLAIIIδ. These results reveal interactions between the G-protein–mediated and lipid signaling/metabolic pathways, where specific phospholipases may act as effectors that control key developmental and environmental responses of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s.</p>

SlHY5 Integrates Temperature, Light, and Hormone Signaling to Balance Plant Growth and Cold Tolerance
<p>During the transition from warm to cool seasons, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s experience decreased temperatures, shortened days, and decreased red/far-red (R/FR) ratios of light. The mechanism by which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s integrate these environmental cues to maintain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth and adaptation remains poorly understood. Here, we report that low temperature induced the transcription of <i>PHYTOCHROME A</i> and accumulation of LONG HYPOCOTYL5 (SlHY5, a basic Leu zipper transcription factor) in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, especially under short day conditions with low R/FR light ratios. Reverse genetic approaches and physiological analyses revealed that silencing of <i>SlHY5</i> increased cold susceptibility in tomato <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, whereas overexpression of <i>SlHY5</i> enhanced cold tolerance. SlHY5 directly bound to and activated the transcription of genes encoding a gibberellin-inactivation enzyme, namely <i>GIBBERELLIN2-OXIDASE4</i>, and an abscisic acid biosynthetic enzyme, namely <i>9-CIS-EPOXYCAROTENOID DIOXYGENASE6</i> (<i>SlNCED6</i>). Thus, phytochrome A-dependent SlHY5 accumulation resulted in an increased abscisic acid/gibberellin ratio, which was accompanied by growth cessation and induction of cold response. Furthermore, silencing of <i>SlNCED6</i> compromises short day- and low R/FR-induced tomato resistance to cold stress. These findings provide insight into the molecular genetic mechanisms by which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s integrate environmental stimuli with hormones to coordinate their growth with impending cold temperatures. Moreover, this work reveals a molecular mechanism that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s have evolved for growth and survival in response to seasonal changes.</p>

NRT1.1-Related NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> Toxicity Is Associated with a Disturbed Balance between NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> Uptake and Assimilation
<p>A high concentration of ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) as the sole source of nitrogen in the growth medium often is toxic to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. The nitrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er NRT1.1 is involved in mediating the effects of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> toxicity; however, the mechanism remains undefined. In this study, wild-type Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> Columbia-0 [Col-0]) and <i>NRT1.1</i> mutants (<i>chl1-1</i> and <i>chl1-5</i>) were grown hydroponically in NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> and (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> media to assess the function of NRT1.1 in NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> stress responses. All the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s grew normally in medium containing mixed nitrogen sources, but Col-0 displayed more chlorosis and lower biomass and photosynthesis than the <i>NRT1.1</i> mutants in (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> medium. Grafting experiments between Col-0 and <i>chl1-5</i> further confirmed that NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> toxicity is influenced by NRT1.1. In (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> medium, NRT1.1 induced the expression of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers, increasing NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> uptake. Additionally, the activities of glutamine synthetase and glutamate synthetase in roots of Col-0 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s decreased and soluble sugar accumulated significantly, whereas pyruvate kinase-mediated glycolysis was not affected, all of which contributed to NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> accumulation. By contrast, the <i>NRT1.1</i> mutants showed reduced NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> accumulation and enhanced NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> assimilation through glutamine synthetase, glutamate synthetase, and glutamate dehydrogenase. Moreover, the up-regulation of genes involved in ethylene synthesis and senescence in Col-0 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s treated with (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> suggests that ethylene is involved in NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> toxicity responses. This study showed that NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> toxicity is related to a nitrate-independent signaling function of <i>NRT1.1</i> in Arabidopsis, characterized by enhanced NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> accumulation and altered NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> metabolism, which stimulates ethylene synthesis, leading to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> senescence.</p>

An Iron-Activated Citrate Transporter, MtMATE67, Is Required for Symbiotic Nitrogen Fixation<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Iron (Fe) is an essential micronutrient for symbiotic nitrogen fixation in legume nodules, where it is required for the activity of bacterial nitrogenase, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> leghemoglobin, respiratory oxidases, and other Fe proteins in both organisms. Fe solubility and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> within and between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> tissues is facilitated by organic chelators, such as nicotianamine and citrate. We have characterized a nodule-specific citrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er of the multidrug and toxic compound extrusion family, MtMATE67 of <i>Medicago truncatula</i>. The MtMATE67 gene was induced early during nodule development and expressed primarily in the invasion zone of mature nodules. The MtMATE67 protein was localized to the plasma membrane of nodule cells and also the symbiosome membrane surrounding bacteroids in infected cells. In oocytes, MtMATE67 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ed citrate out of cells in an Fe-activated manner. Loss of <i>MtMATE67</i> gene function resulted in accumulation of Fe in the apoplasm of nodule cells and a substantial decrease in symbiotic nitrogen fixation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth. Taken together, the results point to a primary role of MtMATE67 in citrate efflux from nodule cells in response to an Fe signal. This efflux is necessary to ensure Fe(III) solubility and mobility in the apoplasm and uptake into nodule cells. Likewise, MtMATE67-mediated citrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> into the symbiosome space would increase the solubility and availability of Fe(III) for rhizobial bacteroids.</p>

Knockdown of Rice MicroRNA166 Confers Drought Resistance by Causing Leaf Rolling and Altering Stem Xylem Development
<p>MicroRNAs are 19- to 22-nucleotide small noncoding RNAs that have been implicated in abiotic stress responses. In this study, we found that knockdown of microRNA166, using the Short Tandem Target Mimic (STTM) system, resulted in morphological changes that confer drought resistance in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). From a large-scale screen for miRNA knockdown lines in rice, we identified miR166 knockdown lines (STTM166); these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s exhibit a rolled-leaf phenotype, which is normally displayed by rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s under drought stress. The leaves of STTM166 rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s had smaller bulliform cells and abnormal sclerenchymatous cells, likely causing the rolled-leaf phenotype. The STTM166 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s had reduced stomatal conductance and showed decreased transpiration rates. The STTM166 lines also exhibited altered stem xylem and decreased hydraulic conductivity, likely due to the reduced diameter of the xylem vessels. Molecular analyses identified rice <i>HOMEODOMAIN CONTAINING PROTEIN4</i> (<i>OsHB4</i>), a member of HD-Zip III gene family, as a major target of miR166; moreover, rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s overexpressing a miR166-resistant form of <i>OsHB4</i> resembled the STTM166 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, including leaf rolling and higher drought resistance. The genes downstream of miR166-<i>OsHB4</i> consisted of polysaccharide synthesis-related genes that may contribute to cell wall formation and vascular development. Our results suggest that drought resistance in rice can be increased by manipulating miRNAs, which leads to developmental changes, such as leaf rolling and reduced diameter of the xylem, that mimic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s’ natural responses to water-deficit stress.</p>

However, with the exception of the H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase and H<sup>+</sup>-PPase, which could be followed due to their hydrolytic activities, attempts to purify tonoplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers were for a long time not successful. Heterologous complementation, T-DNA insertion mutants, and later proteomic studies allowed the next steps, starting from the 1990s. Nowadays, our knowledge about vacuolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers has increased greatly.

A Mucin-Like Protein of Planthopper Is Required for Feeding and Induces Immunity Response in Plants
<p>The brown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>hopper, <i>Nilaparvata lugens</i>, is a pest that threatens rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) production worldwide. While feeding on rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>hoppers secrete saliva, which plays crucial roles in nutrient ingestion and modulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> defense responses, although the specific functions of salivary proteins remain largely unknown. We identified an <i>N. lugens</i>-secreted mucin-like protein (NlMLP) by transcriptome and proteome analyses and characterized its function, both in brown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>hopper and in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. <i>NlMLP</i> is highly expressed in salivary glands and is secreted into rice during feeding. Inhibition of <i>NlMLP</i> expression in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>hoppers disturbs the formation of salivary sheaths, thereby reducing their performance. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, NlMLP induces cell death, the expression of defense-related genes, and callose deposition. These defense responses are related to Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization and the MEK2 MAP kinase and jasmonic acid signaling pathways. The active region of NlMLP that elicits <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> responses is located in its carboxyl terminus. Our work provides a detailed characterization of a salivary protein from a piercing-sucking insect other than aphids.

The Distinct Roles of Class I and II RPD3-Like Histone Deacetylases in Salinity Stress Response
<p>Histone acetylation is an essential process in the epigenetic regulation of diverse biological processes, including environmental stress responses in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Previously, our research group identified a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor (HDI) that confers salt tolerance in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). In this study, we demonstrate that class I HDAC (HDA19) and class II HDACs (HDA5/14/15/18) control responses to salt stress through different pathways. The screening of 12 different selective HDIs indicated that seven newly reported HDIs enhance salt tolerance. Genetic analysis, based on a pharmacological study, identified which HDACs function in salinity stress tolerance. In the wild-type Columbia-0 background, <i>hda19</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s exhibit tolerance to high-salinity stress, while <i>hda5/14/15/18</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s exhibit hypersensitivity to salt stress. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the effect of <i>HDA19</i> deficiency on the response to salinity stress is distinct from that of <i>HDA5/14/15/18</i> deficiencies. In <i>hda19</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, the expression levels of stress tolerance-related genes, late embryogenesis abundant proteins that prevent protein aggregation and positive regulators such as ABI5 and NAC019 in abscisic acid signaling, were induced strongly relative to the wild type. Neither of these elements was up-regulated in the <i>hda5/14/15/18</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. The mutagenesis of HDA19 by genome editing in the <i>hda5/14/15/18</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s enhanced salt tolerance, suggesting that suppression of HDA19 masks the phenotype caused by the suppression of class II HDACs in the salinity stress response. Collectively, our results demonstrate that HDIs that inhibit class I HDACs allow the rescue of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s from salinity stress regardless of their selectivity, and they provide insight into the hierarchal regulation of environmental stress responses through HDAC isoforms.</p>

A Nucleus-Localized Long Non-Coding RNA Enhances Drought and Salt Stress Tolerance

A large number of lncRNA transcripts have been predicted or identified in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s in recent years. However, the biological functions for most of them are still unknown. In this study, we identified an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) lncRNA, <i>DROUGHT INDUCED lncRNA</i> (<i>DRIR</i>), as a novel positive regulator of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> response to drought and salt stress. <i>DRIR</i> was expressed at a low level under nonstress conditions but can be significantly activated by drought and salt stress as well as by abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. We identified a T-DNA insertion mutant, <i>drir<sup>D</sup></i>, which had higher expression of the <i>DRIR</i> gene than the wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. The <i>drir<sup>D</sup></i> mutant exhibits increased tolerance to drought and salt stress. Overexpressing <i>DRIR</i> in Arabidopsis also increased tolerance to drought and salt stress of the transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. The <i>drir<sup>D</sup></i> mutant and the overexpressing seedlings are more sensitive to ABA than the wild type in stomata closure and seedling growth. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis demonstrated that the expression of a large number of genes was altered in <i>drir<sup>D</sup></i> and the overexpressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s.

<p>The use of chemical genomics approaches allows the identification of small molecules that integrate into biological systems, thereby changing discrete processes that influence growth, development, or metabolism. Libraries of chemicals are applied to living systems, and changes in phenotype are observed, potentially leading to the identification of new growth regulators. This work describes an approach that is the nexus of chemical genomics and synthetic biology. Here, each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> in an extensive population synthesizes a unique small peptide arising from a transgene composed of a randomized nucleic acid sequence core flanked by translational start, stop, and cysteine-encoding (for disulfide cyclization) sequences. Ten and 16 amino acid sequences, bearing a core of six and 12 random amino acids, have been synthesized in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Populations were screened for phenotypes from the seedling stage through senescence. Dozens of phenotypes were observed in over 2,000 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s analyzed. Ten conspicuous phenotypes were verified through separate transformation and analysis of multiple independent lines. The results indicate that these populations contain sequences that often influence discrete aspects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> biology. Novel peptides that affect photosynthesis, flowering, and red light response are described. The challenge now is to identify the mechanistic integrations of these peptides into biochemical processes. These populations serve as a new tool to identify small molecules that modulate discrete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> functions that could be produced later in transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s or potentially applied exogenously to impart their effects. These findings could usher in a new generation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">agricultur</span></strong>al growth regulators, herbicides, or defense compounds.</p>

Root Cortical Senescence Improves Growth under Suboptimal Availability of N, P, and K
<p>Root cortical senescence (RCS) in Triticeae reduces nutrient uptake, nutrient content, respiration, and radial hydraulic conductance of root tissue. We used the functional-structural model <i>SimRoot</i> to evaluate the functional implications of RCS in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) under suboptimal nitrate, phosphorus, and potassium availability. The utility of RCS was evaluated using sensitivity analyses in contrasting nutrient regimes. At flowering (80 d), RCS increased simulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth by up to 52%, 73%, and 41% in nitrate-, phosphorus-, and potassium-limiting conditions, respectively. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s with RCS had reduced nutrient requirement of root tissue for optimal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth, reduced total cumulative cortical respiration, and increased total carbon reserves. Nutrient reallocation during RCS had a greater effect on simulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth than reduced respiration or nutrient uptake. Under low nutrient availability, RCS had greater benefit in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s with fewer tillers. RCS had greater benefit in phenotypes with fewer lateral roots at low nitrate availability, but the opposite was true in low phosphorus or potassium availability. Additionally, RCS was quantified in field-grown barley in different nitrogen regimes. Field and virtual soil coring simulation results demonstrated that living cortical volume per root length (an indicator of RCS) decreased with depth in younger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, while roots of older <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s had very little living cortical volume per root length. RCS may be an adaptive trait for nutrient acquisition by reallocating nutrients from senescing tissue and secondarily by reducing root respiration. These simulated results suggest that RCS merits investigation as a breeding target for enhanced soil resource acquisition and edaphic stress tolerance.</p>

Transcription Factor AREB2 Is Involved in Soluble Sugar Accumulation by Activating Sugar Transporter and Amylase Genes
<p>Sugars play important roles in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth and development, crop yield and quality, as well as responses to abiotic stresses. Abscisic acid (ABA) is a multifunctional hormone. However, the exact mechanism by which ABA regulates sugar accumulation is largely unknown in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Here, we tested the expression profile of several sugar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er and amylase genes in response to ABA treatment. <i>MdSUT2</i> and <i>MdAREB2</i> were isolated and genetically transformed into apple (<i>Malus domestica</i>) to investigate their roles in ABA-induced sugar accumulation. The MdAREB2 transcription factor was found to bind to the promoters of the sugar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er and amylase genes and activate their expression. Both MdAREB2 and MdSUT2 transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s produced more soluble sugars than controls. Furthermore, MdAREB2 promoted the accumulation of sucrose and soluble sugars in an <i>MdSUT2</i>-dependent manner. Our results demonstrate that the ABA-responsive transcription factor MdAREB2 directly activates the expression of amylase and sugar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er genes to promote soluble sugar accumulation, suggesting a mechanism by which ABA regulates sugar accumulation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s.</p>

Generation of a Collection of Mutant Tomato Lines Using Pooled CRISPR Libraries
<p>The high efficiency of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-mediated mutagenesis in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s enables the development of high-throughput mutagenesis strategies. By transforming pooled CRISPR libraries into tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>), collections of mutant lines were generated with minimal transformation attempts and in a relatively short period of time. Identification of the targeted gene(s) was easily determined by sequencing the incorporated guide RNA(s) in the primary transgenic events. From a single transformation with a CRISPR library targeting the immunity-associated leucine-rich repeat subfamily XII genes, heritable mutations were recovered in 15 of the 54 genes targeted. To increase throughput, a second CRISPR library was made containing three guide RNAs per construct to target 18 putative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er genes. This resulted in stable mutations in 15 of the 18 targeted genes, with some primary transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s having as many as five mutated genes. Furthermore, the redundancy in this collection of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s allowed for the association of aberrant T0 phenotypes with the underlying targeted genes. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s with mutations in a homolog of an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) boron efflux <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er displayed boron deficiency phenotypes. The strategy described here provides a technically simple yet high-throughput approach for generating a collection of lines with targeted mutations and should be applicable to any <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> transformation system.</p>

A Magnesium Transporter OsMGT1 Plays a Critical Role in Salt Tolerance in Rice
<p>Salt stress is one of the major factors limiting rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) production globally. Although several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers involved in salt tolerance have been identified in rice, the mechanisms regulating their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> activity are still poorly understood. Here, we show evidence that a rice Mg <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er OsMGT1 is required for salt tolerance probably by regulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> activity of OsHKT1;5, a key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er for the removal of Na<sup>+</sup> from the xylem sap at the root mature zone. Knockout of <i>OsMGT1</i> did not affect total Na uptake, but increased Na concentration in the shoots and xylem sap, resulting in a significant increase in salt sensitivity at low external Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration (20–200 μ<sc>m</sc>). However, such differences were abolished at a higher Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration (2 m<sc>m</sc>), although the total Na uptake was not altered. <i>OsMGT1</i> was expressed in both the roots and shoots, but only that in the roots was moderately up-regulated by salt stress. Spatial expression analysis revealed that <i>OsMGT1</i> was expressed in all root cells of the root tips but was highly expressed in the pericycle of root mature zone. <i>OsMGT1</i> was also expressed in the phloem region of basal node, leaf blade, and sheath. When expressed in <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> activity of OsHKT1;5 was enhanced by elevating external Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration. Furthermore, knockout of <i>OsHKT1;5</i> in <i>osmgt1</i> mutant background did not further increase its salt sensitivity. Taken together, our results suggest that Mg<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ed by OsMGT1 in the root mature zone is required for enhancing OsHKT1;5 activity, thereby restricting Na accumulation to the shoots.</p>

A Novel N-Methyltransferase in Arabidopsis Appears to Feed a Conserved Pathway for Nicotinate Detoxification among Land Plants and Is Associated with Lignin Biosynthesis
<p>The Preiss-Handler pathway, which salvages nicotinate (NA) for NAD synthesis, is an indispensable biochemical pathway in land <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Various NA conjugations (mainly methylation and glycosylation) have been detected and have long been proposed for NA detoxification in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Previously, we demonstrated that NA <i>O</i>-glucosylation functions as a mobilizable storage form for NAD biosynthesis in the Brassicaceae. However, little is known about the functions of other NA conjugations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. In this study, we first found that <i>N</i>-methylnicotinate is a ubiquitous NA conjugation in land <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Furthermore, we functionally identified a novel methyltransferase (At3g53140; NA<i>N</i>MT), which is mainly responsible for <i>N</i>-methylnicotinate formation, from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We also established that trigonelline is a detoxification form of endogenous NA in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Combined phylogenetic analysis and enzymatic assays revealed that NA <i>N</i>-methylation activity was likely derived from the duplication and subfunctionalization of an ancestral caffeic acid <i>O</i>-methyltransferase (<i>COMT</i>) gene in the course of land <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> evolution. COMT enzymes, which function in <i>S</i>-lignin biosynthesis, also have weak NA<i>N</i>MT activity. Our data suggest that NA detoxification conferred by NA<i>N</i>MT and COMT might have facilitated the retention of the Preiss-Handler pathway in land <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s.</p>

Metal Tolerance Protein 8 Mediates Manganese Homeostasis and Iron Reallocation during Seed Development and Germination
<p>Metal accumulation in seeds is a prerequisite for germination and establishment of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s but also for micronutrient delivery to humans. To investigate metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> processes and their interactions in seeds, we focused on METAL TOLERANCE PROTEIN8 (MTP8), a tonoplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er of the manganese (Mn) subclade of cation diffusion facilitators, which in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) is expressed in embryos of seeds. The x-ray fluorescence imaging showed that expression of MTP8 was responsible for Mn localization in subepidermal cells on the abaxial side of the cotyledons and in cortical cells of the hypocotyl. Accordingly, under low Mn availability, MTP8 increased seed stores of Mn, required for efficient seed germination. In mutant embryos lacking expression of <i>VACUOLAR IRON <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ER1</i> (<i>VIT1</i>), MTP8 built up iron (Fe) hotspots in <i>MTP8</i>-expressing cells types, suggesting that MTP8 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>s Fe in addition to Mn. In <i>mtp8 vit1</i> double mutant seeds, Mn and Fe were distributed in all cell types of the embryo. An Fe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> function of MTP8 was confirmed by its ability to complement Fe hypersensitivity of a yeast mutant defective in vacuolar Fe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>. Imbibing <i>mtp8-1</i> mutant seeds in the presence of Mn or subjecting seeds to wet-dry cycles showed that MTP8 conferred Mn tolerance. During germination, MTP8 promoted reallocation of Fe from the vasculature. These results indicate that cell type-specific accumulation of Mn and Fe in seeds depends on MTP8 and that this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er plays an important role in the generation of seed metal stores as well as for metal homeostasis and germination efficiency under challenging environmental conditions.</p>

Global Sensitivity Analysis of OnGuard Models Identifies Key Hubs for Transport Interaction in Stomatal Dynamics
<p>The physical requirement for charge to balance across biological membranes means that the transmembrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> of each ionic species is interrelated, and manipulating solute flux through any one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er will affect other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers at the same membrane, often with unforeseen consequences. The OnGuard systems modeling platform has helped to resolve the mechanics of stomatal movements, uncovering previously unexpected behaviors of stomata. To date, however, the manual approach to exploring model parameter space has captured little formal information about the emergent connections between parameters that define the most interesting properties of the system as a whole. Here, we introduce global sensitivity analysis to identify interacting parameters affecting a number of outputs commonly accessed in experiments in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The analysis highlights synergies between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers affecting the balance between Ca<sup>2+</sup> sequestration and Ca<sup>2+</sup> release pathways, notably those associated with internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores and their turnover. Other, unexpected synergies appear, including with the plasma membrane anion channels and H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase and with the tonoplast TPK K<sup>+</sup> channel. These emergent synergies, and the core hubs of interaction that they define, identify subsets of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers associated with free cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration that represent key targets to enhance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> performance in the future. They also highlight the importance of interactions between the voltage regulation of the plasma membrane and tonoplast in coordinating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> between the different cellular compartments.</p>

Fern Stomatal Responses to ABA and CO<sub>2</sub> Depend on Species and Growth Conditions
<p>Changing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels, climate, and air humidity affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> gas exchange that is controlled by stomata, small pores on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> leaves and stems formed by guard cells. Evolution has shaped the morphology and regulatory mechanisms governing stomatal movements to correspond to the needs of various land <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> groups over the past 400 million years. Stomata close in response to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> hormone abscisic acid (ABA), elevated CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, and reduced air humidity. Whether the active regulatory mechanisms that control stomatal closure in response to these stimuli are present already in mosses, the oldest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> group with stomata, or were acquired more recently in angiosperms remains controversial. It has been suggested that the stomata of the basal vascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, such as ferns and lycophytes, close solely hydropassively. On the other hand, active stomatal closure in response to ABA and CO<sub>2</sub> was found in several moss, lycophyte, and fern species. Here, we show that the stomata of two temperate fern species respond to ABA and CO<sub>2</sub> and that an active mechanism of stomatal regulation in response to reduced air humidity is present in some ferns. Importantly, fern stomatal responses depend on growth conditions. The data indicate that the stomatal behavior of ferns is more complex than anticipated before, and active stomatal regulation is present in some ferns and has possibly been lost in others. Further analysis that takes into account fern species, life history, evolutionary age, and growth conditions is required to gain insight into the evolution of land <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> stomatal responses.</p>

A Salivary Endo-β-1,4-Glucanase Acts as an Effector That Enables the Brown Planthopper to Feed on Rice
<p>The brown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>hopper (BPH) <i>Nilaparvata lugens</i> is one of the most destructive insect pests on rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) in Asia. After landing on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, BPH rapidly accesses <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> phloem and sucks the phloem sap through unknown mechanisms. We discovered a salivary endo-β-1,4-glucanase (NlEG1) that has endoglucanase activity with a maximal activity at pH 6 at 37°C and is secreted into rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s by BPH. <i>NlEG1</i> is highly expressed in the salivary glands and midgut. Silencing <i>NlEG1</i> decreases the capacity of BPH to reach the phloem and reduces its food intake, mass, survival, and fecundity on rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. By contrast, <i>NlEG1</i> silencing had only a small effect on the survival rate of BPH raised on artificial diet. Moreover, NlEG1 secreted by BPH did not elicit the production of the defense-related signal molecules salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and jasmonoyl-isoleucine in rice, although wounding plus the application of the recombination protein NlEG1 did slightly enhance the levels of jasmonic acid and jasmonoyl-isoleucine in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s compared with the corresponding controls. These data suggest that NlEG1 enables the BPH’s stylet to reach the phloem by degrading celluloses in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> cell walls, thereby functioning as an effector that overcomes the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> cell wall defense in rice.</p>

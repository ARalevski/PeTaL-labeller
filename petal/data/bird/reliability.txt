Distribution of Estimated 10-Year Risk of Recurrent Vascular Events and Residual Risk in a Secondary Prevention Population
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Among patients with clinically manifest vascular disease, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of recurrent vascular events is likely to vary. We assessed the distribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated 10-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of recurrent vascular events in a secondary prevention population. We also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated the potential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> reduction and residual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> that can be achieved if patients reach guideline-recommended <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factor targets.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The SMART score (Second Manifestations of Arterial Disease) for 10-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of myocardial infarction, stroke, or vascular death was applied to 6904 patients with vascular disease. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> score was externally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valid</span></strong>ated in 18 436 patients with various manifestations of vascular disease from the TNT (Treating to New Targets), IDEAL (Incremental Decrease in End Points Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering), SPARCL (Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels), and CAPRIE (Clopidogrel Versus Aspirin in Patients at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of Ischemic Events) trials. The residual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> at guideline-recommended targets was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated by applying relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> reductions from meta-analyses to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> for targets for systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, physical activity, and use of antithrombotic agents.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The external <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perform</span></strong>ance of the SMART <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> score was reasonable, apart from over<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> in patients with 10-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> >40%.

If <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors were at guideline-recommended targets, the residual 10-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> would be <10% in 47% and >30% in 9% of the patients (median, 11%; interquartile range, 7%–17%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among patients with vascular disease, there is very substantial variation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated 10-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of recurrent vascular events. If all modifiable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors were at guideline-recommended targets, half of the patients would have a 10-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> <10%. These data suggest that even with optimal treatment, many patients with vascular disease will remain at >20% and even >30% 10-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>, clearly delineating an area of substantial unmet medical need.</p></sec>

Cardiovascular Risk Prediction Functions Underestimate Risk in HIV Infection

Lack of Concordance Between Empirical Scores and Physician Assessments of Stroke and Bleeding Risk in Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Physicians treating patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) must weigh the benefits of anticoagulation in preventing stroke versus the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of bleeding. Although empirical models have been developed to predict such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s, the degree to which these coincide with clinicians’ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ates is unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We examined 10 094 AF patients enrolled in the Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of AF (ORBIT-AF) registry between June 2010 and August 2011. Empirical stroke and bleeding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s were assessed by using the congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥75 years, diabetes mellitus, and previous stroke or transient ischemic attack (CHADS<sub>2</sub>) and Anticoagulation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> Factors in Atrial Fibrillation (ATRIA) scores, respectively.

Overall, 72% (n=7251) in ORBIT-AF had high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> CHADS<sub>2</sub> scores (≥2). However, only 16% were assessed as high stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> by physicians. Although 17% (n=1749) had high ATRIA bleeding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> (score ≥5), only 7% (n=719) were considered so by physicians.

Oral Anticoagulation in Very Elderly Patients With Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Stroke prevention with oral anticoagulants (OACs) is the cornerstone for the management of atrial fibrillation (AF). However, data about the use of OACs among patients ≥90 years of age are limited. We aimed to investigate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of ischemic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and the net clinical benefit of OAC treatment for very elderly patients with AF (≥90 years of age).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This study used the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s of ischemic stroke and ICH were compared between 11 064 and 14 658 patients with and without AF ≥90 years of age without antithrombotic therapy from 1996 to 2011. Patients with AF (n=15 756) were divided into 3 groups (no treatment, antiplatelet agents, and warfarin), and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s of stroke and ICH were analyzed. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s of ischemic stroke and ICH were further compared between patients treated with warfarin and nonvitamin K antagonist OACs (NOACs) from 2012 to 2015 when NOACs were available in Taiwan.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Compared with patients without AF, patients with AF had an increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of ischemic stroke (event number/patient number, incidence = 742/11 064, 5.75%/y versus 1399/14 658, 3.00%/y; hazard ratio, 1.93; 95% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confid</span></strong>ence interval, 1.74–2.14) and similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of ICH (131/11 064, 0.97%/y versus 206/14 658, 0.54%/y; hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confid</span></strong>ence interval, 0.66–1.09) in competing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> analysis for mortality.

Polygenic Risk Score Identifies Subgroup With Higher Burden of Atherosclerosis and Greater Relative Benefit From Statin Therapy in the Primary Prevention Setting
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> reduction with statin therapy has been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">consist</span></strong>ent across nearly all subgroups studied to date. However, in analyses of 2 randomized controlled primary prevention trials (ASCOT [Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial–Lipid-Lowering Arm] and JUPITER [Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin]), statin therapy led to a greater relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> reduction among a subgroup at high genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>. Here, we aimed to confirm this observation in a third primary prevention randomized controlled trial. In addition, we assessed whether those at high genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> had a greater burden of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied participants from a randomized controlled trial of primary prevention with statin therapy (WOSCOPS [West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study]; n=4910) and 2 observational cohort studies (CARDIA [Coronary Artery <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> Development in Young Adults] and BioImage; n=1154 and 4392, respectively). For each participant, we calculated a polygenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> score derived from up to 57 common DNA sequence variants previously associated with coronary heart disease. We compared the relative efficacy of statin therapy in those at high genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> (top quintile of polygenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> score) versus all others (WOSCOPS), as well as the association between the polygenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> score and coronary artery calcification (CARDIA) and carotid artery plaque burden (BioImage).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among WOSCOPS trial participants at high genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>, statin therapy was associated with a relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> reduction of 44% (95% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confid</span></strong>ence interval [CI], 22–60; <i>P</i><0.001), whereas in all others, the relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> reduction was 24% (95% CI, 8–37; <i>P</i>=0.004) despite similar low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering. In a study-level meta-analysis across the WOSCOPS, ASCOT, and JUPITER primary prevention, relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> reduction in those at high genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> was 46% versus 26% in all others (<i>P</i> for heterogeneity=0.05).

Genetic Risk Prediction of Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) has a substantial genetic basis. Identification of individuals at grea<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> AF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> could minimize the incidence of cardioembolic stroke.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To determine whether genetic data can stratify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> for development of AF, we examined associations between AF genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> scores and incident AF in 5 prospective studies comprising 18 919 individuals of European ancestry. We examined associations between AF genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> scores and ischemic stroke in a separate study of 509 ischemic stroke cases (202 cardioembolic [40%]) and 3028 referents. Scores were based on 11 to 719 common variants (≥5%) associated with AF at <i>P</i> values ranging from <1×10<sup>−3</sup> to <1×10<sup>−8</sup> in a prior independent genetic association study.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Incident AF occurred in 1032 individuals (5.5%). AF genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> scores were associated with new-onset AF after adjustment for clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors. The pooled hazard ratio for incident AF for the highest versus lowest quartile of genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> scores ranged from 1.28 (719 variants; 95% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confid</span></strong>ence interval, 1.13–1.46; <i>P</i>=1.5×10<sup>−4</sup>) to 1.67 (25 variants; 95% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confid</span></strong>ence interval, 1.47–1.90; <i>P</i>=9.3×10<sup>−15</sup>). Discrimination of combined clinical and genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> scores varied across studies and scores (maximum C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">statist</span></strong>ic, 0.629–0.811; maximum ΔC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">statist</span></strong>ic from clinical score alone, 0.009–0.017). AF genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> was associated with stroke in age- and sex-adjusted models. For example, individuals in the highest versus lowest quartile of a 127-variant score had a 2.49-fold increased odds of cardioembolic stroke (95% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confid</span></strong>ence interval, 1.39–4.58; <i>P</i>=2.7×10<sup>−3</sup>). The effect persisted after the exclusion of individuals (n=70) with known AF (odds ratio, 2.25; 95% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confid</span></strong>ence interval, 1.20–4.40; <i>P</i>=0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Comprehensive AF genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> scores were associated with incident AF beyond associations for clinical AF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors but offered small improvements in discrimination.

Echocardiographic Screening for Rheumatic Heart Disease in High and Low Risk Australian Children
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Echocardiographic screening for rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is becoming more widespread, but screening studies to date have used different echocardiographic definitions. The World Heart Federation has recently published new criteria for the echocardiographic diagnosis of RHD. We aimed to establish the prevalence of RHD in high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> Indigenous Australian children using these criteria and to compare the findings with a group of Australian children at low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> for RHD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Portable echocardiography was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perform</span></strong>ed on high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> Indigenous children aged 5 to15 years living in remote communities of northern Australia.

Echocardiograms were reported in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>ized, blinded fashion. Of 3946 high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> children, 34 met World Heart Federation criteria for definite RHD (prevalence, 8.6 per 1000 [95% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confid</span></strong>ence interval, 6.0–12.0]) and 66 for borderline RHD (prevalence, 16.7 per 1000 [95% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confid</span></strong>ence interval, 13.0–21.2]). Of 1053 low-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> children, none met the criteria for definite RHD, and 5 met the criteria for borderline RHD.

Venous thromboembolic prophylaxis after simultaneous bilateral total knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of this study were to compare the efficacy of two agents,   aspirin and warfarin, for the prevention of venous thromboembolism   (VTE) after simultaneous bilateral total knee arthroplasty (SBTKA),   and to elucidate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of VTE conferred by this procedure compared   with unilateral TKA (UTKA).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A retrospective, multi-institutional study was conducted on 18   951 patients, 3685 who underwent SBTKA and 15 266 who underwent   UTKA, using aspirin or warfarin as VTE prophylaxis. Each patient   was assigned an individualised baseline VTE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> score based on   a system using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample. Symptomatic VTE,   including pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT),   were identified in the first 90 days post-operatively.

Similarly, the adjusted incidence of VTE following   SBTKA was 1.6% (95% CI 1.1 to 2.3) with aspirin and 2.5% (95% CI   1.9 to 3.3) with warfarin. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of PE and VTE were reduced by   66% (odds ratio (OR) 0.44, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.78) and 38% (OR 0.62,   95% CI 0.38 to 1.0), respectively, using aspirin.

Female Sex Is a Risk Modifier Rather Than a Risk Factor for Stroke in Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> in atrial fibrillation is assessed by using the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score. Sex category (Sc, ie, female sex) confers 1 point on CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc. We hypothesized that female sex is a stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> modifier, rather than an overall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factor, when added to a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA (sex-independent thromboembolism <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>) score scale.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using 3 nationwide registries, we identified patients with incident nonvalvular atrial fibrillation from January 1, 1997, through December 31, 2015. Patients receiving oral anticoagulant treatment at baseline were excluded, and person-time was censored at the time of treatment initiation (if any). CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA scores were calculated for men and women, and were followed for up to 1 year in the Danish National Patient Registry. The primary outcome was a primary hospital code for ischemic stroke or systemic embolism (thromboembolism). We calculated crude event rates for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> strata as events per 100 person-years. For quantifying absolute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of stroke, we calculated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s based on the pseudovalue method. Female sex as a prognostic factor was investigated by inclusion as an interaction term on the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA score to calculate the thromboembolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> ratio for different score points.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 239 671 patients with atrial fibrillation (48.7% women) contributed to the analyses. The mean ages for women and men were 76.6 years and 70.3 years, respectively; the mean CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA scores were 2.7 for women and 2.3 for men. The overall 1-year thromboembolic rate per 100 person-years for women was 7.3 and 5.7 for men. The 1-year absolute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of thromboembolism was 0.5% among men and women with a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA score of 0 and increased up to >7% among very comorbid patients (score >5). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> ratio (male as reference) across points >1 indicated that women exhibit a higher stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>. The interaction was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">statist</span></strong>ically significant (<i>P</i><0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Female sex is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> modifier for stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Initial decisions on oral anticoagulant treatment could be guided by a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA score (ie, excluding the sex category criterion), but the Sc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> component modifies and accentuates stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> in women who would have been eligible for oral anticoagulant treatment on the basis of ≥2 additional stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors.</p></sec>

Synovasure ‘quick test’ is not as accurate as the laboratory-based α-defensin immunoassay
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>α-defensin is a biomarker which has been described as having   a high degree of accuracy in the diagnosis of periprosthetic joint   infection (PJI). Current meta-analyses are based on the α-defensin   laboratory-based immunoassay rather than the quick on-table lateral   flow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> kit. This study is the first meta-analysis to compare the   accuracy of the α-defensin laboratory-based immunoassay and the   lateral flow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> kit for the diagnosis of PJI.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A systematic review was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perform</span></strong>ed according to the Preferred   Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.   Inclusion criteria were all clinical studies where the diagnosis   of PJI was uncertain. All studies selected used the Musculoskeletal   Infection Society (MSIS) or modified MSIS criteria. Two independent   reviewers reviewed the studies and extracted data. A meta-analysis   of results was carried out: pooled sensitivity, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity, positive   and negative likelihood ratio, heterogeneity and areas under curves   are reported.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Ten studies (759 patients) were included. Of these, seven studies   (640 patients) evaluated the laboratory-based α-defensin immunoassay   and three (119 patients) the lateral flow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>. The pooled sensitivity   and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity of the qualitative α-defensin laboratory immunoassay   was 0.953 (95% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confid</span></strong>ence interval (CI) 0.87 to 0.984) and 0.965 (95%   CI 0.943 to 0.979) respectively. The pooled positive likelihood   ratio (PLR) and negative likelihood ratio (NLR) were 34.86 (95%   CI 19.34 to 62.85) and 0.02 (95% CI 0.00 to 0.11). The pooled sensitivity   and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity of the lateral flow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> were 0.774 (95% CI 0.637   to 0.870) and 0.913 (95% CI 0.828 to 0.958), respectively. The pooled   PLR and NLR were 8.675 (95% CI 4.229 to 17.794) and 0.248 (95% CI   0.147 to 0.418), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The pooled sensitivity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>icity of the lateral flow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>   were lower than those of the   α-defensin laboratory-based immunoassay <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>.

Value of Progression of Coronary Artery Calcification for Risk Prediction of Coronary and Cardiovascular Events
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Computed tomography (CT) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">allow</span></strong>s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ation of coronary artery calcium (CAC) progression. We evaluated several progression algorithms in our unselected, population-based cohort for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> prediction of coronary and cardiovascular events.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In 3281 participants (45–74 years of age), free from cardiovascular disease until the second visit, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors, and CTs at baseline (b) and after a mean of 5.1 years (5y) were measured. Hard coronary and cardiovascular events, and total cardiovascular events including revascularization, as well, were recorded during a follow-up time of 7.8±2.2 years after the second CT. The added predictive value of 10 CAC progression algorithms on top of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors including baseline CAC was evaluated by using survival analysis, C-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">statist</span></strong>ics, net reclassification improvement, and integrated discrimination index. A subgroup analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> in CAC categories was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perform</span></strong>ed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We observed 85 (2.6%) hard coronary, 161 (4.9%) hard cardiovascular, and 241 (7.3%) total cardiovascular events. Absolute CAC progression was higher with versus without subsequent coronary events (median, 115 [Q1–Q3, 23–360] versus 8 [0–83], <i>P</i><0.0001; similar for hard/total cardiovascular events). Some progression algorithms added to the predictive value of baseline CT and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> assessment in terms of C-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">statist</span></strong>ic or integrated discrimination index, especially for total cardiovascular events. However, CAC progression did not improve models including CAC<sub>5y</sub> and 5-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors. An excellent prognosis was found for 921 participants with double-zero CAC<sub>b</sub>=CAC<sub>5y</sub>=0 (10-year coronary and hard/total cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>: 1.4%, 2.0%, and 2.8%), which was for participants with incident CAC 1.8%, 3.8%, and 6.6%, respectively. When CAC<sub>b</sub> progressed from 1 to 399 to CAC<sub>5y</sub>≥400, coronary and total cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> were nearly 2-fold in comparison with subjects who remained below CAC<sub>5y</sub>=400. Participants with CAC<sub>b</sub>≥400 had high rates of hard coronary and hard/total cardiovascular events (10-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>: 12.0%, 13.5%, and 30.9%, respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>CAC progression is associated with coronary and cardiovascular event rates, but adds only weakly to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> prediction. What counts is the most recent CAC value and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factor assessment. Therefore, a repeat scan >5 years after the first scan may be of additional value, except when a double-zero CT scan is present or when the subjects are already at high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>.</p></sec>

Randomized Comparisons of Double-Dose Clopidogrel or Adjunctive Cilostazol Versus Standard Dual Antiplatelet in Patients With High Posttreatment Platelet Reactivity
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention react differently to antiplatelet drugs. Those with low responsiveness to clopidogrel have a higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of cardiac ischemic events. The goal of this study is to conduct a head-to-head comparison of the safety and effectiveness of intensified antiplatelet therapies (either double-dose clopidogrel [DOUBLE] or adjunctive cilostazol [TRIPLE]) and conventional strategy (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>) in patients after percutaneous coronary intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In this single-center, randomized, controlled trial, we used thromboelastography, a platelet function <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>, to select 1078 patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention at high thrombotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> and compared the intensified antiplatelet therapies with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> antiplatelet therapy. The primary outcome was the incidence of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events at 18 months after percutaneous coronary intervention, defined as a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularization, or stroke. Bleeding Academic Research Consortium defined bleeding complications (types 1, 2, 3, or 5) were the safety end points.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The primary end point occurred in 52 patients (14.4%) in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> group, 38 patients (10.6%) in the DOUBLE group, and 30 patients (8.5%) in the TRIPLE group (hazard ratio, 0.720; 95% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confid</span></strong>ence interval, 0.474–1.094, DOUBLE versus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>; hazard ratio, 0.550; 95% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confid</span></strong>ence interval, 0.349–0.866, TRIPLE versus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong>).

Sex Differences and Similarities in Atrial Fibrillation Epidemiology, Risk Factors, and Mortality in Community Cohorts
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac disease in aging populations with high comorbidity and mortality. Sex differences in AF epidemiology are insufficiently understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In N=79 793 individuals without AF diagnosis at baseline (median age, 49.6 years; age range, 24.1–97.6 years; 51.7% women) from 4 community-based European studies (FIN<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>, DanMONICA, Moli-sani Northern Sweden) of the BiomarCaRE consortium (Biomarker for Cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> Assessment in Europe), we examined AF incidence, its association with mortality, common <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors, biomarkers, and prevalent cardiovascular disease, and their attributable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> by sex. Median follow-up time was 12.6 (to a maximum of 28.2) years.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Fewer AF cases were observed in women (N=1796; 4.4%), than in men (N=2465; 6.4%). Cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factor distribution and lipid profile at baseline were less beneficial in men than in women, and cardiovascular disease was more prevalent in men. Cumulative incidence increased markedly after the age of 50 years in men and after 60 years in women. The lifetime <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> was similar (>30%) for both sexes. Subjects with incident AF had a 3.5-fold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of death in comparison with those without AF. Multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variabl</span></strong>e-adjusted models showed sex differences for the association of body mass index and AF (hazard ratio per <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> deviation increase, 1.18; 95% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confid</span></strong>ence interval [CI], 1.12–1.23 in women versus 1.31; 95% CI 1.25–1.38 in men; interaction <i>P</i> value of 0.001).

No sex differences were seen for C-reactive protein and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide. The population-attributable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors combined was 41.9% in women and 46.0% in men.

The Cost-Effectiveness of Antibiotic Prophylaxis for Patients at Risk of Infective Endocarditis

We have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perform</span></strong>ed a new economic evaluation of AP on the basis of contemporary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ates of efficacy, adverse events, and resource implications.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A decision analytic cost-effectiveness model was used. Health service costs and benefits (measured as quality-adjusted life-years) were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated. Rates of IE before and after the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance were available to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate prophylactic efficacy. AP adverse event rates were derived from recent UK data, and resource implications were based on English Hospital Episode Statistics.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>AP was less costly and more effective than no AP for all patients at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of IE. The results are sensitive to AP efficacy, but efficacy would have to be substantially lower for AP not to be cost-effective. AP was even more cost-effective in patients at high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of IE. Only a marginal reduction in annual IE rates (1.44 cases in high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> and 33 cases in all at-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> patients) would be required for AP to be considered cost-effective at £20 000 ($26 600) per quality-adjusted life-year.

Long-Term Safety and Effectiveness of Mechanical Versus Biologic Aortic Valve Prostheses in Older Patients
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>There is a paucity of long-term data comparing biological versus mechanical aortic valve prostheses in older individuals.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perform</span></strong>ed follow-up of patients aged 65 to 80 years undergoing aortic valve replacement with a biological (n=24 410) or mechanical (n=14 789) prosthesis from 1991 to 1999 at 605 centers within the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database using Medicare inpatient claims (mean, 12.6 years; maximum, 17 years; minimum, 8 years), and outcomes were compared by propensity methods.

<sec><title>Background:</title><p>No practical tool quantitates the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of circulatory-etiology death (CED) immediately after successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation in patients without ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction. We developed and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valid</span></strong>ated a prediction model to rapidly determine that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> and facilitate triage to individualized treatment pathways.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>With the use of INTCAR (International Cardiac Arrest Registry), an 87-question data set representing 44 centers in the United States and Europe, patients were classified as having had CED or a combined end point of neurological-etiology death or survival. Demographics and clinical factors were modeled in a derivation cohort, and backward stepwise logistic regression was used to identify factors independently associated with CED. We demonstrated model <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perform</span></strong>ance using area under the curve and the Hosmer-Lemeshow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> in the derivation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valid</span></strong>ation cohorts, and assigned a simplified point-scoring system.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 638 patients in the derivation cohort, 121 (18.9%) had CED. The final model included preexisting coronary artery disease (odds ratio [OR], 2.86; <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confid</span></strong>ence interval [CI], 1.83–4.49; <i>P</i>≤0.001), nonshockable rhythm (OR, 1.75; CI, 1.10–2.77; P=0.017), initial ejection fraction<30% (OR, 2.11; CI, 1.32–3.37; <i>P</i>=0.002), shock at presentation (OR, 2.27; CI, 1.42–3.62; P<0.001), and ischemic time >25 minutes (OR, 1.42; CI, 0.90–2.23; P=0.13). The derivation model area under the curve was 0.73, and Hosmer-Lemeshow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> P=0.47. Outcomes were similar in the 318-patient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valid</span></strong>ation cohort (area under the curve 0.68, Hosmer-Lemeshow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> P=0.41). When assigned a point for each associated factor in the derivation model, the average predicted versus observed probability of CED with a CREST score (coronary artery disease, initial heart rhythm, low ejection fraction, shock at the time of admission, and ischemic time >25 minutes) of 0 to 5 was: 7.1% versus 10.2%, 9.5% versus 11%, 22.5% versus 19.6%, 32.4% versus 29.6%, 38.5% versus 30%, and 55.7% versus 50%.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The CREST model stratified patients immediately after resuscitation according to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of a circulatory-etiology death. The tool may <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">allow</span></strong> for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ation of circulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> and improve the triage of survivors of cardiac arrest without ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction at the point of care.</p></sec>

At the index age of 45 years, the lifetime <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> for any HF through 90 years of age was higher in men than women (27.4% versus 23.8%). Among HF subtypes, the lifetime <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> for HFrEF was higher in men than women (10.6% versus 5.8%). In contrast, the lifetime <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> for HFpEF was similar in men and women.

Particulate Matter Air Pollution Exposure and Heart Disease Mortality Risks by Race and Ethnicity in the United States
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Most US studies of mortality and air pollution have been conducted on largely non-Hispanic white study populations. However, many health and mortality outcomes differ by race and ethnicity, and non-Hispanic white persons experience lower air pollution exposure than those who are non-Hispanic black or Hispanic. This study examines whether associations between air pollution and heart disease mortality differ by race/ethnicity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used data from the 1997 to 2009 National Health Interview Survey linked to mortality records through December 2011 and annual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ates of fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) by census tract.

Impact of Lipid Measurements in Youth in Addition to Conventional Clinic-Based Risk Factors on Predicting Preclinical Atherosclerosis in Adulthood
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Data suggest that the prediction of adult cardiovascular disease using a model comprised entirely of adult nonlaboratory-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors is equivalent to an approach that additionally incorporates adult lipid measures. We assessed and compared the utility of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> model based solely on nonlaboratory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors in adolescence versus a lipid model based on nonlaboratory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors plus lipids for predicting high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) in adulthood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The study comprised 2893 participants 12 to 18 years of age from 4 longitudinal cohort studies from the United States (Bogalusa Heart Study and the Insulin Study), Australia (Childhood Determinants of Adult Health Study), and Finland (The Cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> in Young Finns Study) and followed into adulthood when cIMT was measured (mean follow-up, 23.4 years). Overweight status was defined according to the Cole classification. Hypertension was defined according to the Fourth Report on High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents from the National High Blood Pressure Education Program. High-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> plasma lipid levels were defined according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Cholesterol Levels in Children. High cIMT was defined as a study-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ic value ≥90th percentile. Age and sex were included in each model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In univariate models, all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors except for borderline high and high triglycerides in adolescence were associated with high cIMT in adulthood. In multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variabl</span></strong>e models (relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> [95% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confid</span></strong>ence interval]), male sex (2.7 [2.0–2.6]), prehypertension (1.4 [1.0–1.9]), hypertension (1.9 [1.3–2.9]), overweight (2.0 [1.4–2.9]), obesity (3.7 [2.0–7.0]), borderline high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (1.6 [1.2–2.2]), high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (1.6 [1.1–2.1]), and borderline low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (1.4 [1.0–1.8]) remained significant predictors of high cIMT (<i>P</i><0.05).

Genetic Architecture of the Cardiovascular Risk Proteome

Here we hypothesized that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perform</span></strong>ing genome-wide association studies and exome array analyses on the levels of each of these 156 proteins might identify genetic determinants of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>-associated circulating factors and provide insights into early cardiovascular pathophysiology.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied the association of genetic variants with the plasma levels of each of the 156 Framingham Cardiovascular Disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> Score–associated proteins using linear mixed-effects models in 2 population-based cohorts.

Global analysis of protein folding using massively parallel design, synthesis, and testing
<p>Proteins fold into unique native structures <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ized by thousands of weak interactions that collectively overcome the entropic cost of folding. Although these forces are “encoded” in the thousands of known protein structures, “decoding” them is challenging because of the complexity of natural proteins that have evolved for function, not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity. We combined computational protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>, next-generation gene synthesis, and a high-throughput protease susceptibility assay to measure folding and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity for more than 15,000 de novo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed miniproteins, 1000 natural proteins, 10,000 point mutants, and 30,000 negative control sequences. This analysis identified more than 2500 stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed proteins in four basic folds—a number sufficient to enable us to systematically examine how sequence determines folding and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity in uncharted protein space. Iteration between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> and experiment increased the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> success rate from 6% to 47%, produced stable proteins unlike those found in nature for topologies where <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> was initially unsuccessful, and revealed subtle contributions to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>s became increasingly optimized. Our approach achieves the long-standing goal of a tight feedback cycle between computation and experiment and has the potential to transform computational protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> into a data-driven science.</p>

Association of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection and Risk of Peripheral Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The effect of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on the development of peripheral artery disease (PAD) remains unclear. We investigated whether HIV infection is associated with an increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of PAD after adjustment for traditional atherosclerotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors in a large cohort of HIV-infected (HIV+) and demographically similar HIV-uninfected veterans.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied participants in the Veterans Aging Cohort Study from April 1, 2003 through December 31, 2014. We excluded participants with known prior PAD or prevalent cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary heart disease, and congestive heart failure) and analyzed the effect of HIV status on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of incident PAD events after adjusting for demographics, PAD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors, substance use, CD4 cell count, HIV-1 ribonucleic acid, and antiretroviral therapy. The primary outcome is incident peripheral artery disease events. Secondary outcomes include mortality and amputation in subjects with incident PAD events by HIV infection status, viral load, and CD4 count.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 91 953 participants, over a median follow up of 9.0 years, there were 7708 incident PAD events. Rates of incident PAD events per 1000 person-years were higher among HIV+ (11.9; 95% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confid</span></strong>ence interval [CI], 11.5–12.4) than uninfected veterans (9.9; 95% CI, 9.6–10.1). After adjustment for demographics, PAD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors, and other covariates, HIV+ veterans had an increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of incident PAD events compared with uninfected veterans (hazard ratio [HR], 1.19; 95% CI, 1.13–1.25). This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> was highest among those with time-updated HIV viral load >500 copies/mL (HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.38–1.65) and CD4 cell counts <200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> (HR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.71–2.13). In contrast, HIV+ veterans with time updated CD4 cell count ≥500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> had no increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of PAD (HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.96–1.11). Mortality rates after incident PAD events are high regardless of HIV status. HIV infection did not affect rates of amputation after incident PAD events.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Infection with HIV is associated with a 19% increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of PAD beyond that explained by traditional atherosclerotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors. However, for those with sustained CD4 cell counts <200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of incident PAD events is nearly 2-fold higher whereas for those with sustained CD4 cell counts ≥500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> there is no excess <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of incident PAD events compared with uninfected people.</p></sec>

Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Lowering With Evolocumab and Outcomes in Patients With Peripheral Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitor evolocumab reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and cardiovascular events in the FOURIER trial (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects With Elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>). We investigated the efficacy and safety of evolocumab in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) as well as the effect on major adverse limb events.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>FOURIER was a randomized trial of evolocumab versus placebo in 27 564 patients with atherosclerotic disease on statin therapy followed for a median of 2.2 years. Patients were identified as having PAD at baseline if they had intermittent claudication and an ankle brachial index of <0.85, or if they had a prior peripheral vascular procedure. The primary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospital admission for unstable angina, or coronary revascularization. The key secondary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. An additional outcome of interest was major adverse limb events defined as acute limb ischemia, major amputation, or urgent peripheral revascularization for ischemia.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Three thousand six hundred forty-two patients (13.2%) had PAD (1505 with no prior myocardial infarction or stroke). Evolocumab significantly reduced the primary end point <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">consist</span></strong>ently in patients with PAD (hazard ratio [HR] 0.79; 95% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confid</span></strong>ence interval [CI], 0.66–0.94; <i>P</i>=0.0098) and without PAD (HR 0.86; 95% CI, 0.80–0.93; <i>P</i>=0.0003; <i>P</i><sub>interaction</sub>=0.40). For the key secondary end point, the HRs were 0.73 (0.59–0.91; <i>P</i>=0.0040) for those with PAD and 0.81 (0.73–0.90; <i>P</i><0.0001) for those without PAD (<i>P</i><sub>interaction</sub>=0.41). Because of their higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>, patients with PAD had larger absolute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> reductions for the primary end point (3.5% with PAD, 1.6% without PAD) and the key secondary end point (3.5% with PAD, 1.4% without PAD). Evolocumab reduced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of major adverse limb events in all patients (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.38–0.88; <i>P</i>=0.0093) with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">consist</span></strong>ent effects in those with and without known PAD. There was a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">consist</span></strong>ent relationship between lower achieved low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of limb events (<i>P</i>=0.026 for the beta coefficient) that extended down to <10 mg/dL.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Patients with PAD are at high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of cardiovascular events, and PCSK9 inhibition with evolocumab significantly reduced that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> with large absolute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> reductions.

Prevalence and Predictors of Cholesterol Screening, Awareness, and Statin Treatment Among US Adults With Familial Hypercholesterolemia or Other Forms of Severe Dyslipidemia (1999–2014)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and other extreme elevations in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol significantly increase the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; however, recent data suggest that prescription rates for statins remain low in these patients. National rates of screening, awareness, and treatment with statins among individuals with FH or severe dyslipidemia are unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data from the 1999 to 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were used to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ate prevalence rates of self-reported screening, awareness, and statin therapy among US adults (n=42 471 weighted to represent 212 million US adults) with FH (defined using the Dutch Lipid Clinic criteria) and with severe dyslipidemia (defined as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels ≥190 mg/dL). Logistic regression was used to identify sociodemographic and clinical correlates of hypercholesterolemia awareness and statin therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated US prevalence of definite/probable FH was 0.47% (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>, 0.03%) and of severe dyslipidemia was 6.6% (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>, 0.2%). The frequency of cholesterol screening and awareness was high (>80%) among adults with definite/probable FH or severe dyslipidemia; however, statin use was uniformly low (52.3% [<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>, 8.2%] of adults with definite/probable FH and 37.6% [<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>, 1.2%] of adults with severe dyslipidemia). Only 30.3% of patients with definite/probable FH on statins were taking a high-intensity statin. The prevalence of statin use in adults with severe dyslipidemia increased over time (from 29.4% to 47.7%) but not faster than trends in the general population (from 5.7% to 17.6%). Older age, health insurance status, having a usual source of care, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and having a personal history of early atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease were associated with higher statin use.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Despite the high prevalence of cholesterol screening and awareness, only ≈50% of adults with FH are on statin therapy, with even fewer prescribed a high-intensity statin; young and uninsured patients are at the highest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> for lack of screening and for undertreatment. This study highlights an imperative to improve the frequency of cholesterol screening and statin prescription rates to better identify and treat this high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> population. Additional studies are needed to better understand how to close these gaps in screening and treatment.</p></sec>

Six-Year Changes in Physical Activity and the Risk of Incident Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Higher physical activity (PA) is associated with lower heart failure (HF) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>; however, the effect of changes in PA on HF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We evaluated 11 351 ARIC study (Atherosclerosis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> in Communities) participants (mean age 60 years) who attended visit 3 (1993–1995) and did not have a history of cardiovascular disease. Exercise PA was assessed using a modified Baecke questionnaire and categorized according to American Heart Association guidelines as recommended, intermediate, or poor. We used Cox regression models to characterize the association of 6-year changes in PA between the first (1987–1989) and third ARIC visits and HF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>During a median of 19 years of follow-up, 1750 HF events occurred.

Use of a Single Baseline Versus Multiyear 24-Hour Urine Collection for Estimation of Long-Term Sodium Intake and Associated Cardiovascular and Renal Risk
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>A decrease in sodium intake has been shown to lower blood pressure, but data from cohort studies on the association with cardiovascular and renal outcomes are in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">consist</span></strong>ent. In these studies, sodium intake was often <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated with a single baseline measurement, which may be inaccurate considering day-to-day changes in sodium intake and sodium excretion. We compared the effects of single versus repetitive follow-up 24-hour urine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es on the relation between sodium intake and long-term cardiorenal outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We selected adult subjects with an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated glomerular filtration rate >60 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>, an outpatient 24-hour urine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e between 1998 and 1999, and at least 1 collection during a 17-year follow-up.

We used Cox regression analysis and the landmark approach to investigate the relation between sodium intake and cardiovascular (cardiovascular events or mortality) and renal (end-stage renal disease: dialysis, transplantation, and/or >60% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated glomerular filtration rate decline, or mortality) outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We included 574 subjects with 9776 twenty-four–hour urine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es. Average age was 47 years, and 46% were male. Median follow-up was 16.2 years. Average 24-hour sodium excretion, ranging from 3.8 to 3.9 g (165–170 mmol), was equal among all methods (<i>P</i>=0.88). However, relative to a single baseline measurement, 50% of the subjects had a >0.8-g (>34-mmol) difference in sodium intake with long-term <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ations. As a result, 45%, 49%, and 50% of all subjects switched between tertiles of sodium intake when the 1-, 5-, or 15-year average was used, respectively. Consequently, hazard ratios for cardiorenal outcome changed up to 85% with the use of sodium intake <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ations from short-term (1-year) and long-term (5-year) follow-up instead of baseline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ations.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Relative to a single baseline 24-hour sodium measurement, the use of subsequent 24-hour urine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es resulted in different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ations of an individual’s sodium intake, whereas population averages remained similar.

We hypothesized that a strategy combining promising biomarkers across multiple different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing modalities would improve global and atherosclerotic CVD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> assessment among individuals without known CVD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We included participants from MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) (n=6621) and the Dallas Heart Study (n=2202) who were free from CVD and underwent measurement of left ventricular hypertrophy by ECG, coronary artery calcium, N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Associations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> results with the global composite CVD outcome (CVD death, myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary or peripheral revascularization, incident heart failure, or atrial fibrillation) and ASCVD (fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke) were assessed over >10 years of follow-up. Multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variabl</span></strong>e analyses for the primary global CVD end point adjusted for traditional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors plus statin use and creatinine (base model).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> result was independently associated with global composite CVD events in MESA after adjustment for the components of the base model and the other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> results (<i>P</i><0.05 for each).

Common Genetic Variant Risk Score Is Associated With Drug-Induced QT Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes Risk
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Drug-induced QT interval prolongation, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factor for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, is a potential side effect of many marketed and withdrawn medications. The contribution of common genetic variants previously associated with baseline QT interval to drug-induced QT prolongation and arrhythmias is not known.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ed the hypothesis that a weighted combination of common genetic variants contributing to QT interval at baseline, identified through genome-wide association studies, can predict individual response to multiple QT-prolonging drugs. Genetic analysis of 22 subjects was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perform</span></strong>ed in a secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of 3 QT-prolonging drugs with 15 time-matched QT and plasma drug concentration measurements. Subjects received single doses of dofetilide, quinidine, ranolazine, and placebo. The outcome was the correlation between a genetic QT score comprising 61 common genetic variants and the slope of an individual subject’s drug-induced increase in heart rate–corrected QT (QTc) versus drug concentration.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The genetic QT score was correlated with drug-induced QTc prolongation. Among white subjects, genetic QT score explained 30% of the variability in response to dofetilide (<i>r</i>=0.55; 95% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confid</span></strong>ence interval, 0.09–0.81; <i>P</i>=0.02), 23% in response to quinidine (<i>r</i>=0.48; 95% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confid</span></strong>ence interval, −0.03 to 0.79; <i>P</i>=0.06), and 27% in response to ranolazine (<i>r</i>=0.52; 95% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confid</span></strong>ence interval, 0.05–0.80; <i>P</i>=0.03). Furthermore, the genetic QT score was a significant predictor of drug-induced torsade de pointes in an independent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e of 216 cases compared with 771 controls (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>=12%, <i>P</i>=1×10<sup>−7</sup>).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We demonstrate that a genetic QT score comprising 61 common genetic variants explains a significant proportion of the variability in drug-induced QT prolongation and is a significant predictor of drug-induced torsade de pointes.

No other aspects of care were modified. The primary outcome was red blood cell transfusion from surgery to postoperative day 7. Other outcomes included transfusion of other blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>s, major bleeding, and major complications. The analysis adjusted for secular time trends, within-hospital clustering, and patient-level <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors.

Improving Assessment of Drug Safety Through Proteomics
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Early detection of adverse effects of novel therapies and understanding of their mechanisms could improve the safety and efficiency of drug development. We have retrospectively applied large-scale proteomics to blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es from ILLUMINATE (Investigation of Lipid Level Management to Understand its Impact in Atherosclerotic Events), a trial of torcetrapib (a cholesterol ester transfer protein inhibitor), that involved 15 067 participants at high cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>. ILLUMINATE was terminated at a median of 550 days because of significant absolute increases of 1.2% in cardiovascular events and 0.4% in mortality with torcetrapib. The aims of our analysis were to determine whether a proteomic analysis might reveal biological mechanisms responsible for these harmful effects and whether harmful effects of torcetrapib could have been detected early in the ILLUMINATE trial with proteomics.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A nested case-control analysis of paired plasma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es at baseline and at 3 months was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perform</span></strong>ed in 249 participants assigned to torcetrapib plus atorvastatin and 223 participants assigned to atorvastatin only. Within each treatment arm, cases with events were matched to controls 1:1. Main outcomes were a survey of 1129 proteins for discovery of biological pathways altered by torcetrapib and a 9-protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> score <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valid</span></strong>ated to predict myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, or death.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Plasma concentrations of 200 proteins changed significantly with torcetrapib. Their pathway analysis revealed un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expect</span></strong>ed and widespread changes in immune and inflammatory functions, as well as changes in endocrine systems, including in aldosterone function and glycemic control. At baseline, 9-protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> scores were similar in the 2 treatment arms and higher in participants with subsequent events. At 3 months, the absolute 9-protein derived <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> increased in the torcetrapib plus atorvastatin arm compared with the atorvastatin-only arm by 1.08% (<i>P</i>=0.0004).

Anti-Müllerian Hormone Trajectories Are Associated With Cardiovascular Disease in Women
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Earlier age at menopause is widely considered to be associated with an increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of cardiovascular disease. However, the underlying mechanisms of this relationship remain undetermined. Indications suggest that anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), an ovarian reserve marker, plays a physiological role outside of the re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ive system. Therefore, we investigated whether longitudinal AMH decline trajectories are associated with an increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of cardiovascular disease (CVD) occurrence.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This study included 3108 female participants between 20 and 60 years of age at baseline of the population-based Doetinchem Cohort. Participants completed ≥1 of 5 consecutive quinquennial visits between 1987 and 2010, resulting in a total follow-up time of 20 years. AMH was measured in 8507 stored plasma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es. Information on total CVD, stroke, and coronary heart disease was obtained through a hospital discharge registry linkage. The association of AMH trajectories with CVD was quantified with joint modeling, with adjustment for age, smoking, oral contraceptive use, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone therapy use, diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and glucose levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>By the end of follow-up, 8.2% of the women had suffered from CVD, 4.9% had suffered from coronary heart disease, and 2.6% had experienced a stroke. After adjustment, each ng/mL lower <sub>log</sub>AMH level was associated with a 21% higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of CVD (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confid</span></strong>ence interval, 1.07–1.36) and a 26% higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of coronary heart disease (hazard ratio, 1.25; 95% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confid</span></strong>ence interval, 1.08–1.46). Each additional ng/mL/year decrease of <sub>log</sub>AMH was associated with a significantly higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of CVD (hazard ratio, 1.46; 95% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confid</span></strong>ence interval, 1.14–1.87) and coronary heart disease (hazard ratio, 1.56; 95% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confid</span></strong>ence interval, 1.15–2.12). No association between AMH and stroke was found.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These results indicate that AMH trajectories in women are independently associated with CVD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>. Therefore, we postulate that the decline of circulating AMH levels may be part of the pathophysiology of the increased cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of earlier menopause. Confirmation of this association and elucidation of its underlying mechanisms are needed to place these results in a clinical perspective.</p></sec>

Coronary Artery Calcium to Guide a Personalized Risk-Based Approach to Initiation and Intensification of Antihypertensive Therapy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The use of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> to personalize systolic blood pressure (SBP) treatment goals is a topic of increasing interest. Therefore, we studied whether coronary artery calcium (CAC) can further guide the allocation of anti-hypertensive treatment intensity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We included 3733 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) with SBP between 120 and 179 mm Hg. Within subgroups categorized by both SBP (120–139 mm Hg, 140–159 mm Hg, and 160–179 mm Hg) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated 10-year ASCVD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> (using the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Assocation pooled-cohort equations), we compared multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">variabl</span></strong>e-adjusted hazard ratios for the composite outcome of incident ASCVD or heart failure after further stratifying by CAC (0, 1–100, or >100). We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated 10-year number-needed-to-treat for an intensive SBP goal of 120 mm Hg by applying the treatment benefit recorded in meta-analyses to event rates within CAC strata.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean age was 65 years, and 642 composite events took place over a median of 10.2 years. In persons with SBP <160 mm Hg, CAC stratified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> for events. For example, among those with an ASCVD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of <15% and who had an SBP of either 120 to 139 mm Hg or 140 to 159 mm Hg, respectively, we found increasing hazard ratios for events with CAC 1 to 100 (1.7 [95% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confid</span></strong>ence interval, 1.0–2.6] or 2.0 [1.1–3.8]) and CAC >100 (3.0 [1.8–5.0] or 5.7 [2.9–11.0]), all relative to CAC=0. There appeared to be no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">statist</span></strong>ical association between CAC and events when SBP was 160 to 179 mm Hg, irrespective of ASCVD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> level. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated 10-year number-needed-to-treat for a SBP goal of 120mmHg varied substantially according to CAC levels when predicted ASCVD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> <15% and SBP <160mmHg (eg, 10-year number-needed-to-treat of 99 for CAC=0 and 24 for CAC>100, when SBP 120-139mm Hg). However, few participants with ASCVD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> <5% had elevated CAC. Furthermore, 10-year number-needed-to-treat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ates were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">consist</span></strong>ently low and varied less among CAC strata when SBP was 160 to 179 mm Hg or when ASCVD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> was ≥15% at any SBP level.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Combined CAC imaging and assessment of global ASCVD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> has the potential to guide personalized SBP goals (eg, choosing a traditional goal of 140 or a more intensive goal of 120 mm Hg), particularly among adults with an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ated ASCVD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of 5% to 15% and prehypertension or mild hypertension.</p></sec>

Temporal Trends in Adverse Events After Everolimus-Eluting Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold Versus Everolimus-Eluting Metallic Stent Implantation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Bioresorbable coronary stents have been introduced into clinical practice to improve the outcomes of patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention. The everolimus-eluting bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BVS) is the most studied of these stent platforms; however, recent trials comparing BVS with everolimus-eluting metallic stents (EES) raised concerns about BVS safety. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of BVS versus EES in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We searched Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, scientific sessions abstracts, and relevant Web sites for randomized trials with a follow-up of ≥2 years investigating percutaneous coronary interventions with BVS versus EES. The primary outcomes of our analysis were definite/probable stent thrombosis (ST) and target lesion failure (TLF; device-oriented composite end point of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction, or ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization [TLR]). Secondary outcomes were target vessel myocardial infarction, TLR, and cardiac death. We calculated the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong>ates for main outcomes according to a fixed-effect model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We included 7 trials comprising data for 5583 patients randomized to receive either a BVS (n=3261) or an EES (n=2322). Median follow-up was 24 months (range, 24–36 months). Patients treated with BVS had a higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of definite/probable ST compared with patients treated with EES (odds ratio, 3.33; 95% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confid</span></strong>ence interval, 1.97–5.62; <i>P</i><0.00001). In particular, patients with BVS had a higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of subacute, late, and very late ST, whereas the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of acute ST was similar. Patients treated with BVS compared with EES had a higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> at 2 years of TLF (odds ratio, 1.47; 95% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confid</span></strong>ence interval, 1.14–1.90; <i>P</i>=0.003), driven mainly by an increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of target vessel myocardial infarction (odds ratio, 1.73; 95% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confid</span></strong>ence interval, 1.31–2.28; <i>P</i>=0.0001; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup>=0%) and of TLR (odds ratio, 1.27; 95% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confid</span></strong>ence interval, 1.00–1.62; <i>P</i>=0.05). Of importance, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of TLF and TLR for patients with BVS was higher between 1 and 2 years, whereas there was no difference in the first year. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of cardiac death was similar between the 2 groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our meta-analysis of randomized trials with a follow-up of ≥2 years demonstrated a higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of ST and of TLF in patients treated with BVS compared with EES. Of note, BVS had a higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of subacute, late, and very late ST, whereas the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of TLF and TLR was higher between 1 and 2 years.</p></sec>

Risk Factors of Sudden Cardiac Death in the Young
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Prevention of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) in the young remains a largely unsolved public health problem, and sports activity is an established trigger. Although the presence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors in the young can link to future morbidity and mortality in adulthood, the potential contribution of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors to SCA in the young has not been evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We prospectively ascertained subjects who experienced SCA between the ages of 5 and 34 years in the Portland, Oregon, metropolitan area (2002–2015, catchment population ≈1 million).

We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">specif</span></strong>ically evaluated the association of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard</span></strong> cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors and SCA, and sports as a trigger for SCA in the young.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 3775 SCAs in all age groups, 186 (5%) occurred in the young (mean age 25.9±6.8, 67% male). In SCA in the young, overall prevalence of warning signs before SCA was low (29%), and 26 (14%) were associated with sports as a trigger. The remainder (n=160) occurred in other settings categorized as nonsports. Sports-related SCAs accounted for 39% of SCAs in patients aged ≤18, 13% of SCAs in patients aged 19 to 25, and 7% of SCAs in patients aged 25 to 34. Sports-related SCA cases were more likely to present with shockable rhythms, and survival from cardiac arrest was 2.5-fold higher in sports-related versus nonsports SCA (28% versus 11%; <i>P</i>=0.05).

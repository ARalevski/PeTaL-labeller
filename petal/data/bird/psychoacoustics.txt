Phonon-mediated quantum state transfer and remote qubit entanglement
<p>Phonons, and in particular surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acoust</span></strong>ic wave phonons, have been proposed as a means to coherently couple distant solid-state quantum systems. Individual phonons in a resonant structure can be controlled and detected by superconducting qubits, enabling the coherent generation and measurement of complex stationary phonon states. We report the deterministic emission and capture of itinerant surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acoust</span></strong>ic wave phonons, enabling the quantum entanglement of two superconducting qubits. Using a 2-millimeter-long <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acoust</span></strong>ic quantum communication channel, equivalent to a 500-nanosecond delay line, we demonstrate the emission and recapture of a phonon by one superconducting qubit, quantum state transfer between two superconducting qubits with a 67% efficiency, and, by partial transfer of a phonon, generation of an entangled Bell pair with a fidelity of 84%.</p>

Restoring auditory cortex plasticity in adult mice by restricting thalamic adenosine signaling
<p>Circuits in the auditory cortex are highly susceptible to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acoust</span></strong>ic influences during an early postnatal critical period. The auditory cortex selectively expands neural representations of enriched <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acoust</span></strong>ic stimuli, a process important for human language acquisition. Adults lack this plasticity. Here we show in the murine auditory cortex that juvenile plasticity can be reestablished in adulthood if <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acoust</span></strong>ic stimuli are paired with disruption of ecto-5′-nucleotidase–dependent adenosine production or A<sub>1</sub>–adenosine receptor signaling in the auditory thalamus. This plasticity occurs at the level of cortical maps and individual neurons in the auditory cortex of awake adult mice and is associated with long-term improvement of tone-discrimination abilities. We conclude that, in adult mice, disrupting adenosine signaling in the thalamus rejuvenates plasticity in the auditory cortex and improves <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">auditory percept</span></strong>ion.</p>

Acoustic mirrors as sensory traps for bats
<p>Sensory traps pose a considerable and often fatal risk for animals, leading them to misinterpret their environment. Bats predominantly rely on their echolocation system to forage, orientate, and navigate. We found that bats can mistake smooth, vertical surfaces as clear flight paths, repeatedly colliding with them, likely as a result of their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acoust</span></strong>ic mirror properties. The probability of collision is influenced by the number of echolocation calls and by the amount of time spent in front of the surface. The echolocation call analysis corroborates that bats perceive smooth, vertical surfaces as open flyways. Reporting on occurrences with different species in the wild, we argue that it is necessary to more closely monitor potentially dangerous locations with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acoust</span></strong>ic mirror properties (such as glass fronts) to assess the true frequency of fatalities around these sensory traps.</p>

Anterior lateral line nerve encoding to tones and play-back vocalisations in free-swimming oyster toadfish, <i>Opsanus tau</i>
<p>In the underwater environment, sound propagates both as a pressure wave and as particle motion, with particle motion dominating close to the source. At the receptor level, the fish ear and the neuromast hair cells act as displacement detectors, and both are potentially stimulated by the particle motion component of sound. The encoding of the anterior lateral line nerve to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acoust</span></strong>ic stimuli in freely behaving oyster toadfish, <i>Opsanus tau</i>, was examined. Nerve sensitivity and directional responses were determined using spike rate and vector strength analysis, a measure of phase-locking of spike times to the stimulus waveform. All units showed greatest sensitivity to 100 Hz stimulus. While sensitivity was independent of stimuli orientation, the neuron's ability to phase-lock was correlated with stimuli origin. Two different types of units were classified, type 1 (tonic), and type 2 (phasic). The type 1 fibres were further classified into two sub-types based on their frequency response (type 1–1 and type 1–2), which was hypothesised to be related to canal (type 1–1) and superficial (type 1–2) neuromast innervation. Lateral line units also exhibited sensitivity and phase locking to boatwhistle vocalisations, with greatest spike rates exhibited at the onset of the call. These results provide direct evidence that oyster toadfish can use their lateral line to detect behaviourally relevant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acoust</span></strong>ic stimuli, which could provide a sensory pathway to aid in sound source localisation.</p>

Ebola outbreak continues despite powerful vaccine
<p>New data show that an experimental Ebola vaccine is "highly effective" and appears to have helped contain a long-lasting outbreak of the deadly disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, but the conflict-ridden region has kept vaccine teams from reaching many people who need it. The World Health Organization (WHO) revealed last week that what it called the "vaccine efficacy" is 97.5% in people who either directly or indirectly came in contact with one of the 1200-plus cases of the disease. But nearly 20% of these contacts either could not be reached or refused the vaccine. WHO also for the second time asked an expert committee to decide whether the outbreak, which began in August 2018, should be declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. But the committee again said no, WHO did not need to ring the loudest alarm <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bell</span></strong> it had, largely because the virus had yet to spread to neighboring countries. WHO's director-general took the committee's advice, but urged the international community to provide more financial support, noting full funding of the response through July would require $104 million more than is now on hand.</p>

Motor cortical control of vocal interaction in neotropical singing mice
<p>Like many adaptive behaviors, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acoust</span></strong>ic communication often requires rapid modification of motor output in response to sensory cues. However, little is known about the sensorimotor transformations that underlie such complex natural behaviors. In this study, we examine vocal exchanges in Alston’s singing mouse (<i>Scotinomys teguina</i>). We find that males modify singing behavior during social interactions on a subsecond time course that resembles both traditional sensorimotor tasks and conversational speech. We identify an orofacial motor cortical region and, via a series of perturbation experiments, demonstrate a hierarchical control of vocal production, with the motor cortex influencing the pacing of singing behavior on a moment-by-moment basis, enabling precise vocal interactions. These results suggest a systems-level framework for understanding the sensorimotor transformations that underlie natural social interactions.</p>

Quantum entanglement of the spin and orbital angular momentum of photons using metamaterials
<p>Metamaterials constructed from deep subwavelength building blocks have been used to demonstrate phenomena ranging from negative refractive index and ε-near-zero to cloaking, emulations of general relativity, and superresolution imaging. More recently, metamaterials have been suggested as a new platform for quantum optics. We present the use of a dielectric metasurface to generate entanglement between the spin and orbital angular momentum of photons. We demonstrate the generation of the four Bell states on a single photon by using the geometric phase that arises from the photonic spin-orbit interaction and subsequently show nonlocal correlations between two photons that interacted with the metasurface. Our results show that metamaterials are suitable for the generation and manipulation of entangled photon states, introducing the area of quantum optics metamaterials.</p>

Resonantly driven CNOT gate for electron spins
<p>Single-qubit rotations and two-qubit CNOT operations are crucial ingredients for universal quantum computing. Although high-fidelity single-qubit operations have been achieved using the electron spin degree of freedom, realizing a robust CNOT gate has been challenging because of rapid nuclear spin dephasing and charge noise. We demonstrate an efficient resonantly driven CNOT gate for electron spins in silicon. Our platform achieves single-qubit rotations with fidelities greater than 99%, as verified by randomized benchmarking. Gate control of the exchange coupling allows a quantum CNOT gate to be implemented with resonant driving in ~200 nanoseconds. We used the CNOT gate to generate a Bell state with 78% fidelity (corrected for errors in state preparation and measurement). Our quantum dot device architecture enables multi-qubit algorithms in silicon.</p>

Conversion of object identity to object-general semantic value in the primate temporal cortex
<p>At the final stage of the ventral visual stream, perirhinal neurons encode the identity of memorized objects through learning. However, it remains elusive whether and how object percepts alone, or concomitantly a nonphysical attribute of the objects (“learned”), are decoded from perirhinal activities. By combining monkey <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">psychophys</span></strong>ics with optogenetic and electrical stimulations, we found a focal spot of memory neurons where both stimulations led monkeys to preferentially judge presented objects as “already seen.” In an adjacent fringe area, where neurons did not exhibit selective responses to the learned objects, electrical stimulation induced the opposite behavioral bias toward “never seen before,” whereas optogenetic stimulation still induced bias toward “already seen.” These results suggest that mnemonic judgment of objects emerges via the decoding of their nonphysical attributes encoded by perirhinal neurons.</p>

Breaking Lorentz reciprocity to overcome the time-bandwidth limit in physics and engineering
<p>A century-old tenet in physics and engineering asserts that any type of system, having bandwidth Δω, can interact with a wave over only a constrained time period Δ<i>t</i> inversely proportional to the bandwidth (Δ<i>t</i>·Δω ~ 2π). This law severely limits the generic capabilities of all types of resonant and wave-guiding systems in photonics, cavity quantum electrodynamics and optomechanics, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acoust</span></strong>ics, continuum mechanics, and atomic and optical physics but is thought to be completely fundamental, arising from basic Fourier reciprocity. We propose that this “fundamental” limit can be overcome in systems where Lorentz reciprocity is broken. As a system becomes more asymmetric in its transport properties, the degree to which the limit can be surpassed becomes greater. By way of example, we theoretically demonstrate how, in an astutely designed magnetized semiconductor heterostructure, the above limit can be exceeded by orders of magnitude by using realistic material parameters. Our findings revise prevailing paradigms for linear, time-invariant resonant systems, challenging the doctrine that high-quality resonances must invariably be narrowband and providing the possibility of developing devices with unprecedentedly high time-bandwidth performance.</p>

Satellite-based entanglement distribution over 1200 kilometers
<p>Long-distance entanglement distribution is essential for both foundational tests of quantum physics and scalable quantum networks. Owing to channel loss, however, the previously achieved distance was limited to ~100 kilometers. Here we demonstrate satellite-based distribution of entangled photon pairs to two locations separated by 1203 kilometers on Earth, through two satellite-to-ground downlinks with a summed length varying from 1600 to 2400 kilometers. We observed a survival of two-photon entanglement and a violation of Bell inequality by 2.37 ± 0.09 under strict Einstein locality conditions. The obtained effective link efficiency is orders of magnitude higher than that of the direct bidirectional transmission of the two photons through telecommunication fibers.</p>

Predicting human olfactory perception from chemical features of odor molecules
<p>It is still not possible to predict whether a given molecule will have a perceived odor or what olfactory percept it will produce. We therefore organized the crowd-sourced DREAM Olfaction Prediction Challenge. Using a large olfactory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">psychophys</span></strong>ical data set, teams developed machine-learning algorithms to predict sensory attributes of molecules based on their chemoinformatic features. The resulting models accurately predicted odor intensity and pleasantness and also successfully predicted 8 among 19 rated semantic descriptors (“garlic,” “fish,” “sweet,” “fruit,” “burnt,” “spices,” “flower,” and “sour”). Regularized linear models performed nearly as well as random forest–based ones, with a predictive accuracy that closely approaches a key theoretical limit. These models help to predict the perceptual qualities of virtually any molecule with high accuracy and also reverse-engineer the smell of a molecule.</p>

Volcanic tremor and plume height hysteresis from Pavlof Volcano, Alaska
<p>The March 2016 eruption of Pavlof Volcano, Alaska, produced an ash plume that caused the cancellation of more than 100 flights in North America. The eruption generated strong tremor that was recorded by seismic and remote low-frequency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acoust</span></strong>ic (infrasound) stations, including the EarthScope Transportable Array. The relationship between the tremor amplitudes and plume height changes considerably between the waxing and waning portions of the eruption. Similar hysteresis has been observed between seismic river noise and discharge during storms, suggesting that flow and erosional processes in both rivers and volcanoes can produce irreversible structural changes that are detectable in geophysical data. We propose that the time-varying relationship at Pavlof arose from changes in the tremor source related to volcanic vent erosion. This relationship may improve estimates of volcanic emissions and characterization of eruption size and intensity.</p>

Seismic constraints on caldera dynamics from the 2015 Axial Seamount eruption
<p>Seismic observations in volcanically active calderas are challenging.

Beginning on 24 April 2015, the seismic network captured an eruption that culminated in explosive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acoust</span></strong>ic signals where lava erupted on the seafloor. Extensive seismic activity preceding the eruption shows that inflation is accommodated by the reactivation of an outward-dipping caldera ring fault, with strong tidal triggering indicating a critically stressed system. The ring fault accommodated deflation during the eruption and provided a pathway for a dike that propagated south and north beneath the caldera’s east wall. Once north of the caldera, the eruption stepped westward, and a dike propagated along the extensional north rift.</p>

Mind the gap: Neural coding of species identity in birdsong prosody
<p>Juvenile songbirds learn vocal communication from adult tutors of the same species but not from adults of other species. How species-specific learning emerges from the basic features of song prosody remains unknown. In the zebra finch auditory cortex, we discovered a class of neurons that register the silent temporal gaps between song syllables and are distinct from neurons encoding syllable morphology. Behavioral learning and neuronal coding of temporal gap structure resisted song tutoring from other species: Zebra finches fostered by Bengalese finch parents learned Bengalese finch song morphology transposed onto zebra finch temporal gaps. During the vocal learning period, temporal gap neurons fired selectively to zebra finch song. The innate temporal coding of intersyllable silent gaps suggests a neuronal barcode for conspecific vocal learning and social communication in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acoust</span></strong>ically diverse environments.</p>

KNOX Protein OSH15 Induces Grain Shattering by Repressing Lignin Biosynthesis Genes
<p>Seed shattering is an agronomically important trait. Two major domestication factors are responsible for this: qSH1 and SH5. Whereas qSH1 functions in cell differentiation in the abscission zone (AZ), a major role of SH5 is the repression of lignin deposition. We have determined that a KNOX protein, OSH15, also controls seed shattering. Knockdown mutations of <i>OSH15</i> showed reduced seed-shattering phenotypes. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that OSH15 interacts with SH5 and qSH1, two proteins in the BELL homeobox family. In transgenic plants carrying the <i>OSH15</i> promoter-<i>GUS</i> reporter construct, the reporter gene was preferentially expressed in the AZ during young spikelet development. The RNA in situ hybridization experiment also showed that <i>OSH15</i> messenger RNAs were abundant in the AZ during spikelet development. Analyses of <i>osh15 SH5-</i>D double mutants showed that <i>SH5</i> could not increase the degree of seed shattering when <i>OSH15</i> was absent, indicating that SH5 functions together with OSH15. In addition to the seed-shattering phenotype, <i>osh15</i> mutants displayed dwarfism and accumulated a higher amount of lignin in internodes due to increased expression of the genes involved in lignin biosynthesis. Knockout mutations of <i>CAD2</i>, which encodes an enzyme for the last step in the monolignol biosynthesis pathway, caused an easy seed-shattering phenotype by reducing lignin deposition in the AZ. This indicated that the lignin level is an important determinant of seed shattering in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that both OSH15 and SH5 interact directly with <i>CAD2</i> chromatin. We conclude that OSH15 and SH5 form a dimer that enhances seed shattering by directly inhibiting lignin biosynthesis genes.</p>

Monitoring of Freezing Dynamics in Trees: A Simple Phase Shift Causes Complexity
<p>During winter, trees have to cope with harsh conditions, including extreme freeze-thaw stress. This study focused on ice nucleation and propagation, related water shifts and xylem cavitation, as well as cell damage and was based on in situ monitoring of xylem (thermocouples) and surface temperatures (infrared imaging), ultrasonic emissions, and dendrometer analysis. Field experiments during late winter on <i>Picea abies</i> growing at the alpine timberline revealed three distinct freezing patterns: (1) from the top of the tree toward the base, (2) from thin branches toward the main stem’s top and base, and (3) from the base toward the top. Infrared imaging showed freezing within branches from their base toward distal parts. Such complex freezing causes dynamic and heterogenous patterns in water potential and probably in cavitation. This study highlights the interaction between environmental conditions upon freezing and thawing and demonstrates the enormous complexity of freezing processes in trees. Diameter shrinkage, which indicated water fluxes within the stem, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acoust</span></strong>ic emission analysis, which indicated cavitation events near the ice front upon freezing, were both related to minimum temperature and, upon thawing, related to vapor pressure deficit and soil temperature. These complex patterns, emphasizing the common mechanisms between frost and drought stress, shed new light on winter tree physiology.</p>

Vocal production complexity correlates with neural instructions in the oyster toadfish (<i>Opsanus tau</i>)
<p>Sound communication is fundamental to many social interactions and essential to courtship and agonistic behaviours in many vertebrates. The swimbladder and associated muscles in batrachoidid fishes (midshipman and toadfish) is a unique vertebrate sound production system, wherein fundamental frequencies are determined directly by the firing rate of a vocal-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acoust</span></strong>ic neural network that drives the contraction frequency of superfast swimbladder muscles. The oyster toadfish boatwhistle call starts with an irregular sound waveform that could be an emergent property of the peripheral nonlinear sound-producing system or reflect complex encoding in the central nervous system. Here, we demonstrate that the start of the boatwhistle is indicative of a chaotic strange attractor, and tested whether its origin lies in the peripheral sound-producing system or in the vocal motor network. We recorded sound and swimbladder muscle activity in awake, freely behaving toadfish during motor nerve stimulation, and recorded sound, motor nerve and muscle activity during spontaneous grunts. The results show that rhythmic motor volleys do not cause complex sound signals. However, arrhythmic recruitment of swimbladder muscle during spontaneous grunts correlates with complex sounds. This supports the hypothesis that the irregular start of the boatwhistle is encoded in the vocal pre-motor neural network, and not caused by peripheral interactions with the sound-producing system. We suggest that sound production system demands across vocal tetrapods have selected for muscles and motorneurons adapted for speed, which can execute complex neural instructions into equivalently complex vocalisations.</p>

The metabolic cost of communicative sound production in bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>)
<p>Bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>) produce various communicative sounds that are important for social behavior, maintaining group cohesion and coordinating foraging. For example, whistle production increases during disturbances, such as separations of mother–calf pairs and vessel approaches. It is clear that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acoust</span></strong>ic communication is important to the survival of these marine mammals, yet the metabolic cost of producing whistles and other socials sounds and the energetic consequences of modifying these sounds in response to both natural and anthropogenic disturbance are unknown. We used flow-through respirometry to determine whether the metabolic cost of sound production could be quantified in two captive dolphins producing social sounds (whistles and squawks). On average, we found that metabolic rates measured during 2 min periods of sound production were 1.2 times resting values. Up to 7 min were required for metabolism to return to resting values following vocal periods. The total metabolic cost (over resting values) of the 2 min vocal period plus the required recovery period (163.3 to 2995.9 ml O<sub>2</sub> or 3279.6 to 60,166.7 J) varied by individual as well as by mean duration of sounds produced within the vocal period. Observed variation in received cumulative sound energy levels of vocalizations was not related to total metabolic costs. Furthermore, our empirical findings did not agree with previous theoretical estimates of the metabolic cost of whistles. This study provides the first empirical data on the metabolic cost of sound production in dolphins, which can be used to estimate metabolic costs of vocal responses to environmental perturbations in wild dolphins.</p>

In addition, we describe supplementary   steps that could be used to avoid these problems.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The causes of instability may be divided into three main groups:   the first includes causes directly related to SCFE (acetabular labral   damage, severe abrasion of the acetabular cartilage, flattening   of the acetabular roof and a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bell</span></strong>-shaped deformity of the epiphysis);   the second, causes not related to the SCFE (acetabular orientation   and poor quality of the soft tissues); the third, causes directly   related to the surgery (capsulotomy, division of the ligamentum teres,   shortening of the femoral neck, pelvi-trochanteric impingement,   previous proximal femoral osteotomy and post-operative positioning   of the leg).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We present examples drawn from our clinical practice, as well   as possible ways of reducing the risks of these complications, and   of correcting them if they happen.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:16–21.</p></sec>

A critical period of susceptibility to sound in the sensory cells of cephalopod hatchlings.
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> We provide evidence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acoust</span></strong>ic trauma in cephalopod hatchling sensory cells after sound exposure, whose damage increases faster than in adults, suggesting a critical period of sensitivity to anthropogenic noise in early stages.</p>

Universal protection against influenza infection by a multidomain antibody to influenza hemagglutinin
<p>Broadly neutralizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es against highly variable pathogens have stimulated the design of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es and therapeutics. We report the use of diverse camelid single-domain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es to influenza <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> hemagglutinin to generate multidomain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es with impressive breadth and potency. Multidomain antibody MD3606 protects mice against influenza A and B infection when administered intravenously or expressed locally from a recombinant adeno-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> vector. Crystal and single-particle electron microscopy structures of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es with hemagglutinins from influenza A and B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es reveal binding to highly conserved epitopes. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that multidomain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es targeting multiple epitopes exhibit enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> cross-reactivity and potency. In combination with adeno-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>–mediated gene delivery, they may provide an effective strategy to prevent infection with influenza <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> and other highly variable pathogens.</p>

Genome-wide identification of interferon-sensitive mutations enables influenza vaccine design
<p>In conventional attenuated viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es, immunogenicity is often suboptimal. Here we present a systematic approach for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e development that eliminates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interferon</span></strong> (IFN)–modulating functions genome-wide while maintaining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> replication fitness. We applied a quantitative high-throughput genomics system to influenza A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> that simultaneously measured the replication fitness and IFN sensitivity of mutations across the entire genome. By incorporating eight IFN-sensitive mutations, we generated a hyper–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interferon</span></strong>-sensitive (HIS) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e candidate. HIS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> is highly attenuated in IFN-competent hosts but able to induce transient IFN responses, elicits robust humoral and cellular immune responses, and provides protection against homologous and heterologous viral challenges. Our approach, which attenuates the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> and promotes immune responses concurrently, is broadly applicable for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e development against other pathogens.</p>

Generation of influenza A viruses as live but replication-incompetent virus vaccines
<p>The conversion of life-threatening <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es into live but a<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virul</span></strong>ent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es represents a revolution in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ology. In a proof-of-principle study, we expanded the genetic code of the genome of influenza A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> via a transgenic cell line containing orthogonal translation machinery. This generated premature termination codon (PTC)–harboring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es that exerted full infectivity but were replication-incompetent in conventional cells. Genome-wide optimization of the sites for incorporation of multiple PTCs resulted in highly reproductive and genetically stable progeny <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es in transgenic cells. In mouse, ferret, and guinea pig models, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ation with PTC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es elicited robust humoral, mucosal, and T cell–mediated immunity against antigenically distinct influenza <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es and even neutralized existing infecting strains. The methods presented here may become a general approach for generating live <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es that can be adapted to almost any <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>.</p>

Why is the flu vaccine so mediocre?
<p>With flu season around the corner in the United States and Europe, the push has begun once again to encourage people to receive their annual shots. But over the past few years, it's become increasingly clear that the level of protection offered by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e varies widely each flu season, from 10% to 60%. And new research has revealed surprising reasons for its lackluster performance. For decades, it appeared that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e had an efficacy of 70% to 90%, but scientists now know that's because they were using a misleading test—replaced in the 1990s—to assess whether it protected people. The traditional explanation for failure also has been revamped. The flu strains selected for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e change each year based on what's in circulation, and scientists long blamed failure on mutations that occur in the circulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es in the 6–8 months that pass between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e being manufactured and used. But these "mismatches" sometimes occur in years when there's solid protection, and some years with lots of failure have good matches. It turns out that other forces at work include mutations in the strain selected for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e during the manufacturing process, which grows the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> in eggs. People's prior exposure to influenza also can bias their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immune system</span></strong> toward a response that undermines that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e-triggered immunity. And the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e strain selection process itself relies heavily on the ferret animal model, which can mislead, too. There's an increasing call now to improve the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e and organize the research community to more collaboratively try to develop a "universal" flu shot that works against many strains and lasts for many years, if not a lifetime. </p>

A sweeter approach to vaccine design
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es have transformed human health. Yet, guided primarily by empiricism for centuries, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e design ultimately met its match in scourges such as HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria, which continue to plague global health. The elusive search for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es against such diseases has driven researchers of diverse expertise to forgo empirical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ology. Instead, they favor a reductionist approach inspired by how pathogens interact with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immune system</span></strong>, which has evolved to distinguish foreign from self by sensing both physical (e.g, size) and chemical (e.g., foreign molecules) features of pathogens. This has guided the rational design of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es that mimic key pathogen properties, including arraying antigens on particles to increase recognition by antibody-producing B cells (<i>1</i>). However, the mechanisms by which multivalent antigen display on nanoparticles—either synthetic or natural—enhances immunity, and how this may influence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e design principles, remain unresolved. On page 649 of this issue, Tokatlian <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) help fill this knowledge gap by demonstrating that engineering nanoparticles with glycans—sugar molecules—is critical to potentiating antibody responses. This might lead to improved next-generation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es against a wide diversity of pathogens.</p>

Ethics of maternal vaccination
<p>Innovations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e science have given us an incredible opportunity to leverage the maternal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immune system</span></strong> to improve maternal, fetal, and infant health outcomes. Maternal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ation reduces the risk of infant infection primarily through the transfer of protective maternal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es to the fetus (<i>1</i>). Although a growing number of countries are adopting maternal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e programs against diseases like influenza and pertussis, and there is an increased focus on including pregnant women in trials for new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es, there is little discussion of the ethical underpinnings of maternal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e programs (<i>2</i>). We see the proposals thus far as being overly paternalistic, founded on a too-limited conception of risk-benefit analyses that has potential to derail the development and use of lifesaving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es. By contrast, an ethical approach focused on mothers' primary interests in protecting themselves and their children could serve as the basis of the ethical framework that guides <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e policies.</p>

Zika rewrites maternal immunization ethics
<p>Pregnant women long have been excluded from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e studies because researchers are wary of causing unintended harm to the highly vulnerable developing fetus. But a new report from a group that represents many disciplines contends that ethics demand pregnant women be included in the trial of experimental Zika <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es, which are designed to protect babies from brain damage and other maladies caused by that mosquito-borne <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>. The report is careful to point out that risk/benefit ratios must be weighed for each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e and each trial on a case-by-case basis—and indeed the Zika <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e that has moved furthest in human studies rightly excludes pregnant women, says a co-author of the report. Other experimental maternal immunizations designed to protect babies are also being tested now, and one trial, for a respiratory syncytial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e, includes pregnant women. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e against group B streptococcus has also moved along the development pipeline and may soon enter trials with pregnant women, too. A second new report on maternal immunizations issued last week explores the challenges of doing safety studies in these women and their babies.</p>

Dengue may bring out the worst in Zika
<p>Mice infused against either dengue or West Nile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> became far more susceptible to disease and death from Zika <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>, a new study published online in <i>Science</i> shows. The mice, engineered to cripple an immune gene that normally helps suppress Zika <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>, of course may not represent what happens in humans. But antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is a well-known phenomenon with dengue, which has four “serotypes” that infect humans. Infection with one dengue serotype typically causes little harm, but the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es produced against it can set a people up for severe and even deadly disease if they subsequently become infected by a different serotype. Dengue, West Nile, and Zika are all from the flavi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> family and the researchers warn that a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e against one could put a person at risk for ADE from a relative. Dengue is closet to Zika, and indeed the mouse experiment showed that dengue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es led to the most severe Zika disease. ADE also led to high levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> in mouse testes and spinal cords, which may help explain sexual transmission of Zika in humans and central nervous system diseases like microcephaly in babies and Guillain-Barré Syndrome in adults.</p>

Multifaceted Activities of Type I Interferon Are Revealed by a Receptor Antagonist

B cells, CMV, and stem cell transplant
<p>Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a potentially curative therapy for various malignant and nonmalignant conditions but can be complicated by infections such as reactivation of cytomegalo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> (CMV). CMV is a ubiquitous DNA herpes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> comprising various distinct strains (<i>1</i>). Around 60 to 90% of healthy adults are seropositive, indicating past exposure to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>, although infections in healthy people are often mild or asymptomatic. After initial acute infection, CMV enters a latent phase, similar to other herpes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es. It has been suggested that CMV infection may confer an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immunolog</span></strong>ical benefit, perhaps explaining its prevalence, because comparison of seropositive and seronegative individuals has shown that CMV infection results in greater responses to the flu <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e (<i>2</i>). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immune system</span></strong> is essential to control the initial infection and to prevent later CMV reactivation, as demonstrated by the high incidence of CMV reactivation in immunosuppressed patients such as HSCT recipients. Whereas the incidence and severity of CMV transcriptional reactivation and cell-to-cell dissemination after HSCT has substantially diminished since the adoption of prophylactic or preemptive antiviral therapies (<i>3</i>), CMV remains the most important viral infection after HSCT, especially in high-risk patients (such as seropositive recipients of seronegative donors), and can lead to life-threatening CMV disease in ∼10% of HSCT recipients (<i>4</i>). On page 288 of this issue, Martins <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) make the unexpected observation, in mice undergoing bone marrow transplantation (BMT) as a model of HSCT, that strain-specific CMV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es made by host B cells play a crucial role in preventing CMV dissemination after BMT. They propose that passive transfer of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es that are matched to the latent CMV strain in HSCT recipients might constitute a powerful and easy therapeutic approach to prevent CMV disease.</p>

Giant viruses with an expanded complement of translation system components
<p>The discovery of giant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es blurred the sharp division between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es and cellular life. Giant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> genomes encode proteins considered as signatures of cellular organisms, particularly translation system components, prompting hypotheses that these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es derived from a fourth domain of cellular life. Here we report the discovery of a group of giant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es (Klosneu<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es) in metagenomic data. Compared with other giant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es, the Klosneu<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es encode an expanded translation machinery, including aminoacyl transfer RNA synthetases with specificities for all 20 amino acids. Notwithstanding the prevalence of translation system components, comprehensive phylogenomic analysis of these genes indicates that Klosneu<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es did not evolve from a cellular ancestor but rather are derived from a much smaller <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> through extensive gain of host genes.</p>

Antibodies to PfSEA-1 block parasite egress from RBCs and protect against malaria infection
<p>Novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es are urgently needed to reduce the burden of severe malaria.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Aphid-borne Viral Spread Is Enhanced by Virus-induced Accumulation of Plant Reactive Oxygen Species
<p>Most known plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es are spread from plant to plant by insect vectors. There is strong evidence that nonpersistently transmitted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es manipulate the release of plant volatiles to attract insect vectors, thereby promoting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> spread. The mechanisms whereby aphid settling and feeding is altered on plants infected with these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es, however, are unclear. Here we employed loss-of-function mutations in cucumber mosaic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> (CMV) and one of its host plants, tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>), to elucidate such mechanisms. We show that, relative to a CMVΔ2b strain with a deletion of the viral suppressor of RNAi 2b protein in CMV, plants infected with wild-type CMV produce higher concentrations of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in plant tissues. Aphids on wild-type CMV-infected plants engage in shorter probes, less phloem feeding, and exhibit other changes, as detected by electrical penetration graphing technology, relative to CMVΔ2b-infected plants. Therefore, the frequency of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> acquisition and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> load per aphid were greater on CMV-infected plants than on CMVΔ2b-infected plants. Aphids also moved away from initial feeding sites more frequently on wild-type CMV infected versus CMVΔ2b-infected plants. The role of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in eliciting these effects on aphids was corroborated using healthy plants infused with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Finally, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels were not elevated, and aphid behavior was unchanged, on CMV-infected RbohD-silenced tobacco plants, which are deficient in the induction of ROS production. These results suggest that CMV uses its viral suppressor of RNAi protein to increase plant ROS levels, thereby enhancing its acquisition and transmission by vector insects.</p>

In this vector, PV101, the gene of interest was inserted downstream of the duplicated subgenomic promoter of the viral coat protein gene, and the corresponding protein was expressed in its free form. The vector allowed the expression of a 239-amino acid-long GFP in both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>-inoculated and upper uninoculated (systemic) leaves of wheat and maize and directed the systemic expression of a larger approximately 600-amino acid protein, GUSPlus, in maize. Moreover, we demonstrated that PV101 can be used for in planta expression and functional analysis of apoplastic pathogen effector proteins such as the host-specific toxin ToxA of <i>Parastagonospora nodorum</i>. Therefore, this VOX vector opens possibilities for functional genomics studies in two important cereal crops.</p>

Peanut allergen–specific antibodies go public
<p>Changes in the human environment and activities over the past few decades have caused an epidemic of food allergies (<i>1</i>). People suffering from allergies often feel that they live on a cliff edge, as the allergens to which they react are potentially fatal (<i>2</i>). For example, tiny amounts of peanut picked up on skin or contaminating other foods can be dangerous to peanut-sensitized individuals (<i>2</i>–<i>4</i>). Immunoglobulin E (IgE) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es mediate the allergic response. They bind to specific receptors on inflammatory immune cells: mast cells in mucosal tissues lining body surfaces and cavities, and basophils in the circulation. These cells mediate allergic responses triggered by specific antigens (allergens) that are recognized by IgE. B cells expressing IgG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es have long served as the paradigm for the development of B cells into antibody-secreting plasma cells in the immune response. Until recently, the far less abundant IgE-expressing B cells have proved to be elusive. On page 1306 of this issue, Croote <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) have analyzed single B cells from six individuals with peanut allergy, which enabled the identification of the natural Ig heavy- and light-chain pairs from IgE-expressing B cells that are responsible for peanut allergy. With this information they produced recombinant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es, identified the peanut allergen–specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es, and used site-directed mutagenesis to suppress their activity. The mutated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es could be used to treat peanut allergy.</p>

Steep drop in Zika cases undermines vaccine trial
<p>When Zika raced through the Americas in 2016, it caused widespread alarm because the usually mild infection led to brain damage in babies. An intense effort began to develop a Zika <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e, and in March 2017, the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases launched a $110 million trial of its most promising candidate. The trial, now taking place in nine countries in North and South America, has hit a wall: There are too few cases of Zika in the region—largely because vast swaths of populations were infected and now are immune—to assess whether the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e works. As a result, researchers are now planning to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ate people and then intentionally infect them with the Zika <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>. This human challenge model, used for decades with other diseases, was dismissed as too risky by an ethics committee just last year, mainly because infected people can sexually transmit the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> to people who are not in the study. But given the drop in transmission, a better understanding about the duration of sexual transmission, and decreasing interest from industry in Zika <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e R&D, the human challenge model now looks like the best way to move the field forward.</p>

Redemption for self-reactive antibodies
<p>Immunity to pathogens and tolerance to self are cardinal features of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immune system</span></strong>s. Immunological specificity is encoded by receptors expressed on the surface of lymphocytes that are generated through random assembly of variable, diversity, and joining (VDJ) gene segments during B and T lymphocyte development. In addition, B lymphocytes further diversify this initial repertoire through somatic hypermutation of antibody genes in germinal centers (transient structures that form in lymphoid organs in which high-affinity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es arise). On page 223 of this issue, Burnett <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) devise a strategy to track the fate of self-reactive B cells in germinal centers elicited by a foreign antigen that structurally mimics a self-antigen (antigen mimicry). The authors provide evidence that hypermutation of antibody genes in germinal centers can repair self-reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es. These results have implications for how broadly neutralizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es to HIV-1 may be formed.</p>

Incomplete host immunity favors the evolution of virulence in an emergent pathogen
<p>Immune memory evolved to protect hosts from reinfection, but incomplete responses that allow future reinfection may inadvertently select for more-harmful pathogens. We present empirical and modeling evidence that incomplete immunity promotes the evolution of higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virul</span></strong>ence in a natural host-pathogen system. We performed sequential infections of house finches with <i>Mycoplasma gallisepticum</i> strains of various levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virul</span></strong>ence. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virul</span></strong>ent bacterial strains generated stronger host protection against reinfection than less <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virul</span></strong>ent strains and thus excluded less <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virul</span></strong>ent strains from infecting previously exposed hosts. In a two-strain model, the resulting fitness advantage selected for an almost twofold increase in pathogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virul</span></strong>ence. Thus, the same <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immune system</span></strong>s that protect hosts from infection can concomitantly drive the evolution of more-harmful pathogens in nature.</p>

Safety concerns derail dengue vaccination program
<p>Efforts to control dengue suffered a major setback in late November when Sanofi Pasteur announced that its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e, the only one on the market, should only be given to those who have already had one infection with the mosquito-borne disease that affects millions of people in the tropics each year. The dengue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> comes in four serotypes. A first infection is usually mild, but a second infection with a different serotype puts the patient at risk of a serious, occasionally life-threatening illness. A retrospective analysis of those who participated in phase III trials in 2011 found that those who had never had a dengue infection at the time of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ation were in rare cases at risk of enhanced disease, although the Dengvaxia <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e did reduce infections and cases of serious illness in those who had previously suffered from dengue. The news caused an uproar in the Philippines, where a mass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ation campaign was halted. And the incident is likely to lead health officials to carefully scrutinize other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es now in development.</p>

Antibody-dependent enhancement of severe dengue disease in humans
<p>For dengue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es 1 to 4 (DENV1-4), a specific range of antibody titer has been shown to enhance viral replication in vitro and severe disease in animal models. Although suspected, such antibody-dependent enhancement of severe disease has not been shown to occur in humans. Using multiple statistical approaches to study a long-term pediatric cohort in Nicaragua, we show that risk of severe dengue disease is highest within a narrow range of preexisting anti-DENV antibody titers. By contrast, we observe protection from all symptomatic dengue disease at high antibody titers. Thus, immune correlates of severe dengue must be evaluated separately from correlates of protection against symptomatic disease. These results have implications for studies of dengue pathogenesis and for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e development, because enhancement, not just lack of protection, is of concern.</p>

Where has all the Zika gone?
<p>Only one case of locally transmitted Zika <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> has been documented in the United States this year, a reflection of the fact that cases have plummeted in Latin America and the Caribbean. Experts say the cause of the drop has nothing to do with efforts to control the mosquitoes that spread the disease or the impact of climate on their populations. Rather, the rapid spread of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> through the Americas—which had its first reported case in Brazil in April 2015—left large swaths of the population immune. This so-called "herd immunity" has made it increasingly difficult for the Zika <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> to find susceptible people, breaking the cycle of transmission between humans and mosquitoes. The drop in cases has not lessened the push to develop a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e against Zika, which caused widespread alarm after thousands of babies in Brazil were born with brain deformities that studies have shown are linked to the mothers being infected by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> while they were pregnant. But with transmission in the region becoming scarce, it does complicate efforts of clinical trials that hope to show lower rates of transmission and disease in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ated people. One such trial is underway right now.</p>

Enhancement of Zika virus pathogenesis by preexisting antiflavivirus immunity
<p>Zika <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> (ZIKV) is spreading rapidly into regions around the world where other flavi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es, such as dengue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> (DENV) and West Nile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> (WNV), are endemic. Antibody-dependent enhancement has been implicated in more severe forms of flavi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> disease, but whether this also applies to ZIKV infection is unclear. Using convalescent plasma from DENV- and WNV-infected individuals, we found substantial enhancement of ZIKV infection in vitro that was mediated through immunoglobulin G engagement of Fcγ receptors. Administration of DENV- or WNV-convalescent plasma into ZIKV-susceptible mice resulted in increased morbidity—including fever, viremia, and viral loads in spinal cord and testes—and increased mortality. Antibody-dependent enhancement may explain the severe disease manifestations associated with recent ZIKV outbreaks and highlights the need to exert great caution when designing flavi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es.</p>

MAVS-dependent host species range and pathogenicity of human hepatitis A virus
<p>Hepatotropic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es are important causes of human disease, but the intrahepatic immune response to hepatitis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es is poorly understood because of a lack of tractable small- animal models.

We demonstrate that the capacity of HAV to evade MAVS-mediated type I <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interferon</span></strong> responses defines its host species range. HAV-induced liver injury was associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interferon</span></strong>-independent intrinsic hepatocellular apoptosis and hepatic inflammation that unexpectedly resulted from MAVS and IRF3/7 signaling.

An Improved <i>Brome mosaic virus</i> Silencing Vector: Greater Insert Stability and More Extensive VIGS
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>-induced gene silencing (VIGS) is used extensively for gene function studies in plants. VIGS is inexpensive and rapid compared with silencing conducted through stable transformation, but many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>-silencing vectors, especially in grasses, induce only transient silencing phenotypes. A major reason for transient phenotypes is the instability of the foreign gene fragment (insert) in the vector during VIGS. Here, we report the development of a <i>Brome mosaic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong></i> (BMV)-based vector that better maintains inserts through modification of the original BMV vector RNA sequence. Modification of the BMV RNA3 sequence yielded a vector, BMVCP5, that better maintained <i>phytoene desaturase</i> and <i>heat shock protein70-1</i> (<i>HSP70-1</i>) inserts in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). Longer maintenance of inserts was correlated with greater target gene silencing and more extensive visible silencing phenotypes displaying greater tissue penetration and involving more leaves. The modified vector accumulated similarly to the original vector in <i>N. benthamiana</i> after agroinfiltration, thus maintaining a high titer of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> in this intermediate host used to produce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> inoculum for grass hosts. For <i>HSP70</i>, silencing one family member led to a large increase in the expression of another family member, an increase likely related to the target gene knockdown and not a general effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> infection. The cause of the increased insert stability in the modified vector is discussed in relationship to its recombination and accumulation potential. The modified vector will improve functional genomic studies in grasses, and the conceptual methods used to improve the vector may be applied to other VIGS vectors.</p>

Immunogene and viral transcript dynamics during parasitic <i>Varroa destructor</i> mite infection of developing honey bee (<i>Apis mellifera</i>) pupae
<p>The ectoparasitic <i>Varroa destructor</i> mite is a major contributor to the ongoing honey bee health crisis. <i>Varroa</i> interacts with honey bee <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es, exacerbating their pathogenicity. In addition to vectoring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es, immunosuppression of the developing honey bee hosts by <i>Varroa</i> has been proposed to explain the synergy between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es and mites. However, the evidence for honey bee immune suppression by <i>V. destructor</i> is contentious. We systematically studied the quantitative effects of experimentally introduced <i>V. destructor</i> mites on immune gene expression at five specific time points during the development of the honey bee hosts. Mites reproduced normally and were associated with increased titers of deformed wing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> in the developing bees. Our data on different immune genes show little evidence for immunosuppression of honey bees by <i>V. destructor</i>. Experimental wounding of developing bees increases relative immune gene expression and deformed wing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> titers. Combined, these results suggest that mite feeding activity itself and not immunosuppression may contribute to the synergy between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es and mites. However, our results also suggest that increased expression of honey bee immune genes decreases mite reproductive success, which may be explored to enhance mite control strategies. Finally, our expression data for multiple immune genes across developmental time and different experimental treatments indicates co-regulation of several of these genes and thus improves our understanding of the understudied honey bee <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immune system</span></strong>.</p>

Gene Expression Profiling for the Identification and Classification of Antibody-Mediated Heart Rejection
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) contributes to heart allograft loss.

Evaluation of the selectivity and sensitivity of isoform- and mutation-specific RAS antibodies
<p>There is intense interest in developing therapeutic strategies for RAS proteins, the most frequently mutated oncoprotein family in cancer. Development of effective anti-RAS therapies will be aided by the greater appreciation of RAS isoform–specific differences in signaling events that support neoplastic cell growth. However, critical issues that require resolution to facilitate the success of these efforts remain. In particular, the use of well-validated anti-RAS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es is essential for accurate interpretation of experimental data. We evaluated 22 commercially available anti-RAS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es with a set of distinct reagents and cell lines for their specificity and selectivity in recognizing the intended RAS isoforms and mutants. Reliability varied substantially. For example, we found that some pan- or isoform-selective anti-RAS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es did not adequately recognize their intended target or showed greater selectivity for another; some were valid for detecting G12D and G12V mutant RAS proteins in Western blotting, but none were valid for immunofluorescence or immunohistochemical analyses; and some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es recognized nonspecific bands in lysates from “Rasless” cells expressing the oncoprotein BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>. Using our validated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es, we identified RAS isoform–specific siRNAs and shRNAs. Our results may help to ensure the accurate interpretation of future RAS studies.</p>

Targeting TNFR2 with antagonistic antibodies inhibits proliferation of ovarian cancer cells and tumor-associated T<sub>regs</sub>
<p>Major barriers to cancer therapy include the lack of selective inhibitors of regulatory T cells (T<sub>regs</sub>) and the lack of broadly applicable ways to directly target tumors through frequently expressed surface oncogenes. Tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2) is an attractive target protein because of its restricted abundance to highly immunosuppressive T<sub>regs</sub> and oncogenic presence on human tumors. We characterized the effect of TNFR2 inhibition using antagonistic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es. In culture-based assays, we found that two TNFR2 antagonists inhibited T<sub>reg</sub> proliferation, reduced soluble TNFR2 secretion from normal cells, and enabled T effector cell expansion. The antagonistic activity occurred in the presence of added TNF, a natural TNFR2 agonist. These TNFR2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es killed T<sub>regs</sub> isolated from ovarian cancer ascites more potently than it killed T<sub>regs</sub> from healthy donor samples, suggesting that these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es may have specificity for the tumor microenvironment. The TNFR2 antagonists also killed OVCAR3 ovarian cancer cells, which have abundant surface TNFR2. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es stabilized antiparallel dimers in cell surface TNFR2 that rendered the receptor unable to activate the nuclear factor κB pathway and trigger cell proliferation. Our data suggest that, by targeting tumor cells and immunosuppressive tumor-associated T<sub>regs</sub>, antagonistic TNFR2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es may be an effective treatment for cancers positive for TNFR2.</p>

Innate immune recognition of glycans targets HIV nanoparticle immunogens to germinal centers

We compared the fates of two different heavily glycosylated HIV antigens, a gp120-derived mini-protein and a large, stabilized envelope trimer, in protein nanoparticle or “free” forms after primary immunization. Unlike monomeric antigens, nanoparticles were rapidly shuttled to the follicular dendritic cell (FDC) network and then concentrated in germinal centers in a complement-, mannose-binding lectin (MBL)–, and immunogen glycan–dependent manner. Loss of FDC localization in MBL-deficient mice or via immunogen deglycosylation significantly affected antibody responses. These findings identify an innate immune–mediated recognition pathway promoting antibody responses to particulate antigens, with broad implications for humoral immunity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e design.</p>

An autoimmune disease variant of IgG1 modulates B cell activation and differentiation
<p>The maintenance of autoreactive B cells in a quiescent state is crucial for preventing autoimmunity. Here we identify a variant of human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) with a Gly<sup>396</sup>→Arg substitution (hIgG1-G396R), which positively correlates with systemic lupus erythematosus. In induced lupus models, murine homolog Gly<sup>390</sup>→Arg (G390R) knockin mice generate excessive numbers of plasma cells, leading to a burst of broad-spectrum auto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es. This enhanced production of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es is also observed in hapten-immunized G390R mice, as well as in influenza-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ated human G396R homozygous carriers. This variant potentiates the phosphorylation of the IgG1 immunoglobulin tail tyrosine (ITT) motif. This, in turn, alters the availability of phospho-ITT to trigger longer adaptor protein Grb2 dwell times in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immunolog</span></strong>ical synapses, leading to hyper–Grb2–Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (Btk) signaling upon antigen binding. Thus, the hIgG1-G396R variant is important for both lupus pathogenesis and antibody responses after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ation.</p>

Congo rapidly curtails Ebola
<p>An outbreak of Ebola that surfaced in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) on 8 May has petered out and, for the first time, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e may have had a role in containing spread.

Most everyone lived in remote, difficult-to-reach villages, although four cases surfaced in the heavily populated city of Mbandaka, triggering serious concerns of an epidemic exploding. A vigorous, rapid effort to contain spread began immediately, with the DRC's Ministry of Public Health working with international partners to build treatment facilities, conduct surveillance, and trace contacts of cases. On 21 May, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e effort began that focused on creating a "ring" around cases by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ating people they may have come in contact with directly or indirectly.

Polio outbreaks in the DRC threaten eradication effort

Antihomotypic affinity maturation improves human B cell responses against a repetitive epitope

These data provide a mechanistic explanation for the strong selection of somatic mutations that mediate homotypic antibody interactions after repeated parasite exposure in humans.

Unsettling new findings, however, show it is far from gone. In the most extensive effort in any country to scour the environment for traces of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>, polio workers are finding it widely across Pakistan, in places they thought it had disappeared. They are wondering "just what the hell is going on" and how worried they should be, says epidemiologist Chris Maher of the World Health Organization in Geneva, Switzerland, who runs polio operations in the eastern Mediterranean region. Does this mean the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> is more entrenched than anyone realized and is poised to resurge? Or is this how a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> behaves in its final days—persisting in the environment but not causing disease until it fades out? </p>

Loss of <i>AvrSr50</i> by somatic exchange in stem rust leads to virulence for <i>Sr50</i> resistance in wheat
<p>Race-specific resistance genes protect the global wheat crop from stem rust disease caused by <i>Puccinia graminis</i> f. sp. <i>tritici</i> (<i>Pgt</i>) but are often overcome owing to evolution of new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virul</span></strong>ent races of the pathogen. To understand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virul</span></strong>ence evolution in <i>Pgt</i>, we identified the protein ligand (AvrSr50) recognized by the Sr50 resistance protein. A spontaneous mutant of <i>Pgt</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virul</span></strong>ent to <i>Sr50</i> contained a 2.5 mega–base pair loss-of-heterozygosity event. A haustorial secreted protein from this region triggers <i>Sr50</i>-dependent defense responses in planta and interacts directly with the Sr50 protein. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virul</span></strong>ence alleles of <i>AvrSr50</i> have arisen through DNA insertion and sequence divergence, and our data provide molecular evidence that in addition to sexual recombination, somatic exchange can play a role in the emergence of new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virul</span></strong>ence traits in <i>Pgt</i>.</p>

An interferon-independent lncRNA promotes viral replication by modulating cellular metabolism
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es regulate host metabolic networks to improve their survival. The molecules that are responsive to viral infection and regulate such metabolic changes are hardly known, but are essential for understanding viral infection. Here we identify a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) that is induced by multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es, but not by type I <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interferon</span></strong> (IFN-I), and facilitates viral replication in mouse and human cells. In vivo deficiency of lncRNA-ACOD1 (a lncRNA identified by its nearest coding gene <i>Acod1</i>, aconitate decarboxylase 1) significantly attenuates viral infection through IFN-I–IRF3 (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interferon</span></strong> regulatory factor 3)–independent pathways. Cytoplasmic lncRNA-ACOD1 directly binds the metabolic enzyme glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT2) near the substrate niche, enhancing its catalytic activity. Recombinant GOT2 protein and its metabolites could rescue viral replication upon lncRNA-ACOD1 deficiency and increase lethality. This work reveals a feedback mechanism of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>-induced lncRNA-mediated metabolic promotion of viral infection and a potential target for developing broad-acting antiviral therapeutics.</p>

Life, death, and antibodies
<p>The production of high-affinity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es has fascinated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immunolog</span></strong>ists for many decades. A potent arm of the immune response, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es are forged in transient tissue structures called germinal centers (GCs) that appear in lymph nodes a few days after an infection is initiated. Over the ensuing days and weeks, the GC witnesses a cellular pantomime that includes rapid bursts of B lymphocyte proliferation and multicellular migratory cycles that have a unique purpose. These B cells are in the act of mutating, reshaping, testing, and improving their antibody specificities. While their antibody is refined, GC B cells are also undergoing further differentiation to be retasked for new, long-term occupations as circulating memory cells in the blood or bone marrow-resident, long-lived plasma cells that will produce high-affinity, protective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es for life. These intense proliferation and selection processes are balanced by an extraordinary rate of programmed cell death (apoptosis), and there is much speculation as to how and why so many B cells are targeted for apoptosis. On page 193 of this issue, Mayer <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) identify the paths leading to B cell apoptosis in the GC reaction.</p>

Structural basis for antibody-mediated neutralization of Lassa virus
<p>The arena<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> Lassa causes severe hemorrhagic fever and a significant disease burden in West Africa every year. The glycoprotein, GPC, is the sole antigen expressed on the viral surface and the critical target for antibody-mediated neutralization. Here we present the crystal structure of the trimeric, prefusion ectodomain of Lassa GP bound to a neutralizing antibody from a human survivor at 3.2-angstrom resolution. The antibody extensively anchors two monomers together at the base of the trimer, and biochemical analysis suggests that it neutralizes by inhibiting conformational changes required for entry. This work illuminates pH-driven conformational changes in both receptor-binding and fusion subunits of Lassa <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>, illustrates the unique assembly of the arena<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> glycoprotein spike, and provides a much-needed template for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e design against these threats to global health.</p>

A “Trojan horse” bispecific-antibody strategy for broad protection against ebolaviruses
<p>There is an urgent need for monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies that broadly protect against Ebola <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> and other filo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es. The conserved, essential interaction between the filo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> glycoprotein, GP, and its entry receptor Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) provides an attractive target for such mAbs but is shielded by multiple mechanisms, including physical sequestration in late endosomes. Here, we describe a bispecific-antibody strategy to target this interaction, in which mAbs specific for NPC1 or the GP receptor–binding site are coupled to a mAb against a conserved, surface-exposed GP epitope. Bispecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es, but not parent mAbs, neutralized all known ebola<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es by coopting viral particles themselves for endosomal delivery and conferred postexposure protection against multiple ebola<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es in mice. Such “Trojan horse” bispecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es have potential as broad antifilo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> immunotherapeutics.</p>

Rapid development of a DNA vaccine for Zika virus
<p>Zika <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> (ZIKV) was identified as a cause of congenital disease during the explosive outbreak in the Americas and Caribbean that began in 2015. Because of the ongoing fetal risk from endemic disease and travel-related exposures, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e to prevent viremia in women of childbearing age and their partners is imperative. We found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ation with DNA expressing the premembrane and envelope proteins of ZIKV was immunogenic in mice and nonhuman primates, and protection against viremia after ZIKV challenge correlated with serum neutralizing activity. These data not only indicate that DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ation could be a successful approach to protect against ZIKV infection, but also suggest a protective threshold of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e-induced neutralizing activity that prevents viremia after acute infection.</p>

Role for migratory wild birds in the global spread of avian influenza H5N8
<p>Avian influenza <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es affect both poultry production and public health. A subtype H5N8 (clade 2.3.4.4) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>, following an outbreak in poultry in South Korea in January 2014, rapidly spread worldwide in 2014–2015. Our analysis of H5N8 viral sequences, epidemiological investigations, waterfowl migration, and poultry trade showed that long-distance migratory birds can play a major role in the global spread of avian influenza <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es. Further, we found that the hemagglutinin of clade 2.3.4.4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> was remarkably promiscuous, creating reassortants with multiple neuraminidase subtypes. Improving our understanding of the circumpolar circulation of avian influenza <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es in migratory waterfowl will help to provide early warning of threats from avian influenza to poultry, and potentially human, health.</p>

Sucrose Nonfermenting 1-Related Protein Kinase 1 Phosphorylates a Geminivirus Rep Protein to Impair Viral Replication and Infection
<p>Gemini<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es are single-stranded DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es that infect a wide variety of plants and cause severe crop losses worldwide. The gemini<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> replication initiator protein (Rep) binds to the viral replication origin and catalyzes DNA cleavage and ligation to initiate rolling circle replication. In this study, we found that the <i>Tomato golden mosaic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong></i> (TGMV) Rep is phosphorylated at serine-97 by sucrose nonfermenting 1-related protein kinase 1 (SnRK1), a master regulator of plant energy homeostasis and metabolism. Phosphorylation of Rep or the phosphomimic S97D mutation impaired Rep binding to viral DNA. A TGMV DNA-A replicon containing the Rep S97D mutation replicated less efficiently in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) protoplasts than in wild-type or Rep phosphorylation-deficient replicons. The TGMV Rep-S97D mutant also was less infectious than the wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> and was unable to infect tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>). Nearly all gemini<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> Rep proteins have a serine residue at the position equivalent to TGMV Rep serine-97. SnRK1 phosphorylated the equivalent serines in the Rep proteins of <i>Tomato mottle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong></i> and <i>Tomato yellow leaf curl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong></i> and reduced DNA binding, suggesting that SnRK1 plays a key role in combating gemini<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> infection. These results established that SnRK1 phosphorylates Rep and interferes with gemini<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> replication and infection, underscoring the emerging role for SnRK1 in the host defense response against plant pathogens.</p>

Potato Mop-Top Virus Co-Opts the Stress Sensor HIPP26 for Long-Distance Movement
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> movement proteins facilitate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> entry into the vascular system to initiate systemic infection. The potato mop-top <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> (PMTV) movement protein, TGB1, is involved in long-distance movement of both viral ribonucleoprotein complexes and virions. Here, our analysis of TGB1 interactions with host <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> proteins revealed an interaction with a member of the heavy metal-associated isoprenylated plant protein family, HIPP26, which acts as a plasma membrane-to-nucleus signal during abiotic stress. We found that knockdown of <i>NbHIPP26</i> expression inhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> long-distance movement but did not affect cell-to-cell movement. Drought and PMTV infection up-regulated <i>NbHIPP26</i> gene expression, and PMTV infection protected plants from drought. In addition, <i>NbHIPP26</i> promoter-reporter fusions revealed vascular tissue-specific expression. Mutational and biochemical analyses indicated that NbHIPP26 subcellular localization at the plasma membrane and plasmodesmata was mediated by lipidation (<i>S</i>-acylation and prenylation), as nonlipidated NbHIPP26 was predominantly in the nucleus. Notably, coexpression of NbHIPP26 with TGB1 resulted in a similar nuclear accumulation of NbHIPP26. TGB1 interacted with the carboxyl-terminal CVVM (prenyl) domain of NbHIPP26, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation revealed that the TGB1-HIPP26 complex localized to microtubules and accumulated in the nucleolus, with little signal at the plasma membrane or plasmodesmata. These data support a mechanism where interaction with TGB1 negates or reverses NbHIPP26 lipidation, thus releasing membrane-associated NbHIPP26 and redirecting it via microtubules to the nucleus, thereby activating the drought stress response and facilitating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> long-distance movement.</p>

Identification of a New Host Factor Required for Antiviral RNAi and Amplification of Viral siRNAs
<p>Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are processed from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>-specific dsRNA to direct antiviral RNA interference (RNAi) in diverse eukaryotic hosts. We have recently performed a sensitized genetic screen in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and identified two related phospholipid flippases required for antiviral RNAi and the amplification of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>-derived siRNAs by plant RNA-dependent RNA polymerase1 (RDR1) and RDR6. Here we report the identification and cloning of <i>ANTIVIRAL RNAI</i>-<i>DEFECTIVE2</i> (<i>AVI2</i>) from the same genetic screen. <i>AVI2</i> encodes a multispan transmembrane protein broadly conserved in plants and animals with two homologous human proteins known as magnesium transporters. We show that <i>avi2</i> mutant plants display no developmental defects and develop severe disease symptoms after infection with a mutant <i>Cucumber mosaic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong></i> (CMV) defective in RNAi suppression. <i>AVI2</i> is induced by CMV infection, particularly in veins, and is required for antiviral RNAi and RDR6-dependent biogenesis of viral siRNAs. AVI2 is also necessary for Dicer-like2-mediated amplification of 22-nucleotide viral siRNAs induced in <i>dcl4</i> mutant plants by infection, but dispensable for RDR6-dependent biogenesis of endogenous transacting siRNAs. Further genetic studies illustrate that AVI2 plays a partially redundant role with AVI2H, the most closely related member in the <i>AVI2</i> gene family, in RDR1-dependent biogenesis of viral siRNAs and the endogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>-activated siRNAs (vasi-RNAs). Interestingly, we discovered a specific genetic interaction of AVI2 with AVI1 flippase that is critical for plant development. We propose that AVI1 and AVI2 participate in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>-induced formation of the RDR1/RDR6-specific, membrane-bound RNA synthesis compartment, essential for the biogenesis of highly abundant viral siRNAs and vasi-RNAs.</p>

Turnip Mosaic Virus Counteracts Selective Autophagy of the Viral Silencing Suppressor HCpro<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Autophagy is a conserved intracellular degradation pathway and has emerged as a key mechanism of antiviral immunity in metazoans, including the selective elimination of viral components. In turn, some animal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>es are able to escape and modulate autophagy for enhanced pathogenicity. Whether host autophagic responses and viral countermeasures play similar roles in plant-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> interactions is not well understood. Here, we have identified selective autophagy as antiviral pathway during plant infection with turnip mosaic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> (TuMV), a positive-stranded RNA poty<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>. We show that the autophagy cargo receptor NBR1 suppresses viral accumulation by targeting the viral RNA silencing suppressor helper-component proteinase (HCpro), presumably in association with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong>-induced RNA granules. Intriguingly, TuMV seems to antagonize NBR1-dependent autophagy during infection by the activity of distinct viral proteins, thereby limiting its antiviral capacity. We also found that NBR1-independent bulk autophagy prevents premature plant death, thus extending the lifespan of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">virus</span></strong> reservoirs and particle production. Together, our study highlights a conserved role of selective autophagy in antiviral immunity and suggests the evolvement of viral protein functions to inhibit autophagy processes, despite a potential trade-off in host survival.</p>

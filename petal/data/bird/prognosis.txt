Phenotypic Characterization of <i>EIF2AK4</i> Mutation Carriers in a Large Cohort of Patients Diagnosed Clinically With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare disease with an emerging genetic basis. Heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding the bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 (<i>BMPR2</i>) are the commonest genetic cause of PAH, whereas biallelic mutations in the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 4 gene (<i>EIF2AK4</i>) are described in pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis. Here, we determine the frequency of these mutations and define the genotype-phenotype characteristics in a large cohort of patients diagnosed clinically with PAH.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Whole-genome sequencing was performed on DNA from patients with idiopathic and heritable PAH and with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis recruited to the National Institute of Health Research BioResource–Rare Diseases study. Heterozygous variants in <i>BMPR2</i> and biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> variants with a minor allele frequency of <1:10 000 in control data sets and predicted to be deleterious (by combined annotation-dependent depletion, PolyPhen-2, and <i>sorting intolerant from tolerant</i> predictions) were identified as potentially causal. Phenotype data from the time of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s were also captured.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Eight hundred sixty-four patients with idiopathic or heritable PAH and 16 with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis were recruited. Mutations in <i>BMPR2</i> were identified in 130 patients (14.8%). Biallelic mutations in <i>EIF2AK4</i> were identified in 5 patients with a clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis. Furthermore, 9 patients with a clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of PAH carried biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutations. These patients had a reduced transfer coefficient for carbon monoxide (K<sc>co</sc>; 33% [interquartile range, 30%–35%] predicted) and younger age at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s (29 years; interquartile range, 23–38 years) and more interlobular septal thickening and mediastinal lymphadenopathy on computed tomography of the chest compared with patients with PAH without <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutations. However, radiological assessment alone could not accurately identify biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutation carriers. Patients with PAH with biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutations had a shorter survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutations are found in patients classified clinically as having idiopathic and heritable PAH. These patients cannot be identified reliably by computed tomography, but a low K<sc>co</sc> and a young age at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s suggests the underlying molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s. Genetic testing can identify these misclassified patients, allowing appropriate management and early referral for lung transplantation.</p></sec>

Diagnosis and Treatment of Fetal Cardiac Disease
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>The goal of this statement is to review available literature and to put forth a scientific statement on the current practice of fetal cardiac medicine, including the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s and management of fetal cardiovascular disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>A writing group appointed by the American Heart Association reviewed the available literature pertaining to topics relevant to fetal cardiac medicine, including the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of congenital heart disease and arrhythmias, assessment of cardiac function and the cardiovascular system, and available treatment options. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association classification of recommendations and level of evidence for practice guidelines were applied to the current practice of fetal cardiac medicine. Recommendations relating to the specifics of fetal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s, including the timing of referral for study, indications for referral, and experience suggested for performance and interpretation of studies, are presented. The components of a fetal echocardiogram are described in detail, including descriptions of the assessment of cardiac anatomy, cardiac function, and rhythm. Complementary modalities for fetal cardiac assessment are reviewed, including the use of advanced ultrasound techniques, fetal magnetic resonance imaging, and fetal magnetocardiography and electrocardiography for rhythm assessment. Models for parental counseling and a discussion of parental stress and depression assessments are reviewed. Available fetal therapies, including medical management for arrhythmias or heart failure and closed or open intervention for diseases affecting the cardiovascular system such as twin–twin transfusion syndrome, lung masses, and vascular tumors, are highlighted. Catheter-based intervention strategies to prevent the progression of disease in utero are also discussed. Recommendations for delivery planning strategies for fetuses with congenital heart disease including models based on classification of disease severity and delivery room treatment will be highlighted. Outcome assessment is reviewed to show the benefit of prenatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s and management as they affect outcome for babies with congenital heart disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Fetal cardiac medicine has evolved considerably over the past 2 decades, predominantly in response to advances in imaging technology and innovations in therapies. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of cardiac disease in the fetus is mostly made with ultrasound; however, new technologies, including 3- and 4-dimensional echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and fetal electrocardiography and magnetocardiography, are available. Medical and interventional treatments for select diseases and strategies for delivery room care enable stabilization of high-risk fetuses and contribute to improved outcomes. This statement highlights what is currently known and recommended on the basis of evidence and experience in the rapidly advancing and highly specialized field of fetal cardiac care.</p></sec>

Synovial calprotectin
<sec><title>Aims </title><p>Recently, several synovial biomarkers have been introduced into   the algorithm for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of a prosthetic joint infection   (PJI). Alpha defensin is a promising biomarker, with a high sensitivity   and specificity, but it is expensive. Calprotectin is a protein   that is present in the cytoplasm of neutrophils, is released upon   neutrophil activation and exhibits anti-microbial activity. Our   aim, in this study, was to determine the diagnostic potential of   synovial calprotectin in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of a PJI.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>In this pilot study, we prospectively collected synovial fluid   from the hip, knee, shoulder and elbow of 19 patients with a proven   PJI and from a control group of 42 patients who underwent revision   surgery without a PJI.</p><p>PJI was diagnosed according to the current diagnostic criteria   of the Musculoskeletal Infection Society. Synovial fluid was centrifuged   and the supernatant was used to measure the level of calprotectin   after applying a lateral flow immunoassay. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The median synovial calprotectin level was 991 mg/L (interquartile   range (IQR) 154 to 1787) in those with a PJI and 11 mg/L (IQR 3   to 29) in the control group (p < 0.0001). Using a cut-off value   of 50 mg/L, this level showed an excellent diagnostic accuracy,   with an area under the curve of 0.94. The overall sensitivity, specificity,   positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV)   was 89%, 90%, 81% and 95% respectively. The NPV was 97% in the nine   patients with a chronic PJI. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion </title><p>Synovial calprotectin may be a valuable biomarker in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s   of a PJI, especially in the exclusion of an infection. With a lateral   flow immunoassay, a relatively rapid quantitative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s can   be made. The measurement is cheap and is easy to use. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:660–5.</p></sec>

Synovasure ‘quick test’ is not as accurate as the laboratory-based α-defensin immunoassay
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>α-defensin is a biomarker which has been described as having   a high degree of accuracy in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of periprosthetic joint   infection (PJI). Current meta-analyses are based on the α-defensin   laboratory-based immunoassay rather than the quick on-table lateral   flow test kit. This study is the first meta-analysis to compare the   accuracy of the α-defensin laboratory-based immunoassay and the   lateral flow test kit for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of PJI.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A systematic review was performed according to the Preferred   Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.   Inclusion criteria were all clinical studies where the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s   of PJI was uncertain. All studies selected used the Musculoskeletal   Infection Society (MSIS) or modified MSIS criteria. Two independent   reviewers reviewed the studies and extracted data. A meta-analysis   of results was carried out: pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive   and negative likelihood ratio, heterogeneity and areas under curves   are reported.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Ten studies (759 patients) were included. Of these, seven studies   (640 patients) evaluated the laboratory-based α-defensin immunoassay   and three (119 patients) the lateral flow test. The pooled sensitivity   and specificity of the qualitative α-defensin laboratory immunoassay   was 0.953 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 to 0.984) and 0.965 (95%   CI 0.943 to 0.979) respectively. The pooled positive likelihood   ratio (PLR) and negative likelihood ratio (NLR) were 34.86 (95%   CI 19.34 to 62.85) and 0.02 (95% CI 0.00 to 0.11). The pooled sensitivity   and specificity of the lateral flow test were 0.774 (95% CI 0.637   to 0.870) and 0.913 (95% CI 0.828 to 0.958), respectively. The pooled   PLR and NLR were 8.675 (95% CI 4.229 to 17.794) and 0.248 (95% CI   0.147 to 0.418), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The pooled sensitivity and specificity of the lateral flow test   were lower than those of the   α-defensin laboratory-based immunoassay test. Hence, care must be   taken with interpretation of the lateral flow test when relying   on its results for the intra-operative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of PJI.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:66–72.</p></sec>

Latent Rheumatic Heart Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Screening echocardiography has emerged as a potentially powerful tool for early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of rheumatic heart disease (RHD). The utility of screening echocardiography hinges on the rate of RHD progression and the ability of penicillin prophylaxis to improve outcome. We report the longitudinal outcomes of a cohort of children with latent RHD and identify risk factors for unfavorable outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This was a prospective natural history study conducted under the Ugandan RHD registry. Children with latent RHD and ≥1 year of follow-up were included. All echocardiograms were re-reviewed by experts (2012 World Heart Federation criteria) for inclusion and evidence of change. Bi- and multivariable logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and Cox proportional hazards models, as well, were developed to search for risk factors for unfavorable outcome and compare progression-free survival between those treated and not treated with penicillin. Propensity and other matching methods with sensitivity analysis were implemented for the evaluation of the penicillin effect.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Blinded review confirmed 227 cases of latent RHD: 164 borderline and 63 definite (42 mild, 21 moderate/severe). Median age at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s was 12 years and median follow-up was 2.3 years (interquartile range, 2.0–2.9). Penicillin prophylaxis was prescribed in 49.3% with overall adherence of 84.7%. Of children with moderate-to-severe definite RHD, 47.6% had echocardiographic progression (including 2 deaths), and 9.5% had echocardiographic regression. Children with mild definite and borderline RHD showed 26% and 9.8% echocardiographic progression and 45.2% and 46.3% echocardiographic improvement, respectively. Of those with mild definite RHD or borderline RHD, more advanced disease category, younger age, and morphological mitral valve features were risk factors for an unfavorable outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Latent RHD is a heterogeneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s with variable disease outcomes. Children with moderate to severe latent RHD have poor outcomes. Children with both borderline and mild definite RHD are at substantial risk of progression. Although long-term outcome remains unclear, the initial change in latent RHD may be evident during the first 1 to 2 years following <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s. Natural history data are inherently limited, and a randomized clinical trial is needed to definitively determine the impact of penicillin prophylaxis on the trajectory of latent RHD.</p></sec>

Direct Comparison of Cardiac Myosin-Binding Protein C With Cardiac Troponins for the Early Diagnosis of Acute Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac myosin-binding protein C (cMyC) is a cardiac-restricted protein that is more abundant than cardiac troponins (cTn) and is released more rapidly after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). We evaluated cMyC as an adjunct or alternative to cTn in the early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of AMI.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Unselected patients (N=1954) presenting to the emergency department with symptoms suggestive of AMI, concentrations of cMyC, and high-sensitivity (hs) and standard-sensitivity cTn were measured at presentation. The final <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of AMI was independently adjudicated using all available clinical and biochemical information without knowledge of cMyC. The prognostic end point was long-term mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Final <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s was AMI in 340 patients (17%). Concentrations of cMyC at presentation were significantly higher in those with versus without AMI (median, 237 ng/L versus 13 ng/L, <i>P</i><0.001). Discriminatory power for AMI, as quantified by the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC), was comparable for cMyC (AUC, 0.924), hs-cTnT (AUC, 0.927), and hs-cTnI (AUC, 0.922) and superior to cTnI measured by a contemporary sensitivity assay (AUC, 0.909). The combination of cMyC with hs-cTnT or standard-sensitivity cTnI (but not hs-cTnI) led to an increase in AUC to 0.931 (<i>P</i><0.0001) and 0.926 (<i>P</i>=0.003), respectively. Use of cMyC more accurately classified patients with a single blood test into rule-out or rule-in categories: Net Reclassification Improvement +0.149 versus hs-cTnT, +0.235 versus hs-cTnI (<i>P</i><0.001). In early presenters (chest pain <3 h), the improvement in rule-in/rule-out classification with cMyC was larger compared with hs-cTnT (Net Reclassification Improvement +0.256) and hs-cTnI (Net Reclassification Improvement +0.308; both <i>P</i><0.001). Comparing the C statistics, cMyC was superior to hs-cTnI and standard sensitivity cTnI (<i>P</i><0.05 for both) and similar to hs-cTnT at predicting death at 3 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>cMyC at presentation provides discriminatory power comparable to hs-cTnT and hs-cTnI in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of AMI and may perform favorably in patients presenting early after symptom onset.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Improving the accuracy of synovial fluid analysis in the diagnosis of prosthetic joint infection with simple and inexpensive biomarkers
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of this study were to increase the diagnostic accuracy   of the analysis of synovial fluid in the differentiation of prosthetic   joint infection (PJI) by the addition of inexpensive biomarkers   such as the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), adenosine deaminase   (ADA), alpha-2-macrogloblulin (α2M) and procalcitonin.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between January 2013 and December 2015, synovial fluid and removed   implants were requested from 143 revision total joint arthroplasties.   A total of 55 patients met inclusion criteria of the receipt of   sufficient synovial fluid, tissue samples and removed implants for   analysis.</p><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of PJI followed the definition from a recent International   Consensus Meeting to create two groups of patients; septic and aseptic.   Using receiver operating characteristic curves we determined the   cutoff values and diagnostic accuracy for each marker.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were 23 PJIs and 32 patients with aseptic loosening. The   levels of total leucocyte count, proportion of polymorphonuclear   leucocytes (PMNs), CRP, ADA and α2M in the synovial fluid were all   significantly higher in those with a PJI than in those with aseptic   loosening. The levels of procalcitonin were comparable in the two   groups.</p><p>Cutoff values for the optimal performance in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of   infection were: total leucocyte count > 1463 cells/μL (sensitivity   (Sens) 100%, specificity (Spec) 71.9%, positive predictive value   (PPV) 71.9%, negative predictive value (NPV) 100%); proportion of   PMNs > 81% (Sens 78.3%, Spec 75.0%, PPV 69.2%, NPV 82.8%); CRP >   6.7mg/L (Sens 78.3%, Spec 93.8%, PPV 90.0%, NPV 85.7%); ADA > 61U/L   (Sens 78.3%, Spec 96.9%, PPV 94.7%, NPV 86.1%) and α2M > 958 mg/L   (Sens 47.8%, Spec 96.9%, PPV 91.7%, NPV 72.1%).</p><p>The addition of a raised level of CRP or ADA to the total leukocyte   count increased the specificity: total leukocyte count > 1463 cells/μL   and CRP > 6.7mg/L (Sens 78.3%, Spec 100%, PPV 100%, NPV 86.5%) or   with ADA > 61U/L (Sens 78.3%, Spec 96.9%, PPV 94.7%, NPV 86.1%). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The total leucocyte count in the synovial fluid offers great   negative predictive value in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of PJI and the addition   of more specific markers such as CRP and ADA improves the positive   predictive value. Thus the addition of simple and inexpensive markers   to the measurement of the leucocyte count in the synovial fluid   may reduce the number of equivocal results which demand more expensive   investigation.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:351–7.</p></sec>

Long-Term Outcomes of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Diagnosed During Childhood
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Late survival and symptomatic status of children with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have not been well defined. We examined long-term outcomes for pediatric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The National Australian Childhood Cardiomyopathy Study is a longitudinal population-based cohort study of children (0–10 years of age) diagnosed with cardiomyopathy between 1987 and 1996. The primary study end point was time to death or cardiac transplantation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>There were 80 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, with a median age at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of 0.48 (interquartile range, 0.1, 2.5) years. Freedom from death/transplantation was 86% (95% confidence interval [CI], 77.0–92.0) 1 year after presentation, 80% (95% CI, 69.0–87.0) at 10 years, and 78% (95% CI, 67.0–86.0) at 20 years. From multivariable analyses, risk factors for death/transplantation included symmetrical left ventricular hypertrophy at the time of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s (hazard ratio, 4.20; 95% CI, 1.60–11.05; <i>P</i>=0.004), Noonan syndrome (hazard ratio, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.02–8.08; <i>P</i>=0.045), higher posterior wall thickness <i>z</i> score (hazard ratio, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.22–1.73; <i>P</i><0.001), and lower fractional shortening <i>z</i> score (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.74–0.95; <i>P</i>=0.005) during follow-up.

Atrial Fibrillation Burden in Young Patients With Congenital Heart Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) are assumed to be vulnerable to atrial fibrillation (AF) as a result of residual shunts, anomalous vessel anatomy, progressive valvulopathy, hypertension, and atrial scars from previous heart surgery. However, the risk of developing AF and the complications associated with AF in children and young adults with CHD have not been compared with those in control subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data from the Swedish Patient and Cause of Death registers were used to identify all patients with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of CHD who were born from 1970 to 1993. Each patient with CHD was matched by birth year, sex, and county with 10 control subjects from the Total Population Register in Sweden. Follow-up data were collected until 2011.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 21 982 patients (51.6% men) with CHD and 219 816 matched control subjects, 654 and 328 developed AF, respectively. The mean follow-up was 27 years. The risk of developing AF was 21.99 times higher (95% confidence interval, 19.26–25.12) in patients with CHD than control subjects. According to a hierarchical CHD classification, patients with conotruncal defects had the highest risk (hazard ratio, 84.27; 95% confidence interval, 56.86–124.89). At the age of 42 years, 8.3% of all patients with CHD had a recorded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of AF.

Assessment of Remote Heart Rhythm Sampling Using the AliveCor Heart Monitor to Screen for Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Asymptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF) is increasingly common in the aging population and implicated in many ischemic strokes. Earlier identification of AF with appropriate anticoagulation may decrease stroke morbidity and mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a randomized controlled trial of AF screening using an AliveCor Kardia monitor attached to a WiFi-enabled iPod to obtain ECGs (iECGs) in ambulatory patients. Patients ≥65 years of age with a CHADS-VASc score ≥2 free from AF were randomized to the iECG arm or routine care (RC). iECG participants acquired iECGs twice weekly over 12 months (plus additional iECGs if symptomatic) onto a secure study server with overread by an automated AF detection algorithm and by a cardiac physiologist and/or consultant cardiologist. Time to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of AF was the primary outcome measure. The overall cost of the devices, ECG interpretation, and patient management were captured and used to generate the cost per AF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s in iECG patients. Clinical events and patient attitudes/experience were also evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We studied 1001 patients (500 iECG, 501 RC) who were 72.6±5.4 years of age; 534 were female. Mean CHADS-VASc score was 3.0 (heart failure, 1.4%; hypertension, 54%; diabetes mellitus, 30%; prior stroke/transient ischemic attack, 6.5%; arterial disease, 15.9%; all CHADS-VASc risk factors were evenly distributed between groups). Nineteen patients in the iECG group were diagnosed with AF over the 12-month study period versus 5 in the RC arm (hazard ratio, 3.9; 95% confidence interval=1.4–10.4; <i>P</i>=0.007) at a cost per AF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of $10 780 (£8255). There was a similar number of stroke/transient ischemic attack/systemic embolic events (6 versus 10, iECG versus RC; hazard ratio=0.61; 95% confidence interval=0.22–1.69; <i>P</i>=0.34). The majority of iECG patients were satisfied with the device, finding it easy to use without restricting activities or causing anxiety.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Screening with twice-weekly single-lead iECG with remote interpretation in ambulatory patients ≥65 years of age at increased risk of stroke is significantly more likely to identify incident AF than RC over a 12-month period. This approach is also highly acceptable to this group of patients, supporting further evaluation in an appropriately powered, event-driven clinical trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.isrctn.com</ext-link>.

Its significance as a first symptom of occult cancer and as a prognostic factor for cancer survival is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using Danish medical databases, we conducted a nationwide cohort study of all patients with a first-time <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of pericarditis during 1994 to 2013. We excluded patients with previous cancer and followed up the remaining patients for subsequent cancer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s until November 30, 2013. We calculated risks and standardized incidence ratios of cancer for patients with pericarditis compared with the general population. We assessed whether pericarditis predicts cancer survival by the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression using a matched comparison cohort of cancer patients without pericarditis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 13 759 patients with acute pericarditis, 1550 subsequently were diagnosed with cancer during follow-up. The overall cancer standardized incidence ratio was 1.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4–1.5), driven predominantly by increased rates of lung, kidney, and bladder cancer, lymphoma, leukemia, and unspecified metastatic cancer. The <3-month cancer risk among patients with pericarditis was 2.7%, and the standardized incidence ratio was 12.4 (95% CI, 11.2–13.7). The 3- to <12-month standardized incidence ratio of cancer was 1.5 (95% CI, 1.2–1.7), subsequently decreasing to 1.1 (95% CI, 1.0–1.2). Three-month survival after the cancer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s was 80% and 86% among those with and without pericarditis, respectively, and the hazard ratio was 1.5 (95% CI, 1.3–1.8). One-year survival was 65% and 70%, respectively, corresponding to a 3- to <12-month hazard ratio of 1.3 (95% CI, 1.1–1.5).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Pericarditis may be a marker of occult cancer and augurs increased mortality after a cancer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s.</p></sec>

Age-Specific Trends in Incidence, Mortality, and Comorbidities of Heart Failure in Denmark, 1995 to 2012
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The cumulative burden and importance of cardiovascular risk factors have changed over the past decades. Specifically, obesity rates have increased among younger people, whereas cardiovascular health has improved in the elderly. Little is known regarding how these changes have impacted the incidence and the mortality rates of heart failure. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the age-specific trends in the incidence and 1-year mortality rates following a first-time <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of heart failure in Denmark between 1995 and 2012.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We included all Danish individuals >18 years of age with a first-time in-hospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of heart failure. Data were collected from 3 nationwide Danish registries. Annual incidence rates of heart failure and 1-year standardized mortality rates were calculated under the assumption of a Poisson distribution.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified 210 430 individuals with a first-time <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of heart failure between 1995 and 2012; the annual incidence rates per 10 000 person-years declined among older individuals (rates in 1995 versus 2012: 164 versus 115 in individuals >74 years, 63 versus 35 in individuals 65–74 years, and 20 versus 17 in individuals 55–64 years; <i>P</i><0.0001 for all) but increased among the younger (0.4 versus 0.7 in individuals 18–34 years, 1.3 versus 2.0 in individuals 35–44 years, and 5.0 versus 6.4 in individuals 45–54 years; <i>P</i><0.0001 for all). The proportion of patients with incident heart failure ≤50 years of age doubled from 3% in 1995 to 6% in 2012 (<i>P</i><0.0001). Sex- and age-adjusted incidence rate ratios for 2012 versus 1996 were 0.69 (95% confidence interval, 0.67–0.71; <i>P</i><0.0001) among people >50 years of age, and 1.52 (95% confidence interval, 1.33–1.73; <i>P</i><0.0001) among individuals ≤50 years of age; it remained essentially unchanged on additional adjustment for diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, and hypertension. Standardized 1-year mortality rates declined for middle-aged patients with heart failure but remained constant for younger (<45 years) and elderly (≥65 years) patients. The prevalence of comorbidities (including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation) increased, especially in younger patients with heart failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Over the past 2 decades, the incidence of heart failure in Denmark declined among older individuals (>50 years), but increased among younger (≤50 years) individuals. These observations may portend a rising burden of heart failure in the community.</p></sec>

An ingestible bacterial-electronic system to monitor gastrointestinal health
<p>Biomolecular monitoring in the gastrointestinal tract could offer rapid, precise disease detection and management but is impeded by access to the remote and complex environment. Here, we present an ingestible micro-bio-electronic device (IMBED) for in situ biomolecular detection based on environmentally resilient biosensor bacteria and miniaturized luminescence readout electronics that wirelessly communicate with an external device. As a proof of concept, we engineer heme-sensitive probiotic biosensors and demonstrate accurate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of gastrointestinal bleeding in swine. Additionally, we integrate alternative biosensors to demonstrate modularity and extensibility of the detection platform. IMBEDs enable new opportunities for gastrointestinal biomarker discovery and could transform the management and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of gastrointestinal disease.</p>

An anatomic transcriptional atlas of human glioblastoma
<p>Glioblastoma is an aggressive brain tumor that carries a poor prognosis. The tumor’s molecular and cellular landscapes are complex, and their relationships to histologic features routinely used for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s are unclear. We present the Ivy Glioblastoma Atlas, an anatomically based transcriptional atlas of human glioblastoma that aligns individual histologic features with genomic alterations and gene expression patterns, thus assigning molecular information to the most important morphologic hallmarks of the tumor. The atlas and its clinical and genomic database are freely accessible online data resources that will serve as a valuable platform for future investigations of glioblastoma pathogenesis, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s, and treatment.</p>

Genetic identification of familial hypercholesterolemia within a single U.S. health care system
<p>Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) remains underdiagnosed despite widespread cholesterol screening. Exome sequencing and electronic health record (EHR) data of 50,726 individuals were used to assess the prevalence and clinical impact of FH-associated genomic variants in the Geisinger Health System. The estimated FH prevalence was 1:256 in unselected participants and 1:118 in participants ascertained via the cardiac catheterization laboratory. FH variant carriers had significantly increased risk of coronary artery disease. Only 24% of carriers met EHR-based presequencing criteria for probable or definite FH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s. Active statin use was identified in 58% of carriers; 46% of statin-treated carriers had a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level below 100 mg/dl. Thus, we find that genomic screening can prompt the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of FH patients, most of whom are receiving inadequate lipid-lowering therapy.</p>

Late presentation of developmental dysplasia of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Despite the presence of screening programmes, infants continue   to present with late developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), the   impact of which is significant. The aim of this study was to assess   infants with late presenting dislocation of the hip despite universal   clinical neonatal and selective ultrasound screening.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 01 January 1997 to 31 December 2011, a prospective, longitudinal   study was undertaken of a cohort of 64 670 live births. Late presenting   dislocation was defined as presentation after three months of age.   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s was confirmed by ultrasound and plain radiography. Patient   demographics, referral type, reason for referral, risk factors (breech   presentation/strong family history) and clinical and radiological   findings were recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were 31 infants with an irreducible dislocation of the   hip, an incidence of 0.48   (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34 to 0.68) per 1000 live births.   Of these, 18 (0.28 (95% CI 0.17 to 0.44) per 1000 live births; 58%)   presented late. All infants had a documented normal newborn clinical   examination and no abnormality reported in the six to eight week   check. Of the 18 late presenting cases 72% (n = 13) had no risk   factors: 16 were referred by GPs and two were late due to administrative   issues (missed appointments). The mean time to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s was 62.4   weeks (19 to 84).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Despite universal clinical neonatal and selective ultrasound   screening, late cases of irreducible hip dislocation still occur.   We recommend an update of the national screening programme for DDH,   a review of training and education of healthcare professionals involved   in the physical examination of neonates and infants, and the addition   of a further assessment after the six to eight week check.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1250–5.</p></sec>

Qualitative α-defensin test (Synovasure) for the diagnosis of periprosthetic infection in revision total joint arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) remains   demanding due to limitations of all the available diagnostic tests.   The synovial fluid marker, α-defensin, is a promising adjunct for   the assessment of potential PJI. The purpose of this study was to   investigate the qualitative assessment of α-defensin, using Synovasure   to detect or exclude periprosthetic infection in total joint arthroplasty.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We studied 50 patients (28 women, 22 men, mean age 65 years;   20 to 89) with a clinical indication for revision arthroplasty who   met the inclusion criteria of this prospective diagnostic study.   The presence of α-defensin was determined using the qualitative   Synovasure test and compared with standard diagnostic methods for   PJI. Based on modified Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS)   criteria, 13 cases were categorised as septic and 36 as aseptic revisions.

Delays in the diagnosis and treatment of bone and joint tuberculosis in the United Kingdom
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Tuberculosis (TB) infection of bones and joints accounts for   6.7% of TB cases in England, and is associated with significant   morbidity and disability. Public Health England reports that patients   with TB experience delays in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s and treatment. Our aims were   to determine the demographics, presentation and investigation of   patients with a TB infection of bones and joints, to help doctors   assessing potential cases and to identify avoidable delays.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This was a retrospective observational study of all adults with   positive TB cultures on specimens taken at a tertiary orthopaedic   centre between June 2012 and May 2014. A laboratory information   system search identified the patients. The demographics, clinical presentation,   radiology, histopathology and key clinical dates were obtained from   medical records.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 31 adult patients were identified. Their median age   was 37 years (interquartile range (IQR): 29 to 53); 21 (68%) were   male; 89% were migrants. The main sites affected were joints (10,   32%), the spine (8, 26%) and long bones (6, 19%); 8 (26%) had multifocal   disease. The most common presenting symptoms were pain (29/31, 94%)   and swelling (26/28, 93%). ‘Typical’ symptoms of TB, such as fever,   sweats and weight loss, were uncommon. Patients waited a median   of seven months (IQR 3 to 13.5) between the onset of symptoms and referral   to the tertiary centre and 2.3 months (IQR 1.6 to 3.4.)) between   referral and starting treatment. Radiology suggested TB in 26 (84%),   but in seven patients (23%) the initial biopsy specimens were not   sent for mycobacterial culture, necessitating a second biopsy. Rapid   Polymerase Chain Reaction-based testing for TB using Xpert MTB/RIF   was performed in five patients; 4 (80%) tested positive for TB.   These patients had a reduced time between the diagnostic biopsy and   starting treatment than those whose samples were not tested (median   eight days <i>versus</i> 36 days, p = 0.016).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Patients with bone and joint TB experience delays in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s   and treatment, some of which are avoidable. Maintaining a high index   of clinical suspicion and sending specimens for mycobacterial culture   are crucial to avoid missing cases.

High-Sensitivity Cardiac Troponin and the Risk Stratification of Patients With Renal Impairment Presenting With Suspected Acute Coronary Syndrome
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>High-sensitivity cardiac troponin testing may improve the risk stratification and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of myocardial infarction, but concentrations can be challenging to interpret in patients with renal impairment, and the effectiveness of testing in this group is uncertain.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a prospective multicenter study of consecutive patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome, we evaluated the performance of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I in those with and without renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>). The negative predictive value and sensitivity of troponin concentrations below the risk stratification threshold (5 ng/L) at presentation were reported for a primary outcome of index type 1 myocardial infarction, or type 1 myocardial infarction or cardiac death at 30 days. The positive predictive value and specificity at the 99th centile diagnostic threshold (16 ng/L in women, 34 ng/L in men) was determined for index type 1 myocardial infarction. Subsequent type 1 myocardial infarction and cardiac death were reported at 1 year.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 4726 patients identified, 904 (19%) had renal impairment. Troponin concentrations <5 ng/L at presentation identified 17% of patients with renal impairment as low risk for the primary outcome (negative predictive value, 98.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 96.0%–99.7%; sensitivity 98.9%; 95%CI, 97.5%–99.9%), in comparison with 56% without renal impairment (<i>P</i><0.001) with similar performance (negative predictive value, 99.7%; 95% CI, 99.4%–99.9%; sensitivity 98.4%; 95% CI, 97.2%–99.4%). The positive predictive value and specificity at the 99th centile were lower in patients with renal impairment at 50.0% (95% CI, 45.2%–54.8%) and 70.9% (95% CI, 67.5%–74.2%), respectively, in comparison with 62.4% (95% CI, 58.8%–65.9%) and 92.1% (95% CI, 91.2%–93.0%) in those without. At 1 year, patients with troponin concentrations >99th centile and renal impairment were at greater risk of subsequent myocardial infarction or cardiac death than those with normal renal function (24% versus 10%; adjusted hazard ratio, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.54–3.11).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In suspected acute coronary syndrome, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin identified fewer patients with renal impairment as low risk and more as high risk, but with lower specificity for type 1 myocardial infarction. Irrespective of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s, patients with renal impairment and elevated cardiac troponin concentrations had a 2-fold greater risk of a major cardiac event than those with normal renal function, and should be considered for further investigation and treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Diagnostic Accuracy of the Aortic Dissection Detection Risk Score Plus D-Dimer for Acute Aortic Syndromes
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Acute aortic syndromes (AASs) are rare and severe cardiovascular emergencies with unspecific symptoms. For AASs, both mis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s and overtesting are key concerns, and standardized diagnostic strategies may help physicians to balance these risks. D-dimer (DD) is highly sensitive for AAS but is inadequate as a stand-alone test. Integration of pretest probability assessment with DD testing is feasible, but the safety and efficiency of such a diagnostic strategy are currently unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a multicenter prospective observational study involving 6 hospitals in 4 countries from 2014 to 2016, consecutive outpatients were eligible if they had ≥1 of the following: chest/abdominal/back pain, syncope, perfusion deficit, and if AAS was in the differential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s. The tool for pretest probability assessment was the aortic dissection detection risk score (ADD-RS, 0–3) per current guidelines. DD was considered negative (DD−) if <500 ng/mL. Final case adjudication was based on conclusive diagnostic imaging, autopsy, surgery, or 14-day follow-up. Outcomes were the failure rate and efficiency of a diagnostic strategy for ruling out AAS in patients with ADD-RS=0/DD− or ADD-RS ≤1/DD−.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 1850 patients were analyzed. Of these, 438 patients (24%) had ADD-RS=0, 1071 patients (58%) had ADD-RS=1, and 341 patients (18%) had ADD-RS >1. Two hundred forty-one patients (13%) had AAS: 125 had type A aortic dissection, 53 had type B aortic dissection, 35 had intramural aortic hematoma, 18 had aortic rupture, and 10 had penetrating aortic ulcer. A positive DD test result had an overall sensitivity of 96.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 93.6–98.6) and a specificity of 64% (95% CI, 61.6–66.4) for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of AAS; 8 patients with AAS had DD−. In 294 patients with ADD-RS=0/DD−, 1 case of AAS was observed. This yielded a failure rate of 0.3% (95% CI, 0.1–1.9) and an efficiency of 15.9% (95% CI, 14.3–17.6) for the ADD-RS=0/DD− strategy. In 924 patients with ADD-RS ≤1/DD−, 3 cases of AAS were observed.

Association of Statin Dose With Amputation and Survival in Patients With Peripheral Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Statin dose guidelines for patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) are largely based on coronary artery disease and stroke data. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of statin intensity on PAD outcomes of amputation and mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using an observational cohort study design and a validated algorithm, we identified patients with incident PAD (2003–2014) in the national Veterans Affairs data. Highest statin intensity exposure (high-intensity versus low-to-moderate–intensity versus antiplatelet therapy but no statin use) was determined within 1 year of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of PAD. Outcomes of interest were lower extremity amputations and death. The association of statin intensity with incident amputation and mortality was assessed with Kaplan-Meier plots, Cox proportional hazards modeling, propensity score–matched analysis, and sensitivity and subgroup analyses, as well, to reduce confounding.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In 155 647 patients with incident PAD, more than a quarter (28%) were not on statins. Use of high-intensity statins was lowest in patients with PAD only (6.4%) in comparison with comorbid coronary/carotid disease (18.4%). Incident amputation and mortality risk declined significantly with any statin use in comparison with the antiplatelet therapy–only group. In adjusted Cox models, the high-intensity statin users were associated with lower amputation risk and mortality in comparison with antiplatelet therapy–only users (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.61–0.74 and hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.70–0.77, respectively). Low-to-moderate–intensity statins also had significant reductions in the risk of amputation and mortality (hazard ratio amputation, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.75– 0.86; hazard ratio death, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.81–0.86) in comparison with no statins (antiplatelet therapy only), but effect size was significantly weaker than the high-intensity statins (<i>P</i><0.001).

Long-Term Outcomes and Prognostic Factors of Complications in Takayasu Arteritis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Because of the wide variation in the course of Takayasu arteritis (TA), predicting outcome is challenging. We assess long-term outcome and prognosis factors for vascular complications in patients with TA.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A retrospective multicenter study of characteristics and outcomes of 318 patients with TA fulfilling American College of Rheumatology and Ishikawa criteria was analyzed. Factors associated with event-free survival, relapse-free survival, and incidences of vascular complications were assessed. Risk factors for vascular complications were identified in a multivariable model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The median age at TA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s was 36 [25–47] years, and 276 patients (86.8%) were women. After a median follow-up of 6.1 years, relapses were observed in 43%, vascular complications in 38%, and death in 5%. Progressive clinical course was observed in 45%, carotidodynia in 10%, and retinopathy in 4%. The 5- and 10-year event-free survival, relapse-free survival, and complication-free survival were 48.2% (42.2; 54.9) and 36.4% (30.3; 43.9), 58.6% (52.7; 65.1) and 47.7% (41.2; 55.1), and 69.9% (64.3; 76.0) and 53.7% (46.8; 61.7), respectively. Progressive disease course (<i>P</i>=0.018) and carotidynia (<i>P</i>=0.036) were independently associated with event-free survival. Male sex (<i>P</i>=0.048), elevated C-reactive protein (<i>P</i>=0.013), and carotidynia (<i>P</i>=0.003) were associated with relapse-free survival. Progressive disease course (<i>P</i>=0.017), thoracic aorta involvement (<i>P</i>=0.009), and retinopathy (<i>P</i>=0.002) were associated with complication-free survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This nationwide study shows that 50% of patients with TA will relapse and experience a vascular complication ≤10 years from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s. We identified specific characteristics that identified those at highest risk for subsequent vascular complications.</p></sec>

Role of Diastolic Stress Testing in the Evaluation for Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is challenging and relies largely on demonstration of elevated cardiac filling pressures (pulmonary capillary wedge pressure). Current guidelines recommend use of natriuretic peptides (N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide) and rest/exercise echocardiography (E/e′ ratio) to make this determination. Data to support this practice are conflicting.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Simultaneous echocardiographic-catheterization studies were prospectively conducted at rest and during exercise in subjects with invasively proven HFpEF (n=50) and participants with dyspnea but no identifiable cardiac pathology (n=24).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>N-Terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide levels were below the level considered to exclude disease (≤125 pg/mL) in 18% of subjects with HFpEF. E/e′ ratio was correlated with directly measured pulmonary capillary wedge pressure at rest (<i>r</i>=0.63, <i>P</i><0.0001) and during exercise (<i>r</i>=0.57, <i>P</i><0.0001). Although specific, current guidelines were poorly sensitive, identifying only 34% to 60% of subjects with invasively proven HFpEF on the basis of resting echocardiographic data alone. Addition of exercise echocardiographic data (E/e′ ratio>14) improved sensitivity (to 90%) and thus negative predictive value, but decreased specificity (71%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Currently proposed HFpEF diagnostic guidelines on the basis of resting data are poorly sensitive. Adding exercise E/e′ data improves sensitivity and negative predictive value but compromises specificity, suggesting that exercise echocardiography may help rule out HFpEF. These results question the accuracy of current approaches to exclude HFpEF on the basis of resting data alone and reinforce the value of exercise testing using invasive and noninvasive hemodynamic assessments to definitively confirm or refute the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of HFpEF.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Direct Comparison of 4 Very Early Rule-Out Strategies for Acute Myocardial Infarction Using High-Sensitivity Cardiac Troponin I
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Four strategies for very early rule-out of acute myocardial infarction using high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) have been identified. It remains unclear which strategy is most attractive for clinical application.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We prospectively enrolled unselected patients presenting to the emergency department with symptoms suggestive of acute myocardial infarction. The final <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s was adjudicated by 2 independent cardiologists. Hs-cTnI levels were measured at presentation and after 1 hour in a blinded fashion. We directly compared all 4 hs-cTnI–based rule-out strategies: limit of detection (LOD, hs-cTnI<2 ng/L), single cutoff (hs-cTnI<5 ng/L), 1-hour algorithm (hs-cTnI<5 ng/L and 1-hour change<2 ng/L), and the 0/1-hour algorithm recommended in the European Society of Cardiology guideline combining LOD and 1-hour algorithm.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 2828 enrolled patients, acute myocardial infarction was the final <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s in 451 (16%) patients. The LOD approach ruled out 453 patients (16%) with a sensitivity of 100% (95% confidence interval [CI], 99.2%–100%), the single cutoff 1516 patients (54%) with a sensitivity of 97.1% (95% CI, 95.1%–98.3%), the 1-hour algorithm 1459 patients (52%) with a sensitivity of 98.4% (95% CI, 96.8%–99.2%), and the 0/1-hour algorithm 1463 patients (52%) with a sensitivity of 98.4% (95% CI, 96.8%–99.2%). Predefined subgroup analysis in early presenters (≤2 hours) revealed significantly lower sensitivity (94.2%, interaction <i>P</i>=0.03) of the single cutoff, but not the other strategies. Two-year survival was 100% with LOD and 98.1% with the other strategies (<i>P</i><0.01 for LOD versus each of the other strategies).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>All 4 rule-out strategies balance effectiveness and safety equally well. The single cutoff should not be applied in early presenters, whereas the 3 other strategies seem to perform well in this challenging subgroup.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Risk of Cerebrovascular Events in 178 962 Five-Year Survivors of Cancer Diagnosed at 15 to 39 Years of Age
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Survivors of teenage and young adult cancer are at risk of cerebrovascular events, but the magnitude of and extent to which this risk varies by cancer type, decade of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s, age at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s, and attained age remains uncertain. This is the largest-ever cohort study to evaluate the risks of hospitalization for a cerebrovascular event among long-term survivors of teenage and young adult cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The population-based TYACSS (Teenage and Young Adult Cancer Survivor Study) (N=178,962) was linked to Hospital Episode Statistics data for England to investigate the risks of hospitalization for a cerebrovascular event among 5-year survivors of cancer diagnosed when 15 to 39 years of age. Observed numbers of first hospitalizations for cerebrovascular events were compared with that expected from the general population using standardized hospitalization ratios (SHRs) and absolute excess risks per 10 000 person-years. Cumulative incidence was calculated with death considered a competing risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, 2782 cancer survivors were hospitalized for a cerebrovascular event—40% higher than expected (SHR=1.4, 95% confidence interval, 1.3–1.4). Survivors of central nervous system (CNS) tumors (SHR=4.6, 95% confidence interval, 4.3–5.0), head and neck tumors (SHR=2.6, 95% confidence interval, 2.2–3.1), and leukemia (SHR=2.5, 95% confidence interval, 1.9–3.1) were at greatest risk. Males had significantly higher absolute excess risks than females (absolute excess risks =7 versus 3), especially among head and neck tumor survivors (absolute excess risks =30 versus 11). By 60 years of age, 9%, 6%, and 5% of CNS tumor, head and neck tumor, and leukemia survivors, respectively, had been hospitalized for a cerebrovascular event. Beyond 60 years of age, every year, 0.4% of CNS tumor survivors were hospitalized for a cerebral infarction (versus 0.1% expected), whereas at any age, every year, 0.2% of head and neck tumor survivors were hospitalized for a cerebral infarction (versus 0.06% expected).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Survivors of a CNS tumor, head and neck tumor, and leukemia are particularly at risk of hospitalization for a cerebrovascular event. The excess risk of cerebral infarction among CNS tumor survivors increases with attained age. For head and neck tumor survivors, this excess risk remains high across all ages. These groups of survivors, particularly males, should be considered for surveillance of cerebrovascular risk factors and potential pharmacological interventions for cerebral infarction prevention.</p></sec>

Severe Pulmonary Vein Stenosis Resulting From Ablation for Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The frequency of pulmonary vein stenosis (PVS) after ablation for atrial fibrillation has decreased, but it remains a highly morbid condition. Although treatment strategies including pulmonary vein dilation and stenting have been described, the long-term impacts of these interventions are unknown. We evaluated the presentation of severe PVS, and examined the risk for restenosis after intervention using either balloon angioplasty (BA) alone or BA with stenting.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This was a prospective, observational study of 124 patients with severe PVS evaluated between 2000 and 2014.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>All 124 patients were identified as having severe PVS by computed tomography in 219 veins. One hundred two patients (82%) were symptomatic at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s. The most common symptoms were dyspnea (67%), cough (45%), fatigue (45%), and decreased exercise tolerance (45%). Twenty-seven percent of patients experienced hemoptysis. Ninety-two veins were treated with BA, 86 were treated with stenting, and 41 veins were not treated. A 94% acute procedural success rate was observed and did not differ by initial management. Major procedural complications occurred in 4 of the 113 patients (3.5%) who underwent invasive assessment, and minor complications occurred in 15 patients (13.3%). Overall, 42% of veins developed restenosis including 27% of veins (n=23) treated with stenting and 57% of veins (n=52) treated with BA. The 3-year overall rate of restenosis was 37%, with 49% of BA-treated veins and 25% of stented veins developing restenosis (hazard ratio, 2.77; 95% confidence interval, 1.72–4.45; <i>P</i><0.001). After adjustment for age, CHA2DS2-VASc score, hypertension, and the time period of the study, there was still a significant difference in the risk of restenosis for BA versus stenting (hazard ratio, 2.46; 95% confidence interval, 1.47–4.12; <i>P</i><0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of PVS is challenging because of nonspecific symptoms and the need for dedicated pulmonary vein imaging. There is no difference in acute success by type of initial intervention; however, stenting significantly reduces the risk of subsequent pulmonary vein restenosis in comparison with BA.</p></sec>

Impact of Combat Deployment and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder on Newly Reported Coronary Heart Disease Among US Active Duty and Reserve Forces
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>The recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have exposed thousands of service members to intense stress, and as a result, many have developed posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The role of military deployment experiences and PTSD in coronary heart disease (CHD) is not well defined, especially in young US service members with recent combat exposure.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We conducted a prospective cohort study to investigate the relationships between wartime experiences, PTSD, and CHD. Current and former US military personnel from all service branches participating in the Millennium Cohort Study during 2001 to 2008 (n=60 025) were evaluated for newly self-reported CHD. Electronic medical record review for <i>International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification</i> codes for CHD was conducted among a subpopulation of active duty members (n=23 794). Logistic regression models examined the associations between combat experiences and PTSD with CHD with adjustment for established CHD risk factors. A total of 627 participants (1.0%) newly reported CHD over an average of 5.6 years of follow-up. Deployers with combat experiences had an increased odds of newly reporting CHD (odds ratio, 1.63; 95% confidence interval, 1.11–2.40) and having a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s code for new-onset CHD (odds ratio, 1.93; 95% confidence interval, 1.31–2.84) compared with noncombat deployers. Screening positive for PTSD symptoms was associated with self-reported CHD before but not after adjustment for depression and anxiety and was not associated with a new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s code for CHD.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Combat deployments are associated with new-onset CHD among young US service members and veterans. Experiences of intense stress may increase the risk for CHD over a relatively short period among young adults.</p></sec>

Do higher-volume hospitals provide better value in revision hip and knee arthroplasty?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The purpose of this study is to determine if higher volume hospitals   have lower costs in revision hip and knee arthroplasty.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We questioned the Centres for Medicare and Medicaid Services   (CMS) Inpatient Charge Data and identified 789 hospitals performing   a total of 29 580 revision arthroplasties in 2014. Centres were   dichotomised into high-volume (performing over 50 revision cases   per year) and low-volume. Mean total hospital-specific charges and   inpatient payments were obtained from the database and stratified   based on Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) codes. Patient satisfaction   scores were obtained from the multiyear CMS Hospital Compare database.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>High-volume hospitals comprised 178 (30%) of the total but performed   15 068 (51%) of all revision cases, including 509 of 522 (98%) of   the most complex DRG 466 cases. While high-volume hospitals had   higher Medicare inpatient payments for DRG 467 ($21 458 <i>versus</i> $20 632,   p = 0.038) and DRG 468 ($17 003 <i>versus</i> $16 120,   p = 0.011), there was no difference in hospital specific charges   between the groups. Higher-volume facilities had a better CMS hospital   star rating (3.63 <i>versus</i> 3.35, p < 0.001). When   controlling for hospital geographic and demographic factors, high-volume   revision hospitals are less likely to be in the upper quartile of   inpatient Medicare costs for DRG 467 (odds ratio (OR) 0.593, 95%   confidence intervals (CI) 0.374 to 0.941, p = 0.026) and DRG 468   (OR 0.451, 95% CI 0.297 to 0.687, p < 0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>While a high-volume hospital is less likely to be a high cost   outlier, the higher mean Medicare reimbursements at these facilities   may be due to increased case complexity.

The analysis of synovial fluid in total knee arthroplasties with flexion instability
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Patients with flexion instability after total knee arthroplasty   (TKA) often present with a recurrent effusion, which may be a haemarthrosis.   While the radiographic factors contributing to flexion instability   have been elucidated, the clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s remains challenging.   Our aim, in this study, was to determine the mean white cell count   and differential profile in pre-operative aspirations of synovial   fluid in a consecutive series of patients undergoing revision TKA   for flexion instability.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 2000 and 2010, 60 patients undergoing aseptic revision   TKA for flexion instability were identified. The results of the   pre-operative aspiration of synovial fluid were available for 53   patients (88%). These patients were 1:2 matched to 106 patients   who underwent aseptic TKA for indications other than flexion instability.   The mean age of the patients at revision TKA was 65 years (44 to   82) and 55% were women. The mean follow-up was 4.3 years (2 to 10.2).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In the flexion instability group, the median total cell count   was 312 cells/µL (interquartile range (IQR) 104 to 624), with a   mean distribution of 45% macrophages (2% to 90%), 30% lymphocytes   (1% to 69%), 18% neutrophils (0% to 80%), 0.5% eosinophils (0% to   6%) and 7% other cells (0% to 42%; mainly synovial cells).

The use of ultra-low-dose CT scans for the evaluation of limb fractures
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To evaluate whether an ultra-low-dose CT protocol can diagnose   selected limb fractures as well as conventional CT (C-CT).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We prospectively studied 40 consecutive patients with a limb   fracture in whom a CT scan was indicated. These were scanned using   an ultra-low-dose CT Reduced Effective Dose Using Computed Tomography   In Orthopaedic Injury (REDUCTION) protocol. Studies from 16 selected   cases were compared with 16 C-CT scans matched for age, gender and   type of fracture. Studies were assessed for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s and image   quality. Descriptive and reliability statistics were calculated.   The total effective radiation dose for each scanned site was compared.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean estimated effective dose (ED) for the REDUCTION protocol   was 0.03 milliSieverts (mSv) and 0.43 mSv (p < 0.005) for C-CT.   The sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value   (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the REDUCTION protocol   to detect fractures were 0.98, 0.89, 0.98 and 0.89 respectively   when two occult fractures were excluded. Inter- and intra-observer   reliability for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s using the REDUCTION protocol (κ = 0.75, κ =   0.71) were similar to those of C-CT (κ = 0.85, κ = 0.82).

Reconstruction of the hip after resection of periacetabular oncological lesions
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Reconstruction of the acetabulum after resection of a periacetabular   malignancy is technically challenging and many different techniques   have been used with varying success. Our aim was to prepare a systematic   review of the literature dealing with these techniques in order   to clarify the management, the rate of complications and the outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A search of PubMed and MEDLINE was conducted for English language   articles published between January 1990 and February 2017 with combinations   of key search terms to identify studies dealing with periacetabular   resection with reconstruction in patients with a malignancy. Studies   in English that reported radiographic or clinical outcomes were   included. Data collected from each study included: the number and   type of reconstructions, the pathological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of the lesions,   the mean age and follow-up, gender distribution, implant survivorship, complications,   functional outcome, and mortality. The results from individual studies   were combined for the general analysis, and then grouped according   to the type of reconstruction. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 57 studies met the inclusion criteria and included   1700 patients. Most lesions were metastatic (41%), followed by chondrosarcoma   (29%), osteosarcoma (10%), Ewing’s sarcoma (7%), and multiple myeloma   (2%). The techniques of reconstruction were divided into seven types   for analysis: those involving a Harrington reconstruction, a saddle   prosthesis, an allograft and allograft prosthesis composite, a pasteurised   autograft, a porous tantalum implant, a custom-made prosthesis and   a modular hemipelvic reconstruction. The rate of complications was   50%, with infection (14%) and instability (8%) being the most common.   Mortality data were available for 1427 patients (84%); 50% had died   of disease progression, 23% were alive with disease, and 27% had no   evidence of disease at a mean follow-up of 3.4 years (0 to 34). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Both the rate of complications and mortality are high following   resection of oncological periacetabular lesions and reconstruction.

A new mouse model of Canavan leukodystrophy displays hearing impairment due to central nervous system dysmyelination
<p>Canavan disease is a leukodystrophy caused by mutations in the <i>ASPA</i> gene. This gene encodes the enzyme that converts N-acetylaspartate into acetate and aspartic acid. In Canavan disease, spongiform encephalopathy of the brain causes progressive mental retardation, motor deficit and death. We have isolated a mouse with a novel ethylnitrosourea-induced mutation in <i>Aspa</i>. This mutant, named <i>deaf14</i>, carries a c.516T>A mutation that is predicted to cause a p.Y172X protein truncation. No full-length ASPA protein is produced in <i>deaf14</i> brain and there is extensive spongy degeneration. Interestingly, we found that <i>deaf14</i> mice have an attenuated startle in response to loud noise. The first auditory brainstem response peak has normal latency and amplitude but peaks II, III, IV and V have increased latency and decreased amplitude in <i>deaf14</i> mice. Our work reveals a hitherto unappreciated pathology in a mouse model of Canavan disease, implying that auditory brainstem response testing could be used in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s and to monitor the progression of this disease.</p>

Prognostic Value of Follow-Up Hemodynamic Variables After Initial Management in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Hemodynamic variables such as cardiac index and right atrial pressure have consistently been associated with survival in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) at the time of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s. Recent studies have suggested that pulmonary arterial compliance may also predict prognosis in PAH. The prognostic importance of hemodynamic values achieved after treatment initiation is less well established.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Our objective was to evaluate the prognostic importance of clinical and hemodynamic variables during follow-up, including pulmonary arterial compliance, after initial management in PAH. We evaluated incident patients with idiopathic, drug- and toxin-induced, or heritable PAH enrolled in the French pulmonary hypertension registry between 2006 and 2016 who had a follow-up right-sided heart catheterization (RHC). The primary outcome was death or lung transplantation. We used stepwise Cox regression and the Kaplan-Meier method to assess variables obtained at baseline and at first follow-up RHC.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 981 patients, a primary outcome occurred in 331 patients (33.7%) over a median follow-up duration of 2.8 years (interquartile range, 1.1–4.6 years). In a multivariable model considering only baseline variables, no hemodynamic variables independently predicted prognosis. Median time to first follow-up RHC was 4.6 months (interquartile range, 3.7–7.8 months). At first follow-up RHC (n=763), New York Heart Association functional class, 6-minute walk distance, stroke volume index (SVI), and right atrial pressure were independently associated with death or lung transplantation, adjusted for age, sex, and type of PAH. Pulmonary arterial compliance did not independently predict outcomes at baseline or during follow-up. The adjusted hazard ratio for SVI was 1.28 (95% confidence interval, 1.11–1.49; <i>P</i><0.01) per 10-mL/m<sup>2</sup> decrease and for right atrial pressure was 1.05 (95% confidence interval, 1.02–1.09; <i>P</i><0.01) per 1–mm Hg increase. Among patients who had 2 (n=355) or 3 (n=193) low-risk prognostic features at follow-up, including a cardiac index ≥2.5 L·min<sup>−1</sup>·m<sup>−2</sup>, 6-minute walk distance >440 m, and New York Heart Association class I or II functional class, lower SVI was still associated with higher rates of death or lung transplantation (<i>P</i><0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>SVI and right atrial pressure were the hemodynamic variables that were independently associated with death or lung transplantation at first follow-up RHC after initial PAH treatment. These findings suggest that the SVI could be a more appropriate treatment target than cardiac index in PAH.</p></sec>

0/1-Hour Triage Algorithm for Myocardial Infarction in Patients With Renal Dysfunction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The European Society of Cardiology recommends a 0/1-hour algorithm for rapid rule-out and rule-in of non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction using high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) concentrations irrespective of renal function. Because patients with renal dysfunction (RD) frequently present with increased hs-cTn concentrations even in the absence of non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, concern has been raised regarding the performance of the 0/1-hour algorithm in RD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a prospective multicenter diagnostic study enrolling unselected patients presenting with suspected non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction to the emergency department, we assessed the diagnostic performance of the European Society of Cardiology 0/1-hour algorithm using hs-cTnT and hs-cTnI in patients with RD, defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, and compared it to patients with normal renal function. The final <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s was centrally adjudicated by 2 independent cardiologists using all available information, including cardiac imaging. Safety was quantified as sensitivity in the rule-out zone, accuracy as the specificity in the rule-in zone, and efficacy as the proportion of the overall cohort assigned to either rule-out or rule-in based on the 0- and 1-hour sample.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 3254 patients, RD was present in 487 patients (15%). The prevalence of non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction was substantially higher in patients with RD compared with patients with normal renal function (31% versus 13%, <i>P</i><0.001). Using hs-cTnT, patients with RD had comparable sensitivity of rule-out (100.0% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 97.6–100.0] versus 99.2% [95% CI, 97.6–99.8]; <i>P</i>=0.559), lower specificity of rule-in (88.7% [95% CI, 84.8–91.9] versus 96.5% [95% CI, 95.7–97.2]; <i>P</i><0.001), and lower overall efficacy (51% versus 81%, <i>P</i><0.001), mainly driven by a much lower percentage of patients eligible for rule-out (18% versus 68%, <i>P</i><0.001) compared with patients with normal renal function. Using hs-cTnI, patients with RD had comparable sensitivity of rule-out (98.6% [95% CI, 95.0–99.8] versus 98.5% [95% CI, 96.5–99.5]; <i>P</i>=1.0), lower specificity of rule-in (84.4% [95% CI, 79.9–88.3] versus 91.7% [95% CI, 90.5–92.9]; <i>P</i><0.001), and lower overall efficacy (54% versus 76%, <i>P</i><0.001; proportion ruled out, 18% versus 58%, <i>P</i><0.001) compared with patients with normal renal function.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In patients with RD, the safety of the European Society of Cardiology 0/1-hour algorithm is high, but specificity of rule-in and overall efficacy are decreased. Modifications of the rule-in and rule-out thresholds did not improve the safety or overall efficacy of the 0/1-hour algorithm.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Empagliflozin and Clinical Outcomes in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Established Cardiovascular Disease, and Chronic Kidney Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial (Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients). Urinary glucose excretion with empagliflozin decreases with declining renal function, resulting in less potency for glucose lowering in patients with kidney disease. We investigated the effects of empagliflozin on clinical outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, established cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, established cardiovascular disease, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥30 mL·min<sup>−1</sup>·1.73 m<sup>−2</sup> at screening were randomized to receive empagliflozin 10 mg, empagliflozin 25 mg, or placebo once daily in addition to standard of care. We analyzed cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure, all-cause hospitalization, and all-cause mortality in patients with prevalent kidney disease (defined as eGFR <60 mL·min<sup>−1</sup>·1.73 m<sup>−2</sup> and/or urine albumin-creatinine ratio >300 mg/g) at baseline. Additional analyses were performed in subgroups by baseline eGFR (<45, 45–<60, 60–<90, ≥90 mL·min<sup>−1</sup>·1.73 m<sup>−2</sup>) and baseline urine albumin-creatinine ratio (>300, 30–≤300, <30 mg/g).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 7020 patients treated, 2250 patients had prevalent kidney disease at baseline, of whom 67% had a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of type 2 diabetes mellitus for >10 years, 58% were receiving insulin, and 84% were taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. In patients with prevalent kidney disease at baseline, empagliflozin reduced the risk of cardiovascular death by 29% compared with placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52–0.98), the risk of all-cause mortality by 24% (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.59–0.99), the risk of hospitalization for heart failure by 39% (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.42–0.87), and the risk of all-cause hospitalization by 19% (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.72–0.92). Effects of empagliflozin on these outcomes were consistent across categories of eGFR and urine albumin-creatinine ratio at baseline and across the 2 doses studied.

Risk of Dementia in Adults With Congenital Heart Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>More children with congenital heart disease (CHD) are surviving to adulthood, and CHD is associated with risk factors for dementia. We compared the risk of dementia in CHD adults to that of the general population.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In this cohort study, we used medical registries and a medical record review covering all Danish hospitals to identify adults with CHD diagnosed between 1963 and 2012. These individuals with CHD were followed from January 1, 1981, 30 years of age, or date of first CHD registration (index date for matched members of the general population cohort) until hospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of dementia, death, emigration, or end of study (December 31, 2012). For each individual with CHD, we identified 10 members of the general population utilizing the Danish Civil Registration System matched on sex and birth year. We computed cumulative incidences and hazard ratios (HRs) of dementia, adjusting for sex and birth year.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The cumulative incidence of dementia was 4% by 80 years of age in 10 632 adults with CHD (46% male). The overall HR comparing adults with CHD with the general population cohort was 1.6 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3−2.0). The HR among individuals with CHD without extracardiac defects was 1.4 (95% CI, 1.1−1.8). Adults with mild-to-moderate CHD had an HR of 1.5 (95% CI, 1.1−2.0), whereas the HR was 2.0 (95% CI, 1.2−3.3) for severe CHD, including univentricular hearts. The HR for early onset dementia (<65 years of age) was 2.6 (95% CI, 1.8−3.8), whereas the late-onset HR was 1.3 (95% CI, 1.0−1.8).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>CHD was associated with an increased risk of dementia compared with the general population, in particular for early onset dementia. Further understanding of dementia risk in the population with CHD is a potential target for future investigation.</p></sec>

Sex and Race Differences in Lifetime Risk of Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction and Heart Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Lifetime risk of heart failure has been estimated to range from 20% to 46% in diverse sex and race groups. However, lifetime risk estimates for the 2 HF phenotypes, HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), are not known.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Participant-level data from 2 large prospective cohort studies, the CHS (Cardiovascular Health Study) and MESA (Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis), were pooled, excluding individuals with prevalent HF at baseline. Remaining lifetime risk estimates for HFpEF (EF ≥45%) and HFrEF (EF <45%) were determined at different index ages with the use of a modified Kaplan-Meier method with mortality and the other HF subtype as competing risks.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We included 12 417 participants >45 years of age (22.2% blacks, 44.8% men) who were followed up for median duration of 11.6 years with 2178 overall incident HF events with 561 HFrEF events and 726 HFpEF events. At the index age of 45 years, the lifetime risk for any HF through 90 years of age was higher in men than women (27.4% versus 23.8%). Among HF subtypes, the lifetime risk for HFrEF was higher in men than women (10.6% versus 5.8%). In contrast, the lifetime risk for HFpEF was similar in men and women. In race-stratified analyses, lifetime risk for overall HF was higher in nonblacks than blacks (25.9% versus 22.4%). Among HF subtypes, the lifetime risk for HFpEF was higher in nonblacks than blacks (11.2% versus 7.7%), whereas that for HFrEF was similar across the 2 groups. Among participants with antecedent myocardial infarction before HF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s, the remaining lifetime risks for HFpEF and HFrEF were up to 2.5-fold and 4-fold higher, respectively, compared with those without antecedent myocardial infarction.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Lifetime risks for HFpEF and HFrEF vary by sex, race, and history of antecedent myocardial infarction. These insights into the distribution of HF risk and its subtypes could inform the development of targeted strategies to improve population-level HF prevention and control.</p></sec>

Exposure to Low-Dose Ionizing Radiation From Cardiac Procedures and Malignancy Risk in Adults With Congenital Heart Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Adults with congenital heart disease (CHD) are exposed to increasing amounts of low-dose ionizing radiation (LDIR) from cardiac procedures. Cancer prevalence in this population is higher than in the general population. This study estimates the association between LDIR exposure from cardiac procedures and incident cancer in adult patients with CHD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The study population derived from the Quebec Congenital Heart Disease Database. We measured cumulative numbers of LDIR-related cardiac procedures for each patient until 1 year before the time of cancer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s or administrative censoring. To assess the association between LDIR exposure and cancer risk, we conducted a nested case-control study and matched cancer cases with controls on sex, CHD severity, birth year, and age.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The study included 24 833 adult patients with CHD aged 18 to 64 years from 1995 to 2009. In >250 791 person-years of follow-up, 602 cancer cases were observed (median age, 55.4 years). The cumulative incidence of cancer estimated up to 64 years of age was 15.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 14.2–16.5). Cases had more LDIR-related cardiac procedures than controls (1410 versus 921 per 1000 adult patients with CHD, <i>P</i><0.0001). Cumulative LDIR exposure was independently associated with cancer (odds ratio [OR], 1.08 per procedure; 95% CI, 1.04–1.13). Similar results were obtained by using dose estimates for LDIR exposure (OR, 1.10 per 10 mSv; 95% CI, 1.05–1.15) with a possible dose-related response. The effect measure was in the same direction, and the association was persistent for exposure from ≥6 procedures in all sensitivity analyses: after excluding most smoking-related cancer cases (OR, 1.10 per procedure; 95% CI, 1.05–1.16 and OR when exposure from ≥6 procedures, 3.08; 95% CI, 1.77–5.37), and after applying a 3-year lag period (OR, 1.09 per procedure; 95% CI, 1.03–1.14 and OR when exposure from ≥6 procedures: 2.58; 95% CI, 1.43–4.69).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first large population-based study to analyze and document the association between LDIR-related cardiac procedures and incident cancer in the population of adults with CHD. Confirmations of these findings by prospective studies are needed to reinforce policy recommendations for radiation surveillance in patients with CHD where no regulation currently exists. Physicians ordering and performing cardiac imaging should ensure that exposure is as low as reasonably achievable without sacrificing quality of care.</p></sec>

Long-Term Outcomes in Patients With Type 2 Myocardial Infarction and Myocardial Injury
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury are common in clinical practice, but long-term consequences are uncertain. We aimed to define long-term outcomes and explore risk stratification in patients with type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We identified consecutive patients (n=2122) with elevated cardiac troponin I concentrations (≥0.05 µg/L) at a tertiary cardiac center. All diagnoses were adjudicated as per the universal definition of myocardial infarction. The primary outcome was all-cause death. Secondary outcomes included major adverse cardiovascular events (eg, nonfatal myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death) and noncardiovascular death. To explore competing risks, cause-specific hazard ratios were obtained using Cox regression models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The adjudicated index <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s was type 1 or 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury in 1171 (55.2%), 429 (20.2%), and 522 (24.6%) patients, respectively. At 5 years, all-cause death rates were higher in those with type 2 myocardial infarction (62.5%) or myocardial injury (72.4%) compared with type 1 myocardial infarction (36.7%). The majority of excess deaths in those with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury were because of noncardiovascular causes (hazard ratio, 2.32; 95% confidence interval, 1.92–2.81 versus type 1 myocardial infarction). Despite this finding, the observed crude major adverse cardiovascular event rates were similar between groups (30.6% versus 32.6%), with differences apparent after adjustment for covariates (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.69–0.96). Coronary heart disease was an independent predictor of major adverse cardiovascular events in those with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury (hazard ratio, 1.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.31–2.24).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Despite an excess in noncardiovascular death, patients with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury have a similar crude rate of major adverse cardiovascular events as those with type 1 myocardial infarction.

Perioperative Myocardial Injury After Noncardiac Surgery
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Perioperative myocardial injury (PMI) seems to be a contributor to mortality after noncardiac surgery. Because the vast majority of PMIs are asymptomatic, PMI usually is missed in the absence of systematic screening.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed a prospective diagnostic study enrolling consecutive patients undergoing noncardiac surgery who had a planned postoperative stay of ≥24 hours and were considered at increased cardiovascular risk. All patients received a systematic screening using serial measurements of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T in clinical routine. PMI was defined as an absolute high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T increase of ≥14 ng/L from preoperative to postoperative measurements. Furthermore, mortality was compared among patients with PMI not fulfilling additional criteria (ischemic symptoms, new ECG changes, or imaging evidence of loss of viable myocardium) required for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of spontaneous acute myocardial infarction versus those that did.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>From 2014 to 2015 we included 2018 consecutive patients undergoing 2546 surgeries. Patients had a median age of 74 years and 42% were women. PMI occurred after 397 of 2546 surgeries (16%; 95% confidence interval, 14%–17%) and was accompanied by typical chest pain in 24 of 397 patients (6%) and any ischemic symptoms in 72 of 397 (18%). Crude 30-day mortality was 8.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.7–12.0) in patients with PMI versus 1.5% (95% CI, 0.9–2.0) in patients without PMI (<i>P</i><0.001). Multivariable regression analysis showed an adjusted hazard ratio of 2.7 (95% CI, 1.5–4.8) for 30-day mortality. The difference was retained at 1 year with mortality rates of 22.5% (95% CI, 17.6–27.4) versus 9.3% (95% CI, 7.9–10.7). Thirty-day mortality was comparable among patients with PMI not fulfilling any other of the additional criteria required for spontaneous acute myocardial infarction (280/397, 71%) versus those with at least 1 additional criterion (10.4%; 95% CI, 6.7–15.7, versus 8.7%; 95% CI, 4.2–16.7; <i>P</i>=0.684).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>PMI is a common complication after noncardiac surgery and, despite early detection during routine clinical screening, is associated with substantial short- and long-term mortality.

Genetic and Functional Profiling of CD16-Dependent Natural Killer Activation Identifies Patients at Higher Risk of Cardiac Allograft Vasculopathy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac transplantation is an effective therapy for end-stage heart failure. Because cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the major cause of late mortality after heart transplant (HT), there is a need to identify markers that reflect inflammatory or cytotoxic immune mechanisms contributing to its onset. Noninvasive and early stratification of patients at risk remains a challenge for adapting individualized therapy. The CD16 (Fc-gamma receptor 3A [FCGR3A]) receptor was recently identified as a major determinant of antibody-mediated natural killer (NK) cell activation in HT biopsies; however, little is known about the role of CD16 in promoting allograft vasculopathy. This study aimed to investigate whether markers that reflect CD16-dependent circulating NK cell activation may identify patients at higher risk of developing CAV after HT.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Blood samples were collected from 103 patients undergoing routine coronarography angiography for CAV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s (median 5 years since HT). Genomic and phenotypic analyses of FCGR3A/CD16 Fc-receptor profiles were compared in CAV-positive (n=52) and CAV-free patients (n=51). The levels of CD16 expression and rituximab-dependent cell cytotoxic activity of peripheral NK cells in HT recipients were evaluated using a noninvasive NK-cellular humoral activation test.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Enhanced levels of CD16 expression and antibody-dependent NK cell cytotoxic function of HT recipients were associated with the FCGR3A-VV genotype. The frequency of the FCGR3A-VV genotype was significantly higher in the CAV<sup>+</sup> group (odds ratio, 3.9; <i>P</i>=0.0317) than in the CAV<sup>-</sup> group. The FCGR3A-VV genotype was identified as an independent marker correlated with the presence of CAV at the time of coronary angiography by using multivariate logistic regression models. The FCGR3A-VV genotype was also identified as a baseline-independent predictor of CAV risk (odds ratio, 4.7; <i>P</i>=0.023).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This study unravels a prominent role for the CD16-dependent NK cell activation pathway in the complex array of factors that favor the progression of transplant arteriosclerosis. It highlights the clinical potential of a noninvasive evaluation of FCGR3A/CD16 in the early stratification of CAV risk. The recognition of CD16 as a major checkpoint that controls immune surveillance may promote the design of individualized NK cell–targeted therapies to limit vascular damage in highly responsive sensitized patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Patients with giant-cell myocarditis, eosinophilic myocarditis, or cardiac sarcoidosis and those <15 years of age were excluded from the subanalysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In the whole population (n=187), the rate of in-hospital death or heart transplantation was 25.5% versus 0% in FM versus NFM, respectively (<i>P</i><0.0001). Long-term heart transplantation–free survival at 9 years was lower in FM than NFM (64.5% versus 100%, log-rank <i>P</i><0.0001). Despite greater improvement in LVEF during hospitalization in FM versus NFM forms (median, 32% [interquartile range, 20%–40%] versus 3% [0%–10%], respectively; <i>P</i><0.0001), the proportion of patients with LVEF <55% at last follow-up was higher in FM versus NFM (29% versus 9%; relative risk, 3.32; 95% confidence interval, 1.45–7.64, <i>P</i>=0.003). Similar results for survival and changes in LVEF in FM versus NFM were observed in the subgroup (n=130) with viral myocarditis. None of the patients with NFM and LVEF ≥55% at discharge had a significant decrease in LVEF at follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Patients with FM have an increased mortality and need for heart transplantation compared with those with NFM. From a functional viewpoint, patients with FM have a more severely impaired LVEF at admission that, despite steep improvement during hospitalization, remains lower than that in patients with NFM at long-term follow-up. These findings also hold true when only the viral forms are considered and are different from previous studies showing better prognosis in FM.</p></sec>

Thirty-Day Readmissions After Endovascular or Surgical Therapy for Critical Limb Ischemia
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Thirty-day readmission rates have gained increasing importance as a key quality metric. A significant number of patients are hospitalized for the management of critical limb ischemia (CLI), but limited data are available on the incidence, predictors, and causes of 30-day readmission after hospitalization for CLI.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Hospitalizations for a primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of CLI during which patients underwent endovascular or surgical therapy (revascularization and/or amputation) and were discharged alive were identified in the 2013 to 2014 Nationwide Readmissions Databases. Incidence, reasons, and costs of 30-day unplanned readmissions were determined. Hierarchical logistic regression models were used to identify independent predictors of 30-day readmissions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We included 60 998 (national estimate, 135 110) index CLI hospitalizations (mean age, 68.9±11.9 years; 40.8% women; 24.6% for rest pain, 37.2% for ulcer, and 38.2% for gangrene). The 30-day readmission rate was 20.4%. Presentation with ulcer or gangrene, age ≥65 years, female sex, large hospital size, teaching hospital status, known coronary artery disease, heart failure, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, anemia, coagulopathy, obesity, major bleeding, acute myocardial infarction, vascular complications, and sepsis were identified as independent predictors of 30-day readmission. Mode of revascularization was not independently associated with readmissions. Infections (23.5%), persistent or recurrent manifestations of peripheral artery disease (22.2%), cardiac conditions (11.4%), procedural complications (11.0%), and endocrine issues (5.7%) were the most common reasons for readmission. The inflation-adjusted aggregate costs of 30-day readmissions for CLI during the study period were $624 million.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Approximately 1 in 5 patients hospitalized for CLI and undergoing revascularization is readmitted within 30 days. Risk of readmission is influenced by CLI presentation, patient demographics, comorbidities, and in-hospital complications, but not by the mode of revascularization.</p></sec>

Sex Differences and Similarities in Atrial Fibrillation Epidemiology, Risk Factors, and Mortality in Community Cohorts
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac disease in aging populations with high comorbidity and mortality. Sex differences in AF epidemiology are insufficiently understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In N=79 793 individuals without AF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s at baseline (median age, 49.6 years; age range, 24.1–97.6 years; 51.7% women) from 4 community-based European studies (FINRISK, DanMONICA, Moli-sani Northern Sweden) of the BiomarCaRE consortium (Biomarker for Cardiovascular Risk Assessment in Europe), we examined AF incidence, its association with mortality, common risk factors, biomarkers, and prevalent cardiovascular disease, and their attributable risk by sex. Median follow-up time was 12.6 (to a maximum of 28.2) years.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Fewer AF cases were observed in women (N=1796; 4.4%), than in men (N=2465; 6.4%). Cardiovascular risk factor distribution and lipid profile at baseline were less beneficial in men than in women, and cardiovascular disease was more prevalent in men. Cumulative incidence increased markedly after the age of 50 years in men and after 60 years in women. The lifetime risk was similar (>30%) for both sexes. Subjects with incident AF had a 3.5-fold risk of death in comparison with those without AF. Multivariable-adjusted models showed sex differences for the association of body mass index and AF (hazard ratio per standard deviation increase, 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12–1.23 in women versus 1.31; 95% CI 1.25–1.38 in men; interaction <i>P</i> value of 0.001). Total cholesterol was inversely associated with incident AF with a greater risk reduction in women (hazard ratio per SD, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.81–0.90 versus 0.92; 95% CI, 0.88–0.97 in men; interaction <i>P</i> value of 0.023). No sex differences were seen for C-reactive protein and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide. The population-attributable risk of all risk factors combined was 41.9% in women and 46.0% in men. About 20% of the risk was observed for body mass index.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Lifetime risk of AF was high, and AF was strongly associated with increased mortality both in women and men. Body mass index explained the largest proportion of AF risk. Observed sex differences in the association of body mass index and total cholesterol with AF need to be evaluated for underlying pathophysiology and relevance to sex-specific prevention strategies.</p></sec>

Validity of Cardiovascular Data From Electronic Sources
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Understanding the validity of data from electronic data research networks is critical to national research initiatives and learning healthcare systems for cardiovascular care. Our goal was to evaluate the degree of agreement of electronic data research networks in comparison with data collected by standardized research approaches in a cohort study.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We linked individual-level data from MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis), a community-based cohort, with HealthLNK, a 2006 to 2012 database of electronic health records from 6 Chicago health systems. To evaluate the correlation and agreement of blood pressure in HealthLNK in comparison with in-person MESA examinations, and body mass index in HealthLNK in comparison with MESA, we used Pearson correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman plots. Using diagnoses in MESA as the criterion standard, we calculated the performance of HealthLNK for hypertension, obesity, and diabetes mellitus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s by using <i>International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision</i> codes and clinical data. We also identified potential myocardial infarctions, strokes, and heart failure events in HealthLNK and compared them with adjudicated events in MESA.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of the 1164 MESA participants enrolled at the Chicago Field Center, 802 (68.9%) participants had data in HealthLNK. The correlation was low for systolic blood pressure (0.39; <i>P</i><0.0001). In comparison with MESA, HealthLNK overestimated systolic blood pressure by 6.5 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, 4.2–7.8). There was a high correlation between body mass index in MESA and HealthLNK (0.94; <i>P</i><0.0001). HealthLNK underestimated body mass index by 0.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (95% confidence interval, –0.4 to –0.1). With the use of <i>International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision</i> codes and clinical data, the sensitivity and specificity of HealthLNK queries for hypertension were 82.4% and 59.4%, for obesity were 73.0% and 89.8%, and for diabetes mellitus were 79.8% and 93.3%. In comparison with adjudicated cardiovascular events in MESA, the concordance rates for myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure were, respectively, 41.7% (5/12), 61.5% (8/13), and 62.5% (10/16).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These findings illustrate the limitations and strengths of electronic data repositories in comparison with information collected by traditional standardized epidemiological approaches for the ascertainment of cardiovascular risk factors and events.</p></sec>

Risk Factors for Coarctation of the Aorta on Prenatal Ultrasound
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Prenatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of coarctation of the aorta (CoA) is still challenging and affected by high rates of false-positive diagnoses. The aim of this study was to ascertain the strength of association and to quantify the diagnostic accuracy of different ultrasound signs in predicting CoA prenatally.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases were searched. Random-effects and hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic model meta-analyses were used to analyze the data.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Seven hundred ninety-four articles were identified, and 12 (922 fetuses at risk for CoA) articles were included. Mean mitral valve diameter <i>z</i> score was lower (<i>P</i><0.001) and the mean tricuspid valve diameter <i>z</i> score was higher in fetuses with CoA than in those without CoA (<i>P</i>=0.01). Mean aortic valve diameter <i>z</i> score was lower in fetuses with CoA than in healthy fetuses (<i>P</i>≤0.001), but the ascending aorta diameter, expressed as <i>z</i> score or millimeters, was similar between groups (<i>P</i>=0.07 and 0.47, respectively). Mean aortic isthmus diameter <i>z</i> scores measured either in sagittal (<i>P</i>=0.02) or in 3-vessel trachea view (<i>P</i><0.001) were lower in fetuses with CoA. Conversely, the mean pulmonary artery diameter <i>z</i> score, the right/left ventricular and pulmonary artery/ascending aorta diameter ratios were higher (<i>P</i><0.001, <i>P</i>=0.02, and <i>P</i>=0.02, respectively) in fetuses with CoA in comparison with controls, although aortic isthmus/arterial duct diameter ratio was lower in fetuses with CoA than in those without CoA (<i>P</i><0.001). The presence of coarctation shelf and aortic arch hypoplasia were more common in fetuses with CoA than in controls (odds ratio, 26.0; 95% confidence interval, 4.42–153; <i>P</i><0.001 and odds ratio, 38.2; 95% confidence interval, 3.01–486; <i>P</i>=0.005), whereas persistent left superior vena cava (<i>P</i>=0.85), ventricular septal defect (<i>P</i>=0.12), and bicuspid aortic valve (<i>P</i>=0.14) did not carry an increased risk for this anomaly. Multiparametric diagnostic models integrating different ultrasound signs for the detection of CoA were associated with an increased detection rate.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The detection rate of CoA may improve when a multiple-criteria prediction model is adopted. Further large multicenter studies sharing the same imaging protocols are needed to develop objective models for risk assessment in these fetuses.</p></sec>

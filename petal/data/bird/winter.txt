Life history responses of meerkats to seasonal changes in extreme environments
<p>Species in extreme habitats increasingly face changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al climate, but the demographic mechanisms through which these changes affect population persistence remain unknown. We investigated how changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al rainfall and temperature influence vital rates and viability of an arid environment specialist, the Kalahari meerkat, through effects on body mass. We show that climate change–induced reduction in adult mass in the prebreeding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong> would decrease fecundity during the breeding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong> and increase extinction risk, particularly at low population densities. In contrast, a warmer nonbreeding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong> resulting in increased mass and survival would buffer negative effects of reduced rainfall during the breeding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>, ensuring persistence. Because most ecosystems undergo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al climate variations, a full understanding of species vulnerability to global change relies on linking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al trait and population dynamics.</p>

Genetic and phenotypically flexible components of seasonal variation in immune function
<p>Animals cope with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al variation in environmental factors by adjustments of physiology and life history. When <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al variation is partly predictable, such adjustments can be based on a genetic component or be phenotypically flexible. Animals have to allocate limited resources over different demands, including immune function. Accordingly, immune traits could change <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>ally, and such changes could have a genetic component that differs between environments. We tested this hypothesis in genotypically distinct groups of a widespread songbird, the stonechat (<i>Saxicola torquata</i>). We compared variation in immunity during 1 year in long-distance migrants, short-distance migrants, tropical residents and hybrids in a common garden environment. Additionally, we investigated phenotypically flexible responses to temperature by applying different temperature regimes to one group. We assessed constitutive immunity by measuring hemagglutination, hemolysis, haptoglobin and bactericidal ability against <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. Genotypic groups differed in patterns of variation of all measured immune indices except haptoglobin. Hybrids differed from, but were rarely intermediate to, parental subspecies. Temperature treatment only influenced patterns of hemolysis and bactericidal ability against <i>E. coli.</i> We conclude that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al variation in constitutive immunity has a genetic component, that heredity does not follow simple Mendelian rules, and that some immune measures are relatively rigid while others are more flexible. Furthermore, our results support the idea that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al variability in constitutive immunity is associated with variability in environment and annual-cycle demands. This study stresses the importance of considering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al variation in immune function in relation to the ecology and life history of the organism of interest.</p>

Impact of summer drought on isoprenoid emissions and carbon sink of three Scots pine provenances
<p>Scots pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i> L.) provenances cover broad ecological amplitudes. In a greenhouse study, we investigated the impact of drought stress and rewetting on gas exchange for three provenances (Italy: Emilia Romagna; Spain: Alto Ebro; Germany: East-German lowlands) of 2-year old Scots pine seedlings. CO<sub>2</sub>, water vapour and isoprenoid exchange of stressed and control trees were quantified with a four-chamber dynamic-enclosure system in the controlled environment of a climate chamber. The three provenances showed distinct isoprenoid emission patterns and were classified into a non-Δ<sup>3</sup>-carene, with either high α-/β-pinene or β-myrcene fraction, and a Δ<sup>3</sup>-carene dominated type. Isoprenoid emission rates, net-photosynthesis and transpiration were reduced during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">summer</span></strong> drought stress and significantly recovered after rewetting. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al increase of isoprenoid emission rates towards <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">autumn</span></strong> was observed for all control groups. Compared with the German provenance, the Spanish and Italian provenances revealed higher isoprenoid emission rates and more plastic responses to drought stress and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al development, which points to a local adaptation to climate. As a result of drought, net carbon uptake and transpiration of trees was reduced, but recovered after rewetting. We conclude from our study that Scots pine isoprenoid emission is more variable than expected and sensitive to drought periods, likely impacting regional air chemistry. Thus, a provenance-specific emission assessment accounting for reduced emission during prolonged (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">summer</span></strong>) drought is recommend for setting up biogenic volatile organic compound emission inventories used in air quality models.</p>

Differential radial growth patterns between beech (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i> L.) and oak (<i>Quercus robur</i> L.) on periodically waterlogged soils
<p>Climate scenarios for northern Central Europe project rising temperatures and increasing frequency and intensity of droughts but also a shift in precipitation pattern with more humid winters. This in turn may result in soil waterlogging during the following spring, leading to increasing stress for trees growing on hydric sites. The influence of waterlogging on growth of common beech and pedunculate oak has been studied intensively on seedlings under experimental conditions. However, the question remains whether results of these studies can be transferred to mature trees growing under natural conditions. To test this, we investigated general growth patterns and climate–growth relationships in four mature stands of beech and oak growing on hydromorphic soils (Stagnosols) in northeast Germany using dendrochronological methods. Our results confirmed the expected tolerance of oak to strong water-level fluctuations. Neither extremely wet conditions during spring nor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">summer</span></strong> droughts significantly affected its radial growth. Oak growth responded positively to warmer temperatures during previous year October and March of the current year of ring formation. Contrary to our expectations, also beech showed relatively low sensitivity to periods of high soil water saturation. Instead, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">summer</span></strong> drought turned out to be the main climatic factor influencing ring width of beech even under the specific periodically wet soil conditions of our study. This became evident from general climate–growth correlations over the last century as well as from discontinuous (pointer year) analysis with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">summer</span></strong> drought being significantly correlated to the occurrence of growth depressions. As ring width of the two species is affected by differing climate parameters, species-specific chronologies show no coherence in high-frequency variations even for trees growing in close proximity. We assume differences in rooting depth as the main reason for the differing growth patterns and climate correlations of the two species under study. Our results indicate that under the projected future climate scenarios, beech may suffer from increasing drought stress even on hydromorphic soils. Oak might be able to maintain a sufficient hydraulic status during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">summer</span></strong> droughts by reaching water in deeper soil strata with its root system. Wet phases with waterlogged soil conditions during spring or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">summer</span></strong> appear to have only a little direct influence on radial growth of both species.</p>

Transcriptional Roadmap to Seasonal Variation in Wood Formation of Norway Spruce
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al cues influence several aspects of the secondary growth of tree stems, including cambial activity, wood chemistry, and transition to latewood formation. We investigated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al changes in cambial activity, secondary cell wall formation, and tracheid cell death in woody tissues of Norway spruce (<i>Picea abies</i>) throughout one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al cycle. RNA sequencing was performed simultaneously in both the xylem and cambium/phloem tissues of the stem. Principal component analysis revealed gradual shifts in the transcriptomes that followed a chronological order throughout the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>. A notable remodeling of the transcriptome was observed in the winter, with many genes having maximal expression during the coldest months of the year. A highly coexpressed set of monolignol biosynthesis genes showed high expression during the period of secondary cell wall formation as well as a second peak in midwinter. This midwinter peak in expression did not trigger lignin deposition, as determined by pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Coexpression consensus network analyses suggested the involvement of transcription factors belonging to the ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2/LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES and MYELOBLASTOSIS-HOMEOBOX families in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al control of secondary cell wall formation of tracheids. Interestingly, the lifetime of the latewood tracheids stretched beyond the winter dormancy period, correlating with a lack of cell death-related gene expression. Our transcriptomic analyses combined with phylogenetic and microscopic analyses also identified the cellulose and lignin biosynthetic genes and putative regulators for latewood formation and tracheid cell death in Norway spruce, providing a toolbox for further physiological and functional assays of these important phase transitions.</p>

An increase in minimum metabolic rate and not activity explains field metabolic rate changes in a breeding seabird
<p>The field metabolic rate (FMR) of a free-ranging animal can be considered as the sum of its maintenance costs (minimum metabolic rate, MMR) and additional costs associated with thermoregulation, digestion, production and activity. However, the relationships between FMR and BMR and how they relate to behaviour and extrinsic influences is not clear. In seabirds, FMR has been shown to increase during the breeding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>. This is presumed to be the result of an increase in foraging activity, stimulated by increased food demands from growing chicks, but few studies have investigated in detail the factors that underlie these increases. We studied free-ranging Australasian gannets (<i>Morus serrator</i>) throughout their 5 month breeding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>, and evaluated FMR, MMR and activity-related metabolic costs on a daily basis using the heart rate method. In addition, we simultaneously recorded behaviour (flying and diving) in the same individuals. FMR increased steadily throughout the breeding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>, increasing by 11% from the incubation period to the long chick-brooding period. However, this was not accompanied by either an increase in flying or diving behaviour, or an increase in the energetic costs of activity. Instead, the changes in FMR could be explained exclusively by a progressive increase in MMR. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al changes in MMR could be due to a change in body composition or a decrease in body condition associated with changing the allocation of resources between provisioning adults and growing chicks. Our study highlights the importance of measuring physiological parameters continuously in free-ranging animals in order to understand fully the mechanisms underpinning <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al changes in physiology and behaviour.</p>

Temporal and spatial patterns of internal and external stem CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes in a sub-Mediterranean oak
<p>To accurately estimate stem respiration (<i>R</i><sub>S</sub>), measurements of both carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) efflux to the atmosphere (<i>E</i><sub>A</sub>) and internal CO<sub>2</sub> flux through xylem (<i>F</i><sub>T</sub>) are needed because xylem sap transports respired CO<sub>2</sub> upward. However, reports of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al dynamics of <i>F</i><sub>T</sub> and <i>E</i><sub>A</sub> are scarce and no studies exist in Mediterranean species under drought stress conditions. Internal and external CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes at three stem heights, together with radial stem growth, temperature, sap flow and shoot water potential, were measured in <i>Quercus pyrenaica</i> Willd. in four measurement campaigns during one growing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>. Substantial daytime depressions in temperature-normalized <i>E</i><sub>A</sub> were observed throughout the experiment, including prior to budburst, indicating that diel hysteresis between stem temperature and <i>E</i><sub>A</sub> cannot be uniquely ascribed to diversion of CO<sub>2</sub> in the transpiration stream. Low internal [CO<sub>2</sub>] (<0.5%) resulted in low contributions of <i>F</i><sub>T</sub> to <i>R</i><sub>S</sub> throughout the growing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>, and <i>R</i><sub>S</sub> was mainly explained by <i>E</i><sub>A</sub> (>90%). Internal [CO<sub>2</sub>] was found to vary vertically along the stems. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>ality in resistance to radial CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion was related to shoot water potential. The low internal [CO<sub>2</sub>] and <i>F</i><sub>T</sub> observed in our study may result from the downregulation of xylem respiration in response to a legacy of coppicing as well as high radial diffusion of CO<sub>2</sub> through cambium, phloem and bark tissues, which was related to low water content of stems. Long-term studies analyzing temporal and spatial variation in internal and external CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes and their interactions are needed to mechanistically understand and model respiration of woody tissues.</p>

Human influence on the seasonal cycle of tropospheric temperature
<p>We provide scientific evidence that a human-caused signal in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al cycle of tropospheric temperature has emerged from the background noise of natural variability. Satellite data and the anthropogenic “fingerprint” predicted by climate models show common large-scale changes in geographical patterns of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al cycle amplitude. These common features include increases in amplitude at mid-latitudes in both hemispheres, amplitude decreases at high latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere, and small changes in the tropics. Simple physical mechanisms explain these features. The model fingerprint of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al cycle changes is identifiable with high statistical confidence in five out of six satellite temperature datasets. Our results suggest that attribution studies with the changing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al cycle provide powerful evidence for a significant human effect on Earth’s climate.</p>

Xylem Sap Surface Tension May Be Crucial for Hydraulic Safety
<p>The surface tension (γ) of xylem sap plays a key role in stabilizing air-water interfaces at the pits between water- and gas-filled conduits to avoid air seeding at low water potentials. We studied <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al changes in xylem sap γ in <i>Picea abies</i> and <i>Pinus mugo</i> growing at the alpine timberline. We analyzed their vulnerability to drought-induced embolism using solutions of different γ and estimated the potential effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al changes in γ on hydraulic vulnerability. In both species, xylem sap γ showed distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al courses between about 50 and 68 m<sc>n</sc> m<sup>−1</sup>. Solutions with low γ caused higher vulnerability to drought-induced xylem embolism. The water potential at 50% loss of hydraulic conductivity in <i>P. abies</i> and <i>P. mugo</i> was −3.35 and −3.86 MPa at γ of 74 m<sc>n</sc> m<sup>−1</sup> but −2.11 and −2.09 MPa at 45 m<sc>n</sc> m<sup>−1</sup>. This indicates up to about 1 MPa <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al variation in 50% loss of hydraulic conductivity. The results revealed pronounced effects of changes in xylem sap γ on the hydraulic safety of trees in situ. These effects also are relevant in vulnerability analyses, where the use of standard solutions with high γ overestimates hydraulic safety. Thus, γ should be considered carefully in hydraulic studies.</p>

Seasonal Regulation of Petal Number
<p>Four petals characterize the flowers of most species in the Brassicaceae family, and this phenotype is generally robust to genetic and environmental variation. A variable petal number distinguishes the flowers of <i>Cardamine hirsuta</i> from those of its close relative Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), and allelic variation at many loci contribute to this trait. However, it is less clear whether <i>C. hirsuta</i> petal number varies in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al changes in environment. To address this question, we assessed whether petal number responds to a suite of environmental and endogenous cues that regulate flowering time in <i>C. hirsuta</i>. We found that petal number showed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al variation in <i>C. hirsuta</i>, such that spring flowering plants developed more petals than those flowering in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">summer</span></strong>. Conditions associated with spring flowering, including cool ambient temperature, short photoperiod, and vernalization, all increased petal number in <i>C. hirsuta</i>. Cool temperature caused the strongest increase in petal number and lengthened the time interval over which floral meristems matured. We performed live imaging of early flower development and showed that floral buds developed more slowly at 15°C versus 20°C. This extended phase of floral meristem formation, coupled with slower growth of sepals at 15°C, produced larger intersepal regions with more space available for petal initiation. In summary, the growth and maturation of floral buds is associated with variable petal number in <i>C. hirsuta</i> and responds to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al changes in ambient temperature.</p>

The joint influence of photoperiod and temperature during growth cessation and development of dormancy in white spruce (<i>Picea glauca</i>)
<p>Timely responses to environmental cues enable the synchronization of phenological life-history transitions essential for the health and survival of north-temperate and boreal tree species. While photoperiodic cues will remain persistent under climate change, temperature cues may vary, contributing to possible asynchrony in signals influencing developmental and physiological transitions essential to forest health. Understanding the relative contribution of photoperiod and temperature as determinants of the transition from active growth to dormancy is important for informing adaptive forest management decisions that consider future climates. Using a combination of photoperiod (long = 20 h or short = 8 h day lengths) and temperature (warm = 22 °C/16 °C and cool = 8 °C/4 °C day/night, respectively) treatments, we used microscopy, physiology and modeling to comprehensively examine hallmark traits of the growth–dormancy transition—including bud formation, growth cessation, cold hardiness and gas exchange—within two provenances of white spruce [<i>Picea glauca</i> (Moench) Voss] spanning a broad latitude in Alberta, Canada. Following exposure to experimental treatments, seedlings were transferred to favorable conditions, and the depth of dormancy was assessed by determining the timing and ability of spruce seedlings to resume growth. Short photoperiods promoted bud development and growth cessation, whereas longer photoperiods extended the growing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong> through the induction of lammas growth. In contrast, cool temperatures under both photoperiodic conditions delayed bud development. Photoperiod strongly predicted the development of cold hardiness, whereas temperature predicted photosynthetic rates associated with active growth. White spruce was capable of attaining endodormancy, but its release was environmentally determined. Dormancy depth varied substantially across experimental treatments suggesting that environmental cues experienced within one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong> could affect growth in the following <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>, which is particularly important for a determinate species such as white spruce. The joint influence of these environmental cues points toward the importance of including local constant photoperiod and shifting temperature cues into predictive models that consider how climate change may affect northern forests.</p>

Cell structural changes in the mesophyll of Norway spruce needles by elevated ozone and elevated temperature in open-field exposure during cold acclimation
<p>The effects of elevated ozone (1.4× ambient) and temperature (ambient +1.3 °C) alone and in combination were studied on the needle cell structure of soil-grown Norway spruce seedlings in the late growing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong> and winter. Temperature treatment continued over winter and lengthened the snow-free period. Elevated temperature caused microscopic changes related to photosynthesis (decreased chloroplast size and increased number), carbon storage (reduced starch and increased cytoplasmic lipids) and defence (decreased mitochondrial size and proportion per cytoplasm, increased peroxisomes and plastoglobuli, altered appearance of tannins). The results suggest increased oxidative stress by elevated temperature and altered allocation of limited carbon reserve to defence. The number of peroxisomes and plastoglobuli remained high in the outer cells of needles of ozone-exposed seedlings but decreased in the inner cells. This may indicate defence allocation to cells close to the stomata and surface, which are experiencing more oxidative stress. Ozone reduced winter hardiness based on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al changes in chloroplast shape and location in the cells. The effects of ozone became evident at the end of the growing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>, indicating the effect of cumulative ozone dose or that the seedlings were vulnerable to ozone at the later phases of winter hardening. Elevated temperature increased cellular damage in early winter and visible damage in spring, and the damage was enhanced by ozone. In conclusion, the study suggests that modest air temperature elevation increases stress at the cell structural level in spruce seedlings and is enhanced by low ozone elevation. Future climatic conditions where snow cover is formed later or is lacking but temperatures are low can increase the risk of severe seedling damage, and current and future predicted ozone concentrations increase this risk.</p>

Metropolitan versus small-town influenza
<p>Every year, influenza epidemics occur during winter in regions with temperate climates. The duration, size, and precise timing of influenza epidemics vary from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong> to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>—the numbers of hospitalizations and deaths can be substantial. The influenza epidemic in the winter of 2017–2018 in the United States was extraordinarily severe and long, straining the health care system capacity. Various external factors have been proposed to explain the duration, size, and precise timing of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al influenza epidemics, including weakened immune systems during winter, increased social crowding indoors, school leave during the Christmas holiday, and the lower humidity in winter. Inferring the relative importance of each of those factors is difficult because they act on a dynamic process that responds sensitively to changes and that is only observable with a measure of error (<i>1</i>–<i>4</i>). How can we determine what is driving influenza epidemics? On page 75 of this issue, Dalziel <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) demonstrate how influenza epidemics in a city are driven by fluctuations in humidity, modulated by the population size. This implies that influenza control measures could work differently in large metropolitan areas compared to small towns.</p>

Feedback regulation of COOLAIR expression controls seed dormancy and flowering time

We found that for regulation of seed dormancy, <i>FLC</i> and <i>FT</i> function in opposite configuration to how those same genes control time to flowering. For seed dormancy, FT regulates seed dormancy through <i>FLC</i> gene expression and regulates chromatin state by activating antisense <i>FLC</i> transcription.

Winter color polymorphisms identify global hot spots for evolutionary rescue from climate change
<p>Maintenance of biodiversity in a rapidly changing climate will depend on the efficacy of evolutionary rescue, whereby population declines due to abrupt environmental change are reversed by shifts in genetically driven adaptive traits. However, a lack of traits known to be under direct selection by anthropogenic climate change has limited the incorporation of evolutionary processes into global conservation efforts. In 21 vertebrate species, some individuals undergo a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al color molt from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">summer</span></strong> brown to winter white as camouflage against snow, whereas other individuals remain brown. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al snow duration is decreasing globally, and fitness is lower for winter white animals on snowless backgrounds. Based on 2713 georeferenced samples of known winter coat color—from eight species across trophic levels—we identify environmentally driven clinal gradients in winter coat color, including polymorphic zones where winter brown and white morphs co-occur. These polymorphic zones, underrepresented by existing global protected area networks, indicate hot spots for evolutionary rescue in a changing climate.</p>

Evolution of Cold Acclimation and Its Role in Niche Transition in the Temperate Grass Subfamily Pooideae
<p>The grass subfamily Pooideae dominates the grass floras in cold temperate regions and has evolved complex physiological adaptations to cope with extreme environmental conditions like frost, winter, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>ality. One such adaptation is cold acclimation, wherein plants increase their frost tolerance in response to gradually falling temperatures and shorter days in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">autumn</span></strong>. However, understanding how complex traits like cold acclimation evolve remains a major challenge in evolutionary biology. Here, we investigated the evolution of cold acclimation in Pooideae and found that a phylogenetically diverse set of Pooideae species displayed cold acclimation capacity. However, comparing differential gene expression after cold treatment in transcriptomes of five phylogenetically diverse species revealed widespread species-specific responses of genes with conserved sequences. Furthermore, we studied the correlation between gene family size and number of cold-responsive genes as well as between selection pressure on coding sequences of genes and their cold responsiveness. We saw evidence of protein-coding and regulatory sequence evolution as well as the origin of novel genes and functions contributing toward evolution of a cold response in Pooideae. Our results reflect that selection pressure resulting from global cooling must have acted on already diverged lineages. Nevertheless, conservation of cold-induced gene expression of certain genes indicates that the Pooideae ancestor may have possessed some molecular machinery to mitigate cold stress. Evolution of adaptations to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>ally cold climates is regarded as particularly difficult. How Pooideae evolved to transition from tropical to temperate biomes sheds light on how complex traits evolve in the light of climate changes.</p>

Cross-generation plasticity in cold hardiness is associated with diapause, but not the non-diapause developmental pathway, in the blow fly <i>Calliphora vicina</i>
<p>Predicting insect responses to global climate change involves understanding cross-generation effects of temperature. The majority of temperate insects overwinter in a state of diapause, a pre-emptive response to winter conditions associated with increased cold hardiness. Diapause is often induced following maternal adult detection of an environmental cue signifying the onset of winter, whilst diapause is initiated in a subsequent life stage and/or generation. Continued global warming will expose adults to higher late-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">autumn</span></strong> temperatures, whilst diapause life stages will still experience prolonged winter cold. The cross-generation effect of temperature was investigated by acclimating adult <i>Calliphora vicina</i> to present-day (15°C) and future (20°C) late-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">autumn</span></strong> conditions and assessing cold-hardiness in diapause (D15 and D20) and non-diapause (ND15 and ND20) progeny. A cross-generation plasticity in cold hardiness was associated with D but not ND larvae. D15 larvae exhibited an enhanced ability to suppress internal freezing (supercooling point=−18.9±0.9°C) compared with D20 (−15.3±0.8°C), and displayed a greater tolerance of prolonged exposure to −4°C (LT<sub>50</sub>=26.0±1.0 and 11.4±1.1 days, respectively) and −8°C (5.1±1.1 and 3.0±1.1 days, respectively). These changes were associated with a reduced glucose content in D15 (2.4±0.3 g mg<sup>−1</sup>) compared with D20 (3.0±0.3 g mg<sup>−1</sup>) larvae. In conclusion, <i>C. vicina</i> adults exposed to warmer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">autumn</span></strong> conditions during diapause induction will produce larvae with a reduced cold hardiness capacity, which could negatively impact winter survival. Given that maternal regulation of diapause is common among temperate insects, this could be a widespread phenomenon.</p>

Invasion and adaptation of a warm-adapted species to montane localities: effect of acclimation potential
<p><i>Drosophila ananassae</i> has successfully invaded the cold and dry montane localities of the Western Himalayas in recent years. The ability of this desiccation- and cold-sensitive tropical species to evolve in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al changes in montane localities is largely unknown. Here, we investigated how this sensitive species adapt to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>ally varying environmental conditions that are lethal to its survival. We observed change in the frequency of dark and light morphs of <i>D. ananassae</i> in five mid-altitude localities during the last decade (2000–2010). We document invasion of <i>D. ananassae</i> to montane localities and increase in frequency of the dark morph. The stress tolerance of morphs (dark and light) remained unaffected of developmental acclimation. However, adult acclimation has shown significant effects on tolerance to various environmental stresses in morphs and effect of this acclimation persist for long durations. Desiccation and cold stress tolerance was increased after adult acclimation for respective stress in the dark morph; while tolerance of the light morph was not affected. Further, heat tolerance of the light morph was increased after adult heat acclimation with no influence on heat tolerance of the dark morph. Our results suggest a possible role of adult acclimation in successful invasion and adaptation of <i>D. ananassae</i> to montane localities. Future experiments should be carried out to determine whether the survival in adverse conditions of low <i>versus</i> high temperature and humidity during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al changes is assisted by different acclimation abilities of the two morphs of <i>D. ananassae</i>.</p>

Ecophysiological responses of <i>Betula pendula</i>, <i>Pinus uncinata</i> and <i>Rhododendron ferrugineum</i> in the Catalan Pyrenees to low summer rainfall
<p>Climate change is producing modifications in the intensity and frequency of rainfall in some regions of the planet. According to predictions, annual rainfall distribution in Western Europe will result in an increase in episodes of drought, thereby negatively affecting nutrient availability. Since high mountain systems will be particularly vulnerable, the physiological and nutritional responses to changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">summer</span></strong> rainfall were monitored over the course of two consecutive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">summer</span></strong>s on three species, which are representative of subalpine forests: birch (<i>Betula pendula</i> Roth.), rhododendron (<i>Rhododendron ferrugineum</i> L.) and mountain pine (<i>Pinus uncinata</i> Mill.). Birch was especially susceptible to scarce precipitation showing alterations in leaf morphology and a decline in net photosynthesis (<i>A</i>) due to stomatal closure, which led to photoinhibition and to early leaf senescence as shown by the photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency (PNUE), carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio, foliar N and <sup>13</sup>C isotope discrimination (Δ<sup>13</sup>C) results. The Δ<sup>13</sup>C of the soluble fraction is a good estimator of intrinsic water-use efficiency in this species. Rhododendron and mountain pine had sclerophyllous leaves, as indicated by leaf mass per area, Δ<sup>13</sup>C, PNUE and C/N results. Rhododendron was particularly affected by short periods of scarce rainfall, which negatively affected gas exchange and photochemistry, and reduced the remobilization of leaf N and P. Mountain pine was the most tolerant species since alterations of gas exchange, photochemistry and Δ<sup>13</sup>C were not observed. Its highest investment of N in RuBisCo and highest potassium, iron and magnesium leaf concentration contributed to the highest <i>A</i> rates observed.</p>

An empirical study of the wound effect on sap flux density measured with thermal dissipation probes
<p>The insertion of thermal dissipation (TD) sensors on tree stems for sap flux density (SFD) measurements can lead to SFD underestimations due to a wound formation close to the drill hole. However, the wound effect has not been assessed experimentally for this method yet. Here, we propose an empirical approach to investigate the effect of the wound healing on measured sap flux with TD probes. The approach was performed for both, diffuse-porous (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i> (Linnaeus)) and ring-porous (<i>Quercus petraea</i> (Lieblein)) species. Thermal dissipation probes were installed on different dates along the growing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong> to document the effects of the dynamic wound formation. The trees were cut in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">autumn</span></strong> and additional sensors were installed in the cut stems, therefore, without potential effects of wound development. A range of water pressures was applied to the stem segments and SFDs were simultaneously measured by TD sensors as well as gravimetrically in the laboratory. The formation of wounds around sensors installed in living tree stems led to underestimation of SFD by 21.4 ± 3 and 47.5 ± 3.8% in beech and oak, respectively. The differences between SFD underestimations of diffuse-porous beech and ring-porous oak were, however, not statistically significant. Sensors with 5-, 11- and 22-week-old wounds also showed no significant differences, which implies that the influence of wound formation on SFD estimates was completed within the first few weeks after perforation. These results were confirmed by time courses of SFD measurements in the field. Field SFD values decreased immediately after sensor installation and reached stable values after ~2 weeks with similar underestimations to the ones observed in the laboratory. We therefore propose a feasible approach to correct directly field observations of SFD for potential underestimations due to the wound effect.</p>

Temperate tree species show identical response in tree water deficit but different sensitivities in sap flow to summer soil drying
<p>Temperate forests are expected to be particularly vulnerable to drought and soil drying because they are not adapted to such conditions and perform best in mesic environments. Here we ask (i) how sensitively four common temperate tree species (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i>, <i>Picea abies</i>, <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> and <i>Fraxinus excelsior</i>) respond in their water relations to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">summer</span></strong> soil drying and seek to determine (ii) if species-specific responses to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">summer</span></strong> soil drying are related to the onset of declining water status across the four species. Throughout 2012 and 2013 we determined tree water deficit (TWD) as a proxy for tree water status from recorded stem radius changes and monitored sap flow rates with sensors on 16 mature trees studied in the field at Lageren, Switzerland. All tree species responded equally in their relative maximum TWD to the onset of declining soil moisture. This implies that the water supply of all tree species was affected by declining soil moisture and that none of the four species was able to fully maintain its water status, e.g., by access to alternative water sources in the soil. In contrast we found strong and highly species-specific responses of sap flow to declining soil moisture with the strongest decline in <i>P. abies</i> (92%), followed by <i>F. sylvatica</i> (53%) and <i>A. pseudoplatanus</i> (48%). <i>F. excelsior</i> did not significantly reduce sap flow. We hypothesize the species-specific responses in sap flow to declining soil moisture that occur despite a simultaneous increase in relative TWD in all species reflect how fast these species approach critical levels of their water status, which is most likely influenced by species-specific traits determining the hydraulic properties of the species tree.</p>

Reproduction-related variation in carbon allocation to woody tissues in <i>Fagus crenata</i> using a natural <sup>13</sup>C approach
<p>The contribution of new photo-assimilates and stored carbon (C) to plant growth remains poorly understood, especially during reproduction. In order to elucidate how mast seeding affects C allocation to both reproductive and vegetative tissues, we measured biomass increase in each tissue, branch starch concentration and stable C isotope composition (δ<sup>13</sup>C) in bulk leaves, current-year shoots, 3-year branches and tree rings in fruiting and non-fruiting trees for 2 years, as well as in fruits. We isolated the effect of reproduction on C allocation to vegetative growth by comparing <sup>13</sup>C enrichment in woody tissues in fruiting and non-fruiting specimens. Compared with 2‰ <sup>13</sup>C enrichment in shoots relative to leaves from non-fruiting trees, fruiting reduced the enrichment to 1‰ and this reduction disappeared in the following year with no fruiting, indicating that new photo-assimilates are preferentially used for woody tissues even with fruiting burden. In contrast, fruits had up to 2.5‰ <sup>13</sup>C enrichment at mid-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">summer</span></strong>, which dropped thereafter, indicating that fruit production relies on C storage early in the growing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong> then shifts to current photo-assimilates. At this tipping point, growth of shoots and cupules had almost finished and nuts had a second rapid growth period thereafter. Together with shorter shoots but higher biomass increment per length in fruiting trees than non-fruiting trees, these results indicate that the C limitation due to fruit burden is minimized by fine-tuning of allocation of old C stores and new photo-assimilates, along with the growth pattern in various tissues. Furthermore, fruiting had no significant effect on starch concentration in 3-year-old branches, which became fully depleted during leaf and flower flushing but were quickly replenished. These results indicate that reproduction affects C allocation to branches but not its source or storage. These reproduction-related variations in the fate of C have implications for evaluating forest ecosystem C cycles during climate change.</p>

Acclimation of <i>Betula alleghaniensis</i> Britton to moderate soil water deficit: small morphological changes make for important consequences in crown display
<p>In the context of the predicted increasing frequency of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">summer</span></strong> droughts in the northeastern deciduous forest of North America due to climate change, we investigated the acclimation capacity of yellow birch, an economically important native tree species, to soil water deficit. We carried out an integrated examination of allocation of biomass, leaf physiology, branching pattern and in situ 3D crown display. Potted seedlings were subjected to moderate soil water deficit for four consecutive months during their second growing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>. Individuals under soil water deficit showed a 40% decrease in biomass accumulation but no change in the relative allocation of biomass to the different plant compartments. Net CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rates at leaf level decreased under water deficit (~15%) but could not alone explain the total reduction in growth, excluding the carbon starvation hypothesis. The observed reduction in net CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rates was related to a decrease in stomatal conductance and chlorophyll content. <i>STAR</i><sub>zen</sub> (in situ silhouette to total leaf area ratio; a proxy for light interception efficiency) decreased under soil water deficit due to shifts in biomass allocation within the branch compartment from long upper axes to short bottom axes. Despite the fact that the understanding of the processes involved in growth reduction and branching pattern alteration will need more attention in future research, we conclude that under water deficit yellow birch at young stages will: (i) experience a substantial loss of growth and biomass; and (ii) acclimate through architectural plasticity rather than through changes in the relative allocation of root biomass to enhance its water management.</p>

Effects of dormancy progression and low-temperature response on changes in the sorbitol concentration in xylem sap of Japanese pear during winter season
<p>In order to elucidate which physiological event(s) are involved in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al changes of carbohydrate dynamics during winter, we examined the effects of different low temperatures on the carbohydrate concentrations of Japanese pear (<i>Pyrus pyrifolia</i> (Burm.) Nakai). For four winter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>s, large increases in the sorbitol concentration of shoot xylem sap occurred during mid- to late December, possibly due to the endodormancy completion and low-temperature responses. When trees were kept at 15 °C from 3 November to 3 December in order to postpone the initiation and completion of chilling accumulation that would break endodormancy, sorbitol accumulation in xylem sap was always higher from trees with sufficient chilling accumulation than from trees that received insufficient chilling. However, an additional increase in xylem sap sorbitol occurred around late December in trees regardless of whether their chilling accumulation naturally progressed or was postponed. To examine different temperature effects more closely, we compared the carbohydrate concentrations of trees subjected to either 6 or 0 °C treatment. The sorbitol concentration in xylem sap tremendously increased at 0 °C treatment compared with 6 °C treatment. However, an additional increase in xylem sap sorbitol occurred at both the temperatures when sufficient chilling accumulated with a peak coinciding with the peak expression in shoots of the sorbitol transporter gene (<i>PpSOT2</i>). Interestingly, the total carbohydrate concentration of shoots tremendously increased with exposure to 0 °C compared with exposure to 6 °C, but was not affected by the amount of accumulated chilling. Instead, as chilling accumulated the ratio of sorbitol to total soluble sugars in shoots increased. We presumed that carbohydrates in the shoot tissues may be converted to sorbitol and loaded into the xylem sap so that the sorbitol accumulation patterns were synchronized with the progression of dormancy, whereas the total carbohydrate transported into shoots from other storage organs may be related to freezing tolerance acquisition independent of dormancy progression. We thus propose that there are different effects of dormancy progression and low-temperature responses on carbohydrate dynamics in Japanese pear.</p>

Above- and belowground controls on water use by trees of different wood types in an eastern US deciduous forest
<p>Stomata control tree transpiration by sensing and integrating environmental signals originating in the atmosphere and soil, and co-occurring species may differ in inherent stomatal sensitivity to these above- and belowground signals and in the types of signals to which they respond. Stomatal responsiveness to environmental signals is likely to differ across species having different types of wood (e.g., ring-porous, diffuse-porous and coniferous) because each wood type differs in the structure, size and spatial distribution of its xylem conduits as well as in the scaling of hydraulic properties with stem diameter. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of variation in soil water availability and atmospheric evaporative demand on stomatal regulation of transpiration in seven co-occurring temperate deciduous forest species representing three wood types. We measured whole-tree sap flux and soil and atmospheric variables in a mixed deciduous forest in central Pennsylvania over the course of a growing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong> characterized by severe drought and large fluctuations in atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (<i>D</i>). The relative sensitivity of sap flux to soil drying was ∼2.2–2.3 times greater in the diffuse-porous and coniferous species than in the ring-porous species. Stomata of the ring-porous oaks were only about half as responsive to increased <i>D</i> as those of trees of the other two wood types. These differences in responsiveness to changes in the below- and aboveground environment implied that regulation of leaf water potential in the ring-porous oaks was less stringent than that in the diffuse-porous angiosperms or the conifers. The results suggest that increases in the frequency or intensity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">summer</span></strong> droughts in the study region could have multiple consequences for forest function, including altered successional time courses or climax species composition and cumulative effects on whole-tree architecture, resulting in a structural and physiological legacy that would restrict the ability of trees to respond rapidly to more favorable growth conditions.</p>

The South Asian monsoon—pollution pump and purifier
<p>Air pollution is growing fastest in monsoon-affected South Asia. During the dry winter monsoon, the fumes disperse toward the Indian Ocean, creating a vast pollution haze, but their fate during the wet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">summer</span></strong> monsoon has been unclear. We performed atmospheric chemistry measurements by aircraft in the Oxidation Mechanism Observations campaign, sampling the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">summer</span></strong> monsoon outflow in the upper troposphere between the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean. The measurements, supported by model calculations, show that the monsoon sustains a remarkably efficient cleansing mechanism by which contaminants are rapidly oxidized and deposited to Earth’s surface. However, some pollutants are lofted above the monsoon clouds and chemically processed in a reactive reservoir before being redistributed globally, including to the stratosphere.</p>

Adaptive introgression underlies polymorphic seasonal camouflage in snowshoe hares
<p>Snowshoe hares (<i>Lepus americanus</i>) maintain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al camouflage by molting to a white winter coat, but some hares remain brown during the winter in regions with low snow cover. We show that cis-regulatory variation controlling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al expression of the <i>Agouti</i> gene underlies this adaptive winter camouflage polymorphism. Genetic variation at <i>Agouti</i> clustered by winter coat color across multiple hare and jackrabbit species, revealing a history of recurrent interspecific gene flow. Brown winter coats in snowshoe hares likely originated from an introgressed black-tailed jackrabbit allele that has swept to high frequency in mild winter environments. These discoveries show that introgression of genetic variants that underlie key ecological traits can seed past and ongoing adaptation to rapidly changing environments.</p>

Background levels of methane in Mars’ atmosphere show strong seasonal variations
<p>Variable levels of methane in the martian atmosphere have eluded explanation partly because the measurements are not repeatable in time or location. We report in situ measurements at Gale crater made over a 5-year period by the Tunable Laser Spectrometer on the Curiosity rover. The background levels of methane have a mean value 0.41 ± 0.16 parts per billion by volume (ppbv) (95% confidence interval) and exhibit a strong, repeatable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al variation (0.24 to 0.65 ppbv). This variation is greater than that predicted from either ultraviolet degradation of impact-delivered organics on the surface or from the annual surface pressure cycle. The large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al variation in the background and occurrences of higher temporary spikes (~7 ppbv) are consistent with small localized sources of methane released from martian surface or subsurface reservoirs.</p>

A 550,000-year record of East Asian monsoon rainfall from <sup>10</sup>Be in loess
<p>Cosmogenic <sup>10</sup>Be flux from the atmosphere is a proxy for rainfall. Using this proxy, we derived a 550,000-year-long record of East Asian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">summer</span></strong> monsoon (EASM) rainfall from Chinese loess. This record is forced at orbital precession frequencies, with higher rainfall observed during Northern Hemisphere <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">summer</span></strong> insolation maxima, although this response is damped during cold interstadials. The <sup>10</sup>Be monsoon rainfall proxy is also highly correlated with global ice-volume variations, which differs from Chinese cave δ<sup>18</sup>O, which is only weakly correlated. We argue that both EASM intensity and Chinese cave δ<sup>18</sup>O are not governed by high-northern-latitude insolation, as suggested by others, but rather by low-latitude interhemispheric insolation gradients, which may also strongly influence global ice volume via monsoon dynamics.</p>

Photoperiodic control of seasonal growth is mediated by ABA acting on cell-cell communication
<p>In temperate and boreal ecosystems, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al cycles of growth and dormancy allow perennial plants to adapt to winter conditions. We show, in hybrid aspen trees, that photoperiodic regulation of dormancy is mechanistically distinct from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">autumn</span></strong>al growth cessation. Dormancy sets in when symplastic intercellular communication through plasmodesmata is blocked by a process dependent on the phytohormone abscisic acid. The communication blockage prevents growth-promoting signals from accessing the meristem. Thus, precocious growth is disallowed during dormancy. The dormant period, which supports robust survival of the aspen tree in winter, is due to loss of access to growth-promoting signals.</p>

Why is the flu vaccine so mediocre?
<p>With flu <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong> around the corner in the United States and Europe, the push has begun once again to encourage people to receive their annual shots. But over the past few years, it's become increasingly clear that the level of protection offered by the vaccine varies widely each flu <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>, from 10% to 60%. And new research has revealed surprising reasons for its lackluster performance. For decades, it appeared that the vaccine had an efficacy of 70% to 90%, but scientists now know that's because they were using a misleading test—replaced in the 1990s—to assess whether it protected people. The traditional explanation for failure also has been revamped. The flu strains selected for the vaccine change each year based on what's in circulation, and scientists long blamed failure on mutations that occur in the circulating viruses in the 6–8 months that pass between the vaccine being manufactured and used. But these "mismatches" sometimes occur in years when there's solid protection, and some years with lots of failure have good matches. It turns out that other forces at work include mutations in the strain selected for the vaccine during the manufacturing process, which grows the virus in eggs. People's prior exposure to influenza also can bias their immune system toward a response that undermines that vaccine-triggered immunity. And the vaccine strain selection process itself relies heavily on the ferret animal model, which can mislead, too. There's an increasing call now to improve the vaccine and organize the research community to more collaboratively try to develop a "universal" flu shot that works against many strains and lasts for many years, if not a lifetime. </p>

Seasonal water storage, stress modulation, and California seismicity

The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al loading analysis reveals earthquakes occurring more frequently during stress conditions that favor earthquake rupture.

Mass seasonal bioflows of high-flying insect migrants
<p>Migrating animals have an impact on ecosystems directly via influxes of predators, prey, and competitors and indirectly by vectoring nutrients, energy, and pathogens. Although linkages between vertebrate movements and ecosystem processes have been established, the effects of mass insect “bioflows” have not been described. We quantified biomass flux over the southern United Kingdom for high-flying (>150 meters) insects and show that ~3.5 trillion insects (3200 tons of biomass) migrate above the region annually. These flows are not randomly directed in insects larger than 10 milligrams, which exploit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>ally beneficial tailwinds. Large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al differences in the southward versus northward transfer of biomass occur in some years, although flows were balanced over the 10-year period. Our long-term study reveals a major transport process with implications for ecosystem services, processes, and biogeochemistry.</p>

The observed linear relationship implies a sustained loss of 3 ± 0.3 square meters of September sea-ice area per metric ton of CO<sub>2</sub> emission. On the basis of this sensitivity, Arctic sea ice will be lost throughout September for an additional 1000 gigatons of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Most models show a lower sensitivity, which is possibly linked to an underestimation of the modeled increase in incoming longwave radiation and of the modeled transient climate response.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
SlHY5 Integrates Temperature, Light, and Hormone Signaling to Balance Plant Growth and Cold Tolerance
<p>During the transition from warm to cool <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>s, plants experience decreased temperatures, shortened days, and decreased red/far-red (R/FR) ratios of light. The mechanism by which plants integrate these environmental cues to maintain plant growth and adaptation remains poorly understood. Here, we report that low temperature induced the transcription of <i>PHYTOCHROME A</i> and accumulation of LONG HYPOCOTYL5 (SlHY5, a basic Leu zipper transcription factor) in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) plants, especially under short day conditions with low R/FR light ratios. Reverse genetic approaches and physiological analyses revealed that silencing of <i>SlHY5</i> increased cold susceptibility in tomato plants, whereas overexpression of <i>SlHY5</i> enhanced cold tolerance. SlHY5 directly bound to and activated the transcription of genes encoding a gibberellin-inactivation enzyme, namely <i>GIBBERELLIN2-OXIDASE4</i>, and an abscisic acid biosynthetic enzyme, namely <i>9-CIS-EPOXYCAROTENOID DIOXYGENASE6</i> (<i>SlNCED6</i>). Thus, phytochrome A-dependent SlHY5 accumulation resulted in an increased abscisic acid/gibberellin ratio, which was accompanied by growth cessation and induction of cold response. Furthermore, silencing of <i>SlNCED6</i> compromises short day- and low R/FR-induced tomato resistance to cold stress. These findings provide insight into the molecular genetic mechanisms by which plants integrate environmental stimuli with hormones to coordinate their growth with impending cold temperatures. Moreover, this work reveals a molecular mechanism that plants have evolved for growth and survival in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al changes.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
The Chickpea <i>Early Flowering 1</i> (<i>Efl1</i>) Locus Is an Ortholog of Arabidopsis <i>ELF3</i>
<p>In climates that experience short growing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>s due to drought, heat, or end-of-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong> frost, early flowering is a highly desirable trait for chickpea (<i>Cicer arietinum</i>). In this study, we mapped, sequenced, and characterized <i>Early flowering3</i> (<i>Efl3</i>), an ortholog of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>EARLY FLOWERING3</i> (<i>ELF3</i>) that confers early flowering in chickpea. In a recombinant inbred line population derived from a cross between CDC Frontier and ICCV 96029, this gene was mapped to the site of a quantitative trait locus on Ca5 that explained 59% of flowering time variation under short days. Sequencing of <i>ELF3</i> in ICCV 96029 revealed an 11-bp deletion in the first exon that was predicted to result in a premature stop codon. The effect of this mutation was tested by transgenic complementation in the Arabidopsis <i>elf3-1</i> mutant, with the CDC Frontier form of <i>CaELF3a</i> partially complementing <i>elf3-1</i> while the ICCV 96029 form had no effect on flowering time. While induction of <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T</i> homologs was very early in ICCV 96029, an analysis of circadian clock function failed to show any clear loss of rhythm in the expression of clock genes in ICCV 96029 grown under continuous light, suggesting redundancy with other <i>ELF3</i> homologs or possibly an alternative mode of action for this gene in chickpea. The 11-bp deletion was associated with early flowering in global chickpea germplasm but was not widely distributed, indicating that this mutation arose relatively recently.</p>

Genome-Wide Analysis of Selection on the Malaria Parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> in West African Populations of Differing Infection Endemicity
<p>Locally varying selection on pathogens may be due to differences in drug pressure, host immunity, transmission opportunities between hosts, or the intensity of between-genotype competition within hosts. Highly recombining populations of the human malaria parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> throughout West Africa are closely related, as gene flow is relatively unrestricted in this endemic region, but markedly varying ecology and transmission intensity should cause distinct local selective pressures. Genome-wide analysis of sequence variation was undertaken on a sample of 100 <i>P. falciparum</i> clinical isolates from a highly endemic region of the Republic of Guinea where transmission occurs for most of each year and compared with data from 52 clinical isolates from a previously sampled population from The Gambia, where there is relatively limited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al malaria transmission. Paired-end short-read sequences were mapped against the 3D7 <i>P. falciparum</i> reference genome sequence, and data on 136,144 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were obtained. Within-population analyses identifying loci showing evidence of recent positive directional selection and balancing selection confirm that antimalarial drugs and host immunity have been major selective agents. Many of the signatures of recent directional selection reflected by standardized integrated haplotype scores were population specific, including differences at drug resistance loci due to historically different antimalarial use between the countries. In contrast, both populations showed a similar set of loci likely to be under balancing selection as indicated by very high Tajima’s <i>D</i> values, including a significant overrepresentation of genes expressed at the merozoite stage that invades erythrocytes and several previously validated targets of acquired immunity. Between-population <i>F</i><sub>ST</sub> analysis identified exceptional differentiation of allele frequencies at a small number of loci, most markedly for five SNPs covering a 15-kb region within and flanking the <i>gdv1</i> gene that regulates the early stages of gametocyte development, which is likely related to the extreme differences in mosquito vector abundance and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>ality that determine the transmission opportunities for the sexual stage of the parasite.</p>

Antifreeze proteins in the primary urine of larvae of the beetle <i>Dendroides canadensis</i>
<p>To avoid freezing while overwintering beneath the bark of fallen trees, <i>Dendroides canadensis</i> (Coleoptera: Pyrochroidae) larvae produce a family of antifreeze proteins (DAFPs) that are transcribed in specific tissues and have specific compartmental fates. DAFPs and associated thermal hysteresis activity (THA) have been shown previously in hemolymph and midgut fluid, but the presence of DAFPs has not been explored in primary urine, a potentially important site that can contain endogenous ice-nucleating compounds that could induce freezing. A maximum mean THA of 2.65±0.33°C was observed in primary urine of winter-collected <i>D. canadensis</i> larvae. THA in primary urine increased significantly through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">autumn</span></strong>, peaked in the winter and decreased through spring to levels of 0.2–0.3°C in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">summer</span></strong>, in a pattern similar to that of hemolymph and midgut fluid. THA was also found in hindgut fluid and excreted rectal fluid, suggesting that these larvae not only concentrate AFPs in the hindgut, but also excrete AFPs from the rectal cavity. Based on <i>dafp</i> transcripts isolated from Malpighian tubule epithelia, cDNAs were cloned and sequenced, identifying the presence of transcripts encoding 24 DAFP isoforms. Six of these Malpighian tubule DAFPs were known previously, but 18 are new. We also provide functional evidence that DAFPs can inhibit ice nucleators present in insect primary urine. This is potentially critical because <i>D. canadensis</i> larvae die if frozen, and therefore ice formation in any body fluid, including the urine, would be lethal.</p>

Aging and its modulation in a long-lived worker caste of the honey bee
<p>Highly social animals provide alternative aging models in which vastly different lifespan patterns are flexible, and linked to social caste. Research in these species aims to reveal how environment, including social cues, can shape the transition between short-lived and extremely long-lived phenotypes with negligible senescence. Among honey bee workers, short to intermediate lifespans are typical for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">summer</span></strong> castes, while the winter caste can live up to 10 times longer. For <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">summer</span></strong> castes, experimental interventions could predictably accelerate, slow or revert functional senescence. In contrast, little is known about the partic ular conditions under which periods of negligible senescence in winter castes can be disrupted or sustained. We asked how manipulation of social environment in colonies with long-lived winter bees might alter the pace of functional senescence, measured as learning performance, as well as of cellular senescence, measured as lipofuscin accumulation. We show that behavioral senescence becomes rapidly detectable when the winter state is disrupted, and changes in social task behaviors and social environment (brood) are induced. Likewise, we found that cellular senescence was induced by such social intervention. However, cellular senescence showed marked regional differences, suggesting that particular brain regions age slower than others. Finally, by preventing post-winter colonies from brood rearing, behavioral senescence became undetectable, even after transition to the usually short-lived phenotypes had occurred. We envision that social regulation of negligible functional senescence and highly dynamic accumulation of a universal symptom of cellular aging (lipofuscin) offers rewarding perspectives to target proximate mechanisms of slowed aging.</p>

Rosetta’s comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko sheds its dusty mantle to reveal its icy nature
<p>The Rosetta spacecraft has investigated comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko from large heliocentric distances to its perihelion passage and beyond. We trace the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al and diurnal evolution of the colors of the 67P nucleus, finding changes driven by sublimation and recondensation of water ice. The whole nucleus became relatively bluer near perihelion, as increasing activity removed the surface dust, implying that water ice is widespread underneath the surface. We identified large (1500 square meters) ice-rich patches appearing and then vanishing in about 10 days, indicating small-scale heterogeneities on the nucleus. Thin frosts sublimating in a few minutes are observed close to receding shadows, and rapid variations in color are seen on extended areas close to the terminator. These cyclic processes are widespread and lead to continuously, slightly varying surface properties.</p>

Seasonal exposure of carbon dioxide ice on the nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is one of the most abundant species in cometary nuclei, but because of its high volatility, CO<sub>2</sub> ice is generally only found beneath the surface. We report the infrared spectroscopic identification of a CO<sub>2</sub> ice–rich surface area located in the Anhur region of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Spectral modeling shows that about 0.1% of the 80- by 60-meter area is CO<sub>2</sub> ice. This exposed ice was observed a short time after the comet exited local winter; following the increased illumination, the CO<sub>2</sub> ice completely disappeared over about 3 weeks. We estimate the mass of the sublimated CO<sub>2</sub> ice and the depth of the eroded surface layer. We interpret the presence of CO<sub>2</sub> ice as the result of the extreme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al changes induced by the rotation and orbit of the comet.</p>

Potent protection against H5N1 and H7N9 influenza via childhood hemagglutinin imprinting
<p>Two zoonotic influenza A viruses (IAV) of global concern, H5N1 and H7N9, exhibit unexplained differences in age distribution of human cases. Using data from all known human cases of these viruses, we show that an individual’s first IAV infection confers lifelong protection against severe disease from novel hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes in the same phylogenetic group. Statistical modeling shows that protective HA imprinting is the crucial explanatory factor, and it provides 75% protection against severe infection and 80% protection against death for both H5N1 and H7N9. Our results enable us to predict age distributions of severe disease for future pandemics and demonstrate that a novel strain’s pandemic potential increases yearly when a group-mismatched HA subtype dominates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">season</span></strong>al influenza circulation. These findings open new frontiers for rational pandemic risk assessment.</p>

An unexpected disruption of the atmospheric quasi-biennial oscillation
<p>One of the most repeatable phenomena seen in the atmosphere, the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) between prevailing eastward and westward wind jets in the equatorial stratosphere (approximately 16 to 50 kilometers altitude), was unexpectedly disrupted in February 2016. An unprecedented westward jet formed within the eastward phase in the lower stratosphere and cannot be accounted for by the standard QBO paradigm based on vertical momentum transport. Instead, the primary cause was waves transporting momentum from the Northern Hemisphere. Seasonal forecasts did not predict the disruption, but analogous QBO disruptions are seen very occasionally in some climate simulations. A return to more typical QBO behavior within the next year is forecast, although the possibility of more frequent occurrences of similar disruptions is projected for a warming climate.</p>

Plant diversity patterns in neotropical dry forests and their conservation implications
<p>Seasonally dry tropical forests are distributed across Latin America and the Caribbean and are highly threatened, with less than 10% of their original extent remaining in many countries. Using 835 inventories covering 4660 species of woody plants, we show marked floristic turnover among inventories and regions, which may be higher than in other neotropical biomes, such as savanna. Such high floristic turnover indicates that numerous conservation areas across many countries will be needed to protect the full diversity of tropical dry forests. Our results provide a scientific framework within which national decision-makers can contextualize the floristic significance of their dry forest at a regional and continental scale.</p>

Such phenological timings are likely to shift as our climate changes, but species exist in communities, and not all species can be expected to shift in concert. <bold>Reed <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 488) used long-term data on European great tits to reveal how the negative consequences of phenological mismatch can be buffered: Lower fitness in individuals subject to mismatch-driven reductions of food availability was balanced by reductions in competition.

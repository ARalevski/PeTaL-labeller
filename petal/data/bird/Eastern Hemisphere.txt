Ischemic Cerebroprotection Conferred by Myeloid Lineage-Restricted or Global CD39 Transgene Expression
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cerebral tissue damage after an ischemic event can be exacerbated by inflammation and thrombosis. Elevated extracellular ATP and ADP levels are associated with cellular injury, inflammation, and thrombosis. Ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase-1 (CD39), an enzyme expressed on the plasmalemma of leukocytes and endothelial cells, suppresses platelet activation and leukocyte infiltration by phosphohydrolyzing ATP/ADP. To investigate the effects of increased CD39 in an in vivo cerebral ischemia model, we developed a transgenic mouse expressing human CD39 (hCD39).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A floxed-stop sequence was inserted between the promoter and the hCD39 transcriptional start site, generating a mouse in which the expression of hCD39 can be controlled tissue-specifically using Cre recombinase mice. We generated mice that express hCD39 globally or in myeloid-lineage cells only. Cerebral ischemia was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion. Infarct volumes were quantified by MRI after 48 hours.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Both global and transgenic hCD39- and myeloid lineage CD39-overexpressing mice (transgenic, n=9; myeloid lineage, n=6) demonstrated significantly smaller cerebral infarct volumes compared with wild-type mice. Leukocytes from ischemic and contralateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemispher</span></strong>es were analyzed by flow cytometry. Although contralateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemispher</span></strong>es had equal numbers of macrophages and neutrophils, ischemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemispher</span></strong>es from transgenic mice had less infiltration (n=4). Transgenic mice showed less neurological deficit compared with wild-type mice (n=6).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This is the first report of transgenic overexpression of CD39 in mice imparting a protective phenotype after stroke, with reduced leukocyte infiltration, smaller infarct volumes, and decreased neurological deficit. CD39 overexpression, either globally or in myeloid lineage cells, quenches postischemic leukosequestration and reduces stroke-induced neurological injury.</p></sec>

Human influence on the seasonal cycle of tropospheric temperature
<p>We provide scientific evidence that a human-caused signal in the seasonal cycle of tropospheric temperature has emerged from the background noise of natural variability. Satellite data and the anthropogenic “fingerprint” predicted by climate models show common large-scale changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geographi</span></strong>cal patterns of seasonal cycle amplitude. These common features include increases in amplitude at mid-latitudes in both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemispher</span></strong>es, amplitude decreases at high latitudes in the Southern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemispher</span></strong>e, and small changes in the tropics. Simple physical mechanisms explain these features. The model fingerprint of seasonal cycle changes is identifiable with high statistical confidence in five out of six satellite temperature datasets. Our results suggest that attribution studies with the changing seasonal cycle provide powerful evidence for a significant human effect on Earth’s climate.</p>

Breakup of last glacial deep stratification in the South Pacific
<p>Stratification of the deep Southern Ocean during the Last Glacial Maximum is thought to have facilitated carbon storage and subsequent release during the deglaciation as stratification broke down, contributing to atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> rise. Here, we present neodymium isotope evidence from deep to abyssal waters in the South Pacific that confirms stratification of the deepwater column during the Last Glacial Maximum. The results indicate a glacial northward expansion of Ross Sea Bottom Water and a Southern Hemisphere climate trigger for the deglacial breakup of deep stratification. It highlights the important role of abyssal waters in sustaining a deep glacial carbon reservoir and Southern Hemisphere climate change as a prerequisite for the destabilization of the water column and hence the deglacial release of sequestered CO<sub>2</sub> through upwelling.</p>

Replicating Meyerhoff for inclusive excellence in STEM
<p>Ethnic minorities comprise rapidly growing portions of the populations of most developed countries (<i>1</i>) but are underrepresented in fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) (<i>2</i>, <i>3</i>). Efforts to increase diversity in the STEM workforce, important for developing more effective approaches to group problem-solving (<i>4</i>–<i>6</i>), have been under way in the United States for decades, but widespread impact remains relatively low (<i>3</i>). The Meyerhoff Scholars Program (MYS) at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), provides a promising model for increasing retention and academic performance of underrepresented minority (URM) undergraduates in STEM and for preparing those undergraduates to pursue and succeed in graduate and professional programs (<i>7</i>, <i>8</i>). Although MYS is nearly 30 years old and outcomes for African-American STEM majors have been extensively documented [see (<i>7</i>, <i>8</i>) and references therein], no other majority university [not meeting the definition of being a minority-serving institution (MSI) (<i>9</i>)] has achieved similar outcomes (<i>10</i>). We describe here some promising early indicators that an interinstitutional partnership approach can help enable MYS-like outcomes at majority universities with different URM compositions, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geographi</span></strong>es, and institutional sizes and cultures: The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) and Pennsylvania State University at University Park (PSU).</p>

Global pattern of nest predation is disrupted by climate change in shorebirds
<p>Ongoing climate change is thought to disrupt trophic relationships, with consequences for complex interspecific interactions, yet the effects of climate change on species interactions are poorly understood, and such effects have not been documented at a global scale. Using a single database of 38,191 nests from 237 populations, we found that shorebirds have experienced a worldwide increase in nest predation over the past 70 years. Historically, there existed a latitudinal gradient in nest predation, with the highest rates in the tropics; however, this pattern has been recently reversed in the Northern Hemisphere, most notably in the Arctic. This increased nest predation is consistent with climate-induced shifts in predator-prey relationships.</p>

Hierarchically porous polymer coatings for highly efficient passive daytime radiative cooling
<p>Passive daytime radiative cooling (PDRC) involves spontaneously cooling a surface by reflecting sunlight and radiating heat to the cold outer space. Current PDRC designs are promising alternatives to electrical cooling but are either inefficient or have limited applicability. We present a simple, inexpensive, and scalable phase inversion–based method for fabricating hierarchically porous poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropene) [P(VdF-HFP)<sub>HP</sub>] coatings with excellent PDRC capability. High, substrate-independent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemispher</span></strong>ical solar reflectances (0.96 ± 0.03) and long-wave infrared emittances (0.97 ± 0.02) allow for subambient temperature drops of ~6°C and cooling powers of ~96 watts per square meter (W m<sup>−2</sup>) under solar intensities of 890 and 750 W m<sup>−2</sup>, respectively. The performance equals or surpasses those of state-of-the-art PDRC designs, and the technique offers a paint-like simplicity.</p>

A 550,000-year record of East Asian monsoon rainfall from <sup>10</sup>Be in loess
<p>Cosmogenic <sup>10</sup>Be flux from the atmosphere is a proxy for rainfall. Using this proxy, we derived a 550,000-year-long record of East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) rainfall from Chinese loess. This record is forced at orbital precession frequencies, with higher rainfall observed during Northern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemispher</span></strong>e summer insolation maxima, although this response is damped during cold interstadials. The <sup>10</sup>Be monsoon rainfall proxy is also highly correlated with global ice-volume variations, which differs from Chinese cave δ<sup>18</sup>O, which is only weakly correlated. We argue that both EASM intensity and Chinese cave δ<sup>18</sup>O are not governed by high-northern-latitude insolation, as suggested by others, but rather by low-latitude inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemispher</span></strong>ic insolation gradients, which may also strongly influence global ice volume via monsoon dynamics.</p>

Electromagnetic evidence that SSS17a is the result of a binary neutron star merger
<p>Eleven hours after the detection of gravitational wave source GW170817 by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory and Virgo Interferometers, an associated optical transient, SSS17a, was identified in the galaxy NGC 4993. Although the gravitational wave data indicate that GW170817 is consistent with the merger of two compact objects, the electromagnetic observations provide independent constraints on the nature of that system. We synthesize the optical to near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy of SSS17a collected by the One-Meter Two-Hemisphere collaboration, finding that SSS17a is unlike other known transients. The source is best described by theoretical models of a kilonova consisting of radioactive elements produced by rapid neutron capture (the r-process). We conclude that SSS17a was the result of a binary neutron star merger, reinforcing the gravitational wave result.</p>

Ocean mixing and ice-sheet control of seawater <sup>234</sup>U/<sup>238</sup>U during the last deglaciation
<p>Seawater <sup>234</sup>U/<sup>238</sup>U provides global-scale information about continental weathering and is vital for marine uranium-series geochronology. Existing evidence supports an increase in <sup>234</sup>U/<sup>238</sup>U since the last glacial period, but the timing and amplitude of its variability has been poorly constrained. Here we report two seawater <sup>234</sup>U/<sup>238</sup>U records based on well-preserved deep-sea corals from the low-latitude Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The Atlantic <sup>234</sup>U/<sup>238</sup>U started to increase before major sea-level rise and overshot the modern value by 3 per mil during the early deglaciation. Deglacial <sup>234</sup>U/<sup>238</sup>U in the Pacific converged with that in the Atlantic after the abrupt resumption of Atlantic meridional overturning. We suggest that ocean mixing and early deglacial release of excess <sup>234</sup>U from enhanced subglacial melting of the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets have driven the observed <sup>234</sup>U/<sup>238</sup>U evolution.</p>

Sick birds don't fly…or do they?
<p>In 2014, a new, highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) called H5N8 caused outbreaks in poultry in East and Southeast Asia and spread across the Northern Hemisphere to Europe and North America. In the United States alone, H5N8 outbreaks resulted in the destruction of more than 48 million poultry birds (<i>1</i>). International live-poultry trade and wild-bird migration have both been implicated in the intercontinental movement of H5N8 and other HPAIVs. H5N8 viruses have been found in wild birds (<i>2</i>–<i>4</i>), but strong links between poultry outbreaks and live-poultry trade or wild-bird migration have been elusive. On page 213 of this issue, the Global Consortium for H5N8 and Related Influenza Viruses (<i>5</i>) delineates the contributions of live-poultry trade and wild-bird migration to the global spread of H5N8 viruses.</p>

An unexpected disruption of the atmospheric quasi-biennial oscillation
<p>One of the most repeatable phenomena seen in the atmosphere, the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) between prevailing eastward and westward wind jets in the equatorial stratosphere (approximately 16 to 50 kilometers altitude), was unexpectedly disrupted in February 2016. An unprecedented westward jet formed within the eastward phase in the lower stratosphere and cannot be accounted for by the standard QBO paradigm based on vertical momentum transport. Instead, the primary cause was waves transporting momentum from the Northern Hemisphere. Seasonal forecasts did not predict the disruption, but analogous QBO disruptions are seen very occasionally in some climate simulations. A return to more typical QBO behavior within the next year is forecast, although the possibility of more frequent occurrences of similar disruptions is projected for a warming climate.</p>

Crippling Virus Set to Conquer Western Hemisphere
<p>The chikungunya virus, which causes rashes, fever, and agonizing, sometimes lasting, joint pains, is spreading rapidly in the Caribbean. More than 45,000 suspected and confirmed infections have already been reported. Now that it has arrived in the Western Hemisphere, the virus will spread as far as the southern United States and Argentina, scientists say, because its main vector, the mosquito species <i>Aedes aegypti</i>, is widespread. There are no drugs against chikungunya, but several vaccines are in various stages of development. </p>

Management of massive acetabular bone defects in revision arthroplasty of the hip using a reconstruction cage and porous metal augment
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>It may not be possible to undertake revision total hip arthroplasty   (THA) in the presence of massive loss of acetabular bone stock using   standard cementless <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemispher</span></strong>ical acetabular components and metal   augments, as satisfactory stability cannot always be achieved. We   aimed to study the outcome using a reconstruction cage and a porous   metal augment in these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 22 acetabular revisions in 19 patients were performed   using a combination of a reconstruction cage and porous metal augments.   The augments were used in place of structural allografts. The mean   age of the patients at the time of surgery was 70 years (27 to 85)   and the mean follow-up was 39 months (27 to 58). The mean number   of previous THAs was 1.9 (1 to 3). All patients had segmental defects   involving more than 50% of the acetabulum and seven hips had an   associated pelvic discontinuity. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Three failures were observed in two hips, both of which had undergone   a previous resection of a tumour affecting the acetabulum. Other   complications included a late arterial injury, a sciatic nerve palsy,   a dislocation treated with a femoral revision, a deep infection   treated with irrigation and debridement and a fracture of the greater   trochanter treated conservatively. The mean Oxford Hip Score significantly   increased from 13.9 (2 to 23) to 28.7 (13 to 38) (p < 0.00001).   The mean vertical distance between the centre of rotation of the   hip and its normal location decreased from 30 mm to 10 mm.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Acceptable early survivorship can be achieved using this novel   technique, but it may be unsuitable for use in patients who have   previously undergone the resection of a tumour involving the acetabulum.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:607–13.</p></sec>

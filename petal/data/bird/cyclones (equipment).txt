Hayabusa2 arrives at the carbonaceous asteroid 162173 Ryugu—A spinning top–shaped rubble pile
<p>The Hayabusa2 spacecraft arrived at the near-Earth carbonaceous asteroid 162173 Ryugu in 2018. We present Hayabusa2 observations of Ryugu’s shape, mass, and geomorphology. Ryugu has an oblate “spinning top” shape, with a prominent circular equatorial ridge. Its bulk density, 1.19 ± 0.02 grams per cubic centimeter, indicates a high-porosity (>50%) interior. Large surface boulders suggest a rubble-pile structure. Surface slope analysis shows Ryugu’s shape may have been produced from having once spun at twice the current rate. Coupled with the observed global material homogeneity, this suggests that Ryugu was reshaped by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">centrifug</span></strong>ally induced deformation during a period of rapid rotation. From these remote-sensing investigations, we identified a suitable sample collection site on the equatorial ridge.</p>

A cryofuge for cold-collision experiments with slow polar molecules
<p>Ultracold molecules represent a fascinating research frontier in physics and chemistry, but it has proven challenging to prepare dense samples at low velocities. Here, we present a solution to this goal by means of a nonconventional approach dubbed cryofuge. It uses <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">centrifug</span></strong>al force to bring cryogenically cooled molecules to kinetic energies below 1 K × <i>k</i><sub>B</sub> in the laboratory frame, where <i>k</i><sub>B</sub> is the Boltzmann constant, with corresponding fluxes exceeding 10<sup>10</sup> per second at velocities below 20 meters per second. By attaining densities higher than 10<sup>9</sup> per cubic centimeter and interaction times longer than 25 milliseconds in samples of fluoromethane as well as deuterated ammonia, we observed cold dipolar collisions between molecules and determined their collision cross sections.</p>

A Simple Method for Measuring Apoplast Hydration and Collecting Apoplast Contents
<p>The plant leaf apoplast is a dynamic environment subject to a variety of both internal and external stimuli. In addition to being a conduit for water vapor and gas exchange involved in transpiration and photosynthesis, the apoplast also accumulates many nutrients transported from the soil as well as those produced through photosynthesis. The internal leaf also provides a protective environment for endophytic and pathogenic microbes alike. Given the diverse array of physiological processes occurring in the apoplast, it is expedient to develop methods to study its contents. Many established methods rely on vacuum infiltration of an apoplast wash solution followed by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">centrifug</span></strong>ation. In this study, we describe a refined method optimized for maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) seedling leaves, which not only provides a simple procedure for obtaining apoplast fluid, but also allows direct calculation of apoplast hydration at the time of harvest for every sample. In addition, we describe an abbreviated method for estimating apoplast hydration if the full apoplast extraction is not necessary. Finally, we show the applicability of this optimized apoplast extraction procedure for plants infected with the maize pathogen <i>Pantoea stewartii</i> ssp <i>stewartii</i>, including the efficient isolation of bacteria previously residing in the apoplast. The approaches to establishing this method should make it generally applicable to other types of plants.</p>

NDH-PSI Supercomplex Assembly Precedes Full Assembly of the NDH Complex in Chloroplast
<p>The chloroplast NADH dehydrogenase-like (NDH) complex is structurally similar to respiratory complex I and mediates PSI cyclic electron flow. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), chloroplast NDH is composed of at least 29 subunits and associates with two copies of PSI to form the NDH-PSI supercomplex. Here, we found that CHLORORESPIRATORY REDUCTION3 (CRR3) is an assembly factor required for the accumulation of subcomplex B (SubB) of chloroplast NDH. In Suc density gradient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">centrifug</span></strong>ation, CRR3 was detected in three protein complexes. Accumulation of the largest peak III complex was impaired in mutants defective in the SubB subunits PnsB2-PnsB5. The oligomeric form of CRR3 likely functions to assemble the core of SubB to form the peak III complex as an assembly intermediate. A defect in the PnsL3 subunit increased the level of the peak III complex, suggesting that CRR3 was released from the assembly intermediate after PnsL3 binding. Unlike PnsB2-PnsB5 and PnsL3, PnsB1 was not absolutely necessary for stabilizing SubB. PnsB1 is likely incorporated into the intermediate at the final step during SubB assembly. Lhca6 is a linker protein mediating NDH-PSI supercomplex formation, and its site of contact with NDH was suggested to be SubB. In the <i>lhca6</i> mutant, accumulation of the peak III complex was impaired, suggesting that SubB interacted with Lhca6 during the step of SubB assembly. The process of supercomplex formation was triggered before the completion of the NDH assembly. Consistent with its predicted function, CRR3 accumulated in young leaves, where the NDH complex was assembled.</p>

Optical Measurement of Stem Xylem Vulnerability
<p>The vulnerability of plant water transport tissues to a loss of function by cavitation during water stress is a key indicator of the survival capabilities of plant species during drought. Quantifying this important metric has been greatly advanced by noninvasive techniques that allow embolisms to be viewed directly in the vascular system. Here, we present a new method for evaluating the spatial and temporal propagation of embolizing bubbles in the stem xylem during imposed water stress. We demonstrate how the optical method, used previously in leaves, can be adapted to measure the xylem vulnerability of stems. Validation of the technique is carried out by measuring the xylem vulnerability of 13 conifers and two short-vesseled angiosperms and comparing the results with measurements made using the cavitron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">centrifug</span></strong>e method. Very close agreement between the two methods confirms the reliability of the new optical technique and opens the way to simple, efficient, and reliable assessment of stem vulnerability using standard flatbed scanners, cameras, or microscopes.</p>

Synovial calprotectin
<sec><title>Aims </title><p>Recently, several synovial biomarkers have been introduced into   the algorithm for the diagnosis of a prosthetic joint infection   (PJI). Alpha defensin is a promising biomarker, with a high sensitivity   and specificity, but it is expensive. Calprotectin is a protein   that is present in the cytoplasm of neutrophils, is released upon   neutrophil activation and exhibits anti-microbial activity. Our   aim, in this study, was to determine the diagnostic potential of   synovial calprotectin in the diagnosis of a PJI.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>In this pilot study, we prospectively collected synovial fluid   from the hip, knee, shoulder and elbow of 19 patients with a proven   PJI and from a control group of 42 patients who underwent revision   surgery without a PJI.</p><p>PJI was diagnosed according to the current diagnostic criteria   of the Musculoskeletal Infection Society. Synovial fluid was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">centrifug</span></strong>ed   and the supernatant was used to measure the level of calprotectin   after applying a lateral flow immunoassay. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The median synovial calprotectin level was 991 mg/L (interquartile   range (IQR) 154 to 1787) in those with a PJI and 11 mg/L (IQR 3   to 29) in the control group (p < 0.0001). Using a cut-off value   of 50 mg/L, this level showed an excellent diagnostic accuracy,   with an area under the curve of 0.94. The overall sensitivity, specificity,   positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV)   was 89%, 90%, 81% and 95% respectively. The NPV was 97% in the nine   patients with a chronic PJI. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion </title><p>Synovial calprotectin may be a valuable biomarker in the diagnosis   of a PJI, especially in the exclusion of an infection. With a lateral   flow immunoassay, a relatively rapid quantitative diagnosis can   be made. The measurement is cheap and is easy to use. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:660–5.</p></sec>

Endothelial Microparticles From Acute Coronary Syndrome Patients Induce Premature Coronary Artery Endothelial Cell Aging and Thrombogenicity
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Microparticles (MPs) have emerged as a surrogate marker of endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular risk. This study examined the potential of MPs from senescent endothelial cells (ECs) or from patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) to promote premature EC aging and thrombogenicity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Primary porcine coronary ECs were isolated from the left circumflex coronary artery. MPs were prepared from ECs and venous blood from patients with ACS (n=30) and from healthy volunteers (n=4) by sequential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">centrifug</span></strong>ation. The level of endothelial senescence was assessed as senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity using flow cytometry, oxidative stress using the redox-sensitive probe dihydroethidium, tissue factor activity using an enzymatic Tenase assay, the level of target protein expression by Western blot analysis, platelet aggregation using an aggregometer, and shear stress using a cone-and-plate viscometer.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Senescence, as assessed by senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, was induced by the passaging of porcine coronary artery ECs from passage P1 to P4, and was associated with a progressive shedding of procoagulant MPs. Exposure of P1 ECs to MPs shed from senescent P3 cells or circulating MPs from ACS patients induced increased senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, oxidative stress, early phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and Akt, and upregulation of p53, p21, and p16. Ex vivo, the prosenescent effect of circulating MPs from ACS patients was evidenced only under conditions of low shear stress. Depletion of endothelial-derived MPs from ACS patients reduced the induction of senescence. Prosenescent MPs promoted EC thrombogenicity through tissue factor upregulation, shedding of procoagulant MPs, endothelial nitric oxide synthase downregulation, and reduced nitric oxide–mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation. These MPs exhibited angiotensin-converting enzyme activity and upregulated AT1 receptors and angiotensin-converting enzyme in P1 ECs. Losartan, an AT1 receptor antagonist, and inhibitors of either mitogen-activated protein kinases or phosphoinositide 3-kinase prevented the MP-induced endothelial senescence.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These findings indicate that endothelial-derived MPs from ACS patients induce premature endothelial senescence under atheroprone low shear stress and thrombogenicity through angiotensin II–induced redox-sensitive activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt. They further suggest that targeting endothelial-derived MP shedding and their bioactivity may be a promising therapeutic strategy to limit the development of an endothelial dysfunction post-ACS.</p></sec>

Hemocompatibility-Related Outcomes in the MOMENTUM 3 Trial at 6 Months
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The HeartMate 3 (HM3) Left Ventricular Assist System (LVAS) (Abbott) is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">centrifug</span></strong>al, fully magnetically levitated, continuous-flow blood pump engineered to enhance hemocompatibility and reduce shear stress on blood components. The MOMENTUM 3 trial (Multicenter Study of MagLev Technology in Patients Undergoing Mechanical Circulatory Support Therapy With HeartMate 3) compares the HM3 LVAS with the HeartMate II (HMII) LVAS (Abbott) in advanced heart failure refractory to medical management, irrespective of therapeutic intention (bridge to transplant versus destination therapy). This investigation reported its primary outcome in the short-term cohort (n=294; 6-month follow-up), demonstrating superiority of the HM3 for the trial primary end point (survival free of a disabling stroke or reoperation to replace the pump for malfunction), driven by a reduced need for reoperations. The aim of this analysis was to evaluate the aggregate of hemocompatibility-related clinical adverse events (HRAEs) between the 2 LVAS.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a secondary end point evaluation of HRAE (survival free of any nonsurgical bleeding, thromboembolic event, pump thrombosis, or neurological event) in the short-term cohort (as-treated cohort n=289) at 6 months. The net burden of HRAE was also assessed by using a previously described hemocompatibility score, which uses 4 escalating tiers of hierarchal severity to derive a total score for events encountered during the entire follow-up experience for each patient.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In 289 patients in the as-treated group (151 the HM3 and 138 the HMII), survival free of any HRAE was achieved in 69% of the HM3 group and in 55% of the HMII group (hazard ratio, 0.62; confidence interval, 0.42–0.91; <i>P</i>=0.012). Using the hemocompatibility score, the HM3 group demonstrated less pump thrombosis requiring reoperation (0 versus 36 points, <i>P</i><0.001) or medically managed pump thrombosis (0 versus 5 points, <i>P</i>=0.02), and fewer nondisabling strokes (6 versus 24 points, <i>P</i>=0.026) than the control HMII LVAS. The net hemocompatibility score in the HM3 in comparison with the HMII patients was 101 (0.67±1.50 points/patient) versus 137 (0.99±1.79 points/patient) (odds ratio, 0.64; confidence interval, 0.39–1.03; <i>P</i>=0.065).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In this secondary analysis of the MOMENTUM 3 trial, the HM3 LVAS demonstrated greater freedom from HRAEs in comparison with the HMII LVAS at 6 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Restoration of Hydrogen Sulfide Production in Diabetic Mice Improves Reparative Function of Bone Marrow Cells
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Bone marrow cell (BMC)–based treatment for critical limb ischemia in diabetic patients yielded a modest therapeutic effect resulting from cell dysfunction. Therefore, approaches that improve diabetic stem/progenitor cell functions may provide therapeutic benefits. Here, we tested the hypothesis that restoration of hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) production in diabetic BMCs improves their reparative capacities.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Mouse BMCs were isolated by density-gradient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">centrifug</span></strong>ation. Unilateral hind limb ischemia was conducted in 12- to 14-week-old db/+ and db/db mice by ligation of the left femoral artery. The H<sub>2</sub>S level was measured by either gas chromatography or staining with florescent dye sulfidefluor 7 <sc>AM</sc>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Both H<sub>2</sub>S production and cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE), an H<sub>2</sub>S enzyme, levels were significantly decreased in BMCs from diabetic db/db mice. Administration of H<sub>2</sub>S donor diallyl trisulfide (DATS) or overexpression of CSE restored H<sub>2</sub>S production and enhanced cell survival and migratory capacity in high glucose (HG)–treated BMCs. Immediately after hind limb ischemia surgery, the db/+ and db/db mice were administered DATS orally and/or given a local intramuscular injection of green fluorescent protein–labeled BMCs or red fluorescent protein–CSE–overexpressing BMCs (CSE-BMCs). Mice with hind limb ischemia were divided into 6 groups: db/+, db/db, db/db+BMCs, db/db+DATS, db/db+DATS+BMCs, and db/db+CSE-BMCs. DATS and CSE overexpression greatly enhanced diabetic BMC retention in ischemic hind limbs followed by improved blood perfusion, capillary/arteriole density, skeletal muscle architecture, and cell survival and decreased perivascular CD68<sup>+</sup> cell infiltration in the ischemic hind limbs of diabetic mice. It is interesting to note that DATS or CSE overexpression rescued high glucose–impaired migration, tube formation, and survival of BMCs or mature human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells. Moreover, DATS restored nitric oxide production and decreased endothelial nitric oxide synthase phosphorylation at threonine 495 levels in human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells and improved BMC angiogenic activity under high glucose condition. Last, silencing CSE by siRNA significantly increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase phosphorylation at threonine 495 levels in human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Decreased CSE-mediated H<sub>2</sub>S bioavailability is an underlying source of BMC dysfunction in diabetes mellitus. Our data indicate that H<sub>2</sub>S and overexpression of CSE in diabetic BMCs may rescue their dysfunction and open novel avenues for cell-based therapeutics of critical limb ischemia in diabetic patients.</p></sec>

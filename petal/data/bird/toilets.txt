‘Frightening’ typhoid fever outbreak spreads in Pakistan
<p>A strain of the bacterium that causes typhoid fever has become resistant to most every drug and is spreading through Pakistan, causing at least 2000 confirmed cases. The so-called extensively drug resistant (XDR) strain of <i>Salmonella typhi</i> remains susceptible to one oral antibiotic, azithromycin, but the only other options are expensive intravenous drugs that most people in Pakistan and other resource-strapped countries cannot afford. The fear is that if <i>S. typhi</i> develops resistance to azithromycin, many people will die from the disease, which leads to bowl perforation and other life-threatening complications in about 15% of untreated people. A new vaccine that for the first time works in young children and has long-lasting immunity is now being rolled out in Pakistan. But antibiotic resistance and spread are a result of poor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sanit</span></strong>ation and contaminated water supplies, which reflect the serious infrastructure problems in Hyderabad and Karachi, the two main cities affected by XDR <i>S. typhi. </i>Public health officials worry that the XDR <i>S. typhi</i> will also jump borders and soon start spreading outside of Pakistan.</p>

Nobel honors discoveries in how cells eat themselves
<p>As the stench of the streets during a garbage strike quickly drives home, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sanit</span></strong>ation workers are the unsung heroes of modern cities and towns. Similarly, the cell's garbage collectors are key to health. By performing "autophagy"—literally, self-eating—they degrade or recycle toxic protein aggregates and cell components. This week, the cell biologist who worked out the genetics and mechanics of this process received the 2016 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. When Yoshinori Ohsumi, now at the Tokyo Institute of Technology's Frontier Research Center, did his pioneering work in yeast in the early 1990s, his results drew little attention outside cell biology. But in the past 15 years, others have shown that cells' clean-up machinery is crucial to human health.</p>

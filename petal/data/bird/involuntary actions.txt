Clinical Usefulness, Angiographic Characteristics, and Safety Evaluation of Intracoronary Acetylcholine Provocation Testing Among 921 Consecutive White Patients With Unobstructed Coronary Arteries
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Coronary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spasm</span></strong> can cause myocardial ischemia and angina in patients with and those without obstructive coronary artery disease. However, provocation tests using intracoronary acetylcholine administration are rarely performed in clinical routine in the United States and Europe. Thus, we assessed the clinical usefulness, angiographic characteristics, and safety of intracoronary acetylcholine provocation testing in white patients with unobstructed coronary arteries.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>From September 2007 to June 2010, a total of 921 consecutive patients (362 men, mean age 62±12years) who underwent diagnostic angiography for suspected myocardial ischemia and were found to have unobstructed coronary arteries (no stenosis ≥50%) were enrolled. The intracoronary acetylcholine provocation testing was performed directly after angiography according to a standardized protocol. Three hundred forty-six patients (35%) reported chest pain at rest, 222 (22%) reported chest pain on exertion, 238 (24%) reported a combination of effort and resting chest pain, and 41 (4%) presented with troponin-positive acute coronary syndrome. The overall frequency of epicardial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spasm</span></strong> (>75% diameter reduction with angina and ischemic ECG shifts) was 33.4%, and the overall frequency of microvascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spasm</span></strong> (angina and ischemic ECG shifts without epicardial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spasm</span></strong>) was 24.2%. Epicardial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spasm</span></strong> was most often diffuse and located in the distal coronary segments (<i>P</i><0.01). No fatal or irreversible nonfatal complications occurred. However, 9 patients (1%) had minor complications (nonsustained ventricular tachycardia [n=1], fast paroxysmal atrial fibrillation [n=1], symptomatic bradycardia [n=6], and catheter-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spasm</span></strong> [n=1]).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Epicardial and microvascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spasm</span></strong> are frequently found in white patients with unobstructed coronary arteries. Epicardial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spasm</span></strong> is most often diffuse and located in the distal coronary segments. The intracoronary acetylcholine provocation test is a safe technique to assess coronary vasomotor function.</p></sec>

Echoes of Ebola as plague hits Madagascar
<p>Hundreds of epidemiologists and technical experts are pouring into Madagascar, one of the poorest countries in the world, to help fight an unprecedented plague epidemic. By 20 October, 1297 people had been infected and 102 had died, and cases are doubling weekly. Worries are high that the outbreak will spread to nearby countries and territories in Africa and the Indian Ocean, where governments are scrambling to prepare. Madagascar is one of the few countries in the world still hard hit by plague, which decimated Europe's population during the Black Death in the Middle Ages. The disease is endemic in the central highlands, where small outbreaks occur most years. Most are bubonic plague, transmitted from rats to humans by the bite of a flea. Now, for the first time, plague is hitting urban areas, including Antananarivo, the capital, and the port city Toamasina, and it has taken an unusual and especially menacing form: pneumonic plague, which is spread from person to person through coughing or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sneez</span></strong>ing. Without treatment, pneumonic plague is 100% fatal. Infectious disease experts say the outbreak underscores one lesson of the Ebola epidemic of 2 years ago: As cities burgeon and populations become more mobile, once-isolated diseases are increasingly likely to reach cities, where they can race out of control.</p>

Defined Engineered Human Myocardium With Advanced Maturation for Applications in Heart Failure Modeling and Repair
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Advancing structural and functional maturation of stem cell–derived cardiomyocytes remains a key challenge for applications in disease modeling, drug screening, and heart repair. Here, we sought to advance cardiomyocyte maturation in engineered human myocardium (EHM) toward an adult phenotype under defined conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We systematically investigated cell composition, matrix, and media conditions to generate EHM from embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cell–derived cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts with organotypic functionality under serum-free conditions. We used morphological, functional, and transcriptome analyses to benchmark maturation of EHM.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>EHM demonstrated important structural and functional properties of postnatal myocardium, including: (1) rod-shaped cardiomyocytes with M bands assembled as a functional syncytium; (2) systolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">twitch</span></strong> forces at a similar level as observed in bona fide postnatal myocardium; (3) a positive force-frequency response; (4) inotropic responses to β-adrenergic stimulation mediated via canonical β<sub>1</sub>- and β<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor signaling pathways; and (5) evidence for advanced molecular maturation by transcriptome profiling. EHM responded to chronic catecholamine toxicity with contractile dysfunction, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, cardiomyocyte death, and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide release; all are classical hallmarks of heart failure. In addition, we demonstrate the scalability of EHM according to anticipated clinical demands for cardiac repair.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We provide proof-of-concept for a universally applicable technology for the engineering of macroscale human myocardium for disease modeling and heart repair from embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cell–derived cardiomyocytes under defined, serum-free conditions.</p></sec>

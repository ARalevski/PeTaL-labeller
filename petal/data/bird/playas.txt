An analysis of the best method for evaluating anteversion of the acetabular component after total hip replacement on plain radiographs
<p>Several radiological methods of measuring anteversion   of the acetabular component after total hip replacement (THR) have   been described. These studies used different definitions and reference   planes to compare methods, allowing for misinterpretation of the   results. We compared the reliability and accuracy of five current   methods using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plain</span></strong> radiographs (those of Lewinnek, Widmer, Liaw,   Pradhan, and Woo and Morrey) with CT measurements, using the same   definition and reference plane. We retrospectively studied the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plain</span></strong>   radiographs and CT scans in 84 hips of 84 patients who underwent   primary THR. Intra- and inter-observer reliability were high for   the measurement of inclination and anteversion with all methods   on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plain</span></strong> radiographs and CT scans. The measurements of inclination on   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plain</span></strong> radiographs were similar to the measurements using CT (p =   0.043). The mean difference between CT measurements was 0.6° (-5.9°   to 6.8°).</p><p>Measurements using Widmer’s method were the most similar to those   using CT (p = 0.088), with a mean difference between CT measurements   of -0.9° (-10.4° to 9.1°), whereas the other four methods differed   significantly from those using CT (p < 0.001).</p><p>This study has shown that Widmer’s method is the best for evaluating   the anteversion of the acetabular component on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plain</span></strong> radiographs.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014; 96-B:597–603.</p>

Redox stratification of an ancient lake in Gale crater, Mars
<p>In 2012, NASA’s Curiosity rover landed on Mars to assess its potential as a habitat for past life and investigate the paleoclimate record preserved by sedimentary rocks inside the ~150-kilometer-diameter Gale impact crater. Geological reconstructions from Curiosity rover data have revealed an ancient, habitable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lake</span></strong> environment fed by rivers draining into the crater. We synthesize geochemical and mineralogical data from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lake</span></strong>-bed mudstones collected during the first 1300 martian solar days of rover operations in Gale. We present evidence for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lake</span></strong> redox stratification, established by depth-dependent variations in atmospheric oxidant and dissolved-solute concentrations. Paleoclimate proxy data indicate that a transition from colder to warmer climate conditions is preserved in the stratigraphy. Finally, a late phase of geochemical modification by saline fluids is recognized.</p>

Genomic Basis of Adaptive Evolution: The Survival of Amur Ide (<i>Leuciscu</i>s <i>waleckii</i>) in an Extremely Alkaline Environment
<p>The Amur ide (<i>Leuciscus waleckii</i>) is a cyprinid fish that is widely distributed in Northeast Asia. The Lake Dali Nur population inhabits one of the most extreme aquatic environments on Earth, with an alkalinity up to 50 mmol/L (pH 9.6), thus providing an exceptional model with which to characterize the mechanisms of genomic evolution underlying adaptation to extreme environments. Here, we developed the reference genome assembly for <i>L. waleckii</i> from Lake Dali Nur. Intriguingly, we identified unusual expanded long terminal repeats (LTRs) with higher nucleotide substitution rates than in many other teleosts, suggesting their more recent insertion into the <i>L. waleckii</i> genome. We also identified expansions in genes encoding egg coat proteins and natriuretic peptide receptors, possibly underlying the adaptation to extreme environmental stress. We further sequenced the genomes of 10 additional individuals from freshwater and 18 from Lake Dali Nur populations, and we detected a total of 7.6 million SNPs from both populations. In a genome scan and comparison of these two populations, we identified a set of genomic regions under selective sweeps that harbor genes involved in ion homoeostasis, acid-base regulation, unfolded protein response, reactive oxygen species elimination, and urea excretion. Our findings provide comprehensive insight into the genomic mechanisms of teleost fish that underlie their adaptation to extreme alkaline environments.</p>

Glacial lake outburst floods as drivers of fluvial erosion in the Himalaya
<p>Himalayan rivers are frequently hit by catastrophic floods that are caused by the failure of glacial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lake</span></strong> and landslide dams; however, the dynamics and long-term impacts of such floods remain poorly understood. We present a comprehensive set of observations that capture the July 2016 glacial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lake</span></strong> outburst flood (GLOF) in the Bhotekoshi/Sunkoshi River of Nepal. Seismic records of the flood provide new insights into GLOF mechanics and their ability to mobilize large boulders that otherwise prevent channel erosion. Because of this boulder mobilization, GLOF impacts far exceed those of the annual summer monsoon, and GLOFs may dominate fluvial erosion and channel-hillslope coupling many tens of kilometers downstream of glaciated areas. Long-term valley evolution in these regions may therefore be driven by GLOF frequency and magnitude, rather than by precipitation.</p>

Quantification of drought during the collapse of the classic Maya civilization
<p>The demise of Lowland Classic Maya civilization during the Terminal Classic Period (~800 to 1000 CE) is a well-cited example of how past climate may have affected ancient societies. Attempts to estimate the magnitude of hydrologic change, however, have met with equivocal success because of the qualitative and indirect nature of available climate proxy data. We reconstructed the past isotopic composition (δ<sup>18</sup>O, δD, <sup>17</sup>O-excess, and d-excess) of water in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lake</span></strong> Chichancanab, Mexico, using a technique that involves isotopic analysis of the structurally bound water in sedimentary gypsum, which was deposited under drought conditions. The triple oxygen and hydrogen isotope data provide a direct measure of past changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lake</span></strong> hydrology. We modeled the data and conclude that annual precipitation decreased between 41 and 54% (with intervals of up to 70% rainfall reduction during peak drought conditions) and that relative humidity declined by 2 to 7% compared to present-day conditions.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Genetic Architecture and Molecular Networks Underlying Leaf Thickness in Desert-Adapted Tomato <i>Solanum pennellii</i>
<p>Thicker leaves allow plants to grow in water-limited conditions. However, our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of this highly functional leaf shape trait is poor. We used a custom-built confocal profilometer to directly measure leaf thickness in a set of introgression lines (ILs) derived from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">desert</span></strong> tomato <i>Solanum pennellii</i> and identified quantitative trait loci. We report evidence of a complex genetic architecture of this trait and roles for both genetic and environmental factors. Several ILs with thick leaves have dramatically elongated palisade mesophyll cells and, in some cases, increased leaf ploidy. We characterized the thick IL2-5 and IL4-3 in detail and found increased mesophyll cell size and leaf ploidy levels, suggesting that endoreduplication underpins leaf thickness in tomato. Next, we queried the transcriptomes and inferred dynamic Bayesian networks of gene expression across early leaf ontogeny in these lines to compare the molecular networks that pattern leaf thickness. We show that thick ILs share <i>S. pennellii</i>-like expression profiles for putative regulators of cell shape and meristem determinacy as well as a general signature of cell cycle-related gene expression. However, our network data suggest that leaf thickness in these two lines is patterned at least partially by distinct mechanisms. Consistent with this hypothesis, double homozygote lines combining introgression segments from these two ILs show additive phenotypes, including thick leaves, higher ploidy levels, and larger palisade mesophyll cells. Collectively, these data establish a framework of genetic, anatomical, and molecular mechanisms that pattern leaf thickness in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">desert</span></strong>-adapted tomato.</p>

The influence of cartilage thickness at the sigmoid notch on inclination at the distal radioulnar joint
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of this study were: firstly, to investigate the influence   of the thickness of cartilage at the sigmoid notch on the inclination   of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ), and secondly, to compare   the sensitivity and specificity of MRI with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plain</span></strong> radiographs for   the assessment of the inclination of the articular surface of the   DRUJ in the coronal plane. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Contemporaneous MRI images and radiographs of 100 wrists from   98 asymptomatic patients (mean age 43 years, (16 to 67); 52 male,   53%) with no history of a fracture involving the wrist or surgery   to the wrist, were reviewed. The thickness of the cartilage at the   sigmoid notch, inclination of the DRUJ and Tolat Type of each DRUJ   were determined. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The assessment using MRI scans and cortical bone correlated well   with radiographs, with a kappa value of 0.83. The mean difference   between the inclination using the cortex and cartilage on MRI scans   was 12°, leading to a change of Tolat type of inclination in 66%   of wrists. No reverse oblique (Type 3) inclinations were found when   using the cartilage to assess inclination. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion </title><p>These data revealed that when measuring the inclination of the   DRUJ using cartilage, reverse oblique inclinations might not exist.   The data suggest that performing an ulna shortening osteotomy might   be reasonable even in distal radioulnar joints where the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plain</span></strong> radiographic   appearance suggests an unfavourable reverse oblique inclination   in the coronal plane. We recommend using MRI to validate radiographs   in those that appear to be reverse oblique (Tolat Type 3), as the   true inclination might be different, thereby removing one possible   contraindication to ulnar shortening.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:369–75.</p></sec>

A 90,000-year record of Afromontane forest responses to climate change
<p>Pollen records from African highlands are scarce; hence, the paleoecology of the Afromontane forest and its responses to glacial cycles are poorly known. Lake Bambili (Cameroon) provides a record of vegetation changes in the tropical mountains of Africa over the past 90,000 years, with high temporal resolution. Pollen data and biome reconstructions show a diverging response of forests to climate changes; the upper tree line was extremely unstable, shifting substantially in response to glacial-interglacial climate alternation, whereas the transition between the montane and lowland forests remained remarkably stable. Such ecological instability may have had a critical influence on species richness in the Afromontane forests.</p>

Agouti-related peptide 2 facilitates convergent evolution of stripe patterns across cichlid fish radiations
<p>The color patterns of African cichlid fishes provide notable examples of phenotypic convergence. Across the more than 1200 East African rift <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lake</span></strong> species, melanic horizontal stripes have evolved numerous times. We discovered that regulatory changes of the gene <i>agouti-related peptide 2</i> (<i>agrp2</i>) act as molecular switches controlling this evolutionarily labile phenotype. Reduced <i>agrp2</i> expression is convergently associated with the presence of stripe patterns across species flocks. However, cis-regulatory mutations are not predictive of stripes across radiations, suggesting independent regulatory mechanisms. Genetic mapping confirms the link between the <i>agrp2</i> locus and stripe patterns. The crucial role of <i>agrp2</i> is further supported by a CRISPR-Cas9 knockout that reconstitutes stripes in a nonstriped cichlid. Thus, we unveil how a single gene affects the convergent evolution of a complex color pattern.</p>

Climate model shows large-scale wind and solar farms in the Sahara increase rain and vegetation
<p>Wind and solar farms offer a major pathway to clean, renewable energies. However, these farms would significantly change land surface properties, and, if sufficiently large, the farms may lead to unintended climate consequences. In this study, we used a climate model with dynamic vegetation to show that large-scale installations of wind and solar farms covering the Sahara lead to a local temperature increase and more than a twofold precipitation increase, especially in the Sahel, through increased surface friction and reduced albedo. The resulting increase in vegetation further enhances precipitation, creating a positive albedo–precipitation–vegetation feedback that contributes ~80% of the precipitation increase for wind farms. This local enhancement is scale dependent and is particular to the Sahara, with small impacts in other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">desert</span></strong>s.</p>

Sex reversal following deletion of a single distal enhancer of <i>Sox9</i>
<p>Cell fate decisions require appropriate regulation of key genes. <i>Sox9</i>, a direct target of SRY, is pivotal in mammalian sex determination. In vivo high-throughput chromatin accessibility techniques, transgenic assays, and genome editing revealed several novel gonadal regulatory elements in the 2-megabase gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">desert</span></strong> upstream of <i>Sox9</i>. Although others are redundant, enhancer 13 (Enh13), a 557–base pair element located 565 kilobases 5′ from the transcriptional start site, is essential to initiate mouse testis development; its deletion results in XY females with <i>Sox9</i> transcript levels equivalent to those in XX gonads. Our data are consistent with the time-sensitive activity of SRY and indicate a strict order of enhancer usage. Enh13 is conserved and embedded within a 32.5-kilobase region whose deletion in humans is associated with XY sex reversal, suggesting that it is also critical in humans.</p>

Environmental dynamics during the onset of the Middle Stone Age in eastern Africa
<p>Development of the African Middle Stone Age (MSA) before 300,000 years ago raises the question of how environmental change influenced the evolution of behaviors characteristic of early <i>Homo sapiens</i>. We used temporally well-constrained sedimentological and paleoenvironmental data to investigate environmental dynamics before and after the appearance of the early MSA in the Olorgesailie basin, Kenya. In contrast to the Acheulean archeological record in the same basin, MSA sites are associated with a markedly different faunal community, more pronounced erosion-deposition cycles, tectonic activity, and enhanced wet-dry variability. Aspects of Acheulean technology in this region imply that, as early as 615,000 years ago, greater stone material selectivity and wider resource procurement coincided with an increased pace of land-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lake</span></strong> fluctuation, potentially anticipating the adaptability of MSA hominins.</p>

Genomic estimation of complex traits reveals ancient maize adaptation to temperate North America
<p>By 4000 years ago, people had introduced maize to the southwestern United States; full agriculture was established quickly in the lowland <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">desert</span></strong>s but delayed in the temperate highlands for 2000 years. We test if the earliest upland maize was adapted for early flowering, a characteristic of modern temperate maize. We sequenced fifteen 1900-year-old maize cobs from Turkey Pen Shelter in the temperate Southwest. Indirectly validated genomic models predicted that Turkey Pen maize was marginally adapted with respect to flowering, as well as short, tillering, and segregating for yellow kernel color. Temperate adaptation drove modern population differentiation and was selected in situ from ancient standing variation. Validated prediction of polygenic traits improves our understanding of ancient phenotypes and the dynamics of environmental adaptation.</p>

Water harvesting from air with metal-organic frameworks powered by natural sunlight

Archaeal (Per)Chlorate Reduction at High Temperature: An Interplay of Biotic and Abiotic Reactions
<sec><title>Archaea Powered by Rocket Fuel</title><p>Perchlorate is a ubiquitous chlorine-based compound that forms naturally in the atmosphere. It is only present in large deposits in a few locations, such as the Atacama Desert in Chile, which has been assumed to be because perchlorate-reducing bacteria normally degrade it into chloride and oxygen. <bold>Liebensteiner <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 85; see the Perspective by <bold>Nerenberg</bold>), however, found that an archeon, <i>Archaeoglobus fulgidus</i>, can also reduce perchlorate. The archaeal perchlorate reduction pathway shares limited similarity with bacterial perchlorate reduction: Instead of producing chloride and oxygen, enzymatically produced chlorite reacts with sulfide to produce oxidized sulfur compounds. Because hyperthermophilic anaerobic archaea similar to <i>A. fulgidus</i> are thought to have been among the first complex organisms to evolve on Earth, they may have started creating oxidized conditions in some habitats before the emergence of oxygen-generating photosynthesis.</p></sec>

Non-visual numerical discrimination in a blind cavefish (<i>Phreatichthys andruzzii</i>)
<p>Over a decade of comparative studies, researchers have found that rudimentary numerical abilities are widespread among vertebrates. While experiments in mammals and birds have employed a variety of stimuli (visual, auditory and tactile), all fish studies involved visual stimuli and it is unknown whether fish can process numbers in other sensory modalities. To fill this gap, we studied numerical abilities in <i>Phreatichthys andruzzii</i>, a blind cave-dwelling species that evolved in the phreatic layer of the Somalia <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">desert</span></strong>. Fish were trained to receive a food reward to discriminate between two groups of objects placed in opposite positions of their home tank. In Experiment 1, subjects learned to discriminate between two and six objects, with stimuli not controlled for non-numerical continuous variables that co-vary with numbers, such as total area occupied by stimuli or density. In Experiment 2, the discrimination was two versus four, with half of the stimuli controlled for continuous quantities and half not controlled for continuous quantities. The subjects discriminated only the latter condition, indicating that they spontaneously used non-numerical information, as other vertebrates tested in similar experiments. In Experiments 3 and 4, cavefish trained from the beginning only with stimuli controlled for continuous quantities proved able to learn the discrimination of quantities based on the sole numerical information. However, their numerical acuity was lower than that reported in other teleost fish tested with visual stimuli.</p>

The validity and reproducibility of cross table radiographs compared with CT scans for the measurement of anteversion of the acetabular component after total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to assess the reproducibility and validity   of cross table radiographs for measuring the anteversion of the   acetabular component after total hip arthroplasty (THA) and to compare   it with measurements using CT scans.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 29 patients who underwent THA between June 2010 and   January 2016 were included. There were 17 men and 12 women. Their   mean age was 43 years (26 to 65). Seven patients underwent a bilateral   procedure. Thus, 36 THAs were included in the study. Lateral radiographs   and CT scans were obtained post-operatively and radiographs repeated   three weeks later. The anteversion of the acetabular component was   measured using the method described by Woo and Morrey and the ischiolateral   method described by Pulos et al and these were compared with the   results obtained from CT scans.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean anteversion was 18.35° (3° to 38°) using Woo and Morrey’s   method, 51.45° (30° to 85°) using the ischiolateral method and 21.22°   (2° to 48°) using CT scans. The Pearson correlation coefficient   was 0.754 for Woo and Morrey’s method and 0.925 for the ischiolateral   method. There was a linear correlation between the measurements   using the ischiolateral method and those using CT scans. We derived   a simple linear equation between the value of the CT scan and that   of ischiolateral method to deduce the CT scan value from that of ischiolateral   method and <i>vice versa</i>. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The anteversion of the acetabular component measured using both   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plain</span></strong> radiographic methods was consistently valid with good interobserver   reproducibility, but the ischiolateral method which is independent   of pelvic tilt was more accurate. As CT is costly, associated with   a high dose of radiation and not readily available, the ischiolateral method   can be used for assessing the anteversion of the acetabular component.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1006–11.</p></sec>

High prevalence of noise following Delta ceramic-on-ceramic total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We evaluated the short-term functional outcome and prevalence   of bearing-specific generation of audible noise in 301 patients   (336 hips) operated on with fourth generation (Delta) medium diameter   head, ceramic-on-ceramic (CoC) total hip arthroplasties (THAs).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>There were 191 female (63%) and 110 male patients (37%) with   a mean age of 61 years (29 to 78) and mean follow-up of 2.1 years   (1.3 to 3.4). Patients completed three questionnaires: Oxford Hip   Score (OHS), Research and Development 36-item health survey (RAND-36)   and a noise-specific symptom questionnaire. Plain radiographs were also   analysed. A total of three hips (0.9%) were revised. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were 52 patients (54 hips, 17%) who reported noise, and   in 25 (48%) of them the noise was frequently heard. In the multiple   regression analysis, the only independent risk factor for noise   was a specific THA brand, with a threefold increased risk (95% confidence   intervals 1.39 to 6.45, p = 0.005) of noise compared with the reference   THA brand. Patients with noisy hips had lower median OHS (43 <i>versus</i> 46.5,   p = 0.002) and their physical functioning (p = 0.021) subscale in   RAND-36 was reduced.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Noise was surprisingly common in this population.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:44–50.</p></sec>

Tuberculosis of the spine with severe angular kyphosis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To address the natural history of severe post-tuberculous (TB)   kyphosis, with focus upon the long-term neurological outcome, occurrence   of restrictive lung disease, and the effect on life expectancy. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This is a retrospective clinical review of prospectively collected   imaging data based at a single institute. A total of 24 patients   of Southern Chinese origin who presented with spinal TB with a mean   of 113° of kyphosis (65° to 159°) who fulfilled inclusion criteria   were reviewed. Plain radiographs were used to assess the degree   of spinal deformity. Myelography, CT and MRI were used when available   to assess the integrity of the spinal cord and canal. Patient demographics,   age of onset of spinal TB and interventions, types of surgical procedure,   intra- and post-operative complications, and neurological status   were assessed. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>All except one of the 24 patients were treated with anti-TB chemotherapy   when they were first diagnosed with spinal TB. They subsequently   received surgery either for neurological deterioration, or deformity   correction in later life. The mean follow-up was 34 years (11 to   59) since these surgical interventions. Some 16 patients (66.7%) suffered   from late neurological deterioration at a mean of 26 years (8 to   49) after the initial drug treatment. The causes of neurological   deterioration were healed disease in nine patients (56.2%),    re-activation in six patients (37.5%) and adjacent level spinal   stenosis in one patient (6.3%). The result of surgery was worse   in healed disease. Eight patients without neurological deterioration   received surgery to correct the kyphosis. The mean correction ranged   from 97° to 72°. Three patients who were clinically quiescent with   no neurological deterioration were found to have active TB of the   spine. Solid fusion was achieved in all cases and no patient suffered   from neurological deterioration after 42 years of follow-up. On   final follow-up, six patients were noted to have deceased (age range:   47 years to 75 years).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study presents one of the longest assessments of spinal TB   with severe kyphosis. Severe post-TB kyphosis may lead to significant   health problems many years following the initial drug treatment.   Early surgical correction of the kyphosis, solid fusion and regular   surveillance may avoid late complications. Paraplegia, restrictive   lung disease and early onset kyphosis might relate to early death.   Clinically quiescent disease does not mean cure. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1381–8.</p></sec>

Outcomes after extensive manual curettage and limited burring for atypical cartilaginous tumour of long bone
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Adjuvant treatment after intralesional curettage for atypical   cartilaginous tumours (ACTs) of long bones is widely accepted for   extending surgical margins. However, evaluating the isolated effect   of adjuvant treatment is difficult, and it is unclear whether not   using such adjuvants provides poor oncological outcomes. Hence,   we analyzed whether intralesional curettage without cryosurgery   or chemical adjuvants provides poor oncological outcomes in patients   with an ACT.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 24 patients (nine men, 15 women) (mean age 45 years;   18 to 62) were treated for ACTs of long bones and followed up for   a median of 66 months (interquartile range 50 to 84). All patients   were treated with extensive manual curettage and limited burring.   Bone cement and grafts were used to fill bone defects in 16 and eight   patients, respectively. No chemical adjuvants or cryosurgery were   used.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>No local recurrence was detectable on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plain</span></strong> radiographs and MRI   or CT images. At the last follow-up, there were no distant metastases   or disease-specific deaths. No procedure-related complications or   postoperative fractures developed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Intralesional curettage without cryosurgery or chemical adjuvants   may provide excellent oncological outcomes for patients with ACTs   of long bones, without the risk of complications related to adjuvant   use. Our investigation suggests thorough curettage alone is a reasonable   treatment option for ACT. However, we acknowledge the limited size   of our investigation warrants a multicentre collaborative study   to confirm our findings.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:256–61.</p></sec>

Gene Capture Coupled to High-Throughput Sequencing as a Strategy for Targeted Metagenome Exploration
<p>Next-generation sequencing (NGS) allows faster acquisition of metagenomic data, but complete exploration of complex ecosystems is hindered by the extraordinary diversity of microorganisms. To reduce the environmental complexity, we created an innovative solution hybrid selection (SHS) method that is combined with NGS to characterize large DNA fragments harbouring biomarkers of interest. The quality of enrichment was evaluated after fragments containing the methyl coenzyme M reductase subunit A gene (<i>mcrA</i>), the biomarker of methanogenesis, were captured from a <i>Methanosarcina</i> strain and a metagenomic sample from a meromictic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lake</span></strong>. The methanogen diversity was compared with direct metagenome and <i>mcrA</i>-based amplicon pyrosequencing strategies<i>.</i> The SHS approach resulted in the capture of DNA fragments up to 2.5 kb with an enrichment efficiency between 41 and 100%, depending on the sample complexity. Compared with direct metagenome and amplicons sequencing, SHS detected broader <i>mcrA</i> diversity, and it allowed efficient sampling of the rare biosphere and unknown sequences. In contrast to amplicon-based strategies, SHS is less biased and GC independent, and it recovered complete biomarker sequences in addition to conserved regions. Because this method can also isolate the regions flanking the target sequences, it could facilitate operon reconstructions.</p>

Randomized Comparison of Paclitaxel-Eluting Balloon and Stenting Versus Plain Balloon Plus Stenting Versus Directional Atherectomy for Femoral Artery Disease (ISAR-STATH)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Atherosclerosis in the superficial femoral artery is common in patients suffering from peripheral artery disease. Paclitaxel-eluting balloon (PEB) angioplasty, stenting, and directional atherectomy (DA) have provided new options for the treatment of superficial femoral artery disease; however, the comparative efficacy of these interventional strategies remains uncertain.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>One hundred and fifty-five patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease due to de novo superficial femoral artery stenotic or occlusive lesions were randomized to treatment with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plain</span></strong> balloon angioplasty (BA) followed by PEB angioplasty and stenting (n=48), BA and stenting (n=52), or DA with distal protection and bailout stenting (n=55). The primary end point of the study was percentage diameter stenosis after 6 months measured by angiography. Other end points included target lesion revascularization, thrombosis, ipsilateral amputation, binary restenosis, and all-cause mortality at 6 and 24 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Baseline and lesion characteristics were comparable in all groups with a mean lesion length of 65.9±46.8 mm and 56% total occlusions. At 6 months angiography, the percent diameter stenosis was significantly lower in patients treated by PEB angioplasty and stenting (34±31%) as compared with BA angioplasty and stenting (56±29%, <i>P</i>=0.009) or DA (55±29%, <i>P</i>=0.007). Similarly, binary restenosis was significantly lower after treatment with PEB and stenting as compared with BA and stenting or DA. Clinical follow-up at 24 months revealed a lower risk for target lesion revascularization after PEB angioplasty and stenting as compared with BA and stenting or DA. We found no difference in terms of target lesion thrombosis and mortality among groups, and no patient underwent amputation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Treatment of de novo superficial femoral artery lesions with PEB angioplasty and stenting is superior to BA angioplasty and stenting or DA in terms of angiographic diameter stenosis at 6 months and target lesion revascularization at 24 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

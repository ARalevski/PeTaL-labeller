Assessment of methane emissions from the U.S. oil and gas supply chain
<p>Methane emissions from the U.S. oil and natural gas supply chain were estimated by using ground-based, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">facil</span></strong>ity-scale measurements and validated with aircraft observations in areas accounting for ~30% of U.S. gas production. When scaled up nationally, our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">facil</span></strong>ity-based estimate of 2015 supply chain emissions is 13 ± 2 teragrams per year, equivalent to 2.3% of gross U.S. gas production. This value is ~60% higher than the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency inventory estimate, likely because existing inventory methods miss emissions released during abnormal operating conditions. Methane emissions of this magnitude, per unit of natural gas consumed, produce radiative forcing over a 20-year time horizon comparable to the CO<sub>2</sub> from natural gas combustion. Substantial emission reductions are feasible through rapid detection of the root causes of high emissions and deployment of less failure-prone systems.</p>

Digitization of multistep organic synthesis in reactionware for on-demand pharmaceuticals
<p>Chemical manufacturing is often done at large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">facil</span></strong>ities that require a sizable capital investment and then produce key compounds for a finite period. We present an approach to the manufacturing of fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals in a self-contained plastic reactionware device. The device was designed and constructed by using a chemical to computer-automated design (ChemCAD) approach that enables the translation of traditional bench-scale synthesis into a platform-independent digital code. This in turn guides production of a three-dimensional printed device that encloses the entire synthetic route internally via simple operations. We demonstrate the approach for the γ-aminobutyric acid receptor agonist, (±)-baclofen, establishing a concept that paves the way for the local manufacture of drugs outside of specialist <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">facil</span></strong>ities.</p>

Do higher-volume hospitals provide better value in revision hip and knee arthroplasty?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The purpose of this study is to determine if higher volume hospitals   have lower costs in revision hip and knee arthroplasty.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We questioned the Centres for Medicare and Medicaid Services   (CMS) Inpatient Charge Data and identified 789 hospitals performing   a total of 29 580 revision arthroplasties in 2014. Centres were   dichotomised into high-volume (performing over 50 revision cases   per year) and low-volume. Mean total hospital-specific charges and   inpatient payments were obtained from the database and stratified   based on Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) codes.

While high-volume hospitals had   higher Medicare inpatient payments for DRG 467 ($21 458 <i>versus</i> $20 632,   p = 0.038) and DRG 468 ($17 003 <i>versus</i> $16 120,   p = 0.011), there was no difference in hospital specific charges   between the groups.

Ventricular Fibrillation Conversion Testing After Implantation of a Subcutaneous Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Compared with transvenous implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), subcutaneous (S)-ICDs require a higher energy for effective defibrillation. Although ventricular fibrillation conversion testing (CT) is recommended after S-ICD implantation to ensure an adequate margin between the defibrillation threshold and maximum device output (80J), prior work found that adherence to this recommendation is declining.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied first-time recipients of S-ICDs (between September 28, 2012, and April 1, 2016) in the National Cardiovascular Database Registry ICD Registry to determine predictors of use of CT, predictors of an insufficient safety margin (ISM, defined as ventricular fibrillation conversion energy >65J) during testing, and inhospital outcomes associated with use of CT. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to predict use of CT and ISM. Inverse probability weighted logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between use of CT and inhospital adverse events including death.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>CT testing was performed in 70.7% (n=5624) of 7960 patients with S-ICDs. Although deferral of CT was associated with several patient characteristics (including increased body mass index, increased body surface area, severely reduced ejection fraction, dialysis dependence, warfarin use, anemia, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">facil</span></strong>ity effect was comparatively more important (area under the curve for patient level versus generalized linear mixed model: 0.619 versus 0.877). An ISM occurred in 6.9% (n=336) of 4864 patients without a prior ICD and was more common among white patients and those with ventricular pacing on the preimplant ECG, higher preimplant blood pressure, larger body surface area, higher body mass index, and lower ejection fraction. A risk score was able to identify patients at low (<5%), medium (5% to 10%), and high risk (>10%) for ISM. CT testing was not associated with a composite of inhospital complications including death.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Use of CT testing after S-ICD implantation was driven by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">facil</span></strong>ity preference to a greater extent than patient factors and was not associated with a composite of inhospital complications or death. ISM was relatively uncommon and is associated with several widely available patient characteristics. These data may inform ICD system selection and a targeted approach to CT.</p></sec>

Quality of Care at Hospitals Identified as Outliers in Publicly Reported Mortality Statistics for Percutaneous Coronary Intervention
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Public reporting of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) outcomes may create disincentives for physicians to provide care for critically ill patients, particularly at institutions with worse clinical outcomes. We thus sought to evaluate the procedural management and in-hospital outcomes of patients treated for acute myocardial infarction before and after a hospital had been publicly identified as a negative outlier.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using state reports, we identified hospitals that were recognized as negative PCI outliers in 2 states (Massachusetts and New York) from 2002 to 2012. State hospitalization files were used to identify all patients with an acute myocardial infarction within these states. Procedural management and in-hospital outcomes were compared among patients treated at outlier hospitals before and after public report of outlier status. Patients at nonoutlier institutions were used to control for temporal trends.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 86 hospitals, 31 were reported as outliers for excess mortality. Outlier <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">facil</span></strong>ities were larger, treating more patients with acute myocardial infarction and performing more PCIs than nonoutlier hospitals (<i>P</i><0.05 for each). Among 507 672 patients with acute myocardial infarction hospitalized at these institutions, 108 428 (21%) were treated at an outlier hospital after public report. The likelihood of PCI at outlier (relative risk [RR], 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12–1.15) and nonoutlier institutions (RR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.11–1.14) increased in a similar fashion (interaction <i>P</i>=0.50) after public report of outlier status. The likelihood of in-hospital mortality decreased at outlier institutions (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.81–0.85) after public report, and to a lesser degree at nonoutlier institutions (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.87–0.92; interaction <i>P</i><0.001). Among patients that underwent PCI, in-hospital mortality decreased at outlier institutions after public recognition of outlier status in comparison with prior (RR, 0.72; 9% CI, 0.66–0.79), a decline that exceeded the reduction at nonoutlier institutions (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.80–0.96; interaction <i>P</i><0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Large hospitals with higher clinical volume are more likely to be designated as negative outliers. The rates of percutaneous revascularization increased similarly at outlier and nonoutlier institutions after report of outlier status. After outlier designation, in-hospital mortality declined at outlier institutions to a greater extent than was observed at nonoutlier <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">facil</span></strong>ities.</p></sec>

Synchrotron radiation from an accelerating light pulse
<p>Synchrotron radiation—namely, electromagnetic radiation produced by charges moving in a curved path—is regularly generated at large-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">facil</span></strong>ities where giga–electron volt electrons move along kilometer-long circular paths. We use a metasurface to bend light and demonstrate synchrotron radiation produced by a subpicosecond pulse, which moves along a circular arc of radius 100 micrometers inside a nonlinear crystal. The emitted radiation, in the terahertz frequency range, results from the nonlinear polarization induced by the pulse. The generation of synchrotron radiation from a pulse revolving about a circular trajectory holds promise for the development of on-chip terahertz sources.</p>

Congo rapidly curtails Ebola
<p>An outbreak of Ebola that surfaced in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) on 8 May has petered out and, for the first time, a vaccine may have had a role in containing spread. To date, Ebola has s<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">truck</span></strong> 53 people in the DRC's Équateur province, killing 29. Most everyone lived in remote, difficult-to-reach villages, although four cases surfaced in the heavily populated city of Mbandaka, triggering serious concerns of an epidemic exploding. A vigorous, rapid effort to contain spread began immediately, with the DRC's Ministry of Public Health working with international partners to build treatment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">facil</span></strong>ities, conduct surveillance, and trace contacts of cases. On 21 May, a vaccine effort began that focused on creating a "ring" around cases by vaccinating people they may have come in contact with directly or indirectly. Some 3300 people received the vaccine, which is still experimental and was given in a clinical trial. But the trial did not have a control group, so it will not be possible to assess the precise role, if any, it played in stopping spread. Then again, no one who received the vaccine developed the disease as of yet, and researchers noted that simply providing it helped with Ebola education.</p>

Cobalt-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of enamides enabled by single-electron reduction
<p>Identifying catalyst activation modes that exploit one-electron chemistry and overcome associated deactivation pathways will be transformative for developing first-row transition metal catalysts with performance equal or, ideally, superior to precious metals. Here we describe a zinc-activation method compatible with high-throughput reaction discovery that identified scores of cobalt-phosphine combinations for the asymmetric hydrogenation of functionalized alkenes. An optimized catalyst prepared from (<i>R</i>,<i>R</i>)-Ph-BPE {Ph-BPE, 1,2-bis[(2<i>R</i>,5<i>R</i>)-2,5-diphenylphospholano]ethane} and cobalt chloride [CoCl<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O] exhibited high activity and enantioselectivity in protic media and enabled the asymmetric synthesis of the epilepsy medication levetiracetam at 200-gram scale with 0.08 mole % catalyst loading. Stoichiometric studies established that the cobalt (II) catalyst precursor (<i>R</i>,<i>R</i>)-Ph-BPECoCl<sub>2</sub> underwent ligand displacement by methanol, and zinc promoted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">facil</span></strong>e one-electron reduction to cobalt (I), which more stably bound the phosphine.</p>

Polyamide membranes with nanoscale Turing structures for water purification
<p>The emergence of Turing structures is of fundamental importance, and designing these structures and developing their applications have practical effects in chemistry and biology. We use a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">facil</span></strong>e route based on interfacial polymerization to generate Turing-type polyamide membranes for water purification. Manipulation of shapes by control of reaction conditions enabled the creation of membranes with bubble or tube structures. These membranes exhibit excellent water-salt separation performance that surpasses the upper-bound line of traditional desalination membranes. Furthermore, we show the existence of high water permeability sites in the Turing structures, where water transport through the membranes is enhanced.</p>

Single-stranded DNA and RNA origami
<p>Self-folding of an information-carrying polymer into a defined structure is foundational to biology and offers attractive potential as a synthetic strategy. Although multicomponent self-assembly has produced complex synthetic nanostructures, unimolecular folding has seen limited progress. We describe a framework to design and synthesize a single DNA or RNA strand to self-fold into a complex yet unknotted structure that approximates an arbitrary user-prescribed shape. We experimentally construct diverse multikilobase single-stranded structures, including a ~10,000-nucleotide (nt) DNA structure and a ~6000-nt RNA structure. We demonstrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">facil</span></strong>e replication of the strand in vitro and in living cells. The work here thus establishes unimolecular folding as a general strategy for constructing complex and replicable nucleic acid nanostructures, and expands the design space and material scalability for bottom-up nanotechnology.</p>

Scalable synthesis of bryostatin 1 and analogs, adjuvant leads against latent HIV
<p>Bryostatin 1 is an exceedingly scarce marine-derived natural product that is in clinical development directed at HIV/AIDS eradication, cancer immunotherapy, and the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. Despite this unique portfolio of indications, its availability has been limited and variable, thus impeding research and clinical studies. Here, we report a total synthesis of bryostatin 1 that proceeds in 29 total steps (19 in the longest linear sequence, >80% average yield per step), collectively produces grams of material, and can be scaled to meet clinical needs (~20 grams per year). This practical solution to the bryostatin supply problem also opens broad, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">facil</span></strong>e, and efficient access to derivatives and potentially superior analogs.</p>

Mechanochemical unzipping of insulating polyladderene to semiconducting polyacetylene
<p>Biological systems sense and respond to mechanical stimuli in a complex manner. In an effort to develop synthetic materials that transduce mechanical force into multifold changes in their intrinsic properties, we report on a mechanochemically responsive nonconjugated polymer that converts to a conjugated polymer via an extensive rearrangement of the macromolecular structure in response to force. Our design is based on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">facil</span></strong>e mechanochemical unzipping of polyladderene, a polymer inspired by a lipid natural product structure and prepared via direct metathesis polymerization. The resultant polyacetylene block copolymers exhibit long conjugation length and uniform trans-configuration and self-assemble into semiconducting nanowires. Calculations support a tandem unzipping mechanism of the ladderene units.</p>

Low-temperature activation of methane on the IrO<sub>2</sub>(110) surface
<p>Methane undergoes highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">facil</span></strong>e C–H bond cleavage on the stoichiometric IrO<sub>2</sub>(110) surface. From temperature-programmed reaction spectroscopy experiments, we found that methane molecularly adsorbed as a strongly bound σ complex on IrO<sub>2</sub>(110) and that a large fraction of the adsorbed complexes underwent C–H bond cleavage at temperatures as low as 150 kelvin (K). The initial dissociation probability of methane on IrO<sub>2</sub>(110) decreased from 80 to 20% with increasing surface temperature from 175 to 300 K. We estimate that the activation energy for methane C–H bond cleavage is 9.5 kilojoule per mole (kJ/mol) lower than the binding energy of the adsorbed precursor on IrO<sub>2</sub>(110), and equal to a value of ~28.5 kJ/mol. Low-temperature activation may avoid unwanted side reactions in the development of catalytic processes to selectively convert methane to value-added products.</p>

We used this source to follow previously unexamined light-induced chemical reactions in the lowest electronic states of isolated CF<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and SF<sub>6</sub><sup>+</sup> molecules in the gas phase. By probing element-specific core-to-valence transitions at the carbon K-edge or the sulfur L-edges, we characterized their reaction paths and observed the effect of symmetry breaking through the splitting of absorption bands and Rydberg-valence mixing induced by the geometry changes.</p>

A general, modular method for the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of alkylboronate esters
<p>Alkylboron compounds are an important family of target molecules, serving as useful intermediates, as well as end points, in fields such as pharmaceutical science and organic chemistry. Facile transformation of carbon-boron bonds into a wide variety of carbon-X bonds (where X is, for example, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, or a halogen), with stereochemical fidelity, renders the generation of enantioenriched alkylboronate esters a powerful tool in synthesis. Here we report the use of a chiral nickel catalyst to achieve stereoconvergent alkyl-alkyl couplings of readily available racemic α-haloboronates with organozinc reagents under mild conditions. We demonstrate that this method provides straightforward access to a diverse array of enantioenriched alkylboronate esters, in which boron is bound to a stereogenic carbon, and we highlight the utility of these compounds in synthesis.</p>

The millimeter-thick synthetic nacre consists of alternating organic layers and aragonite platelet layers (91 weight percent) and exhibits good ultimate strength and fracture toughness. This predesigned matrix-directed mineralization method represents a rational strategy for the preparation of robust composite materials with hierarchically ordered structures, where various constituents are adaptable, including brittle and heat-labile materials.</p>

MoChlo: A Versatile, Modular Cloning Toolbox for Chloroplast Biotechnology
<p>Plant synthetic biology is a rapidly evolving field with new tools constantly emerging to drive innovation. Of particular interest is the application of synthetic biology to chloroplast biotechnology to generate plants capable of producing new metabolites, vaccines, biofuels, and high-value chemicals. Progress made in the assembly of large DNA molecules, composing multiple transcriptional units, has significantly aided in the ability to rapidly construct novel vectors for genetic engineering. In particular, Golden Gate assembly has provided a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">facil</span></strong>e molecular tool for standardized assembly of synthetic genetic elements into larger DNA constructs. In this work, a complete modular chloroplast cloning system, MoChlo, was developed and validated for fast and flexible chloroplast engineering in plants. A library of 128 standardized chloroplast-specific parts (47 promoters, 38 5′ untranslated regions [5′UTRs], nine promoter:5′UTR fusions, 10 3′UTRs, 14 genes of interest, and 10 chloroplast-specific destination vectors) were mined from the literature and modified for use in MoChlo assembly, along with chloroplast-specific destination vectors. The strategy was validated by assembling synthetic operons of various sizes and determining the efficiency of assembly. This method was successfully used to generate chloroplast transformation vectors containing up to seven transcriptional units in a single vector (∼10.6-kb synthetic operon). To enable researchers with limited resources to engage in chloroplast biotechnology, and to accelerate progress in the field, the entire kit, as described, is available through Addgene at minimal cost. Thus, the MoChlo kit represents a valuable tool for fast and flexible design of heterologous metabolic pathways for plastid metabolic engineering.</p>

Reduced Arogenate Dehydratase Expression: Ramifications for Photosynthesis and Metabolism
<p>Arogenate dehydratase (ADT) catalyzes the final step of phenylalanine (Phe) biosynthesis. Previous work showed that ADT-deficient Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants had significantly reduced lignin contents, with stronger reductions in lines that had deficiencies in more ADT isoforms. Here, by analyzing Arabidopsis <i>ADT</i> mutants using our phenomics <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">facil</span></strong>ity and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, we describe the effects of the modulation of ADT on photosynthetic parameters and secondary metabolism. Our data indicate that a reduced carbon flux into Phe biosynthesis in <i>ADT</i> mutants impairs the consumption of photosynthetically produced ATP, leading to an increased ATP/ADP ratio, the overaccumulation of transitory starch, and lower electron transport rates. The effect on electron transport rates is caused by an increase in proton motive force across the thylakoid membrane that down-regulates photosystem II activity by the high-energy quenching mechanism. Furthermore, quantitation of secondary metabolites in <i>ADT</i> mutants revealed reduced flavonoid, phenylpropanoid, lignan, and glucosinolate contents, including glucosinolates that are not derived from aromatic amino acids, and significantly increased contents of putative galactolipids and apocarotenoids. Additionally, we used real-time atmospheric monitoring mass spectrometry to compare respiration and carbon fixation rates between the wild type and <i>adt3/4/5/6</i>, our most extreme <i>ADT</i> knockout mutant, which revealed no significant difference in both night- and day-adapted plants. Overall, these data reveal the profound effects of altered ADT activity and Phe metabolism on secondary metabolites and photosynthesis with implications for plant improvement.</p>

Femtosecond electron-phonon lock-in by photoemission and x-ray free-electron laser
<p>The interactions that lead to the emergence of superconductivity in iron-based materials remain a subject of debate. It has been suggested that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> correlations enhance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-phonon coupling in iron selenide (FeSe) and related pnictides, but direct experimental verification has been lacking. Here we show that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-phonon coupling strength in FeSe can be quantified by combining two time-domain experiments into a “coherent lock-in” measurement in the terahertz regime. X-ray diffraction tracks the light-induced femtosecond coherent lattice motion at a single phonon frequency, and photoemission monitors the subsequent coherent changes in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic band structure. Comparison with theory reveals a strong enhancement of the coupling strength in FeSe owing to correlation effects. Given that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-phonon coupling affects superconductivity exponentially, this enhancement highlights the importance of the cooperative interplay between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-phonon interactions.</p>

PGR5-Dependent Cyclic Electron Flow Protects Photosystem I under Fluctuating Light at Donor and Acceptor Sides
<p>In response to a sudden increase in light intensity, plants must cope with absorbed excess photon energy to protect photosystems from photodamage. Under fluctuating light, PSI is severely photodamaged in the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>proton gradient regulation5</i> (<i>pgr5</i>) mutant defective in the main pathway of PSI cyclic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport (CET). Here, we aimed to determine how PSI is protected by two proposed regulatory roles of CET via transthylakoid ΔpH formation: (1) reservation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> sink capacity by adjusting the ATP/NADPH production ratio (acceptor-side regulation) and (2) down-regulation of the cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub><i>f</i> complex activity called photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> for slowing down the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> flow toward PSI (donor-side regulation). We artificially enhanced donor- and acceptor-side regulation in the wild-type and <i>pgr5</i> backgrounds by introducing the <i>pgr1</i> mutation conferring the hypersensitivity of the cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub><i>f</i> complex to luminal acidification and moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i> flavodiiron protein genes, respectively. Enhanced photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> partially alleviated PSI photodamage in the <i>pgr5</i> mutant background but restricted linear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport under constant high light, suggesting that the strength of photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> should be optimized. Flavodiiron protein-dependent oxygen photoreduction formed a large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> sink and alleviated PSI photoinhibition, accompanied by the induction of photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>. Thus, donor-side regulation is essential for PSI photoprotection but acceptor-side regulation also is important to rapidly induce donor-side regulation. In angiosperms, PGR5-dependent CET is required for both functions.</p>

Contemporary failure aetiologies of the primary, posterior-stabilised total knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The number of revision total knee arthroplasties (TKA) that are   performed is expected to increase. However, previous reports of   the causes of failure after TKA are limited in that they report   the causes at specific institutions, which are often dependent on   referral patterns. Our aim was to report the most common indications   for re-operations and revisions in a large series of posterior-stabilised   TKAs undertaken at a single institution, excluding referrals from   elsewhere, which may bias the causes of failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 5098 TKAs which were undertaken between 2000 and 2012   were included in the study. Re-operations, revisions with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modular</span></strong>   component exchange, and revisions with non-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modular</span></strong> component replacement   or removal were identified from the medical records. The mean follow-up   was five years (two to 12).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The Kaplan-Meier ten-year survival without a re-operation, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modular</span></strong>   component revision and non-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modular</span></strong> component revision was 95.7%,   99.3% and 95.3%, respectively. The most common indications for a   re-operation were: post-operative stiffness (58%), delayed wound healing   (21%), and patellar clunk (11%). The indications for isolated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modular</span></strong>   component revision were acute periprosthetic joint infection (PJI)   (64%) and instability (36%). The most common indications for non-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modular</span></strong>   component revision were chronic PJI (52%), aseptic loosening (17%), periprosthetic   fracture (10%), and instability (10%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Post-operative stiffness remains the most common indication for   re-operation after TKA.

Full momentum- and energy-resolved spectral function of a 2D electronic system
<p>The single-particle spectral function measures the density of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic states in a material as a function of both momentum and energy, providing central insights into strongly correlated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> phenomena. Here we demonstrate a high-resolution method for measuring the full momentum- and energy-resolved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic spectral function of a two-dimensional (2D) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic system embedded in a semiconductor. The technique remains operational in the presence of large externally applied magnetic fields and functions even for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic systems with zero electrical conductivity or with zero <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> density. Using the technique on a prototypical 2D system, a GaAs quantum well, we uncover signatures of many-body effects involving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-phonon interactions, plasmons, polarons, and a phonon analog of the vacuum Rabi splitting in atomic systems.</p>

Global Pulmonary Vascular Remodeling in Pulmonary Hypertension Associated With Heart Failure and Preserved or Reduced Ejection Fraction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>We hypothesized that pulmonary venous hypertension in heart failure (HF) leads to predominate remodeling of pulmonary veins and that the severity of venous remodeling is associated with the severity of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients with HF (n=108; 53 preserved and 55 reduced ejection fraction) with PH (HF-PH; pulmonary artery systolic pressure [PASP] ≥40 mm Hg) were compared to normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>s (n=12) and patients with primary pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD; n=17). In lung specimens from autopsy (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>, HF-PH, and 7 PVOD) or surgery (10 PVOD), quantitative histomorphometry was performed in all analyzable arteries (n=4949), veins (n=7630), and small indeterminate vessels (IV; n=2168) to define percent medial thickness (arteries) and percent intimal thickness (%IT) (arteries, veins, and IV) relative to external diameter.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The average arterial percent medial thickness (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>, 6.9; HF-PH, 11.0; PVOD, 15.0), arterial %IT (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>, 4.9; HF-PH, 14.9; PVOD, 31.1), venous %IT (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>, 14.0; HF-PH, 24.9; PVOD, 43.9), and IV %IT (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>, 10.6; HF-PH, 25.8; PVOD, 50.0) in HF-PH were higher than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>s (<i>P</i><0.0001 for all) but lower than PVOD (<i>P</i>≤0.005 for all). PASP (mm Hg) was lower in HF-PH (median, 59 [interquartile range, 50–70]) than in PVOD (median, 91 [interquartile range, 82–103]). PASP correlated with arterial percent medial thickness (<i>r</i>=0.41) and arterial %IT (<i>r</i>=0.35) but more strongly with venous %IT (<i>r</i>=0.49) and IV %IT (<i>r</i>=0.55) (<i>P</i><0.0001 for all). Associations between PASP and venous or IV %IT remained significant after adjusting for arterial percent medial thickness and %IT and did not vary by HF type. In patients with right heart catheterization (30 HF-PH, 14 PVOD), similar associations between the transpulmonary gradient and pulmonary vascular remodeling existed, with numerically stronger associations for venous and IV %IT. Although the PASP was slightly higher in patients with HF-PH with right ventricular dysfunction, pulmonary vascular remodeling was not more severe. Pulmonary vascular remodeling severity was associated with reductions in the diffusing capacity of the lungs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In HF, PH is associated with global pulmonary vascular remodeling, but the severity of PH correlates most strongly with venous and small IV intimal thickening, similar to the pattern observed in PVOD. These findings expand our understanding of the pathobiology of PH in HF.</p></sec>

Electron-scale dynamics of the diffusion region during symmetric magnetic reconnection in space
<p>Magnetic reconnection is an energy conversion process that occurs in many astrophysical contexts including Earth’s magnetosphere, where the process can be investigated in situ by spacecraft. On 11 July 2017, the four Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft encountered a reconnection site in Earth’s magnetotail, where reconnection involves symmetric inflow conditions. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-scale plasma measurements revealed (i) super-Alfvénic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> jets reaching 15,000 kilometers per second; (ii) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> meandering motion and acceleration by the electric field, producing multiple crescent-shaped structures in the velocity distributions; and (iii) the spatial dimensions of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> diffusion region with an aspect ratio of 0.1 to 0.2, consistent with fast reconnection. The well-structured multiple layers of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> populations indicate that the dominant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> dynamics are mostly laminar, despite the presence of turbulence near the reconnection site.</p>

Imaging of nonlocal hot-electron energy dissipation via shot noise
<p>In modern micro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic devices, hot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>s accelerate, scatter, and dissipate energy in nanoscale dimensions. Despite recent progress in nanothermometry, direct real-space mapping of hot-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> energy dissipation is challenging because existing techniques are restricted to probing the lattice rather than the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>s. We realize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic nanothermometry by measuring local current fluctuations, or shot noise, associated with ultrafast hot-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> kinetic processes (~21 terahertz). Exploiting a scanning and contact-free tungsten tip as a local noise probe, we directly visualize hot-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> distributions before their thermal equilibration with the host gallium arsenide/aluminium gallium arsenide crystal lattice. With nanoconstriction devices, we reveal unexpected nonlocal energy dissipation at room temperature, which is reminiscent of ballistic transport of low-temperature quantum conductors.</p>

Tuning quantum nonlocal effects in graphene plasmonics
<p>The response of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> systems to electrodynamic fields that change rapidly in space is endowed by unique features, including an exquisite spatial nonlocality. This can reveal much about the materials’ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic structure that is invisible in standard probes that use gradually varying fields. Here, we use graphene plasmons, propagating at extremely slow velocities close to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> Fermi velocity, to probe the nonlocal response of the graphene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> liquid. The near-field imaging experiments reveal a parameter-free match with the full quantum description of the massless Dirac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> gas, which involves three types of nonlocal quantum effects: single-particle velocity matching, interaction-enhanced Fermi velocity, and interaction-reduced compressibility. Our experimental approach can determine the full spatiotemporal response of an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> system.</p>

Attosecond dynamics through a Fano resonance: Monitoring the birth of a photoelectron
<p>The dynamics of quantum systems are encoded in the amplitude and phase of wave packets. However, the rapidity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> dynamics on the attosecond scale has precluded the complete characterization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> wave packets in the time domain. Using spectrally resolved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> interferometry, we were able to measure the amplitude and phase of a photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> wave packet created through a Fano autoionizing resonance in helium. In our setup, replicas obtained by two-photon transitions interfere with reference wave packets that are formed through smooth continua, allowing the full temporal reconstruction, purely from experimental data, of the resonant wave packet released in the continuum. In turn, this resolves the buildup of the autoionizing resonance on an attosecond time scale. Our results, in excellent agreement with ab initio time-dependent calculations, raise prospects for detailed investigations of ultrafast photoemission dynamics governed by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> correlation, as well as coherent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> over structured <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> wave packets.</p>

Ballistic miniband conduction in a graphene superlattice
<p>Rational design of long-period artificial lattices yields effects unavailable in simple solids. The moiré pattern in highly aligned graphene/hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) heterostructures is a lateral superlattice with high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> mobility and an unusual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic dispersion whose miniband edges and saddle points can be reached by electrostatic gating. We investigated the dynamics of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>s in moiré minibands by measuring ballistic transport between adjacent local contacts in a magnetic field, known as the transverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> focusing effect. At low temperatures, we observed caustics of skipping orbits extending over hundreds of superlattice periods, reversals of the cyclotron revolution for successive minibands, and breakdown of cyclotron motion near van Hove singularities. At high temperatures, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> collisions suppress focusing. Probing such miniband conduction properties is a necessity for engineering novel transport behaviors in superlattice devices.</p>

The Impacts of Phosphorus Deficiency on the Photosynthetic Electron Transport Chain
<p>Phosphorus (P) is an essential macronutrient, and P deficiency limits plant productivity. Recent work showed that P deficiency affects <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport to photosystem I (PSI), but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here, we present a comprehensive biological model describing how P deficiency disrupts the photosynthetic machinery and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport chain through a series of sequential events in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>). P deficiency reduces the orthophosphate concentration in the chloroplast stroma to levels that inhibit ATP synthase activity. Consequently, protons accumulate in the thylakoids and cause lumen acidification, which inhibits linear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> flow. Limited plastoquinol oxidation retards <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport to the cytochrome <i>b<sub>6</sub>f</i> complex, yet the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transfer rate of PSI is increased under steady-state growth light and is limited under high-light conditions. Under P deficiency, the enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> flow through PSI increases the levels of NADPH, whereas ATP production remains restricted and, hence, reduces CO<sub>2</sub> fixation. In parallel, lumen acidification activates the energy-dependent quenching component of the nonphotochemical quenching mechanism and prevents the overexcitation of photosystem II and damage to the leaf tissue. Consequently, plants can be severely affected by P deficiency for weeks without displaying any visual leaf symptoms. All of the processes in the photosynthetic machinery influenced by P deficiency appear to be fully reversible and can be restored in less than 60 min after resupply of orthophosphate to the leaf tissue.</p>

Signatures of exciton condensation in a transition metal dichalcogenide
<p>Bose condensation has shaped our understanding of macroscopic quantum phenomena, having been realized in superconductors, atomic gases, and liquid helium. Excitons are bosons that have been predicted to condense into either a superfluid or an insulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic crystal. Using the recently developed technique of momentum‐resolved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> energy‐loss spectroscopy (M-EELS), we studied <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic collective modes in the transition metal dichalcogenide semimetal 1<i>T</i>‐TiSe<sub>2</sub>. Near the phase-transition temperature (190 kelvin), the energy of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic mode fell to zero at nonzero momentum, indicating dynamical slowing of plasma fluctuations and crystallization of the valence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>s into an exciton condensate. Our study provides compelling evidence for exciton condensation in a three-dimensional solid and establishes M-EELS as a versatile technique sensitive to valence band excitations in quantum materials.</p>

Imaging resonant dissipation from individual atomic defects in graphene
<p>Conversion of electric current into heat involves microscopic processes that operate on nanometer length scales and release minute amounts of power. Although central to our understanding of the electrical properties of materials, individual mediators of energy dissipation have so far eluded direct observation. Using scanning nanothermometry with submicrokelvin sensitivity, we visualized and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led phonon emission from individual atomic-scale defects in graphene. The inferred <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-phonon “cooling power spectrum” exhibits sharp peaks when the Fermi level comes into resonance with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic quasi-bound states at such defects. Rare in the bulk but abundant at graphene’s edges, switchable atomic-scale phonon emitters provide the dominant dissipation mechanism. Our work offers insights for addressing key materials challenges in modern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ics and enables <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of dissipation at the nanoscale.</p>

Attosecond-resolved photoionization of chiral molecules
<p>Chiral light-matter interactions have been investigated for two centuries, leading to the discovery of many chiroptical processes used for discrimination of enantiomers. Whereas most chiroptical effects result from a response of bound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>s, photoionization can produce much stronger chiral signals that manifest as asymmetries in the angular distribution of the photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>s along the light-propagation axis. We implemented self-referenced attosecond photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> interferometry to measure the temporal profile of the forward and backward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> wave packets emitted upon photoionization of camphor by circularly polarized laser pulses. We measured a delay between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>s ejected forward and backward, which depends on the ejection angle and reaches 24 attoseconds. The asymmetric temporal shape of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> wave packets emitted through an autoionizing state further reveals the chiral character of strongly correlated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic dynamics.</p>

Crystallization and vitrification of electrons in a glass-forming charge liquid
<p>Charge ordering (CO) is a phenomenon in which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>s in solids crystallize into a periodic pattern of charge-rich and charge-poor sites owing to strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> correlations. This usually results in long-range order. In geometrically frustrated systems, however, a glassy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic state without long-range CO has been observed. We found that a charge-ordered organic material with an isosceles triangular lattice shows charge dynamics associated with crystallization and vitrification of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>s, which can be understood in the context of an energy landscape arising from the degeneracy of various CO patterns. The dynamics suggest that the same nucleation and growth processes that characterize conventional glass-forming liquids guide the crystallization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>s. These similarities may provide insight into our understanding of the liquid-glass transition.</p>

<p>Interacting atoms or molecules condense into liquid, and, when cooled further, they form a crystal. The time evolution of the atomic or molecular ordering has been widely studied as a nonequilibrium emergence of order from a supercooled liquid or a glass. Interacting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>s in a variety of correlated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> systems also form crystals, but observing the time evolution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic crystallization has been experimentally challenging. Here, working with an organic conductor exhibiting a supercooled charge liquid or charge glass as a metastable state, we observed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic crystal growth through resistivity and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements. The temperature profile of the crystal growth is similar to those observed in classical systems and reveals two distinct regimes for the mechanism of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic crystallization.</p>

Enantioselective photochemistry through Lewis acid–catalyzed triplet energy transfer
<p>Relatively few catalytic systems are able to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> the stereochemistry of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ically excited organic intermediates. Here we report the discovery that a chiral Lewis acid complex can catalyze triplet energy transfer from an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ically excited photosensitizer. We applied this strategy to asymmetric [2 + 2] photocycloadditions of 2′-hydroxychalcones, using tris(bipyridyl) ruthenium(II) as a sensitizer. A variety of electrochemical, computational, and spectroscopic data rule out substrate activation by means of photoinduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transfer and instead support a mechanism in which Lewis acid coordination dramatically lowers the triplet energy of the chalcone substrate. We expect that this approach will enable chemists to more broadly apply their detailed understanding of chiral Lewis acid catalysis to stereo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> in reactions involving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ically excited states.</p>

In Silico Analysis of the Regulation of the Photosynthetic Electron Transport Chain in C3 Plants<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>We present a new simulation model of the reactions in the photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport chain of C3 species. We show that including recent insights about the regulation of the thylakoid proton motive force, ATP/NADPH balancing mechanisms (cyclic and noncyclic alternative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport), and regulation of Rubisco activity leads to emergent behaviors that may affect the operation and regulation of photosynthesis under different dynamic environmental conditions. The model was parameterized with experimental results in the literature, with a focus on Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). A dataset was constructed from multiple sources, including measurements of steady-state and dynamic gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, and absorbance spectroscopy under different light intensities and CO<sub>2</sub>, to test predictions of the model under different experimental conditions. Simulations suggested that there are strong interactions between cyclic and noncyclic alternative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport and that an excess capacity for alternative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport is required to ensure adequate redox state and lumen pH. Furthermore, the model predicted that, under specific conditions, reduction of ferredoxin by plastoquinol is possible after a rapid increase in light intensity. Further analysis also revealed that the relationship between ATP synthesis and proton motive force was highly regulated by the concentrations of ATP, ADP, and inorganic phosphate, and this facilitated an increase in nonphotochemical quenching and proton motive force under conditions where metabolism was limiting, such as low CO<sub>2</sub>, high light intensity, or combined high CO<sub>2</sub> and high light intensity. The model may be used as an in silico platform for future research on the regulation of photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport.</p>

<i>CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1</i> (<i>CCA1</i>) and the Circadian Control of Stomatal Aperture
<p>The endogenous circadian (∼24 h) system allows plants to anticipate and adapt to daily environmental changes. Stomatal aperture is one of the many processes under circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>; stomatal opening and closing occurs under constant conditions, even in the absence of environmental cues. To understand the significance of circadian-mediated anticipation in stomatal opening, we have generated <i>SGC</i> (specifically guard cell) Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants in which the oscillator gene <i>CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1</i> (<i>CCA1</i>) was overexpressed under the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of the guard-cell-specific promoter, <i>GC1.</i> The <i>SGC</i> plants showed a loss of ability to open stomata in anticipation of daily dark-to-light changes and of circadian-mediated stomatal opening in constant light. We observed that under fully watered and mild drought conditions, <i>SGC</i> plants outperform wild type with larger leaf area and biomass. To investigate the molecular basis for circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of guard cell aperture, we used large-scale qRT-PCR to compare circadian oscillator gene expression in guard cells compared with the “average” whole-leaf oscillator and examined gene expression and stomatal aperture in several lines of plants with misexpressed <i>CCA1</i>. Our results show that the guard cell oscillator is different from the average plant oscillator. Moreover, the differences in guard cell oscillator function may be important for the correct regulation of photoperiod pathway genes that have previously been reported to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> stomatal aperture. We conclude by showing that CONSTANS and FLOWERING LOCUS T, components of the photoperiod pathway that regulate flowering time, also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> stomatal aperture in a daylength-dependent manner.</p>

Overexpression of RING Domain E3 Ligase ZmXerico1 Confers Drought Tolerance through Regulation of ABA Homeostasis
<p>Drought stress is one of the main environmental problems encountered by crop growers. Reduction in arable land area and reduced water availability make it paramount to identify and develop strategies to allow crops to be more resilient in water-limiting environments. The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays an important role in the plants’ response to drought stress through its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of stomatal aperture and water transpiration, and transgenic modulation of ABA levels therefore represents an attractive avenue to improve the drought tolerance of crops. Several steps in the ABA-signaling pathway are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led by ubiquitination involving really interesting new genes (RING) domain-containing proteins. We characterized the maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) RING protein family and identified two novel RING-H2 genes called <i>ZmXerico1</i> and <i>ZmXerico2</i>. Expression of <i>ZmXerico</i> genes is induced by drought stress, and we show that overexpression of <i>ZmXerico1</i> and <i>ZmXerico2</i> in Arabidopsis and maize confers ABA hypersensitivity and improved water use efficiency, which can lead to enhanced maize yield performance in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led drought-stress environment. Overexpression of <i>ZmXerico1</i> and <i>ZmXerico2</i> in maize results in increased ABA levels and decreased levels of ABA degradation products diphaseic acid and phaseic acid. We show that ZmXerico1 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, where ABA 8′-hydroxylases have been shown to be localized, and that it functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. We demonstrate that ZmXerico1 plays a role in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of ABA homeostasis through regulation of ABA 8′-hydroxylase protein stability, representing a novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> point in the regulation of the ABA pathway.</p>

Genetic Control of Plasticity in Root Morphology and Anatomy of Rice in Response to Water Deficit
<p>Elucidating the genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of rooting behavior under water-deficit stress is essential to breed climate-robust rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) cultivars. Using a diverse panel of 274 <i>indica</i> genotypes grown under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> and water-deficit conditions during vegetative growth, we phenotyped 35 traits, mostly related to root morphology and anatomy, involving 45,000 root-scanning images and nearly 25,000 cross sections from the root-shoot junction. The phenotypic plasticity of these traits was quantified as the relative change in trait value under water-deficit compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> conditions. We then carried out a genome-wide association analysis on these traits and their plasticity, using 45,608 high-quality single-nucleotide polymorphisms. One hundred four significant loci were detected for these traits under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> conditions, 106 were detected under water-deficit stress, and 76 were detected for trait plasticity. We predicted 296 (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>), 284 (water-deficit stress), and 233 (plasticity) a priori candidate genes within linkage disequilibrium blocks for these loci. We identified key a priori candidate genes regulating root growth and development and relevant alleles that, upon validation, can help improve rice adaptation to water-deficit stress.</p>

Flexible strategies for flight control: an active role for the abdomen
<p>Moving animals orchestrate myriad motor systems in response to multimodal sensory inputs. Coordinating movement is particularly challenging in flight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>, where animals deal with potential instability and multiple degrees of freedom of movement. Prior studies have focused on wings as the primary flight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> structures, for which changes in angle of attack or shape are used to modulate lift and drag forces. However, other actuators that may impact flight performance are reflexively activated during flight. We investigated the visual–abdominal reflex displayed by the hawkmoth <i>Manduca sexta</i> to determine its role in flight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>. We measured the open-loop stimulus–response characteristics (measured as a transfer function) between the visual stimulus and abdominal response in tethered moths. The transfer function reveals a 41 ms delay and a high-pass filter behavior with a pass band starting at ~0.5 Hz. We also developed a simplified mathematical model of hovering flight wherein articulation of the thoracic–abdominal joint redirects an average lift force provided by the wings. We show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of the joint, subject to a high-pass filter, is sufficient to maintain stable hovering, but with a slim stability margin. Our experiments and models suggest a novel mechanism by which articulation of the body or ‘airframe’ of an animal can be used to redirect lift forces for effective flight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>. Furthermore, the small stability margin may increase flight agility by easing the transition from stable flight to a more maneuverable, unstable regime.</p>

Atrial Fibrillation Burden in Young Patients With Congenital Heart Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) are assumed to be vulnerable to atrial fibrillation (AF) as a result of residual shunts, anomalous vessel anatomy, progressive valvulopathy, hypertension, and atrial scars from previous heart surgery. However, the risk of developing AF and the complications associated with AF in children and young adults with CHD have not been compared with those in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data from the Swedish Patient and Cause of Death registers were used to identify all patients with a diagnosis of CHD who were born from 1970 to 1993. Each patient with CHD was matched by birth year, sex, and county with 10 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> subjects from the Total Population Register in Sweden.

The risk of developing AF was 21.99 times higher (95% confidence interval, 19.26–25.12) in patients with CHD than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> subjects. According to a hierarchical CHD classification, patients with conotruncal defects had the highest risk (hazard ratio, 84.27; 95% confidence interval, 56.86–124.89). At the age of 42 years, 8.3% of all patients with CHD had a recorded diagnosis of AF.

Transcatheter Interatrial Shunt Device for the Treatment of Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction (REDUCE LAP-HF I [Reduce Elevated Left Atrial Pressure in Patients With Heart Failure])
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In nonrandomized, open-label studies, a transcatheter interatrial shunt device (IASD, Corvia Medical) was associated with lower pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), fewer symptoms, and greater quality of life and exercise capacity in patients with heart failure (HF) and midrange or preserved ejection fraction (EF ≥40%). We conducted the first randomized sham-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led trial to evaluate the IASD in HF with EF ≥40%.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>REDUCE LAP-HF I (Reduce Elevated Left Atrial Pressure in Patients With Heart Failure) was a phase 2, randomized, parallel-group, blinded multicenter trial in patients with New York Heart Association class III or ambulatory class IV HF, EF ≥40%, exercise PCWP ≥25 mm Hg, and PCWP-right atrial pressure gradient ≥5 mm Hg. Participants were randomized (1:1) to the IASD versus a sham procedure (femoral venous access with intracardiac echocardiography but no IASD placement). The participants and investigators assessing the participants during follow-up were blinded to treatment assignment. The primary effectiveness end point was exercise PCWP at 1 month. The primary safety end point was major adverse cardiac, cerebrovascular, and renal events at 1 month. PCWP during exercise was compared between treatment groups using a mixed-effects repeated measures model analysis of covariance that included data from all available stages of exercise.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 94 patients were enrolled, of whom 44 met inclusion/exclusion criteria and were randomized to the IASD (n=22) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> (n=22) groups.

Right Ventricular Myofilament Functional Differences in Humans With Systemic Sclerosis–Associated Versus Idiopathic Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc)–associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have a far worse prognosis than those with idiopathic PAH (IPAH). In the intact heart, SSc-PAH exhibits depressed rest and reserve right ventricular (RV) contractility compared with IPAH. We tested whether this disparity involves underlying differences in myofilament function.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Cardiac myocytes were isolated from RV septal endomyocardial biopsies from patients with SSc-PAH, IPAH, or SSc with exertional dyspnea but no resting PAH (SSc-d); <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> RV septal tissue was obtained from nondiseased donor hearts (6–7 per group). Isolated myocyte passive length-tension and developed tension-calcium relationships were determined and correlated with in vivo RV function and reserve. RV septal fibrosis was also examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Myocyte passive stiffness from length-tension relations was similarly increased in IPAH and SSc-PAH compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>, although SSc-PAH biopsies had more interstitial fibrosis. More striking disparities were found between active force-calcium relations. Compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>s, maximal calcium-activated force (F<sub>max</sub>) was 28% higher in IPAH but 37% lower in SSc-PAH. F<sub>max</sub> in SSc-d was intermediate between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> and SSc-PAH. The calcium concentration required for half-maximal force (EC<sub>50</sub>) was similar between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>, IPAH, and SSc-d but lower in SSc-PAH. This disparity disappeared in myocytes incubated with the active catalytic subunit of protein kinase A. Myocyte F<sub>max</sub> directly correlated with in vivo RV contractility assessed by end-systolic elastance (<i>R<sup>2</sup></i>=0.46, <i>P</i>=0.002) and change in end-systolic elastance with exercise (<i>R<sup>2</sup></i>=0.49, <i>P</i>=0.008) and was inversely related with exercise-induced chamber dilation (<i>R<sup>2</sup></i>=0.63, <i>P</i><0.002), which also was a marker of depressed contractile reserve.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>A primary defect in human SSc-PAH resides in depressed sarcomere function, whereas this is enhanced in IPAH. These disparities correlate with in vivo RV contractility and contractile reserve and are consistent with worse clinical outcomes in SSc-PAH. The existence of sarcomere disease before the development of resting PAH in patients with SSc-d suggests that earlier identification and intervention may prove useful.</p></sec>

Reversing the Cardiac Effects of Sedentary Aging in Middle Age—A Randomized Controlled Trial
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Poor fitness in middle age is a risk factor for heart failure, particularly heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction.

In a prospective, parallel group, randomized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led trial, we examined the effect of 2 years of supervised high-intensity exercise training on LV stiffness.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Sixty-one (48% male) healthy, sedentary, middle-aged participants (53±5 years) were randomly assigned to either 2 years of exercise training (n=34) or attention <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>; n=27). Right heart catheterization and 3-dimensional echocardiography were performed with preload manipulations to define LV end-diastolic pressure-volume relationships and Frank-Starling curves.

Effects of network modularity on the spread of perturbation impact in experimental metapopulations
<p>Networks with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modular</span></strong> structure are expected to have a lower risk of global failure. However, this theoretical result has remained untested until now. We used an experimental microarthropod metapopulation to test the effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modular</span></strong>ity on the response to perturbation. We perturbed one local population and measured the spread of the impact of this perturbation, both within and between modules. Our results show the buffering capacity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modular</span></strong> networks. To assess the generality of our findings, we then analyzed a dynamical model of our system. We show that in the absence of perturbations, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modular</span></strong>ity is negatively correlated with metapopulation size. However, even when a small local perturbation occurs, this negative effect is offset by a buffering effect that protects the majority of the nodes from the perturbation.</p>

Extremely efficient internal exciton dissociation through edge states in layered 2D perovskites

Two-dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites are solution-processed quantum wells wherein the band gap can be tuned by varying the perovskite-layer thickness, which modulates the effective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-hole confinement. We report that, counterintuitive to classical quantum-confined systems where photogenerated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>s and holes are strongly bound by Coulomb interactions or excitons, the photophysics of thin films made of Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites with a thickness exceeding two perovskite-crystal units (>1.3 nanometers) is dominated by lower-energy states associated with the local intrinsic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic structure of the edges of the perovskite layers. These states provide a direct pathway for dissociating excitons into longer-lived free carriers that substantially improve the performance of opto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic devices.</p>

A Synthetic Oxygen Sensor for Plants Based on Animal Hypoxia Signaling
<p>Due to the involvement of oxygen in many essential metabolic reactions, all living organisms have developed molecular systems that allow adaptive physiological and metabolic transitions depending on oxygen availability. In mammals, the expression of hypoxia-response genes is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led by the heterodimeric Hypoxia-Inducible Factor. The activity of this transcriptional regulator is linked mainly to the oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of conserved proline residues in its α-subunit, carried out by prolyl-hydroxylases, and subsequent ubiquitination via the E3 ligase von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor, which targets Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-α to the proteasome. By exploiting bioengineered versions of this mammalian oxygen sensor, we designed and optimized a synthetic device that drives gene expression in an oxygen-dependent fashion in plants. Transient assays in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mesophyll protoplasts indicated that a combination of the yeast Gal4/upstream activating sequence system and the mammalian oxygen sensor machinery can be used effectively to engineer a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modular</span></strong>, oxygen-inducible transcriptional regulator. This synthetic device also was shown to be selectively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led by oxygen in whole plants when its components were expressed stably in Arabidopsis seedlings. We envision the exploitation of our genetically encoded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>lers to generate plants able to switch gene expression selectively depending on oxygen availability, thereby providing a proof of concept for the potential of synthetic biology to assist agricultural practices in environments with variable oxygen provision.</p>

MAP KINASE PHOSPHATASE1 Controls Cell Fate Transition during Stomatal Development
<p>Stomata on the plant epidermis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> gas and water exchange and are formed by MAPK-dependent processes. Although the contribution of MAP KINASE3 (MPK3) and MPK6 (MPK3/MPK6) to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of stomatal patterning and differentiation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) has been examined extensively, how they are inactivated and regulate distinct stages of stomatal development is unknown. Here, we identify a dual-specificity phosphatase, MAP KINASE PHOSPHATASE1 (MKP1), which promotes stomatal cell fate transition by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>ling MAPK activation at the early stage of stomatal development. Loss of function of <i>MKP1</i> creates clusters of small cells that fail to differentiate into stomata, resulting in the formation of patches of pavement cells. We show that MKP1 acts downstream of YODA (a MAPK kinase kinase) but upstream of MPK3/MPK6 in the stomatal signaling pathway and that MKP1 deficiency causes stomatal signal-induced MAPK hyperactivation in vivo. By expressing MKP1 in the three discrete cell types of stomatal lineage, we further identified that MKP1-mediated deactivation of MAPKs in early stomatal precursor cells directs cell fate transition leading to stomatal differentiation. Together, our data reveal the important role of MKP1 in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>ling MAPK signaling specificity and cell fate decision during stomatal development.</p>

Glycolate Induces Redox Tuning Of Photosystem II in Vivo: Study of a Photorespiration Mutant
<p>Bicarbonate removal from the nonheme iron at the acceptor side of photosystem II (PSII) was shown recently to shift the midpoint potential of the primary quinone acceptor Q<sub>A</sub> to a more positive potential and lowers the yield of singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) production. The presence of Q<sub>A</sub><sup>−</sup> results in weaker binding of bicarbonate, suggesting a redox-based regulatory and protective mechanism where loss of bicarbonate or exchange of bicarbonate by other small carboxylic acids may protect PSII against <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> in vivo under photorespiratory conditions. Here, we compared the properties of Q<sub>A</sub> in the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) photorespiration mutant deficient in peroxisomal HYDROXYPYRUVATE REDUCTASE1 (<i>hpr1-1</i>), which accumulates glycolate in leaves, with the wild type. Photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport was affected in the mutant, and chlorophyll fluorescence showed slower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport between Q<sub>A</sub> and Q<sub>B</sub> in the mutant. Glycolate induced an increase in the temperature maximum of thermoluminescence emission, indicating a shift of the midpoint potential of Q<sub>A</sub> to a more positive value. The yield of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> production was lowered in thylakoid membranes isolated from <i>hpr1-1</i> compared with the wild type, consistent with a higher potential of Q<sub>A</sub>/Q<sub>A</sub><sup>−</sup>. In addition, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> donation to photosystem I was affected in <i>hpr1-1</i> at higher light intensities, consistent with diminished <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transfer out of PSII. This study indicates that replacement of bicarbonate at the nonheme iron by a small carboxylate anion occurs in plants in vivo. These findings suggested that replacement of the bicarbonate on the nonheme iron by glycolate may represent a regulatory mechanism that protects PSII against photooxidative stress under low-CO<sub>2</sub> conditions.</p>

Tissue-Specific Control of the Endocycle by the Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome Inhibitors UVI4 and DEL1<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The endocycle represents a modified mitotic cell cycle that in plants is often coupled to cell enlargement and differentiation. Endocycle onset is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led by activity of the Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C), a multisubunit E3 ubiquitin ligase targeting cell-cycle factors for destruction. CELL CYCLE SWITCH52 (CCS52) proteins represent rate-limiting activator subunits of the APC/C. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), mutations in either <i>CCS52A1</i> or <i>CCS52A2</i> activators result in a delayed endocycle onset, whereas their overexpression triggers increased DNA ploidy levels. Here, the relative contribution of the APC/C<sup>CCS52A1</sup> and APC/C<sup>CCS52A2</sup> complexes to different developmental processes was studied through analysis of their negative regulators, being the ULTRAVIOLET-B-INSENSITIVE4 protein and the DP-E2F-Like1 transcriptional repressor, respectively. Our data illustrate cooperative activity of the APC/C<sup>CCS52A1</sup> and APC/C<sup>CCS52A2</sup> complexes during root and trichome development, but functional interdependency during leaf development. Furthermore, we found APC/C<sup>CCS52A1</sup> activity to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> <i>CCS52A2</i> expression. We conclude that interdependency of CCS52A-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led APC/C activity is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led in a tissue-specific manner.</p>

Transcription Factor Interplay between LEAFY and APETALA1/CAULIFLOWER during Floral Initiation<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The transcription factors LEAFY (LFY) and APETALA1 (AP1), together with the AP1 paralog CAULIFLOWER (CAL), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> the onset of flower development in a partially redundant manner. This redundancy is thought to be mediated, at least in part, through the regulation of a shared set of target genes. However, whether these genes are independently or cooperatively regulated by LFY and AP1/CAL is currently unknown. To better understand the regulatory relationship between LFY and AP1/CAL and to obtain deeper insights into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of floral initiation, we monitored the activity of LFY in the absence of AP1/CAL function. We found that the regulation of several known LFY target genes is unaffected by AP1/CAL perturbation, while others appear to require AP1/CAL activity. Furthermore, we obtained evidence that LFY and AP1/CAL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> the expression of some genes in an antagonistic manner. Notably, these include key regulators of floral initiation such as <i>TERMINAL FLOWER1</i> (<i>TFL1</i>), which had been previously reported to be directly repressed by both LFY and AP1. We show here that <i>TFL1</i> expression is suppressed by AP1 but promoted by LFY. We further demonstrate that LFY has an inhibitory effect on flower formation in the absence of AP1/CAL activity. We propose that LFY and AP1/CAL act as part of an incoherent feed-forward loop, a network motif where two interconnected pathways or transcription factors act in opposite directions on a target gene, to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> the establishment of a stable developmental program for the formation of flowers.</p>

Genome Wide Analysis of Fatty Acid Desaturation and Its Response to Temperature
<p>Plants modify the polyunsaturated fatty acid content of their membrane and storage lipids in order to adapt to changes in temperature. In developing seeds, this response is largely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led by the activities of the microsomal ω-6 and ω-3 fatty acid desaturases, FAD2 and FAD3. Although temperature regulation of desaturation has been studied at the molecular and biochemical levels, the genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of this trait is poorly understood. Here, we have characterized the response of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed lipids to variation in ambient temperature and found that heat inhibits both ω-6 and ω-3 desaturation in phosphatidylcholine, leading to a proportional change in triacylglycerol composition. Analysis of the 19 parental accessions of the multiparent advanced generation intercross (MAGIC) population showed that significant natural variation exists in the temperature responsiveness of ω-6 desaturation. A combination of quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using the MAGIC population suggests that ω-6 desaturation is largely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led by cis-acting sequence variants in the <i>FAD2</i> 5′ untranslated region intron that determine the expression level of the gene. However, the temperature responsiveness of ω-6 desaturation is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led by a separate QTL on chromosome 2. The identity of this locus is unknown, but genome-wide association studies identified potentially causal sequence variants within ∼40 genes in an ∼450-kb region of the QTL.</p>

Genetic Architecture of Flowering-Time Variation in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i><xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The transition to reproductive development is a crucial step in the plant life cycle, and the timing of this transition is an important factor in crop yields. Here, we report new insights into the genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of natural variation in flowering time in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>, a nondomesticated pooid grass closely related to cereals such as wheat (<i>Triticum</i> spp.) and barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i> L.). A recombinant inbred line population derived from a cross between the rapid-flowering accession Bd21 and the delayed-flowering accession Bd1-1 were grown in a variety of environmental conditions to enable exploration of the genetic architecture of flowering time. A genotyping-by-sequencing approach was used to develop SNP markers for genetic map construction, and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> differences in flowering time were identified. Many of the flowering-time QTLs are detected across a range of photoperiod and vernalization conditions, suggesting that the genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of flowering within this population is robust. The two major QTLs identified in undomesticated <i>B. distachyon</i> colocalize with <i>VERNALIZATION1/PHYTOCHROME C</i> and <i>VERNALIZATION2</i>, loci identified as flowering regulators in the domesticated crops wheat and barley. This suggests that variation in flowering time is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led in part by a set of genes broadly conserved within pooid grasses.</p>

Ferredoxin:NADP(H) Oxidoreductase Abundance and Location Influences Redox Poise and Stress Tolerance
<p>In linear photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport, ferredoxin:NADP(H) oxidoreductase (FNR) transfers <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>s from ferredoxin (Fd) to NADP<sup>+</sup>. Both NADPH and reduced Fd (Fd<sup>red</sup>) are required for reductive assimilation and light/dark activation/deactivation of enzymes. FNR is therefore a hub, connecting photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport to chloroplast redox metabolism. A correlation between FNR content and tolerance to oxidative stress is well established, although the precise mechanism remains unclear. We investigated the impact of altered FNR content and localization on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport and superoxide radical evolution in isolated thylakoids, and probed resulting changes in redox homeostasis, expression of oxidative stress markers, and tolerance to high light in planta. Our data indicate that the ratio of Fd<sup>red</sup> to FNR is critical, with either too much or too little FNR potentially leading to increased superoxide production, and perception of oxidative stress at the level of gene transcription. In FNR overexpressing plants, which show more NADP(H) and glutathione pools, improved tolerance to high-light stress indicates that disturbance of chloroplast redox poise and increased free radical generation may help “prime” the plant and induce protective mechanisms. In <i>fnr1</i> knock-outs, the NADP(H) and glutathione pools are more oxidized relative to the wild type, and the photoprotective effect is absent despite perception of oxidative stress at the level of gene transcription.</p>

Molecular Evolution of the Yap/Yorkie Proto-Oncogene and Elucidation of Its Core Transcriptional Program
<p>Throughout Metazoa, developmental processes are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led by a surprisingly limited number of conserved signaling pathways. Precisely how these signaling cassettes were assembled in early animal evolution remains poorly understood, as do the molecular transitions that potentiated the acquisition of their myriad developmental functions. Here we analyze the molecular evolution of the proto-oncogene yes-associated protein (Yap)/Yorkie, a key effector of the Hippo signaling pathway that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>s organ size in both <i>Drosophila</i> and mammals. Based on heterologous functional analysis of evolutionarily distant Yap/Yorkie orthologs, we demonstrate that a structurally distinct interaction interface between Yap/Yorkie and its partner TEAD/Scalloped became fixed in the eumetazoan common ancestor. We then combine transcriptional profiling of tissues expressing phylogenetically diverse forms of Yap/Yorkie with ChIP-seq validation to identify a common downstream gene expression program underlying the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of tissue growth in <i>Drosophila</i>. Intriguingly, a subset of the newly identified Yorkie target genes are also induced by Yap in mammalian tissues, thus revealing a conserved Yap-dependent gene expression signature likely to mediate organ size <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> throughout bilaterian animals. Combined, these experiments provide new mechanistic insights while revealing the ancient evolutionary history of Hippo signaling.</p>

Non-visual numerical discrimination in a blind cavefish (<i>Phreatichthys andruzzii</i>)
<p>Over a decade of comparative studies, researchers have found that rudimentary numerical abilities are widespread among vertebrates. While experiments in mammals and birds have employed a variety of stimuli (visual, auditory and tactile), all fish studies involved visual stimuli and it is unknown whether fish can process numbers in other sensory modalities. To fill this gap, we studied numerical abilities in <i>Phreatichthys andruzzii</i>, a blind cave-dwelling species that evolved in the phreatic layer of the Somalia desert. Fish were trained to receive a food reward to discriminate between two groups of objects placed in opposite positions of their home tank. In Experiment 1, subjects learned to discriminate between two and six objects, with stimuli not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led for non-numerical continuous variables that co-vary with numbers, such as total area occupied by stimuli or density. In Experiment 2, the discrimination was two versus four, with half of the stimuli <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led for continuous quantities and half not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led for continuous quantities. The subjects discriminated only the latter condition, indicating that they spontaneously used non-numerical information, as other vertebrates tested in similar experiments. In Experiments 3 and 4, cavefish trained from the beginning only with stimuli <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led for continuous quantities proved able to learn the discrimination of quantities based on the sole numerical information. However, their numerical acuity was lower than that reported in other teleost fish tested with visual stimuli.</p>

A total   of 52 (63%) of DAIRs were for early PJI (less than six weeks). Greater   success in the eradication of infection with DAIR was identified   with early PJI, comprising an interval less than a week between   onset of symptoms and exchange of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modular</span></strong> components with the DAIR   procedure. Eradication of infection, complications and re-operation   rates were similar in the DAIR and two-stage revision groups. For   hips with successful eradication of infection with DAIR, the five-year   survival (98%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 94 to 100) was similar   to the primary THA group (98%; 95% CI 95 to 100) (n = 43; p = 0.3).   The DAIR group had inferior mean Oxford Hip Scores (OHS) (38; 12   to 48) compared with the primary THA group (42; 15 to 48) (p = 0.02)   but a significantly better mean OHS compared with the two-stage   revision group (31; 0 to 48) (p = 0.008). Patients who required   only one DAIR for eradication of infection had a similar mean OHS   (41; 20 to 48) to the primary THA group (p = 0.2).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The DAIR procedure is associated with a similar complication   rate and ability to eradicate infection as two-stage revision. This   study emphasises the need for exchange of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modular</span></strong> components for   improved chances of eradication of infection. This is the first   study showing that DAIR is better than a two-stage revision regarding   functional outcome.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:614–22.</p></sec>

Vitamin E diffused highly cross-linked polyethylene in total hip arthroplasty at five years
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The objective of this five-year prospective, blinded, randomised   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led trial (RCT) was to compare femoral head penetration into   a vitamin E diffused highly cross-linked polyethylene (HXLPE) liner   with penetration into a medium cross-linked polyethylene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>   liner using radiostereometric analysis. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Patients scheduled for total hip arthroplasty (THA) were randomised   to receive either the study E1 (32 patients) or the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> ArComXL   polyethylene (35 patients). The median age (range) of the overall   cohort was 66 years (40 to 76).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The five-year median (interquartile range) proximal femoral head   penetration into the E1 was -0.05 mm (-0.13 to -0.02) and 0.07 mm   (-0.03 to 0.16) for ArComXL. At three and five years, the penetration   was significantly greater in the ArComXL group compared with the   E1 group (p = 0.029 and p = 0.019, respectively). All patient-reported outcomes   (PROs) improved significantly from the pre-operative interval compared   with those at one year, and remained favourable at five years. There   were no differences between the two groups at any interval.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The five-year results showed that E1 polyethylene does not wear   more than the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>, ArComXL. This is the longest-term RCT comparing   the wear performance and clinical outcome of vitamin E diffused   HXLPE with a previous generation of medium cross-linked polyethylene.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:577–84. </p></sec>

Multimodal infiltration of local anaesthetic in total knee arthroplasty; is posterior capsular infiltration worth the risk?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Multimodal infiltration of local anaesthetic provides effective   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of pain in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA).   There is little information about the added benefits of posterior   capsular infiltration (PCI) using different combinations of local   anaesthetic agents. Our aim was to investigate the effectiveness   of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of pain using multimodal infiltration with and without   infiltration of the posterior capsule of the knee.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>In a double-blind, randomised <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led trial of patients scheduled   for unilateral primary TKA, 86 were assigned to be treated with   multimodal infiltration with (Group I) or without (Group II) PCI.   Routine associated analgesia included the use of bupivacaine, morphine,   ketorolac and epinephrine. All patients had spinal anaesthesia and patient-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led   analgesia (PCA) post-operatively. A visual analogue scale (VAS)   for pain and the use of morphine were recorded 24 hours post-operatively.   Side effects of the infiltration, blood loss, and length of stay   in hospital were recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were no statistically significant differences between the   groups in relation to: VAS pain scores in the first 24 hours post-operatively   (p = 0.693), the use of morphine in the PCA (p = 0.647), blood loss   (p = 0.625), and length of stay (p = 0.17). There were no neurovascular   complications in either group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The multimodal infiltration of local anaesthetic with infiltration   of the posterior capsule did not provide significant added analgesic   benefits or reduce the use of morphine after TKA. Multimodal infiltration   is a satisfactory technique for the management of pain in these   patients without the attendant risks of PCI.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017; 99-B:483–8.</p></sec>

Comparative study on the effectiveness of a corticosteroid injection for carpal tunnel syndrome in patients with and without Raynaud’s phenomenon
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of a corticosteroid   injection for the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) in patients   with and without Raynaud’s phenomenon.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>In a prospective study, 139 patients with CTS were treated with   a corticosteroid injection (10 mg triamcinolone acetonide); 34 had   Raynaud’s phenomenon and 105 did not (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> group). Grip strength,   perception of touch with a Semmes-Weinstein monofilament and the   Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaires (BCTQ) were assessed at baseline and   at six, 12 and 24 weeks after the injection. The Cold Intolerance   Severity Score (CISS) questionnaire was also assessed at baseline   and 24 weeks after the injection.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The two groups had similar baseline BCTQ scores, but the scores   in the Raynaud’s phenomenon group were significantly higher than   those in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> group at 12 and 24 weeks after the injection.   Throughout the 24-week follow-up, there were no significant differences   in the mean grip strength between the groups, whereas the mean Semmes-Weinstein   monofilament sensory index for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> group was significantly   higher than that of the Raynaud’s phenomenon group. The mean CISSs   were not significantly different between the groups at baseline   and at 24 weeks. After 24 weeks, 11 patients (32%) in the Raynaud’s   phenomenon group and 16 (15%) in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> group required carpal   tunnel decompression (p = 0.028). Multivariable analysis indicated   that concurrent Raynaud’s phenomenon (odds ratio (OR) 2.6) and severe   electrophysiological grade (OR 2.1) were independently associated with   a failure of treatment after a corticosteroid injection.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Although considerable improvements in symptoms will probably   occur in patients with Raynaud’s phenomenon who have CTS, they have   higher risk of poor functional outcomes and failure of treatment   than those without Raynaud’s phenomenon.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1637–42.</p></sec>

Comparison of Micropore Distribution in Cell Walls of Softwood and Hardwood Xylem
<p>The porosity of wood cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>s is of interest for both understanding xylem functionality and from a wood materials perspective. The movement of water in xylem generally occurs through the macroporous networks formed in softwood by bordered pits and in hardwood by the intervessel pits and o<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pen</span></strong> conduits created by vessels and perforation plates. In some situations, such as cavitated xylem, water can only move through the micropores that occur in lignified tracheid and fiber cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>s; however, these micropore networks are poorly understood. Here, we used molecular microscopy analysis of radiata pine (<i>Pinus radiata</i>) and red beech (<i>Nothofagus fusca</i>) to determine the distribution of micropores in the secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>s and middle lamellae of tracheids and fibers in relation to cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> composition. Using two different types of probe, we identified a greater porosity of secondary cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>s and a reduced porosity of the middle lamella. Areas of reduced porosity were observed in the outer regions of the secondary cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> of both tracheids and fibers that appear unrelated to lignification or the distribution of cellulose, mannan, and xylan. Hardwood fiber cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>s were less lignified than those of softwood tracheids and showed greater accessibility to porosity probes. Vessel cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>s were comparable to those of fibers in terms of both porosity and lignification. Lignification is probably the primary determinant of cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> porosity in xylem. The highly lignified middle lamella, and lumen surface, act as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barrier</span></strong> to probe movement and, therefore, water movement in both softwood and hardwood.</p>

The Receptor-Like Kinase AtVRLK1 Regulates Secondary Cell Wall Thickening
<p>During the growth and development of land plants, some specialized cells, such as tracheary elements, undergo secondary cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> thickening. Secondary cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong> additional lignin, compared with primary cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>s, thus providing mechanical strength and potentially improving defenses against pathogens. However, the molecular mechanisms that initiate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> thickening are unknown. In this study, we identified an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase, encoded by <i>AtVRLK1</i> (<i>Vascular-Related Receptor-Like Kinase1</i>), that is expressed specifically in cells undergoing secondary cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> thickening. Suppression of <i>AtVRLK1</i> expression resulted in a range of phenotypes that included retarded early elongation of the inflorescence stem, shorter fibers, slower root growth, and shorter flower filaments. In contrast, up-regulation of <i>AtVRLK1</i> led to longer fiber cells, reduced secondary cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> thickening in fiber and vessel cells, and defects in anther dehiscence. Molecular and cellular analyses showed that down-regulation of <i>AtVRLK1</i> promoted secondary cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> thickening and up-regulation of <i>AtVRLK1</i> enhanced cell elongation and inhibited secondary cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> thickening. We propose that AtVRLK1 functions as a signaling component in coordinating cell elongation and cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> thickening during growth and development.</p>

Functional Specialization of Cellulose Synthase Isoforms in a Moss Shows Parallels with Seed Plants
<p>The secondary cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>s of tracheary elements and fibers are rich in cellulose microfibrils that are helically oriented and laterally aggregated. Support cells within the leaf midribs of mosses deposit cellulose-rich secondary cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>s, but their biosynthesis and microfibril organization have not been examined. Although the <i>Cellulose Synthase</i> (<i>CESA</i>) gene families of mosses and seed plants diversified inde<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pen</span></strong>dently, <i>CESA</i> knockout analysis in the moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i> revealed parallels with Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) in CESA functional specialization, with roles for both subfunctionalization and neofunctionalization. The similarities include regulatory uncoupling of the CESAs that synthesize primary and secondary cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>s, a requirement for two or more functionally distinct CESA isoforms for secondary cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> synthesis, interchangeability of some primary and secondary CESAs, and some CESA redundancy. The cellulose-deficient midribs of <i>ppcesa3/8</i> knockouts provided negative controls for the structural characterization of stereid secondary cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>s in wild type <i>P. patens</i>. Sum frequency generation spectra collected from midribs were consistent with cellulose microfibril aggregation, and polarization microscopy revealed helical microfibril orientation only in wild type leaves. Thus, stereid secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>s are structurally distinct from primary cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>s, and they share structural characteristics with the secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>s of tracheary elements and fibers. We propose a mechanism for the convergent evolution of secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>s in which the deposition of aggregated and helically oriented microfibrils is coupled to rapid and highly localized cellulose synthesis enabled by regulatory uncoupling from primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> synthesis.</p>

Branched Pectic Galactan in Phloem-Sieve-Element Cell Walls: Implications for Cell Mechanics
<p>A major question in plant biology concerns the specification and functional differentiation of cell types. This is in the context of constraints imposed by networks of cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>s that both adhere cells and contribute to the form and function of developing organs. Here, we report the identification of a glycan epitope that is specific to phloem sieve element cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>s in several systems. A monoclonal antibody, designated LM26, binds to the cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> of phloem sieve elements in stems of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), <i>Miscanthus</i> x <i>giganteus</i>, and notably sugar beet (<i>Beta vulgaris</i>) roots where phloem identification is an important factor for the study of phloem unloading of Suc. Using microarrays of synthetic oligosaccharides, the LM26 epitope has been identified as a β-1,6-galactosyl substitution of β-1,4-galactan requiring more than three backbone residues for optimized recognition. This branched galactan structure has previously been identified in garlic (<i>Allium sativum</i>) bulbs in which the LM26 epitope is widespread throughout most cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>s including those of phloem cells. Garlic bulb cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> material has been used to confirm the association of the LM26 epitope with cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> pectic rhamnogalacturonan-I polysaccharides. In the phloem tissues of grass stems, the LM26 epitope has a complementary pattern to that of the LM5 linear β-1,4-galactan epitope, which is detected only in companion cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>s. Mechanical probing of transverse sections of <i>M</i>. x <i>giganteus</i> stems and leaves by atomic force microscopy indicates that phloem sieve element cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>s have a lower indentation modulus (indicative of higher elasticity) than companion cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>s.</p>

Heteroblastic Development of Transfer Cells Is Controlled by the microRNA miR156/SPL Module
<p>We report that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> ingrowth deposition in phloem parenchyma (PP) transfer cells (TCs) in leaf veins of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) represents a novel trait of heteroblasty. Development of PP TCs involves extensive deposition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> ingrowths adjacent to cells of the sieve element/companion cell complex. These PP TCs potentially facilitate phloem loading by enhancing efflux of symplasmic Suc for subsequent active uptake into cells of the sieve element/companion cell complex. PP TCs with extensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> ingrowths are ubiquitous in mature cotyledons and juvenile leaves, but dramatically less so in mature adult leaves, an observation consistent with PP TC development reflecting vegetative phase change (VPC) in Arabidopsis. Consistent with this conclusion, the abundance of PP TCs with extensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> ingrowths varied across rosette development in three ecotypes displaying differing durations of juvenile phase, and extensive deposition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> ingrowths was observed in rejuvenated leaves following prolonged defoliation. PP TC development across juvenile, transition, and adult leaves correlated positively with levels of miR156, a major regulator of VPC in plants, and corresponding changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> ingrowth deposition were observed when miR156 was overexpressed or its activity suppressed by target mimicry. Analysis of plants carrying miR156-resistant forms of <i>SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN LIKE</i> (<i>SPL</i>) genes showed that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> ingrowth deposition was increased in <i>SPL9</i>-group but not <i>SPL3</i>-group genes, indicating that <i>SPL9</i>-group genes may function as negative regulators of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> ingrowth deposition in PP TCs. Collectively, our results point to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> ingrowth deposition in PP TCs being under control of the genetic program regulating VPC.</p>

Pollen-Expressed Leucine-Rich Repeat Extensins Are Essential for Pollen Germination and Growth
<p>During pollen tube growth, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>s of the tube provide the mechanical strength resisting turgor pressure to protect two sperm cells. Cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> proteins may play an important role in this process. Pollen tube cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> proteins known as leucine-rich repeat extensins (LRXs) harbor a leucine-rich repeat domain and an extensin domain. In this study, the functions of four pollen-expressed LRXs, LRX8, LRX9, LRX10, and LRX11 (LRX8–11), were characterized in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). <i>LRX8–11</i> displayed a consistent expression pattern in mature pollen grains and pollen tubes. In a phenotypic analysis of four single mutants, six double mutants, four triple mutants, and a quadruple mutant, the triple and quadruple mutant plants displayed markedly reduced seed set and decreased male transmission efficiency accompanied by compromised pollen germination and pollen tube growth. GFP-fused LRX8, LRX10, and LRX11 were found to be localized to pollen tube cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>s. An immunohistochemical analysis of pollen tube cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> polysaccharides showed an increase in the amount of rhamnogalacturonan I in the subapical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>s of pollen tubes of the <i>lrx9 lrx10 lrx11</i> and <i>lrx8 lrx9 lrx11</i> mutants and a decrease in the content of fucosylated xyloglucans in <i>lrx8 lrx9 lrx11</i> compared with wild-type plants. Moreover, the callose content in the apical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>s of pollen tubes increased in the <i>lrx8 lrx9 lrx11</i> mutant. In conclusion, we propose that LRX8–11 function synergistically to maintain pollen tube cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> integrity; thus, they play critical roles in pollen germination and pollen tube growth.</p>

Prolines in Transit Peptides Are Crucial for Efficient Preprotein Translocation into Chloroplasts
<p>Chloroplasts import many preproteins that can be classified based on their physicochemical properties. The cleavable N-terminal transit peptide (TP) of chloroplast preproteins <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>s all the information required for import into chloroplasts through Toc/Tic translocons. The question of whether and how the physicochemical properties of preproteins affect TP-mediated import into chloroplasts has not been elucidated. Here, we present evidence that Pro residues in TP mediate efficient translocation through the chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">envelop</span></strong>e membranes for proteins <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing transmembrane domains (TMDs) or proteins prone to aggregation. By contrast, the translocation of soluble proteins through the chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">envelop</span></strong>e membranes is less de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pen</span></strong>dent on TP prolines. Proless TPs failed to mediate protein translocation into chloroplasts; instead, these mutant TPs led to protein mistargeting to the chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">envelop</span></strong>e membranes or nonspecific protein aggregation during import into chloroplasts. The mistargeting of TMD-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing proteins caused by Pro-less TPs in wild-type protoplasts was mimicked by wild-type TPs in <i>hsp93-V</i> protoplasts, in which preprotein translocation is compromised. We propose that the physicochemical properties of chloroplast proteins affect protein translocation through the chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">envelop</span></strong>e, and prolines in TP have a crucial role in the efficient translocation of TMD-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing proteins.</p>

Gradients in Wall Mechanics and Polysaccharides along Growing Inflorescence Stems
<p>At early stages of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) flowering, the inflorescence stem undergoes rapid growth, with elongation occurring predominantly in the apical ∼4 cm of the stem. We measured the spatial gradients for elongation rate, osmotic pressure, cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> thickness, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> mechanical compliances and coupled these macroscopic measurements with molecular-level characterization of the polysaccharide composition, mobility, hydration, and intermolecular interactions of the inflorescence cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and small-angle neutron scattering. Force-extension curves revealed a gradient, from high to low, in the plastic and elastic compliances of cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>s along the elongation zone, but plots of growth rate versus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> compliances were strikingly nonlinear. Neutron-scattering curves showed only subtle changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> structure, including a slight increase in cellulose microfibril alignment along the growing stem. In contrast, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectra showed substantial decreases in pectin amount, esterification, branching, hydration, and mobility in an apical-to-basal pattern, while the cellulose content increased modestly. These results suggest that pectin structural changes are connected with increases in pectin-cellulose interaction and reductions in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> compliances along the apical-to-basal gradient in growth rate. These pectin structural changes may lessen the ability of the cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> to undergo stress relaxation and irreversible expansion (e.g. induced by expansins), thus contributing to the growth kinematics of the growing stem.</p>

Identification and Characterization of Arabidopsis Seed Coat Mucilage Proteins
<p>Plant cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> proteins are important regulators of cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> architecture and function. However, because cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> proteins are difficult to extract and analyze, they are generally poorly understood. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of proteins integral to the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed coat mucilage, a specialized layer of the extracellular matrix composed of plant cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> carbohydrates that is used as a model for cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> research. The proteins identified in mucilage include those previously identified by genetic analysis, and several mucilage proteins are reduced in mucilage-deficient mutant seeds, suggesting that these proteins are genuinely associated with the mucilage. Arabidopsis mucilage has both nonadherent and adherent layers. Both layers have similar protein profiles except for proteins involved in lipid metabolism, which are present exclusively in the adherent mucilage. The most abundant mucilage proteins include a family of proteins named TESTA ABUNDANT1 (TBA1) to TBA3; a less abundant fourth homolog was named TBA-LIKE (TBAL). <i>TBA</i> and <i>TBAL</i> transcripts and promoter activities were detected in developing seed coats, and their expression requires seed coat differentiation regulators. TBA proteins are secreted to the mucilage pocket during differentiation. Although reverse genetics failed to identify a function for TBAs/TBAL, the <i>TBA</i> promoters are highly expressed and cell type specific and so should be very useful tools for targeting proteins to the seed coat epidermis. Altogether, these results highlight the mucilage proteome as a model for cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>s in general, as it shares similarities with other cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> proteomes while also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing mucilage-specific features.</p>

Myosins XI Are Involved in Exocytosis of Cellulose Synthase Complexes
<p>In plants, cellulose is synthesized at the cell surface by plasma membrane (PM)-localized cellulose synthase (CESA) complexes (CSCs). The molecular and cellular mechanisms that underpin delivery of CSCs to the PM, however, are poorly understood. Cortical microtubules have been shown to interact with CESA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compart</span></strong>ments and mark the site for CSC delivery, but are not required for the delivery itself. Here, we demonstrate that myosin XI and the actin cytoskeleton mediate CSC delivery to the PM by coordinating the exocytosis of CESA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compart</span></strong>ments. Measurement of cellulose content indicated that cellulose biosynthesis was significantly reduced in a <i>myosin xik xi1 xi2</i> triple-knockout mutant. By combining genetic and pharmacological disruption of myosin activity with quantitative live-cell imaging, we observed decreased abundance of PM-localized CSCs and reduced delivery rate of CSCs in myosin-deficient cells. These phenotypes correlated with a significant increase in failed vesicle secretion events at the PM as well as an abnormal accumulation of CESA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compart</span></strong>ments at the cell cortex. Through high-resolution spatiotemporal assays of cortical vesicle behavior, we identified defects in CSC vesicle tethering and fusion at the PM. Furthermore, disruption of myosin activity reduced the delivery of several other secretory markers to the PM and reduced constitutive and receptor-mediated endocytosis. These findings reveal a previously undescribed role for myosin in vesicle secretion and cellulose production at the cytoskeleton-PM-cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> nexus.</p>

Gene Regulatory Networks for the Haploid-to-Diploid Transition of <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>
<p>The sexual cycle of the unicellular <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> culminates in the formation of diploid zygotes that differentiate into dormant spores that eventually undergo meiosis. Mating between gametes induces rapid cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> shedding via the enzyme g-lysin; cell fusion is followed by heterodimerization of sex-specific homeobox transcription factors, GSM1 and GSP1, and initiation of zygote-specific gene expression. To investigate the genetic underpinnings of the zygote developmental pathway, we performed comparative transcriptome analysis of both pre- and post-fertilization samples. We identified 253 transcripts specifically enriched in early zygotes, 82% of which were not up-regulated in <i>gsp1</i> null zygotes. We also found that the GSM1/GSP1 heterodimer negatively regulates the vegetative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> program at the posttranscriptional level, enabling prompt transition from vegetative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> to zygotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> assembly. Annotation of the g-lysin-induced and early zygote genes reveals distinct vegetative and zygotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> programs, supported by concerted up-regulation of genes encoding cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>-modifying enzymes and proteins involved in nucleotide-sugar metabolism. The haploid-to-diploid transition in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> is masterfully controlled by the GSM1/GSP1 heterodimer, translating fertilization and gamete coalescence into a bona fide differentiation program. The fertilization-triggered integration of genes required to make related, but structurally and functionally distinct organelles—the vegetative versus zygote cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>—presents a likely scenario for the evolution of complex developmental gene regulatory networks.</p>

<p>Stomata are formed by a pair of guard cells which have thickened, elastic cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>s to withstand the large increases in turgor pressure that have to be generated to o<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pen</span></strong> the pore that they surround. We have characterized FOCL1, a guard cell-expressed, secreted protein with homology to Hyp-rich cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> proteins. FOCL1-GFP localizes to the guard cell outer cuticular ledge and plants lacking FOCL1 produce stomata without a cuticular ledge. Instead the majority of stomatal pores are entirely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cover</span></strong>ed over by a continuous fusion of the cuticle, and consequently plants have decreased levels of transpiration and display drought tolerance. The <i>focl1</i> guard cells are larger and less able to reduce the aperture of their stomatal pore in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e signals suggesting that the flexibility of guard cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>s is impaired. <i>FOCL1</i> is also expressed in lateral root initials where it aids lateral root emergence. We propose that FOCL1 acts in these highly specialized cells of the stomata and root to impart cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> strength at high turgor and/or to facilitate interactions between the cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> and the cuticle.</p>

Cellulose-Derived Oligomers Act as Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns and Trigger Defense-Like Responses
<p>The plant cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>, often the site of initial encounters between plants and their microbial pathogens, is composed of a complex mixture of cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin polysaccharides as well as proteins. The concept of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) was proposed to describe plant elicitors like oligogalacturonides (OGs), which can be derived by the breakdown of the pectin homogalacturon by pectinases. OGs act via many of the same signaling steps as pathogen- or microbe-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) to elicit defenses and provide protection against pathogens. Given both the complexity of the plant cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> and the fact that many pathogens secrete a wide range of cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>-degrading enzymes, we reasoned that the breakdown products of other cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> polymers may be similarly biologically active as elicitors and may help to reinforce the perception of danger by plant cells. Our results indicate that oligomers derived from cellulose are perceived as signal molecules in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), triggering a signaling cascade that shares some similarities to responses to well-known elicitors such as chitooligomers and OGs. However, in contrast to other known PAMPs/DAMPs, cellobiose stimulates neither detectable reactive oxygen species production nor callose deposition. Confirming our idea that both PAMPs and DAMPs are likely to cooccur at infection sites, cotreatments of cellobiose with flg22 or chitooligomers led to synergistic increases in gene expression. Thus, the perception of cellulose-derived oligomers may participate in cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> integrity surveillance and represents an additional layer of signaling following plant cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> breakdown during cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> remodeling or pathogen attack.</p>

DEFECTIVE KERNEL1 (DEK1) Regulates Cell Walls in the Leaf Epidermis
<p>The plant epidermis is crucial to survival, regulating interactions with the environment and controlling plant growth. The phytocalpain DEFECTIVE KERNEL1 (DEK1) is a master regulator of epidermal differentiation and maintenance, acting upstream of epidermis-specific transcription factors, and is required for correct cell adhesion. It is currently unclear how changes in DEK1 lead to cellular defects in the epidermis and the pathways through which DEK1 acts. We have combined growth kinematic studies, cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> analysis, and transcriptional analysis of genes downstream of DEK1 to determine the cause of phenotypic changes observed in DEK1-modulated lines of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We reveal a novel role for DEK1 in the regulation of leaf epidermal cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> structure. Lines with altered DEK1 activity have epidermis-specific changes in the thickness and polysaccharide composition of cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>s that likely underlie the loss of adhesion between epidermal cells in plants with reduced levels of DEK1 and changes in leaf shape and size in plants constitutively overexpressing the active CALPAIN domain of DEK1. Calpain-overexpressing plants also have increased levels of cellulose and pectins in epidermal cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>s, and this is correlated with the expression of several cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>-related genes, linking transcriptional regulation downstream of DEK1 with cellular effects. These findings significantly advance our understanding of the role of the epidermal cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>s in growth regulation and establish a new role for DEK1 in pathways regulating epidermal cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> deposition and remodeling.</p>

Chemical responses to modified lignin composition in tension wood of hybrid poplar (<i>Populus tremula × Populus alba</i>)
<p>The effect of altering the expression level of the <i>F5H</i> gene was investigated in three wood tissues (normal, opposite and tension wood) in 1-year-old hybrid poplar clone 717 (<i>Populus tremula × Populus alba</i> L.), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing the <i>F5H</i> gene under the control of the <i>C4H</i> promoter. Elevated expression of the <i>F5H</i> gene in poplar has been previously reported to increase the percent syringyl content of lignin. The wild-type and three transgenic lines were inclined 45° for 3 months to induce tension wood formation. Tension and opposite wood from inclined trees, along with normal wood from control trees, were analyzed separately for carbohydrates, lignin, cellulose crystallinity and microfibril angle (MFA). In the wild-type poplar, the lignin in tension wood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ed a significantly higher percentage of syringyl than normal wood or opposite wood. However, there was no significant difference in the percent syringyl content of the three wood types within each of the transgenic lines. Increasing the <i>F5H</i> gene expression caused an increase in the percent syringyl content and a slight decrease in the total lignin in normal wood. In tension wood, the addition of a gelatinous layer in the fiber <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>s resulted in a consistently lower percentage of total lignin in the tissue. Acid-soluble lignin was observed to increase by up to 2.3-fold in the transgenic lines. Compared with normal wood and opposite wood, cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> crystallinity in tension wood was higher and the MFA was smaller, as expected, with no evidence of an effect from modifying the syringyl monomer ratio. Tension wood in all the lines <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ed consistently higher total sugar and glucose percentages when compared with normal wood within the respective lines. However, both sugar and glucose percentages were lower in the tension wood of transgenic lines when compared with the tension wood of wild-type trees. Evaluating the response of trees with altered syringyl content to gravity will improve our understanding of the changes in cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> chemistry and ultrastructural properties of normal, opposite and tension wood in plants.</p>

Cellulose Synthase Stoichiometry in Aspen Differs from Arabidopsis and Norway Spruce
<p>Cellulose is synthesized at the plasma membrane by cellulose synthase complexes (CSCs) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing cellulose synthases (CESAs). Genetic analysis and CESA isoform quantification indicate that cellulose in the secondary cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>s of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) is synthesized by isoforms CESA4, CESA7, and CESA8 in equimolar amounts. Here, we used quantitative proteomics to investigate whether the CSC model based on Arabidopsis secondary cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> CESA stoichiometry can be applied to the angiosperm tree as<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pen</span></strong> (<i>Populus tremula</i>) and the gymnosperm tree Norway spruce (<i>Picea abies</i>). In the developing xylem of as<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pen</span></strong>, the secondary cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> CESA stoichiometry was 3:2:1 for PtCESA8a/b:PtCESA4:PtCESA7a/b, while in Norway spruce, the stoichiometry was 1:1:1, as observed previously in Arabidopsis. Furthermore, in as<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pen</span></strong> tension wood, the secondary cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> CESA stoichiometry changed to 8:3:1 for PtCESA8a/b:PtCESA4:PtCESA7a/b. PtCESA8b represented 73% of the total secondary cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> CESA pool, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of CESA transcripts in cryosectioned tension wood revealed increased <i>PtCESA8b</i> expression during the formation of the cellulose-enriched gelatinous layer, while the transcripts of <i>PtCESA4</i>, <i>PtCESA7a/b</i>, and <i>PtCESA8a</i> decreased. A wide-angle x-ray scattering analysis showed that the shift in CESA stoichiometry in tension wood coincided with an increase in crystalline cellulose microfibril diameter, suggesting that the CSC CESA composition influences microfibril properties. The as<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pen</span></strong> CESA stoichiometry results raise the possibility of alternative CSC models and suggest that homomeric PtCESA8b complexes are responsible for cellulose biosynthesis in the gelatinous layer in tension wood.</p>

LRX Proteins Play a Crucial Role in Pollen Grain and Pollen Tube Cell Wall Development<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Leu-rich repeat extensins (LRXs) are chimeric proteins <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing an N-terminal Leu-rich repeat (LRR) and a C-terminal extensin domain. LRXs are involved in cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> formation in vegetative tissues and required for plant growth. However, the nature of their role in these cellular processes remains to be elucidated. Here, we used a combination of molecular techniques, light microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy to characterize mutants of pollen-expressed <i>LRXs</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis</i> <i>thaliana</i>). Mutations in multiple pollen-expressed <i>lrx</i> genes cause severe defects in pollen germination and pollen tube growth, resulting in a reduced seed set. Physiological experiments demonstrate that manipulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> availability partially suppresses the pollen tube growth defects, suggesting that LRX proteins influence Ca<sup>2+</sup>-related processes. Furthermore, we show that LRX protein localizes to the cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>, and its LRR-domain (which likely mediates protein-protein interactions) is associated with the plasma membrane. Mechanical analyses by cellular force microscopy and finite element method-based modeling revealed significant changes in the material properties of the cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> and the fine-tuning of cellular biophysical parameters in the mutants compared to the wild type. The results indicate that LRX proteins might play a role in cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>-plasma membrane communication, influencing cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> formation and cellular mechanics.</p>

Reassessing the Roles of PIN Proteins and Anticlinal Microtubules during Pavement Cell Morphogenesis
<p>The leaf epidermis is a biomechanical shell that influences the size and shape of the organ. Its morphogenesis is a multiscale process in which nanometer-scale cytoskeletal protein complexes, individual cells, and groups of cells pattern growth and define macroscopic leaf traits. Interdigitated growth of neighboring cells is an evolutionarily conserved developmental strategy. Understanding how signaling pathways and cytoskeletal proteins pattern cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>s during this form of tissue morphogenesis is an important research challenge. The cellular and molecular control of a lobed cell morphology is currently thought to involve PIN-FORMED (PIN)-type plasma membrane efflux carriers that generate subcellular auxin gradients. Auxin gradients were proposed to function across cell boundaries to encode stable offset patterns of cortical microtubules and actin filaments between adjacent cells. Many models suggest that long-lived microtubules along the anticlinal cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> generate local cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> heterogeneities that restrict local growth and specify the timing and location of lobe formation. Here, we used Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) reverse genetics and multivariate long-term time-lapse imaging to test current cell shape control models. We found that neither PIN proteins nor long-lived microtubules along the anticlinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> predict the patterns of lobe formation. In fields of lobing cells, anticlinal microtubules are not correlated with cell shape and are unstable at the time scales of cell expansion. Our analyses indicate that anticlinal microtubules have multiple functions in pavement cells and that lobe initiation is likely controlled by complex interactions among cell geometry, cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> stress patterns, and transient microtubule networks that span the anticlinal and periclinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>s.</p>

Pea Border Cell Maturation and Release Involve Complex Cell Wall Structural Dynamics
<p>The adhesion of plant cells is vital for support and protection of the plant body and is maintained by a variety of molecular associations between cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> components. In some specialized cases, though, plant cells are programmed to detach, and root cap-derived border cells are examples of this. Border cells (in some species known as border-like cells) provide an ex<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pen</span></strong>dable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barrier</span></strong> between roots and the environment. Their maturation and release is an important but poorly characterized cell separation event. To gain a deeper insight into the complex cellular dynamics underlying this process, we undertook a systematic, detailed analysis of pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) root tip cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>s. Our study included immunocarbohydrate microarray profiling, monosaccharide composition determination, Fourier-transformed infrared microspectroscopy, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR of cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> biosynthetic genes, analysis of hydrolytic activities, transmission electron microscopy, and immunolocalization of cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> components. Using this integrated glycobiology approach, we identified multiple novel modes of cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> structural and compositional rearrangement during root cap growth and the release of border cells. Our findings provide a new level of detail about border cell maturation and enable us to develop a model of the separation process. We propose that loss of adhesion by the dissolution of homogalacturonan in the middle lamellae is augmented by an active biophysical process of cell curvature driven by the polarized distribution of xyloglucan and extensin epitopes.</p>

Identification of Putative Substrates of SEC2, a Chloroplast Inner Envelope Translocase
<p>Most chloroplast proteins are synthesized in the cytosol and imported into chloroplasts. Many imported proteins are further targeted to the thylakoid membrane and lumen by the SEC1, TAT, or SRP/ALB3 translocases. Others are targeted to the inner chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">envelop</span></strong>e membrane by undescribed translocases. Recently, a second SEC system (SEC2) consisting of SCY2, SECE2, and SECA2 was found in the chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">envelop</span></strong>e. Null mutants of <i>SCY2</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) exhibit a severe embryo-lethal phenotype. To investigate the function of the SEC2 system in plants, we used inducible RNA interference to knock down <i>SCY2</i> in Arabidopsis. Seedlings cultured with inducer were chlorotic with aberrant chloroplasts and undeveloped thylakoids, indicating an essential role for SCY2 in chloroplast biogenesis beyond embryo development. In <i>SCY2</i> down-regulated seedlings, several thylakoid membrane proteins, including SCY1, ALB3, and TATC, and inner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">envelop</span></strong>e membrane proteins, including TIC40, TIC110, and FTSH12, were reduced substantially, suggesting that they may be SEC2 substrates. Additional insight was achieved by the in vitro reconstitution of protein integration into chloroplast membranes. The results show that SCY1 and ALB3 target directly to the thylakoid membrane and are likely inde<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pen</span></strong>dent of SEC2. FTSH12 was integrated into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">envelop</span></strong>e membrane in a coupled import-integration reaction that was impaired by the SECA inhibitor sodium azide. The stromal intermediate of TIC40 integrated into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">envelop</span></strong>e in a reaction that was largely inhibited when antibodies against epitope-tagged SCY2 or SECE2 were applied. These data demonstrate that the SEC2 translocase likely integrates a subset of inner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">envelop</span></strong>e membrane proteins, such as FTSH12 and TIC40.</p>

Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Phosphatases Affect UV-B-Induced Stomatal Closure via Controlling NO in Guard Cells
<p>Ultraviolet B (UV-B) radiation induces the activation of MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE PHOSPHATASE1 (MKP1) and its targets MPK3 and MPK6, but whether they participate in UV-B guard cell signaling is not clear. Here, evidence shows that UV-B-induced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) is antagonistically regulated by MKP1 and MPK6 via modulating hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)-induced nitric oxide (NO) production in guard cells. The <i>mkp1</i> mutant was hypersensitive to UV-B-induced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e and NO production in guard cells but not to UV-B-induced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production, suggesting that MKP1 negatively regulates UV-B-induced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e via inhibiting NO generation in guard cells. Moreover, MPK3 and MPK6 were activated by UV-B in leaves of the wild type and hyperactivated in the <i>mkp1</i> mutant, but the UV-B-induced activation of MPK3 and MPK6 was largely inhibited in mutants for <i>ATRBOHD</i> and <i>ATRBOHF</i> but not in mutants for <i>NIA1</i> and <i>NIA2</i>. <i>mpk6</i> mutants showed defects of UV-B-induced NO production and stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e but were normal in UV-B-induced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production, while stomata of <i>mpk3</i> mutants responded to UV-B just like those of the wild type. The defect of UV-B-induced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e in <i>mpk6</i> mutants was rescued by exogenous NO but not by exogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Furthermore, double mutant <i>mkp1</i>/<i>mpk6</i> and the single mutant <i>mpk6</i> showed the same responses to UV-B in terms of either stomatal movement or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and NO production. These data indicate that MPK6, but not MPK3, positively regulates UV-B-induced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e via acting downstream of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and upstream of NO, while MKP1 functions negatively in UV-B guard cell signaling via down-regulation of MPK6.</p>

Role of Glycosyltransferases in Pollen Wall Primexine Formation and Exine Patterning
<p>The pollen cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> is important for protection of male sperm from physical stresses and consists of an inner gametophyte-derived intine layer and a sporophyte-derived exine layer. The polymeric constituents of the robust exine are termed sporopollenin. The mechanisms by which sporopollenin is anchored onto microspores and polymerized in specific patterns are unknown, but the primexine, a transient cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> matrix formed on the surface of microspores at the late tetrad stage, is hypothesized to play a key role. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>spongy</i> (<i>spg</i>) and <i>uneven pattern of exine</i> (<i>upex</i>) mutants exhibit defective and irregular exine patterns. <i>SPG2</i> (synonymous with <i>IRREGULAR XYLEM9-LIKE</i> [<i>IRX9L</i>]) encodes a family GT43 glycosyltransferase involved in xylan backbone biosynthesis, while <i>UPEX1</i> encodes a family GT31 glycosyltransferase likely involved in galactosylation of arabinogalactan proteins. Imaging of developing <i>irx9l</i> microspores showed that the earliest detectable defect was in primexine formation. Furthermore, wild-type microspores <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ed primexine-localized epitopes indicative of the presence of xylan, but these were absent in <i>irx9l</i>. These data, together with the <i>spg</i> phenotype of a mutant in <i>IRX14L</i>, which also plays a role in xylan backbone elongation, indicate the presence of xylan in pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> primexine, which plays a role in exine patterning on the microspore surface. We observed an aberrant primexine and irregular patterns of incipient sporopollenin deposition in <i>upex1</i>, suggesting that primexine-localized arabinogalactan proteins could play roles in sporopollenin adhesion and patterning early in microspore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> development. Our data provide new insights into the biochemical and functional properties of the primexine component of the microspore cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>.</p>

Gene expression profiles of brain endothelial cells during embryonic development at bulk and single-cell levels
<p>The blood-brain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barrier</span></strong> is a dynamic interface that separates the brain from the circulatory system, and it is formed by highly specialized endothelial cells. To explore the molecular mechanisms defining the unique nature of vascular development and differentiation in the brain, we generated high-resolution gene expression profiles of mouse embryonic brain endothelial cells using translating ribosome affinity purification and single-cell RNA sequencing. We compared the brain vascular translatome with the vascular translatomes of other organs and analyzed the vascular translatomes of the brain at different time points during embryonic development. Because canonical Wnt signaling is implicated in the formation of the blood-brain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barrier</span></strong>, we also compared the brain endothelial translatome of wild-type mice with that of mice lacking the transcriptional cofactor β-catenin (<i>Ctnnb1</i>). Our analysis revealed extensive molecular changes during the embryonic development of the brain endothelium. We identified genes encoding brain endothelium–specific transcription factors (<i>Foxf2</i>, <i>Foxl2</i>, <i>Foxq1</i>, <i>Lef1</i>, <i>Ppard</i>, <i>Zfp551</i>, and <i>Zic3</i>) that are associated with maturation of the blood-brain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barrier</span></strong> and act downstream of the Wnt–β-catenin signaling pathway. Profiling of individual brain endothelial cells revealed substantial heterogeneity in the population. Nevertheless, the high abundance of <i>Foxf2</i>, <i>Foxq1</i>, <i>Ppard</i>, or <i>Zic3</i> transcripts correlated with the increased expression of genes encoding markers of brain endothelial cell differentiation. Expression of <i>Foxf2</i> and <i>Zic3</i> in human umbilical vein endothelial cells induced the production of blood-brain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barrier</span></strong> differentiation markers. This comprehensive data set may help to improve the engineering of in vitro blood-brain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barrier</span></strong> models.</p>

PDZRN3 destabilizes endothelial cell-cell junctions through a PKCζ-containing polarity complex to increase vascular permeability

We revealed that the E3 ubiquitin ligase PDZ domain–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing ring finger 3 (PDZRN3) regulated endothelial intercellular junction integrity. Endothelial cell–specific overexpression of <i>Pdzrn3</i> led to early embryonic lethality with severe hemorrhaging and altered organization of endothelial intercellular junctions. Conversely, endothelial-specific loss of <i>Pdzrn3</i> prevented vascular leakage in a mouse model of transient ischemic stroke, an effect that was mimicked by pharmacological inhibition of PKCζ. PDZRN3 regulated Wnt signaling and associated with a complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing PAR3, PKCζ, and the multi-PDZ domain protein MUPP1 (Discs Lost–multi-PDZ domain protein 1) and targeted MUPP1 for proteasomal degradation in transfected cells.

In endothelial cells, <i>Pdzrn3</i> overexpression increased permeability through a PKCζ-de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pen</span></strong>dent pathway. In contrast, <i>Pdzrn3</i> depletion enhanced PKCζ accumulation at cell-cell contacts and reinforced the cortical actin cytoskeleton under stress conditions.

Assembly of a nucleus-like structure during viral replication in bacteria
<p>We observed the assembly of a nucleus-like structure in bacteria during viral infection. Using fluorescence microscopy and cryo-electron tomography, we showed that <i>Pseudomonas chlororaphis</i> phage 201φ2-1 assembled a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compart</span></strong>ment that separated viral DNA from the cytoplasm. The phage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compart</span></strong>ment was centered by a bipolar tubulin-based spindle, and it segregated phage and bacterial proteins according to function. Proteins involved in DNA replication and transcription localized inside the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compart</span></strong>ment, whereas proteins involved in translation and nucleotide synthesis localized outside.

Biotin Attachment Domain-Containing Proteins Irreversibly Inhibit Acetyl CoA Carboxylase
<p>The first committed step in fatty acid synthesis is mediated by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase), a biotin-de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pen</span></strong>dent enzyme that carboxylates acetyl-CoA to produce malonyl-CoA. ACCase can be feedback regulated by short-term or long-term exposure to fatty acids in the form of Tween 80 (predominantly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing oleic acid), which results in reversible or irreversible ACCase inhibition, respectively. Biotin attachment domain-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing (BADC) proteins are inactive analogs of biotin carboxyl transfer proteins that lack biotin, and their incorporation into ACCase down-regulates its activity by displacing active (biotin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing) biotin carboxyltransferase protein subunits. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) lines <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing T-DNA insertions in <i>BADC1</i>, <i>BADC2</i>, and <i>BADC3</i> were used to generate <i>badc1 badc2</i> and <i>badc1 badc3</i> double mutants. The <i>badc1 badc3</i> mutant exhibited normal growth and development; however, ACCase activity was 26% higher in <i>badc1 badc3</i> and its seeds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ed 30.1% more fatty acids and 32.6% more triacylgycerol relative to wild-type plants. To assess whether BADC contributes to the irreversible phase of ACCase inhibition, cell sus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pen</span></strong>sion cultures were generated from the leaves of <i>badc1 badc3</i> and wild-type plants and treated with 10 m<sc>m</sc> Tween 80. Reversible ACCase inhibition was similar in <i>badc1 badc3</i> and wild-type cultures after 2 d of Tween 80 treatment, but irreversible inhibition was reduced by 50% in <i>badc1 badc3</i> relative to wild-type plants following 4 d of Tween 80 treatment. In this study, we present evidence for two important homeostatic roles for BADC proteins in down-regulating ACCase activity: by acting during normal growth and development and by contributing to its long-term irreversible feedback inhibition resulting from the oversupply of fatty acids.</p>

Exocyst Subunit EXO70H4 Has a Specific Role in Callose Synthase Secretion and Silica Accumulation<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Biogenesis of the plant secondary cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> involves many important aspects, such as phenolic compound deposition and often silica encrustation. Previously, we demonstrated the importance of the exocyst subunit EXO70H4 for biogenesis of the trichome secondary cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>, namely for deposition of the autofluorescent and callose-rich cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> layer. Here, we reveal that EXO70H4-driven cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> biogenesis is constitutively active in the mature trichome, but also can be activated elsewhere upon pathogen attack, giving this study a broader significance with an overlap into phytopathology. To address the specificity of EXO70H4 among the EXO70 family, we complemented the <i>exo70H4-1</i> mutant by 18 different Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) EXO70 paralogs subcloned under the EXO70H4 promoter. Only EXO70H4 had the capacity to rescue the <i>exo70H4</i>-<i>1</i> trichome phenotype. Callose deposition phenotype of <i>exo70H4-1</i> mutant is caused by impaired secretion of PMR4, a callose synthase responsible for the synthesis of callose in the trichome. PMR4 colocalizes with EXO70H4 on plasma membrane microdomains that do not develop in the <i>exo70H4-1</i> mutant. Using energy-dispersive x-ray microanalysis, we show that both EXO70H4- and PMR4-de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pen</span></strong>dent callose deposition in the trichome are essential for cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> silicification.</p>

Hydrogen Sulfide Increases Production of NADPH Oxidase-Dependent Hydrogen Peroxide and Phospholipase D-Derived Phosphatidic Acid in Guard Cell Signaling<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) is an important gaseous signaling molecule in plants that participates in stress responses and development. <sc>l</sc>-Cys desulfhydrase 1, one of the enzymatic sources of H<sub>2</sub>S in plants, participates in abscisic acid-induced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e. We combined pharmacological and genetic approaches to elucidate the involvement of H<sub>2</sub>S in stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e and the interplay between H<sub>2</sub>S and other second messengers of the guard cell signaling network, such as hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and phospholipase D (PLD)-derived phosphatidic acid in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Both NADPH oxidase isoforms, respiratory burst oxidase homolog (RBOH)D and RBOHF, were required for H<sub>2</sub>S-induced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e. In vivo imaging using the cytosolic ratiometric fluorescent biosensor roGFP2-Orp1 revealed that H<sub>2</sub>S stimulates H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production in Arabidopsis guard cells. Additionally, we observed an interplay between H<sub>2</sub>S and PLD activity in the regulation of reactive oxygen species production and stomatal movement. The PLDα1 and PLDδ isoforms were required for H<sub>2</sub>S-induced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e, and most of the H<sub>2</sub>S-de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pen</span></strong>dent H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production required the activity of PLDα1.

Pollen Aperture Factor INP1 Acts Late in Aperture Formation by Excluding Specific Membrane Domains from Exine Deposition
<p>Accurate placement of extracellular materials is a critical part of cellular development. To study how cells achieve this accuracy, we use formation of pollen apertures as a model. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), three regions on the pollen surface lack deposition of pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> exine and develop into apertures. In developing pollen, Arabidopsis <i>INAPERTURATE POLLEN1</i> (INP1) protein acts as a marker for the preaperture domains, assembling there into three punctate lines. To understand the mechanism of aperture formation, we studied the dynamics of INP1 expression and localization and its relationship with the membrane domains at which it assembles. We found that INP1 assembly occurs after meiotic cytokinesis at the interface between the plasma membrane and the overlying callose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>, and requires the normal callose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> formation. Sites of INP1 localization coincide with positions of protruding membrane ridges in proximity to the callose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>. Our data suggest that INP1 is a late-acting factor involved in keeping specific membrane domains next to the callose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> to prevent formation of exine at these sites.</p>

A Synthetic Glycan Microarray Enables Epitope Mapping of Plant Cell Wall Glycan-Directed Antibodies
<p>In the last three decades, more than 200 monoclonal antibodies have been raised against most classes of plant cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> polysaccharides by different laboratories worldwide. These antibodies are widely used to identify differences in plant cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> components in mutants, organ and tissue types, and developmental stages.

Synthesis and Self-Assembly of Cellulose Microfibrils from Reconstituted Cellulose Synthase
<p>Cellulose, the major component of plant cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>s, can be converted to bioethanol and is thus highly studied. In plants, cellulose is produced by cellulose synthase, a processive family-2 glycosyltransferase. In plant cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>s, individual β-1,4-glucan chains polymerized by CesA are assembled into microfibrils that are frequently bundled into macrofibrils. An in vitro system in which cellulose is synthesized and assembled into fibrils would facilitate detailed study of this process. Here, we report the heterologous expression and partial purification of His-tagged CesA5 from <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. Immunoblot analysis and mass spectrometry confirmed enrichment of PpCesA5. The recombinant protein was functional when reconstituted into liposomes made from yeast total lipid extract. The functional studies included incorporation of radiolabeled Glc, linkage analysis, and imaging of cellulose microfibril formation using transmission electron microscopy. Several microfibrils were observed either inside or on the outer surface of proteoliposomes, and strikingly, several thinner fibrils formed ordered bundles that either <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cover</span></strong>ed the surfaces of proteoliposomes or were spawned from liposome surfaces. We also report this arrangement of fibrils made by proteoliposomes bearing CesA8 from hybrid as<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pen</span></strong>. These observations describe minimal systems of membrane-reconstituted CesAs that polymerize β-1,4-glucan chains that coalesce to form microfibrils and higher-ordered macrofibrils. How these micro- and macrofibrils relate to those found in primary and secondary plant cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>s is uncertain, but their presence enables further study of the mechanisms that govern the formation and assembly of fibrillar cellulosic structures and cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> composites during or after the polymerization process controlled by CesA proteins.</p>

Processes Underlying a Reproductive Barrier in <i>indica</i>-<i>japonica</i> Rice Hybrids Revealed by Transcriptome Analysis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>In rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), hybrids between <i>indica</i> and <i>japonica</i> subspecies are usually highly sterile, which provides a model system for studying postzygotic reproductive isolation. A killer-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protector</span></strong> system, <i>S5</i>, composed of three adjacent genes (<i>ORF3</i>, <i>ORF4</i>, and <i>ORF5</i>), regulates female gamete fertility of <i>indica-japonica</i> hybrids. To characterize the processes underlying this system, we performed transcriptomic analyses of pistils from rice variety Balilla (BL), Balilla with transformed <i>ORF5+</i> (BL<i>5+</i>) producing sterile female gametes, and Balilla with transformed <i>ORF3+</i> and <i>ORF5+</i> (BL<i>3+5+</i>) producing fertile gametes. RNA sequencing of tissues collected before (MMC), during (MEI), and after (AME) meiosis of the megaspore mother cell detected 19,269 to 20,928 genes as expressed. Comparison between BL<i>5+</i> and BL showed that <i>ORF5+</i> induced differential expression of 8,339, 6,278, and 530 genes at MMC, MEI, and AME, respectively. At MMC, large-scale differential expression of cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>-modifying genes and biotic and abiotic response genes indicated that cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> integrity damage induced severe biotic and abiotic stresses. The processes continued to MEI and induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress as indicated by differential expression of ER stress-responsive genes, leading to programmed cell death at MEI and AME, resulting in abortive female gametes. In the BL<i>3+5+</i>/BL comparison, 3,986, 749, and 370 genes were differentially expressed at MMC, MEI, and AME, respectively. Large numbers of cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> modification and biotic and abiotic response genes were also induced at MMC but largely suppressed at MEI without inducing ER stress and programed cell death , producing fertile gametes. These results have general implications for the understanding of biological processes underlying reproductive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barrier</span></strong>s.</p>

PECTIN METHYLESTERASE34 Contributes to Heat Tolerance through Its Role in Promoting Stomatal Movement

PME activity on the status of pectin methylesterification profoundly affects the properties of pectin and, thereby, is critical for plant development and the plant defense response, although the roles of PMEs under heat stress (HS) are poorly understood. Functional genome annotation predicts that at least 66 potential <i>PME</i> genes are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ed in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Thermotolerance assays of <i>PME</i> gene T-DNA insertion lines revealed two null mutant alleles of <i>PME34</i> (At3g49220) that both consistently showed reduced thermotolerance. Nevertheless, their impairment was inde<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pen</span></strong>dently associated with the expression of HS-responsive genes. It was also observed that <i>PME34</i> transcription was induced by abscisic acid and highly expressed in guard cells. We showed that the <i>PME34</i> mutation has a defect in the control of stomatal movement and greatly altered PME and polygalacturonase (EC 3.2.1.15) activity, resulting in a heat-sensitive phenotype. <i>PME34</i> has a role in the regulation of transpiration through the control of the stomatal aperture due to its cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>-modifying enzyme activity during the HS response. Hence, PME34 is required for regulating guard cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> flexibility to mediate the heat response in Arabidopsis.</p>

Insights into the Evolution of Hydroxyproline-Rich Glycoproteins from 1000 Plant Transcriptomes
<p>The carbohydrate-rich cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>s of land plants and algae have been the focus of much interest given the value of cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>-based products to our current and future economies. Hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs), a major group of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> glycoproteins, play important roles in plant growth and development, yet little is known about how they have evolved in parallel with the polysaccharide components of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>s. We investigate the origins and evolution of the HRGP superfamily, which is commonly divided into three major multigene families: the arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs), extensins (EXTs), and proline-rich proteins. Using motif and amino acid bias, a newly developed bioinformatics pipeline, we identified HRGPs in sequences from the 1000 Plants transcriptome project (<ext-link>www.onekp.com</ext-link>). Our analyses provide new insights into the evolution of HRGPs across major evolutionary milestones, including the transition to land and the early radiation of angiosperms. Significantly, data mining reveals the origin of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored AGPs in green algae and a 3- to 4-fold increase in GPI-AGPs in liverworts and mosses. The first detection of cross-linking (CL)-EXTs is observed in bryophytes, which suggests that CL-EXTs arose though the juxtaposition of preexisting SP<sub>n</sub> EXT glycomotifs with refined Y-based motifs. We also detected the loss of CL-EXT in a few lineages, including the grass family (Poaceae), that have a cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> composition distinct from other monocots and eudicots. A key challenge in HRGP research is tracking individual HRGPs throughout evolution. Using the 1000 Plants output, we were able to find putative orthologs of Arabidopsis pollen-specific GPI-AGPs in basal eudicots.</p>

Disrupting Flavone Synthase II Alters Lignin and Improves Biomass Digestibility
<p>Lignin, a ubiquitous phenylpropanoid polymer in vascular plant cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>s, is derived primarily from oxidative couplings of monolignols (<i>p</i>-hydroxycinnamyl alcohols). It was dis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cover</span></strong>ed recently that a wide range of grasses, including cereals, utilize a member of the flavonoids, tricin (3′,5′-dimethoxyflavone), as a natural comonomer with monolignols for cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> lignification. Previously, we established that cytochrome P450 93G1 is a flavone synthase II (OsFNSII) indis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pen</span></strong>sable for the biosynthesis of soluble tricin-derived metabolites in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). Here, our tricin-deficient <i>fnsII</i> mutant was analyzed further with an emphasis on its cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> structure and properties. The mutant is similar in growth to wild-type control plants with normal vascular morphology. Chemical and nuclear magnetic resonance structural analyses demonstrated that the mutant lignin is completely devoid of tricin, indicating that FNSII activity is essential for the deposition of tricin-bound lignin in rice cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>s. The mutant also showed substantially reduced lignin content with decreased syringyl/guaiacyl lignin unit composition. Interestingly, the loss of tricin in the mutant lignin appears to be partially com<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pen</span></strong>sated by incorporating naringenin, which is a preferred substrate of OsFNSII. The <i>fnsII</i> mutant was further revealed to have enhanced enzymatic saccharification efficiency, suggesting that the cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> recalcitrance of grass biomass may be reduced through the manipulation of the flavonoid monomer supply for lignification.</p>

Drought-Enhanced Xylem Sap Sulfate Closes Stomata by Affecting ALMT12 and Guard Cell ABA Synthesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Water limitation of plants causes stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e to prevent water loss by transpiration. For this purpose, progressing soil water deficit is communicated from roots to shoots. Abscisic acid (ABA) is the key signal in stress-induced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e, but ABA as an early xylem-delivered signal is still a matter of debate. In this study, poplar plants (<i>Populus × canescens</i>) were exposed to water stress to investigate xylem sap sulfate and ABA, stomatal conductance, and sulfate transporter (<i>SULTR</i>) expression. In addition, stomatal behavior and expression of ABA receptors, drought-responsive genes, transcription factors, and <i>NCED3</i> were studied after feeding sulfate and ABA to detached poplar leaves and epidermal peels of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The results show that increased xylem sap sulfate is achieved upon drought by reduced xylem unloading by PtaSULTR3;3a and PtaSULTR1;1, and by enhanced loading from parenchyma cells into the xylem via PtaALMT3b. Sulfate application caused stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e in excised leaves and peeled epidermis. In the loss of sulfate-channel function mutant, At<i>almt12</i>, sulfate-triggered stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e was impaired. The QUAC1/ALMT12 anion channel heterologous expressed in oocytes was gated o<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pen</span></strong> by extracellular sulfate. Sulfate up-regulated the expression of <i>NCED3</i>, a key step of ABA synthesis, in guard cells. In conclusion, xylem-derived sulfate seems to be a chemical signal of drought that induces stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e via QUAC1/ALMT12 and/or guard cell ABA synthesis.</p>

Here, we characterize the essential role of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) COPII protein SECRETORY31B (SEC31B) in pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> development and the secretory activity of tapetal cells. The sporophyte-controlled <i>atsec31b</i> mutant exhibits severe pollen and seed abortion. Transmission electron microscopy observation indicates that pollen exine formation in the <i>atsec31b</i> mutant is disrupted significantly. AtSEC31B is a functional COPII protein revealed by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit site localization, interaction with AtSEC13A, and retarded ER-Golgi protein trafficking in the <i>atsec31b</i> mutant. A genetic tapetum-specific rescue assay indicates that AtSEC31B functions primarily in the tapetum. Moreover, deletion of AtSEC31B interrupted the formation of the ER-derived tapetosome and altered the location of the ATP-BINDING CASSETTE TRANSPORTER9 protein in the tapetum. Therefore, this work demonstrates that AtSEC31B plays a vital role in pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> development by regulating the secretory pathway of the tapetal cells.</p>

A murine <i>Zic3</i> transcript with a premature termination codon evades nonsense-mediated decay during axis formation
<p>The ZIC transcription factors are key mediators of embryonic development and <i>ZIC3</i> is the gene most commonly associated with <i>situs</i> defects (heterotaxy) in humans. Half of patient <i>ZIC3</i> mutations introduce a premature termination codon (PTC). <i>In vivo</i>, PTC-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing transcripts might be targeted for nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). NMD efficiency is known to vary greatly between transcripts, tissues and individuals and it is possible that differences in survival of PTC-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing transcripts partially explain the striking phenotypic variability that characterizes ZIC3-associated congenital defects. For example, the PTC-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing transcripts might encode a C-terminally truncated protein that retains partial function or that dominantly interferes with other ZIC family members. Here we describe the katun (<i>Ka</i>) mouse mutant, which harbours a mutation in the <i>Zic3</i> gene that results in a PTC. At the time of axis formation there is no discernible decrease in this PTC-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing transcript <i>in vivo</i>, indicating that the mammalian <i>Zic3</i> transcript is relatively insensitive to NMD, prompting the need to re-examine the molecular function of the truncated proteins predicted from human studies and to determine whether the N-terminal portion of ZIC3 possesses dominant-negative capabilities. A combination of <i>in vitro</i> studies and analysis of the <i>Ka</i> phenotype indicate that it is a null allele of <i>Zic3</i> and that the N-terminal portion of ZIC3 does not encode a dominant-negative molecule. Heterotaxy in patients with PTC-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing <i>ZIC3</i> transcripts probably arises due to loss of ZIC3 function alone.</p>

Dynamic GLUT4 sorting through a syntaxin-6 compartment in muscle cells is derailed by insulin resistance-causing ceramide
<p>GLUT4 constitutively recycles between the plasma membrane and intracellular depots. Insulin shifts this dynamic equilibrium towards the plasma membrane by recruiting GLUT4 to the plasma membrane from insulin-responsive vesicles. Muscle is the primary site for dietary glucose deposition; however, how GLUT4 sorts into insulin-responsive vesicles, and if and how insulin resistance affects this process, is unknown. In L6 myoblasts stably expressing myc-tagged GLUT4, we analyzed the intracellular itinerary of GLUT4 as it internalizes from the cell surface and examined if such sorting is perturbed by C2-ceramide, a lipid metabolite causing insulin resistance. Surface-labeled GLUT4<i>myc</i> that internalized for 30 min accumulated in a Syntaxin-6 (Stx6)- and Stx16-positive perinuclear sub-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compart</span></strong>ment devoid of furin or internalized transferrin, and displayed insulin-responsive re-exocytosis. C2-ceramide dispersed the Stx6-positive sub-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compart</span></strong>ment and prevented insulin-responsive re-exocytosis of internalized GLUT4<i>myc</i>, even under conditions not affecting insulin-stimulated signaling towards Akt. Microtubule disruption with nocodazole prevented pre-internalized GLUT4<i>myc</i> from reaching the Stx6-positive perinuclear sub-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compart</span></strong>ment and from undergoing insulin-responsive exocytosis. Removing nocodazole allowed both parameters to re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cover</span></strong>, suggesting that the Stx6-positive perinuclear sub-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compart</span></strong>ment was required for GLUT4 insulin-responsiveness. Accordingly, Stx6 knockdown inhibited by ∼50% the ability of internalized GLUT4<i>myc</i> to undergo insulin-responsive re-exocytosis without altering its overall perinuclear accumulation. We propose that Stx6 defines the insulin-responsive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compart</span></strong>ment in muscle cells. Our data are consistent with a model where ceramide could cause insulin resistance by altering intracellular GLUT4 sorting.</p>

Infrared Nanospectroscopy Reveals the Chemical Nature of Pit Membranes in Water-Conducting Cells of the Plant Xylem
<p>In the xylem of angiosperm plants, microscopic pits through the secondary cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>s connect the water-conducting vessels. Cellulosic meshes originated from primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>s, and middle lamella between adjacent vessels, called the pit membrane, separates one conduit from another. The intricate structure of the nano-sized pores in pit membranes enables the passage of water under negative pressure without hydraulic failure due to obstruction by gas bubbles (i.e. embolism) under normal conditions or mild drought stress. Since the chemical composition of pit membranes affects embolism formation and bubble behavior, we directly measured pit membrane composition in <i>Populus nigra</i> wood. Here, we characterized the chemical composition of cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> structures by synchrotron infrared nanospectroscopy and atomic force microscopy-infrared nanospectroscopy with high spatial resolution. Characteristic peaks of cellulose, phenolic compounds, and proteins were found in the intervessel pit membranes of <i>P. nigra</i> wood. In addition, the vessel to parenchyma pit membranes and developing cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>s of the vascular cambium showed clear signals of cellulose, proteins, and pectin. We did not find a distinct peak of lignin and other compounds in these structures. Our investigation of the complex chemical composition of intervessel pit membranes furthers our understanding of the flow of water and bubbles between neighboring conduits. The advances presented here pave the way for further label-free studies related to the nanochemistry of plant cell components.</p>

Regular Motifs in Xylan Modulate Molecular Flexibility and Interactions with Cellulose Surfaces
<p>Xylan is tightly associated with cellulose and lignin in secondary plant cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>s, contributing to its rigidity and structural integrity in vascular plants. However, the molecular features and the nanoscale forces that control the interactions among cellulose microfibrils, hemicelluloses, and lignin are still not well understood. Here, we combine comprehensive mass spectrometric glycan sequencing and molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the substitution pattern in softwood xylans and to investigate the effect of distinct intramolecular motifs on xylan conformation and on the interaction with cellulose surfaces in Norway spruce (<i>Picea abies</i>). We confirm the presence of motifs with evenly spaced glycosyl decorations on the xylan backbone, together with minor motifs with consecutive glucuronation. These domains are differently enriched in xylan fractions extracted by alkali and subcritical water, which indicates their preferential positioning in the secondary plant cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> ultrastructure. The flexibility of the 3-fold screw conformation of xylan in solution is enhanced by the presence of arabinofuranosyl decorations. Additionally, molecular dynamic simulations suggest that the glycosyl substitutions in xylan are not only sterically tolerated by the cellulose surfaces but that they increase the affinity for cellulose and favor the stabilization of the 2-fold screw conformation. This effect is more significant for the hydrophobic surface compared with the hydrophilic ones, which demonstrates the importance of nonpolar driving forces on the structural integrity of secondary plant cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>s. These novel molecular insights contribute to an improved understanding of the supramolecular architecture of plant secondary cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>s and have fundamental implications for overcoming lignocellulose recalcitrance and for the design of advanced wood-based materials.</p>

Storage Compartments for Capillary Water Rarely Refill in an Intact Woody Plant
<p>Water storage is thought to play an integral role in the maintenance of whole-plant water balance. The contribution of both living and dead cells to water storage can be derived from rehydration and water-release curves on excised plant material, but the underlying tissue-specific emptying/refilling dynamics remain unclear. Here, we used x-ray computed microtomography to characterize the refilling of xylem fibers, pith cells, and vessels under both excised and in vivo conditions in <i>Laurus nobilis</i>. In excised stems supplied with water, water uptake exhibited a biphasic response curve, and x-ray computed microtomography images showed that high water storage capacitance was associated with fiber and pith refilling as driven by capillary forces: fibers refilled more rapidly than pith cells, while vessel refilling was minimal. In excised stems that were sealed, fiber and pith refilling was associated with vessel emptying, indicating a link between tissue connectivity and water storage. In contrast, refilling of fibers, pith cells, and vessels was negligible in intact saplings over two time scales, 24 h and 3 weeks. However, those <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compart</span></strong>ments did refill slowly when the shoot was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cover</span></strong>ed to prevent transpiration. Collectively, our data (1) provide direct evidence that storage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compart</span></strong>ments for capillary water refill in excised stems but rarely under in vivo conditions, (2) highlight that estimates of capacitance from excised samples should be interpreted with caution, as certain storage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compart</span></strong>ments may not be utilized in the intact plant, and (3) question the paradigm that fibers play a substantial role in daily discharge/recharge of stem capacitance in an intact tree.</p>

Abscisic Acid-Induced Reactive Oxygen Species Are Modulated by Flavonols to Control Stomata Aperture
<p>Abscisic acid (ABA) increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) in guard cells to close Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) stomata. In tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>), we find that ABA-increased ROS is followed by stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e and that both responses are blocked by inhibitors of ROS-producing respiratory burst oxidase enzymes. ABA-induced ROS sensor fluorescence accumulates in the nucleus, chloroplasts, and endomembranes. The accumulation of flavonol antioxidants in guard cells, but not surrounding pavement cells, was visualized by confocal microscopy using a flavonol-specific fluorescent dye. Decreased flavonols in guard cells in the <i>anthocyanin reduced</i> (<i>are</i>) mutant and elevated levels in the <i>anthocyanin without</i> (<i>aw</i>) mutant were quantified by confocal microscopy and in leaf extracts by mass spectrometry. Consistent with flavonols acting as antioxidants, higher levels of ROS were detected in guard cells of the tomato <i>are</i> mutant and lower levels were detected in <i>aw</i> both at homeostasis and after treatment with ABA. These results demonstrate the inverse relationship between flavonols and ROS. Guard cells of <i>are</i> show greater ABA-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e than the wild type, reduced light-de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pen</span></strong>dent guard cell o<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pen</span></strong>ing, and reduced water loss, with <i>aw</i> having opposite responses. Ethylene treatment of wild-type tomato plants increased flavonol accumulation in guard cells; however, no flavonol increases were observed in <i>Neverripe</i> (<i>Nr</i>), an ethylene receptor mutant. Consistent with lower levels of ROS due to elevated flavonols, ethylene treatments decreased ABA-induced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e in the wild type, but not <i>Nr</i>, with ethylene responses attenuated in the <i>are</i> mutant. Together, these results are consistent with flavonols dam<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pen</span></strong>ing the ABA-de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pen</span></strong>dent ROS burst that drives stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e and facilitating stomatal o<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pen</span></strong>ing to modulate leaf gas exchange.</p>

Rice Sucrose Partitioning Mediated by a Putative Pectin Methyltransferase and Homogalacturonan Methylesterification
<p>Homogalacturonan (HG) is the main component of pectins. HG methylesterification has recently emerged as a key determinant controlling cell attachment, organ formation, and phyllotaxy. However, whether and how HG methylesterification affects intercellular metabolite transport has rarely been reported. Here, we identified and characterized knockout mutants of the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) <i>OsQUA2</i> gene encoding a putative pectin methyltransferase. <i>Osqua2</i> mutants exhibit a remarkable decrease in the degree of methylesterification of HG in the culm-sieve element cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> and a markedly reduced grain yield. The culm of <i>Osqua2</i> mutant plants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>s excessive sucrose (Suc), and a <sup>13</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> feeding experiment showed that the Suc overaccumulation in the culm was caused by blocked Suc translocation. These and other findings demonstrate that OsQUA2 is essential for maintaining a high degree of methylesterification of HG in the rice culm-sieve element cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>, which may be critical for efficient Suc partitioning and grain filling. In addition, our results suggest that the apoplastic pathway is involved in long-distance Suc transport in rice. The identification and characterization of the <i>OsQUA2</i> gene and its functionality revealed a previously unknown contribution of HG methylesterification and provided insight into how modification of the cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> regulates intercellular transport in plants.</p>

Pipeline to Identify Hydroxyproline-Rich Glycoproteins
<p>Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are functional proteins that lack a well-defined three-dimensional structure. The study of IDPs is a rapidly growing area as the crucial biological functions of more of these proteins are un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cover</span></strong>ed. In plants, IDPs are implicated in plant stress responses, signaling, and regulatory processes. A superfamily of cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> proteins, the hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs), have characteristic features of IDPs. Their protein backbones are rich in the disordering amino acid proline, they <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong> repeated sequence motifs and extensive posttranslational modifications (glycosylation), and they have been implicated in many biological functions. HRGPs are evolutionarily ancient, having been isolated from the protein-rich <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>s of chlorophyte algae to the cellulose-rich <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong>s of embryophytes. Examination of HRGPs in a range of plant species should provide valuable insights into how they have evolved. Commonly divided into the arabinogalactan proteins, extensins, and proline-rich proteins, in reality, a continuum of structures exists within this diverse and heterogenous superfamily. An inability to accurately classify HRGPs leads to inconsistent gene ontologies limiting the identification of HRGP classes in existing and emerging omics data sets. We present a novel and robust motif and amino acid bias (MAAB) bioinformatics pipeline to classify HRGPs into 23 descriptive subclasses. Validation of MAAB was achieved using available genomic resources and then applied to the 1000 Plants transcriptome project (<ext-link>www.onekp.com</ext-link>) data set. Significant improvement in the detection of HRGPs using multiple-<i>k-</i>mer transcriptome assembly methodology was observed. The MAAB pipeline is readily adaptable and can be modified to optimize the re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cover</span></strong>y of IDPs from other organisms.</p>

A Rice <i>PECTATE LYASE-LIKE</i> Gene Is Required for Plant Growth and Leaf Senescence
<p>To better understand the molecular mechanisms behind plant growth and leaf senescence in monocot plants, we identified a mutant exhibiting dwarfism and an early-senescence leaf phenotype, termed <i>dwarf and early-senescence leaf1</i> (<i>del1</i>). Histological analysis showed that the abnormal growth was caused by a reduction in cell number. Further investigation revealed that the decline in cell number in <i>del1</i> was affected by the cell cycle. Physiological analysis, transmission electron microscopy, and TUNEL assays showed that leaf senescence was triggered by the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. The <i>DEL1</i> gene was cloned using a map-based approach. It was shown to encode a pectate lyase (PEL) precursor that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>s a PelC domain. <i>DEL1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>s all the conserved residues of PEL and has strong similarity with plant PelC. <i>DEL1</i> is expressed in all tissues but predominantly in elongating tissues. Functional analysis revealed that mutation of <i>DEL1</i> decreased the total PEL enzymatic activity, increased the degree of methylesterified homogalacturonan, and altered the cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> composition and structure. In addition, transcriptome assay revealed that a set of cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wall</span></strong> function- and senescence-related gene expression was altered in <i>del1</i> plants. Our research indicates that <i>DEL1</i> is involved in both the maintenance of normal cell division and the induction of leaf senescence. These findings reveal a new molecular mechanism for plant growth and leaf senescence mediated by <i>PECTATE LYASE-LIKE</i> genes.</p>

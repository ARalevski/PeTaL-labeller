Why is the flu vaccine so mediocre?
<p>With flu season around the corner in the United States and Europe, the push has begun once again to encourage people to receive their annual shots. But over the past few years, it's become increasingly clear that the level of protection offered by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e varies widely each flu season, from 10% to 60%. And new research has revealed surprising reasons for its lackluster performance. For decades, it appeared that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e had an efficacy of 70% to 90%, but scientists now know that's because they were using a misleading test—replaced in the 1990s—to assess whether it protected people. The traditional explanation for failure also has been revamped. The flu strains selected for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e change each year based on what's in circulation, and scientists long blamed failure on mutations that occur in the circulating viruses in the 6–8 months that pass between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e being manufactured and used. But these "mismatches" sometimes occur in years when there's solid protection, and some years with lots of failure have good matches. It turns out that other forces at work include mutations in the strain selected for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e during the manufacturing process, which grows the virus in eggs. People's prior exposure to influenza also can bias their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e system toward a response that undermines that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e-triggered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity. And the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e strain selection process itself relies heavily on the ferret animal model, which can mislead, too. There's an increasing call now to improve the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e and organize the research community to more collaboratively try to develop a "universal" flu shot that works against many strains and lasts for many years, if not a lifetime. </p>

Genetic and phenotypically flexible components of seasonal variation in immune function
<p>Animals cope with seasonal variation in environmental factors by adjustments of physiology and life history. When seasonal variation is partly predictable, such adjustments can be based on a genetic component or be phenotypically flexible. Animals have to allocate limited resources over different demands, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e function. Accordingly, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e traits could change seasonally, and such changes could have a genetic component that differs between environments. We tested this hypothesis in genotypically distinct groups of a widespread songbird, the stonechat (<i>Saxicola torquata</i>). We compared variation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity during 1 year in long-distance migrants, short-distance migrants, tropical residents and hybrids in a common garden environment. Additionally, we investigated phenotypically flexible responses to temperature by applying different temperature regimes to one group. We assessed constitutive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity by measuring hemagglutination, hemolysis, haptoglobin and bactericidal ability against <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. Genotypic groups differed in patterns of variation of all measured <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e indices except haptoglobin. Hybrids differed from, but were rarely intermediate to, parental subspecies. Temperature treatment only influenced patterns of hemolysis and bactericidal ability against <i>E. coli.</i> We conclude that seasonal variation in constitutive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity has a genetic component, that heredity does not follow simple Mendelian rules, and that some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e measures are relatively rigid while others are more flexible. Furthermore, our results support the idea that seasonal variability in constitutive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity is associated with variability in environment and annual-cycle demands. This study stresses the importance of considering seasonal variation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e function in relation to the ecology and life history of the organism of interest.</p>

A sweeter approach to vaccine design
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es have transformed human health. Yet, guided primarily by empiricism for centuries, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e design ultimately met its match in scourges such as HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria, which continue to plague global health. The elusive search for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es against such diseases has driven researchers of diverse expertise to forgo empirical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ology. Instead, they favor a reductionist approach inspired by how pathogens interact with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e system, which has evolved to distinguish foreign from self by sensing both physical (e.g, size) and chemical (e.g., foreign molecules) features of pathogens. This has guided the rational design of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es that mimic key pathogen properties, including arraying antigens on particles to increase recognition by antibody-producing B cells (<i>1</i>). However, the mechanisms by which multivalent antigen display on nanoparticles—either synthetic or natural—enhances <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity, and how this may influence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e design principles, remain unresolved. On page 649 of this issue, Tokatlian <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) help fill this knowledge gap by demonstrating that engineering nanoparticles with glycans—sugar molecules—is critical to potentiating antibody responses. This might lead to improved next-generation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es against a wide diversity of pathogens.</p>

Ethics of maternal vaccination
<p>Innovations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e science have given us an incredible opportunity to leverage the maternal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e system to improve maternal, fetal, and infant health outcomes. Maternal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ation reduces the risk of infant infection primarily through the transfer of protective maternal antibodies to the fetus (<i>1</i>). Although a growing number of countries are adopting maternal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e programs against diseases like influenza and pertussis, and there is an increased focus on including pregnant women in trials for new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es, there is little discussion of the ethical underpinnings of maternal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e programs (<i>2</i>). We see the proposals thus far as being overly paternalistic, founded on a too-limited conception of risk-benefit analyses that has potential to derail the development and use of lifesaving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es. By contrast, an ethical approach focused on mothers' primary interests in protecting themselves and their children could serve as the basis of the ethical framework that guides <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e policies.</p>

Zika rewrites maternal immunization ethics
<p>Pregnant women long have been excluded from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e studies because researchers are wary of causing unintended harm to the highly vulnerable developing fetus. But a new report from a group that represents many disciplines contends that ethics demand pregnant women be included in the trial of experimental Zika <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es, which are designed to protect babies from brain damage and other maladies caused by that mosquito-borne virus. The report is careful to point out that risk/benefit ratios must be weighed for each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e and each trial on a case-by-case basis—and indeed the Zika <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e that has moved furthest in human studies rightly excludes pregnant women, says a co-author of the report. Other experimental maternal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>izations designed to protect babies are also being tested now, and one trial, for a respiratory syncytial virus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e, includes pregnant women. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e against group B streptococcus has also moved along the development pipeline and may soon enter trials with pregnant women, too. A second new report on maternal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>izations issued last week explores the challenges of doing safety studies in these women and their babies.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
A Subset of Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes Is Essential for Plant Immunity
<p>Of the three classes of enzymes involved in ubiquitination, ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2) have been often incorrectly considered to play merely an auxiliary role in the process, and few E2 enzymes have been investigated in plants. To reveal the role of E2 in plant innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity, we identified and cloned 40 tomato genes encoding ubiquitin E2 proteins. Thioester assays indicated that the majority of the genes encode enzymatically active E2. Phylogenetic analysis classified the 40 tomato E2 enzymes into 13 groups, of which members of group III were found to interact and act specifically with AvrPtoB, a <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> effector that uses its ubiquitin ligase (E3) activity to suppress host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity. Knocking down the expression of group III E2 genes in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> diminished the AvrPtoB-promoted degradation of the Fen kinase and the AvrPtoB suppression of host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity-associated programmed cell death. Importantly, silencing group III E2 genes also resulted in reduced pattern-triggered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity (PTI). By contrast, programmed cell death induced by several effector-triggered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity elicitors was not affected on group III-silenced plants. Functional characterization suggested redundancy among group III members for their role in the suppression of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity by AvrPtoB and in PTI and identified UBIQUITIN-CONJUGATING11 (UBC11), UBC28, UBC29, UBC39, and UBC40 as playing a more significant role in PTI than other group III members. Our work builds a foundation for the further characterization of E2s in plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity and reveals that AvrPtoB has evolved a strategy for suppressing host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity that is difficult for the plant to thwart.</p>

Immunity as a continuum of archetypes
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e system has long been recognized for its importance in eliminating pathogens. Recently, it has become appreciated for additional distinct roles in normal tissue biology, contributing to tissue development and maintenance. Further, it is being revealed as a major force in diseases as diverse as fibrosis, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as cancer. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e system is exquisitely selective; more than a billion different adaptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e lymphocytes (T cells and B cells) survey the body. These can individually be sensitized to antigens—for example, by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ation—leading to their expansion and to a rapid and protective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e response that destroys antigen-bearing cells upon reexposure. Alternatively, the system can become “tolerant” when antigen-specific T cells and/or B cells are deleted or inactivated. Historically, activation versus inaction (tolerance) have dominated views of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e system. These, however, should be considered the extremes of a continuum of “archetypal” response states that collections of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e cells can take, many of which serve to accommodate dynamic tissue function.</p>

Innate immune recognition of glycans targets HIV nanoparticle immunogens to germinal centers
<p>In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e design, antigens are often arrayed in a multivalent nanoparticle form, but in vivo mechanisms underlying the enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity elicited by such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es remain poorly understood. We compared the fates of two different heavily glycosylated HIV antigens, a gp120-derived mini-protein and a large, stabilized envelope trimer, in protein nanoparticle or “free” forms after primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ization. Unlike monomeric antigens, nanoparticles were rapidly shuttled to the follicular dendritic cell (FDC) network and then concentrated in germinal centers in a complement-, mannose-binding lectin (MBL)–, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ogen glycan–dependent manner. Loss of FDC localization in MBL-deficient mice or via <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ogen deglycosylation significantly affected antibody responses. These findings identify an innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e–mediated recognition pathway promoting antibody responses to particulate antigens, with broad implications for humoral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e design.</p>

Analysis of the ZAR1 Immune Complex Reveals Determinants for Immunity and Molecular Interactions<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plants depend on innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity to prevent disease. Plant pathogenic bacteria, like <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> and <i>Xanthomonas campestris</i>, use the type III secretion system as a molecular syringe to inject type III secreted effector (T3SE) proteins in plants. The primary function of most T3SEs is to suppress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity; however, the plant can evolve nucleotide-binding domain-leucine-rich repeat domain-containing proteins to recognize specific T3SEs. The AtZAR1 NLR induces strong defense responses against <i>P. syringae</i> and <i>X. campestris</i>. The <i>P. syringae</i> T3SE HopZ1a is an acetyltransferase that acetylates the pseudokinase AtZED1 and triggers recognition by AtZAR1. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that lead to AtZAR1-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity in response to HopZ1a. We established a transient expression system in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> to study detailed interactions among HopZ1a, AtZED1, and AtZAR1. We show that the AtZAR1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e pathway is conserved in <i>N. benthamiana</i> and identify AtZAR1 domains, and residues in AtZAR1 and AtZED1, that are important for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity and protein-protein interactions in planta and in yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>). We show that the coiled-coil domain of AtZAR1 oligomerizes, and this domain acts as a signal to induce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity. This detailed analysis of the AtZAR1-AtZED1 protein complex provides a better understanding of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e signaling hub controlled by AtZAR1.</p>

Immunogene and viral transcript dynamics during parasitic <i>Varroa destructor</i> mite infection of developing honey bee (<i>Apis mellifera</i>) pupae
<p>The ectoparasitic <i>Varroa destructor</i> mite is a major contributor to the ongoing honey bee health crisis. <i>Varroa</i> interacts with honey bee viruses, exacerbating their pathogenicity. In addition to vectoring viruses, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>osuppression of the developing honey bee hosts by <i>Varroa</i> has been proposed to explain the synergy between viruses and mites. However, the evidence for honey bee <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e suppression by <i>V. destructor</i> is contentious. We systematically studied the quantitative effects of experimentally introduced <i>V. destructor</i> mites on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e gene expression at five specific time points during the development of the honey bee hosts. Mites reproduced normally and were associated with increased titers of deformed wing virus in the developing bees. Our data on different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e genes show little evidence for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>osuppression of honey bees by <i>V. destructor</i>. Experimental wounding of developing bees increases relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e gene expression and deformed wing virus titers. Combined, these results suggest that mite feeding activity itself and not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>osuppression may contribute to the synergy between viruses and mites. However, our results also suggest that increased expression of honey bee <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e genes decreases mite reproductive success, which may be explored to enhance mite control strategies. Finally, our expression data for multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e genes across developmental time and different experimental treatments indicates co-regulation of several of these genes and thus improves our understanding of the understudied honey bee <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e system.</p>

Upregulation of Human Endogenous Retrovirus-K Is Linked to Immunity and Inflammation in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e dysregulation has been linked to occlusive vascular remodeling in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) that is hereditary, idiopathic, or associated with other conditions. Circulating autoantibodies, lung perivascular lymphoid tissue, and elevated cytokines have been related to PAH pathogenesis but without a clear understanding of how these abnormalities are initiated, perpetuated, and connected in the progression of disease. We therefore set out to identify specific target antigens in PAH lung <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e complexes as a starting point toward resolving these issues to better inform future application of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>omodulatory therapies.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Lung <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e complexes were isolated and PAH target antigens were identified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, confirmed by enzyme-linked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>osorbent assay, and localized by confocal microscopy. One PAH antigen linked to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity and inflammation was pursued and a link to PAH pathophysiology was investigated by next-generation sequencing, functional studies in cultured monocytes and endothelial cells, and hemodynamic and lung studies in a rat.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>SAM domain and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1), an innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e factor that suppresses HIV replication, was identified and confirmed as highly expressed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e complexes from 16 hereditary and idiopathic PAH versus 12 control lungs. Elevated SAMHD1 was localized to endothelial cells, perivascular dendritic cells, and macrophages, and SAMHD1 antibodies were prevalent in tertiary lymphoid tissue. An unbiased screen using metagenomic sequencing related SAMHD1 to increased expression of human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K) in PAH versus control lungs (n=4). HERV-K envelope and deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase mRNAs were elevated in PAH versus control lungs (n=10), and proteins were localized to macrophages. HERV-K deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase induced SAMHD1 and proinflammatory cytokines (eg, interleukin 6, interleukin 1β, and tumor necrosis factor α) in circulating monocytes, pulmonary arterial endothelial cells, and also activated B cells. Vulnerability of pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (PAEC) to apoptosis was increased by HERV-K deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase in an interleukin 6-independent manner. Furthermore, 3 weekly injections of HERV-K deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase induced hemodynamic and vascular changes of pulmonary hypertension in rats (n=8) and elevated interleukin 6.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our study reveals that upregulation of the endogenous retrovirus HERV-K could both initiate and sustain activation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e system and cause vascular changes associated with PAH.</p></sec>

Genome-wide identification of interferon-sensitive mutations enables influenza vaccine design
<p>In conventional attenuated viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ogenicity is often suboptimal. Here we present a systematic approach for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e development that eliminates interferon (IFN)–modulating functions genome-wide while maintaining virus replication fitness. We applied a quantitative high-throughput genomics system to influenza A virus that simultaneously measured the replication fitness and IFN sensitivity of mutations across the entire genome. By incorporating eight IFN-sensitive mutations, we generated a hyper–interferon-sensitive (HIS) virus as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e candidate. HIS virus is highly attenuated in IFN-competent hosts but able to induce transient IFN responses, elicits robust humoral and cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e responses, and provides protection against homologous and heterologous viral challenges. Our approach, which attenuates the virus and promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e responses concurrently, is broadly applicable for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e development against other pathogens.</p>

Escaping the traps of your own hunters
<p>During the first days of an infection, protection is almost entirely provided by innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity, a large part of which consists of one type of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e cell—the neutrophil. Neutrophils form the largest group of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e cells in the body [humans produce ∼10<sup>11</sup> neutrophils daily (<i>1</i>)], and they carry out a number of defense mechanisms, including pathogen ingestion (phagocytosis) and the production of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong> chemicals that kill intruders directly. They can also cause severe hyperinflammatory diseases, such as lethal influenza-associated lung destruction (<i>2</i>, <i>3</i>). In 2004, another neutrophil defense system was discovered. In a final act of protection, dying neutrophils mix their nuclear DNA with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong> components from their cytosolic granules and release it explosively to form a neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) in the surrounding environment. This process is called NETosis (<i>4</i>). In addition to carrying genetic information, DNA is a very long (each nucleus contains ∼2 m of DNA) and sticky polyanionic molecule. Hence, DNA binds to surfaces such as bacterial cell walls by means of charge interactions (<i>5</i>). Through this immobilization on NETs, pathogens are brought into direct contact with cyto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong> molecules on the NET-DNA complex. However, free extracellular DNA is also a potent trigger of severe side effects in the body, for example, by forming <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e complexes with anti nuclear antibodies (antibodies that can bind to DNA) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (<i>6</i>) or by directly clogging blood vessels and establishing vessel-blocking thrombi (<i>7</i>). Consequently, finding mechanisms that mediate the degradation of NETs has been a matter of intense research. On page 1202 of this issue, Jiménez-Alcéázar <i>et al.</i> (<i>8</i>) describe two deoxyribonucleases (DNases) [DNase1 and DNase1-like 3 (DNase1L3)], which cleave DNA and together degrade freshly formed NETs. By doing so, they inhibit otherwise lethal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>opathologies such as thrombus-mediated organ failure.</p>

First flu is forever

Control strategies rely on annual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>izations and require frequent updates of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e, an expensive, cumbersome, and not always foolproof process.

Cross-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity is pervasive in nature; in multistrain viral diseases such as influenza or dengue, response to a primary infection can profoundly influence response to the next strain encountered. Even unrelated viruses can be recognized by the same cross-reactive T cells. On page 722 of this issue (<i>1</i>), Gostic <i>et al.</i> show that severe infection with a bird flu virus depends on the individual's first encounter with influenza in childhood.</p>

Roles of Receptor-Like Cytoplasmic Kinase VII Members in Pattern-Triggered Immune Signaling
<p>Pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), which consist of receptor kinases (RKs) and receptor-like proteins, sense microbe- and host-derived molecular patterns associated with pathogen infection to trigger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e responses in plants. Several kinases of the 46-member Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase (RLCK) subfamily VII play important roles in pattern-triggered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity, but it is unclear whether different RLCK VII members act specifically or redundantly in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e signaling. Here, we constructed nine higher order mutants of this subfamily (named <i>rlck vii-1</i> to <i>rlck vii-9</i>) and systematically characterized their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e phenotypes. The mutants <i>rlck vii-5</i>, -<i>7</i>, and -<i>8</i> had compromised reactive oxygen species production in response to all patterns tested, indicating that the corresponding members are broadly required for the signaling of multiple PRRs. However, <i>rlck vii-4</i> was defective specifically in chitin-induced reactive oxygen species production, suggesting that RCLK VII-4 members mediate the signaling of specific PRRs. Furthermore, RLCK VII-4 members were required for the chitin-triggered activation of MAPK, demonstrating that these kinases link a PRR to MAPK activation. Moreover, we found that RLCK VII-6 and -8 also were required for RK-mediated root growth. Together, these results show that numerous RLCK VII members are involved in pattern-triggered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e signaling and uncover both common and specific roles of these kinases in plant development and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity mediated by various RKs.</p>

Modulation of Plant Salicylic Acid-Associated Immune Responses via Glycosylation of Dihydroxybenzoic Acids
<p>Salicylic acid (SA) plays a crucial role in plant innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity. The deployment of SA-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e responses is primarily affected by SA concentration, which is determined by a balance between SA biosynthesis and catabolism. However, the mechanisms regulating SA homeostasis are poorly understood. In this study, we characterized a unique UDP-glycosyltransferase, UGT76D1, which plays an important role in SA homeostasis and associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e responses in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Expression of <i>UGT76D1</i> was induced by treatment with both the pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv. <i>tomato</i> (<i>Pst</i>) DC3000 and SA. Overexpression of <i>UGT76D1</i> resulted in high SA accumulation, significant up-regulation of pathogen-related genes, and a hypersensitive response (HR)-like lesion mimic phenotype. This HR-like phenotype was not observed following <i>UGT76D1</i> overexpression in SA-deficient <i>NahG</i> transgenic or <i>sid2</i> plants, suggesting that the phenotype is SA dependent. Biochemical assays showed that UGT76D1 glycosylated 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,3-DHBA) and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,5-DHBA), the major catabolic forms of SA, to their Glc and Xyl conjugates in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, in a mutant background blocked in the formation of 2,3-DHBA and 2,5-DHBA, <i>UGT76D1</i> overexpression did not cause a HR-like lesion mimic phenotype. Following infection with <i>Pst</i> DC3000, <i>UGT76D1</i> knockout mutants displayed a delayed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e response, with reduced levels of DHBA glycosides and SA, and down-regulated SA synthase expression. By contrast, <i>UGT76D1</i> overexpression lines showed an enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e response and increased SA biosynthesis before and after pathogen infection. Thus, we propose that UGT76D1 plays an important role in SA homeostasis and plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e responses by facilitating glycosylation of dihydroxybenzoic acids.</p>

Functional analysis of a zebrafish <i>myd88</i> mutant identifies key transcriptional components of the innate immune system
<p>Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are an important class of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that recognize microbial and danger signals. Their downstream signaling upon ligand binding is vital for initiation of the innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e response. In human and mammalian models, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MYD88) is known for its central role as an adaptor molecule in interleukin 1 receptor (IL-1R) and TLR signaling. The zebrafish is increasingly used as a complementary model system for disease research and drug screening. Here, we describe a zebrafish line with a truncated version of MyD88 as the first zebrafish mutant for a TLR signaling component. We show that this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e-compromised mutant has a lower survival rate under standard rearing conditions and is more susceptible to challenge with the acute bacterial pathogens <i>Edwardsiella tarda</i> and <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>. Microarray and quantitative PCR analysis revealed that expression of genes for transcription factors central to innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity (including NF-ĸB and AP-1) and the pro-inflammatory cytokine Il1b, is dependent on MyD88 signaling during these bacterial infections. Nevertheless, expression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e genes independent of MyD88 in the <i>myd88</i> mutant line was sufficient to limit growth of an attenuated <i>S. typhimurium</i> strain. In the case of infection with the chronic bacterial pathogen <i>Mycobacterium marinum</i>, we show that MyD88 signaling has an important protective role during early pathogenesis. During mycobacterial infection, the <i>myd88</i> mutant shows accelerated formation of granuloma-like aggregates and increased bacterial burden, with associated lower induction of genes central to innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity. This zebrafish <i>myd88</i> mutant will be a valuable tool for further study of the role of IL1R and TLR signaling in the innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity processes underlying infectious diseases, inflammatory disorders and cancer.</p>

IL-33 and ST2 mediate FAK-dependent antitumor immune evasion through transcriptional networks
<p>Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) mediates tumor cell–intrinsic behaviors that promote tumor growth and metastasis. We previously showed that FAK also induces the expression of inflammatory genes that inhibit antitumor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity in the microenvironment. We identified a crucial, previously unknown role for the dual-function cytokine interleukin-33 (IL-33) in FAK-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e evasion. In murine squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells, specifically nuclear FAK enhanced the expression of the genes encoding IL-33, the chemokine CCL5, and the soluble, secreted form of the IL-33 receptor, called soluble ST2 (sST2). The abundance of IL-33 and CCL5 was increased in FAK-positive SCC cells but not in normal keratinocytes. IL-33 associated with FAK in the nucleus, and the FAK–IL-33 complex interacted with a network of chromatin modifiers and transcriptional regulators, including TAF9, WDR82, and BRD4, which promote the activity of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and its induction of genes encoding chemokines, including CCL5. We did not detect secretion of IL-33 from FAK-positive SCC cells; thus, we propose that the increased production and secretion of sST2 likely sequesters IL-33 secreted by other cell types within the tumor environment, thus blocking its stimulatory effects on infiltrating host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e cells. Depleting FAK, IL-33, or sST2 from SCC cells before implantation induced tumor regression in syngeneic mice, except when CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were co-depleted. Our data provide mechanistic insight into how FAK controls the tumor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e environment, namely, through a transcriptional regulatory network mediated by nuclear IL-33. Targeting this axis may boost antitumor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity in patients.</p>

Steep drop in Zika cases undermines vaccine trial
<p>When Zika raced through the Americas in 2016, it caused widespread alarm because the usually mild infection led to brain damage in babies. An intense effort began to develop a Zika <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e, and in March 2017, the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases launched a $110 million trial of its most promising candidate. The trial, now taking place in nine countries in North and South America, has hit a wall: There are too few cases of Zika in the region—largely because vast swaths of populations were infected and now are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e—to assess whether the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e works. As a result, researchers are now planning to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ate people and then intentionally infect them with the Zika virus. This human challenge model, used for decades with other diseases, was dismissed as too risky by an ethics committee just last year, mainly because infected people can sexually transmit the virus to people who are not in the study. But given the drop in transmission, a better understanding about the duration of sexual transmission, and decreasing interest from industry in Zika <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e R&D, the human challenge model now looks like the best way to move the field forward.</p>

Congo rapidly curtails Ebola
<p>An outbreak of Ebola that surfaced in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) on 8 May has petered out and, for the first time, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e may have had a role in containing spread. To date, Ebola has struck 53 people in the DRC's Équateur province, killing 29. Most everyone lived in remote, difficult-to-reach villages, although four cases surfaced in the heavily populated city of Mbandaka, triggering serious concerns of an epidemic exploding. A vigorous, rapid effort to contain spread began immediately, with the DRC's Ministry of Public Health working with international partners to build treatment facilities, conduct surveillance, and trace contacts of cases. On 21 May, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e effort began that focused on creating a "ring" around cases by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ating people they may have come in contact with directly or indirectly. Some 3300 people received the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e, which is still experimental and was given in a clinical trial. But the trial did not have a control group, so it will not be possible to assess the precise role, if any, it played in stopping spread. Then again, no one who received the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e developed the disease as of yet, and researchers noted that simply providing it helped with Ebola education.</p>

Safety concerns derail dengue vaccination program
<p>Efforts to control dengue suffered a major setback in late November when Sanofi Pasteur announced that its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e, the only one on the market, should only be given to those who have already had one infection with the mosquito-borne disease that affects millions of people in the tropics each year. The dengue virus comes in four serotypes. A first infection is usually mild, but a second infection with a different serotype puts the patient at risk of a serious, occasionally life-threatening illness. A retrospective analysis of those who participated in phase III trials in 2011 found that those who had never had a dengue infection at the time of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ation were in rare cases at risk of enhanced disease, although the Dengvaxia <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e did reduce infections and cases of serious illness in those who had previously suffered from dengue.

Mouse models of acute and chronic hepacivirus infection
<p>An estimated 71 million people worldwide are infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). The lack of small-animal models has impeded studies of antiviral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e mechanisms. Here we show that an HCV-related hepacivirus discovered in Norway rats can establish high-titer hepatotropic infections in laboratory mice with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ological features resembling those seen in human viral hepatitis. Whereas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e-compromised mice developed persistent infection, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e-competent mice cleared the virus within 3 to 5 weeks. Acute clearance was T cell dependent and associated with liver injury. Transient depletion of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells before infection resulted in chronic infection, characterized by high levels of intrahepatic regulatory T cells and expression of inhibitory molecules on intrahepatic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Natural killer cells controlled early infection but were not essential for viral clearance. This model may provide mechanistic insights into hepatic antiviral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity, a prerequisite for the development of HCV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es.</p>

Reovirus infection triggers inflammatory responses to dietary antigens and development of celiac disease
<p>Viral infections have been proposed to elicit pathological processes leading to the initiation of T helper 1 (T<sub>H</sub>1) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity against dietary gluten and celiac disease (CeD). To test this hypothesis and gain insights into mechanisms underlying virus-induced loss of tolerance to dietary antigens, we developed a viral infection model that makes use of two reovirus strains that infect the intestine but differ in their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>opathological outcomes. Reovirus is an avirulent pathogen that elicits protective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity, but we discovered that it can nonetheless disrupt intestinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e homeostasis at inductive and effector sites of oral tolerance by suppressing peripheral regulatory T cell (pT<sub>reg</sub>) conversion and promoting T<sub>H</sub>1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity to dietary antigen. Initiation of T<sub>H</sub>1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity to dietary antigen was dependent on interferon regulatory factor 1 and dissociated from suppression of pT<sub>reg</sub> conversion, which was mediated by type-1 interferon. Last, our study in humans supports a role for infection with reovirus, a seemingly innocuous virus, in triggering the development of CeD.</p>

NRT1.1-Related NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> Toxicity Is Associated with a Disturbed Balance between NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> Uptake and Assimilation
<p>A high concentration of ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) as the sole source of nitrogen in the growth medium often is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong> to plants. The nitrate transporter NRT1.1 is involved in mediating the effects of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong>ity; however, the mechanism remains undefined. In this study, wild-type Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> Columbia-0 [Col-0]) and <i>NRT1.1</i> mutants (<i>chl1-1</i> and <i>chl1-5</i>) were grown hydroponically in NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> and (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> media to assess the function of NRT1.1 in NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> stress responses. All the plants grew normally in medium containing mixed nitrogen sources, but Col-0 displayed more chlorosis and lower biomass and photosynthesis than the <i>NRT1.1</i> mutants in (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> medium. Grafting experiments between Col-0 and <i>chl1-5</i> further confirmed that NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong>ity is influenced by NRT1.1. In (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> medium, NRT1.1 induced the expression of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> transporters, increasing NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> uptake. Additionally, the activities of glutamine synthetase and glutamate synthetase in roots of Col-0 plants decreased and soluble sugar accumulated significantly, whereas pyruvate kinase-mediated glycolysis was not affected, all of which contributed to NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> accumulation. By contrast, the <i>NRT1.1</i> mutants showed reduced NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> accumulation and enhanced NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> assimilation through glutamine synthetase, glutamate synthetase, and glutamate dehydrogenase. Moreover, the up-regulation of genes involved in ethylene synthesis and senescence in Col-0 plants treated with (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> suggests that ethylene is involved in NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong>ity responses. This study showed that NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong>ity is related to a nitrate-independent signaling function of <i>NRT1.1</i> in Arabidopsis, characterized by enhanced NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> accumulation and altered NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> metabolism, which stimulates ethylene synthesis, leading to plant senescence.</p>

BRASSINOSTEROID-SIGNALING KINASE1 Phosphorylates MAPKKK5 to Regulate Immunity in Arabidopsis
<p>Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e receptor FLAGELLIN SENSING2 (FLS2) rapidly forms a complex to activate pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity (PTI) upon perception of the bacterial protein flagellin. The receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase BRASSINOSTEROID-SIGNALINGKINASE1 (BSK1) interacts with FLS2 and is critical for the activation of PTI. However, it is unknown how BSK1 transduces signals to activate downstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e responses. We identified MEK Kinase5 (MAPKKK5) as a potential substrate of BSK1 by whole-genome phosphorylation analysis. In addition, we demonstrated that BSK1 interacts with and phosphorylates MAPKKK5. In the <i>bsk1</i>-<i>1</i> mutant, the Ser-289 residue of MAPKKK5 was not phosphorylated as it was in the wild type. Similar to the <i>bsk1</i> mutant, the <i>mapkkk5</i> mutant displayed enhanced susceptibility to virulent and avirulent strains of the bacterial pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> DC3000, and to the fungal powdery mildew pathogen <i>Golovinomyces cichoracearum</i>. Phosphorylation of the Ser-289 residue is not involved in MAPKKK5-triggered cell death but is critical for MAPKKK5-mediated resistance to both bacterial and fungal pathogens. Furthermore, MAPKKK5 interacts with multiple MAPK kinases, including MKK1, MKK2, MKK4, MKK5, and MKK6. Overall, these results indicate that BSK1 regulates plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity by phosphorylating MAPKKK5 and suggest a direct regulatory mode of signaling from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e complex to the MAPK cascade.</p>

Different Modes of Negative Regulation of Plant Immunity by Calmodulin-Related Genes
<p>Plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e responses activated through the perception of microbe-associated molecular patterns, leading to pattern-triggered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity, are tightly regulated. This results in low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e responses in the absence of pathogens and a rapid return to the resting state following an activation event. Here, we show that two <i>CALMODULIN-LIKE</i> genes, <i>CML46</i> and <i>CML47</i>, negatively regulate salicylic acid accumulation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The double mutant <i>cml46 cml47</i> is highly resistant to the pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>maculicola</i> (<i>Pma</i>). The effects of <i>cml46 cml47</i> on <i>Pma</i> growth are genetically additive to that of <i>cbp60a</i>, a known negative regulator in the <i>CALMODULIN-BINDING PROTEIN60</i> (<i>CBP60</i>) family. Transcriptome profiling revealed the effects of <i>cbp60a</i> and <i>cml46 cml47</i> on both common and separate sets of genes, with the majorities of these differentially expressed genes being <i>Pma</i> responsive. <i>CBP60g</i>, a positive regulator of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity in the <i>CBP60</i> family, was found to be transcriptionally regulated by <i>CBP60a</i>, <i>CML46</i>, and <i>CML47</i>. Analysis of the flg22-induced mRNA levels of <i>CBP60g</i> in <i>cbp60a</i> and <i>cml46 cml47</i> revealed that <i>cml46 cml47</i> plants have higher induced expression while <i>cbp60a</i> plants retain elevated levels longer than wild-type plants. Assays for the effect of flg22 treatment on <i>Pma</i> growth showed that the effect is stronger in <i>cml46 cml47</i> plants and lasts longer in <i>cbp60a</i> plants. Thus, the expression pattern of <i>CBP60g</i> is reflected in flg22-induced resistance to <i>Pma</i>.</p>

RXLR Effector AVR2 Up-Regulates a Brassinosteroid-Responsive bHLH Transcription Factor to Suppress Immunity
<p>An emerging area in plant research focuses on antagonism between regulatory systems governing growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity. Such cross talk represents a point of vulnerability for pathogens to exploit. AVR2, an RXLR effector secreted by the potato blight pathogen <i>Phytophthora infestans</i>, interacts with potato BSL1, a putative phosphatase implicated in growth-promoting brassinosteroid (BR) hormone signaling. Transgenic potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>) plants expressing the effector exhibit transcriptional and phenotypic hallmarks of overactive BR signaling and show enhanced susceptibility to <i>P. infestans</i>. Microarray analysis was used to identify a set of BR-responsive marker genes in potato, all of which are constitutively expressed to BR-induced levels in AVR2 transgenic lines. One of these genes was a bHLH transcription factor, designated <i>StCHL1</i>, homologous to <i>AtCIB1</i> and <i>AtHBI1</i>, which are known to facilitate antagonism between BR and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e responses. Transient expression of either AVR2 or CHL1 enhanced leaf colonization by <i>P. infestans</i> and compromised <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e cell death activated by perception of the elicitin Infestin1 (INF1). Knockdown of <i>CHL1</i> transcript using Virus-Induced Gene Silencing (VIGS) reduced colonization of <i>P. infestans</i> on <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. Moreover, the ability of AVR2 to suppress INF1-triggered cell death was attenuated in <i>NbCHL1</i>-silenced plants, indicating that NbCHL1 was important for this effector activity. Thus, AVR2 exploits cross talk between BR signaling and innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity in <i>Solanum</i> species, representing a novel, indirect mode of innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e suppression by a filamentous pathogen effector.</p>

Capping Protein Modulates Actin Remodeling in Response to Reactive Oxygen Species during Plant Innate Immunity
<p>Plants perceive microbe-associated molecular patterns and damage-associated molecular patterns to activate innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e signaling events, such as bursts of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The actin cytoskeleton remodels during the first 5 min of innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e signaling in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis</i> <i>thaliana</i>) epidermal cells; however, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e signals that impinge on actin cytoskeleton and its response regulators remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that rapid actin remodeling upon elicitation with diverse microbe-associated molecular patterns and damage-associated molecular patterns represent a conserved plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e response. Actin remodeling requires ROS generated by the defense-associated NADPH oxidase, RBOHD. Moreover, perception of flg22 by its cognate receptor complex triggers actin remodeling through the activation of RBOHD-dependent ROS production. Our genetic studies reveal that the ubiquitous heterodimeric capping protein transduces ROS signaling to the actin cytoskeleton during innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity. Additionally, we uncover a negative feedback loop between actin remodeling and flg22-induced ROS production.</p>

Cytoskeletal adaptivity regulates T cell receptor signaling
<p>The factors that govern T cell activation control the initiation and progression of adaptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e responses. T cells recognize their cognate antigen on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) through the T cell receptor, which results in the formation of a contact region (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e synapse) between the two cells and the activation of the T cells. Activated T cells proliferate and differentiate into effector T cells that secrete cytokines, provide help to B cells, and kill target cells. We asked whether the actin cytoskeleton governs differences in signaling in effector T cells versus naive (unstimulated) T cells. Using atomic force microscopy and quantitative confocal microscopy, we found that naive T cells had a mechanically stiffer cortical cytoskeleton than that of effector cells, which resulted in naive cells forming smaller <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e synapses with APCs. This suggests that the cytoskeletal stiffness of the T cell before it undergoes antigen stimulation predicts its subsequent dynamic engagement with APCs and its activation potential. Cytoskeletal rigidity depended on the activity of the actin-severing enzyme cofilin through a pathway requiring the small guanosine triphosphatase RhoA and the kinases ROCK (Rho-activated kinase) and LIMK. These findings suggest that the baseline cytoskeletal state controls T cell responses and that the underlying pathway could be a therapeutic target for modulating adaptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity.</p>

WHO's director-general took the committee's advice, but urged the international community to provide more financial support, noting full funding of the response through July would require $104 million more than is now on hand.</p>

Vaccine trial launched to stop Ebola
<p>On 8 May, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) announced that a new Ebola outbreak was underway in a remote part of the country, and within 3 days, the government decided for the first time to use an experimental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e to help stop spread. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e performed well in a large clinical trial held in Guinea in 2015, but it remains unlicensed and technically can only be used as part of a new study. The DRC hopes the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e will add to traditional containment efforts like quarantine for the infected and protective gear for medical teams and prevent the outbreak from exploding into a full-blown epidemic, as happened in West Africa in 2014. As <i>Science</i> went to press, the DRC had two confirmed and 39 probable and suspected cases in three different health districts. Most concerning, two of the probable cases are in Mbandaka, a city that has 1.2 million residents. In addition to helping the DRC launch the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e trial, the international community has responded in full force, quickly sending in teams of experts to help with surveillance, testing, and treatment for the infected.</p>

CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> mononuclear phagocytes control immunity to intestinal fungi
<p>Intestinal fungi are an important component of the microbiota, and recent studies have unveiled their potential in modulating host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e homeostasis and inflammatory disease. Nonetheless, the mechanisms governing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity to gut fungal communities (mycobiota) remain unknown. We identified CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) as being essential for the initiation of innate and adaptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e responses to intestinal fungi. CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> MNPs express antifungal receptors and activate antifungal responses in a Syk-dependent manner. Genetic ablation of CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> MNPs in mice led to changes in gut fungal communities and to severe colitis that was rescued by antifungal treatment. In Crohn’s disease patients, a missense mutation in the gene encoding CX3CR1 was identified and found to be associated with impaired antifungal responses. These results unravel a role of CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> MNPs in mediating interactions between intestinal mycobiota and host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity at steady state and during inflammatory disease.</p>

The structural basis of flagellin detection by NAIP5: A strategy to limit pathogen immune evasion
<p>Robust innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e detection of rapidly evolving pathogens is critical for host defense. Nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins function as cytosolic innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e sensors in plants and animals. However, the structural basis for ligand-induced NLR activation has so far remained unknown. NAIP5 (NLR family, apoptosis inhibitory protein 5) binds the bacterial protein flagellin and assembles with NLRC4 to form a multiprotein complex called an inflammasome. Here we report the cryo–electron microscopy structure of the assembled ~1.4-megadalton flagellin-NAIP5-NLRC4 inflammasome, revealing how a ligand activates an NLR. Six distinct NAIP5 domains contact multiple conserved regions of flagellin, prying NAIP5 into an open and active conformation. We show that innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e recognition of multiple ligand surfaces is a generalizable strategy that limits pathogen evolution and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e escape.</p>

Where has all the Zika gone?
<p>Only one case of locally transmitted Zika virus has been documented in the United States this year, a reflection of the fact that cases have plummeted in Latin America and the Caribbean. Experts say the cause of the drop has nothing to do with efforts to control the mosquitoes that spread the disease or the impact of climate on their populations. Rather, the rapid spread of the virus through the Americas—which had its first reported case in Brazil in April 2015—left large swaths of the population <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e. This so-called "herd <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity" has made it increasingly difficult for the Zika virus to find susceptible people, breaking the cycle of transmission between humans and mosquitoes. The drop in cases has not lessened the push to develop a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e against Zika, which caused widespread alarm after thousands of babies in Brazil were born with brain deformities that studies have shown are linked to the mothers being infected by the virus while they were pregnant. But with transmission in the region becoming scarce, it does complicate efforts of clinical trials that hope to show lower rates of transmission and disease in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ated people. One such trial is underway right now.</p>

Tumor aneuploidy correlates with markers of immune evasion and with reduced response to immunotherapy
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>otherapies based on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e checkpoint blockade are highly effective in a subset of patients. An ongoing challenge is the identification of biomarkers that predict which patients will benefit from these therapies. Aneuploidy, also known as somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs), is widespread in cancer and is posited to drive tumorigenesis. Analyzing 12 human cancer types, we find that, for most, highly aneuploid tumors show reduced expression of markers of cyto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong> infiltrating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e cells, especially CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, and increased expression of cell proliferation markers. Different types of SCNAs predict the proliferation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e signatures, implying distinct underlying mechanisms. Using published data from two clinical trials of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e checkpoint blockade therapy for metastatic melanoma, we found that tumor aneuploidy inversely correlates with patient survival. Together with other tumor characteristics such as tumor mutational load, aneuploidy may thus help identify patients most likely to respond to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>otherapy.</p>

The receptor kinase FER is a RALF-regulated scaffold controlling plant immune signaling
<p>In plants, perception of invading pathogens involves cell-surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e receptor kinases. Here, we report that the <i>Arabidopsis</i> SITE-1 PROTEASE (S1P) cleaves endogenous RAPID ALKALINIZATION FACTOR (RALF) propeptides to inhibit plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity. This inhibition is mediated by the malectin-like receptor kinase FERONIA (FER), which otherwise facilitates the ligand-induced complex formation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e receptor kinases EF-TU RECEPTOR (EFR) and FLAGELLIN-SENSING 2 (FLS2) with their co-receptor BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1–ASSOCIATED KINASE 1 (BAK1) to initiate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e signaling. We show that FER acts as a RALF-regulated scaffold that modulates receptor kinase complex assembly. A similar scaffolding mechanism may underlie FER function in other signaling pathways.</p>

A half-billion-dollar bid to head off emerging diseases
<p>In the wake of the Ebola crisis that erupted in West Africa in 2014, many public health leaders recognized that a more aggressive effort to develop <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es could have moved a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>e forward more quickly and prevented that outbreak from becoming an epidemic. A new organization was formed last year, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), to speed development of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es against emerging infectious diseases—but it had no serious financial backing. Now, CEPI has attracted nearly a half-billion dollars in funding, as it planned to announce at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, this week. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust each donated $100 million, and the governments of Norway, Japan, and Germany make up the balance. CEPI also decided to focus initially on three diseases—Lassa, Nipah, and Middle East respiratory syndrome–coronavirus—and it will soon seek proposals from academia and industry to make these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es and conduct early phase trials so that they're at the ready for a real-word efficacy test when these pathogens emerge.</p>

Generation of influenza A viruses as live but replication-incompetent virus vaccines
<p>The conversion of life-threatening viruses into live but avirulent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>es represents a revolution in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ology. In a proof-of-principle study, we expanded the genetic code of the genome of influenza A virus via a transgenic cell line containing orthogonal translation machinery. This generated premature termination codon (PTC)–harboring viruses that exerted full infectivity but were replication-incompetent in conventional cells. Genome-wide optimization of the sites for incorporation of multiple PTCs resulted in highly reproductive and genetically stable progeny viruses in transgenic cells. In mouse, ferret, and guinea pig models, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vaccin</span></strong>ation with PTC viruses elicited robust humoral, mucosal, and T cell–mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity against antigenically distinct influenza viruses and even neutralized existing infecting strains.

Social status alters immune regulation and response to infection in macaques
<p>Social status is one of the strongest predictors of human disease risk and mortality, and it also influences Darwinian fitness in social mammals more generally.

We demonstrate causal but largely plastic social status effects on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e cell proportions, cell type–specific gene expression levels, and the gene expression response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e challenge. Further, we identify specific transcription factor signaling pathways that explain these differences, including low-status–associated polarization of the Toll-like receptor 4 signaling pathway toward a proinflammatory response.

Rapid development of a DNA vaccine for Zika virus

BRASSINOSTEROID-SIGNALING KINASE5 Associates with Immune Receptors and Is Required for Immune Responses
<p>Plants utilize cell surface-localized pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to detect pathogen- or damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMP/DAMPs) and initiate pattern-triggered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity (PTI). Here, we investigated the role of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) BRASSINOSTEROID-SIGNALING KINASE5 (BSK5), a member of the receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase subfamily XII, in PRR-initiated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity. BSK5 localized to the plant cell periphery, interacted in yeast and in planta with multiple receptor-like kinases, including the ELONGATION FACTOR-TU RECEPTOR (EFR) and PEP1 RECEPTOR1 (PEPR1) PRRs, and was phosphorylated in vitro by PEPR1 and EFR in the kinase activation loop. Consistent with a role in PTI, <i>bsk5</i> mutant plants displayed enhanced susceptibility to the bacterial pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> and to the fungus <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>. Furthermore, <i>bsk5</i> mutant plants were impaired in several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e responses induced by the elf18, pep1, and flg22 PAMP/DAMPs, including resistance to <i>P. syringae</i> and <i>B. cinerea</i>, production of reactive oxygen species, callose deposition at the cell wall, and enhanced <i>PATHOGENESIS-RELATED1</i> gene expression. However, <i>bsk5</i> plants were not affected in PAMP/DAMP activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and expression of the <i>FLG22-INDUCED RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE1</i> or the WRKY domain-containing gene <i>WRKY29</i>. BSK5 variants mutated in the BSK5 myristoylation site, ATP-binding site, and kinase activation loop failed to complement defective PTI phenotypes of <i>bsk5</i> mutant plants, suggesting that localization to the cell periphery, kinase activity, and phosphorylation by PRRs are critical for the function of BSK5 in PTI. These findings demonstrate that BSK5 plays a role in PTI by interacting with multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e receptors.</p>

ARSENATE INDUCED CHLOROSIS 1/ TRANSLOCON AT THE OUTER ENVOLOPE MEMBRANE OF CHLOROPLASTS 132 Protects Chloroplasts from Arsenic Toxicity
<p>Arsenic (As) is highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong> to plants and detoxified primarily through complexation with phytochelatins (PCs) and other thiol compounds. To understand the mechanisms of As <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong>ity and detoxification beyond PCs, we isolated an arsenate-sensitive mutant of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), <i>arsenate induced chlorosis1</i> (<i>aic1</i>), in the background of the PC synthase-defective mutant <i>cadmium-sensitive1-3</i> (<i>cad1-3</i>). Under arsenate stress, <i>aic1 cad1-3</i> showed larger decreases in chlorophyll content and the number and size of chloroplasts than <i>cad1-3</i> and a severely distorted chloroplast structure. The <i>aic1</i> single mutant also was more sensitive to arsenate than the wild type (Columbia-0). As concentrations in the roots, shoots, and chloroplasts were similar between <i>aic1 cad1-3</i> and <i>cad1-3</i>. Using genome resequencing and complementation, <i>TRANSLOCON AT THE OUTER ENVOLOPE MEMBRANE OF CHLOROPLAST132</i> (<i>TOC132</i>) was identified as the mutant gene, which encodes a translocon protein involved in the import of preproteins from the cytoplasm into the chloroplasts. Proteomic analysis showed that the proteome of <i>aic1 cad1-3</i> chloroplasts was more affected by arsenate stress than that of <i>cad1-3</i>. A number of proteins related to chloroplast ribosomes, photosynthesis, compound synthesis, and thioredoxin systems were less abundant in <i>aic1 cad1-3</i> than in <i>cad1-3</i> under arsenate stress. Our results indicate that chloroplasts are a sensitive target of As <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong>ity and that AIC1/Toc132 plays an important role in protecting chloroplasts from As <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong>ity.</p>

Distinct Roles of Non-Overlapping Surface Regions of the Coiled-Coil Domain in the Potato Immune Receptor Rx1
<p>The intracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e receptor Rx1 of potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>), which confers effector-triggered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity to <i>Potato virus X</i>, consists of a central nucleotide-binding domain (NB-ARC) flanked by a carboxyl-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain and an amino-terminal coiled-coil (CC) domain. Rx1 activity is strictly regulated by interdomain interactions between the NB-ARC and LRR, but the contribution of the CC domain in regulating Rx1 activity or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e signaling is not fully understood. Therefore, we used a structure-informed approach to investigate the role of the CC domain in Rx1 functionality. Targeted mutagenesis of CC surface residues revealed separate regions required for the intramolecular and intermolecular interaction of the CC with the NB-ARC-LRR and the cofactor Ran GTPase-activating protein2 (RanGAP2), respectively. None of the mutant Rx1 proteins was constitutively active, indicating that the CC does not contribute to the autoinhibition of Rx1 activity. Instead, the CC domain acted as a modulator of downstream responses involved in effector-triggered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity. Systematic disruption of the hydrophobic interface between the four helices of the CC enabled the uncoupling of cell death and disease resistance responses. Moreover, a strong dominant negative effect on Rx1-mediated resistance and cell death was observed upon coexpression of the CC alone with full-length Rx1 protein, which depended on the RanGAP2-binding surface of the CC. Surprisingly, coexpression of the N-terminal half of the CC enhanced Rx1-mediated resistance, which further indicated that the CC functions as a scaffold for downstream components involved in the modulation of disease resistance or cell death signaling.</p>

The Kinase OsCPK4 Regulates a Buffering Mechanism That Fine-Tunes Innate Immunity
<p>The calcium-dependent protein kinase OsCPK4 has been demonstrated to play important roles in salt and drought tolerance, plant growth, and development in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). However, little is known about molecular mechanisms underlying OsCPK4 function in rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity. In this study, we demonstrated that the generation of oxidative burst and pathogenesis-related gene expression triggered by microbe-associated molecular patterns were significantly enhanced in the <i>oscpk4</i> mutants. These mutant lines are more resistant to bacterial blight and fungal blast diseases than the wild-type plants, indicating that OsCPK4 negatively regulates innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity in rice. OsCPK4 was further identified to interact with a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase OsRLCK176. OsRLCK176 accumulation is negatively regulated by OsCPK4. Interestingly, the kinase-dead OsCPK4 promotes OsRLCK176 degradation more strongly than the wild-type protein. OsCPK4 and OsRLCK176 mutually phosphorylate each other and form a feedback loop. Moreover, the kinase activity and phosphorylation of OsCPK4 and OsRLCK176 contribute to the stability of OsRLCK176. These findings indicate that the kinase-inactive OsCPK4 promotes OsRLCK176 degradation and restricts plant defenses, whereas the activation of OsCPK4-OsRLCK176 phosphorylation circuit invalidates the OsRLCK176 degradation machinery, thus enhancing plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity. Collectively, the study proposes a novel defense buffering mechanism mediated by OsCPK4, which fine-tunes microbe-associated molecular pattern-triggered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity in rice.</p>

Glutathione Transferase U13 Functions in Pathogen-Triggered Glucosinolate Metabolism<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Glutathione (GSH) and indole glucosinolates (IGs) exert key functions in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e system of the model plant Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Appropriate GSH levels are important for execution of both pre- and postinvasive disease resistance mechanisms to invasive pathogens, whereas an intact PENETRATION2 (PEN2)-pathway for IG metabolism is essential for preinvasive resistance in this species. Earlier indirect evidence suggested that the latter pathway involves conjugation of GSH with unstable products of IG metabolism and further processing of the resulting adducts to biologically active molecules. Here we describe the identification of Glutathione-<i>S</i>-Transferase class-tau member 13 (GSTU13) as an indispensable component of the PEN2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e pathway for IG metabolism. <i>gstu13</i> mutant plants are defective in the pathogen-triggered biosynthesis of end products of the PEN2 pathway, including 4-O-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosyl-indol-3-yl formamide, indole-3-ylmethyl amine, and raphanusamic acid. In line with this metabolic defect, lack of functional GSTU13 results in enhanced disease susceptibility toward several fungal pathogens including <i>Erysiphe pisi</i>, <i>Colletotrichum gloeosporioides</i>, and <i>Plectosphaerella cucumerina</i>. Seedlings of <i>gstu13</i> plants fail also to deposit the (1,3)-β-glucan cell wall polymer, callose, after recognition of the bacterial flg22 epitope. We show that GSTU13 mediates specifically the role of GSH in IG metabolism without noticeable impact on other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e functions of this tripeptide. We postulate that GSTU13 connects GSH with the pathogen-triggered PEN2 pathway for IG metabolism to deliver metabolites that may have numerous functions in the innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e system of Arabidopsis.</p>

Phospholipase C2 Affects MAMP-Triggered Immunity by Modulating ROS Production
<p>The activation of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) is one of the earliest responses triggered by the recognition of several microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) in plants. The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) PI-PLC gene family is composed of nine members. Previous studies suggested a role for PLC2 in MAMP-triggered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity, as it is rapidly phosphorylated in vivo upon treatment with the bacterial MAMP flg22. Here, we analyzed the role of PLC2 in plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity using an artificial microRNA to silence <i>PLC2</i> expression in Arabidopsis. We found that <i>PLC2</i>-silenced plants are more susceptible to the type III secretion system-deficient bacterial strain <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> (<i>Pst</i>) DC3000 <i>hrcC<sup>−</sup></i> and to the nonadapted pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) powdery mildew <i>Erysiphe pisi</i>. However, <i>PLC2</i>-silenced plants display normal susceptibility to virulent (<i>Pst</i> DC3000) and avirulent (<i>Pst</i> DC3000 AvrRPM1) <i>P. syringae</i> strains, conserving typical hypersensitive response features. In response to flg22, <i>PLC2</i>-silenced plants maintain wild-type mitogen-activated protein kinase activation and <i>PHI1</i>, <i>WRKY33</i>, and <i>FRK1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e marker gene expression but have reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent responses such as callose deposition and stomatal closure. Accordingly, the generation of ROS upon flg22 treatment is compromised in the <i>PLC2</i>-defficient plants, suggesting an effect of PLC2 in a branch of MAMP-triggered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity and nonhost resistance that involves early ROS-regulated processes. Consistently, PLC2 associates with the NADPH oxidase RBOHD, suggesting its potential regulation by PLC2.</p>

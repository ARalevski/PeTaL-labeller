Cation Specificity of Vacuolar NHX-Type Cation/H<sup>+</sup> Antiporters
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cation</span></strong>/H<sup>+</sup> (NHX-type) antiporters are important regulators of intracellular ion homeostasis and are critical for cell expansion and plant stress acclimation. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), four distinct NHX isoforms, named AtNHX1 to AtNHX4, locate to the tonoplast. To determine the concerted roles of all tonoplast NHXs on vacuolar ion and pH homeostasis, we examined multiple knockout mutants lacking all but one of the four vacuolar isoforms and quadruple knockout plants lacking any vacuolar NHX activity. The <i>nhx</i> triple and quadruple knockouts displayed reduced growth phenotypes. Exposure to sodium chloride improved growth while potassium chloride was deleterious to some knockouts. Kinetic analysis of K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> transport indicated that AtNHX1 and AtNHX2 are the main contributors to both vacuolar pH and K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> uptake, while AtNHX3 and AtNHX4 differ in Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> selectivity. The lack of any vacuolar NHX activity resulted in no K<sup>+</sup> uptake, highly acidic vacuoles, and reduced but not abolished vacuolar Na<sup>+</sup> uptake. Additional K<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange activity assays in the quadruple knockout indicated Na<sup>+</sup> uptake that was not H<sup>+</sup> coupled, suggesting the existence of an alternative, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cation</span></strong>/H<sup>+</sup>-independent, Na<sup>+</sup> conductive pathway in vacuoles. These results highlight the importance of NHX-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cation</span></strong>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters in the maintenance of cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cation</span></strong> homeostasis and in growth and development.</p>

Arylation of hydrocarbons enabled by organosilicon reagents and weakly coordinating anions
<p>Over the past 80 years, phenyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cation</span></strong> intermediates have been implicated in a variety of C–H arylation reactions. Although these examples have inspired several theoretical and mechanistic studies, aryl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cation</span></strong> equivalents have received limited attention in organic methodology. Their high-energy, promiscuous reactivity profiles have hampered appli<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cation</span></strong>s in selective intermolecular processes. We report a reaction design that overcomes these challenges. Specifically, we found that β-silicon–stabilized aryl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cation</span></strong> equivalents, generated via silylium-mediated fluoride activation, undergo insertion into sp<sup>3</sup> and sp<sup>2</sup> C–H bonds. This reaction manifold provides a framework for the catalytic arylation of hydrocarbons, including simple alkanes such as methane. This process uses low loadings of Earth-abundant initiators (1 to 5 mole percent) and occurs under mild conditions (30° to 100°C).</p>

Incorporation of rubidium cations into perovskite solar cells improves photovoltaic performance
<p>All of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cation</span></strong>s currently used in perovskite solar cells abide by the tolerance factor for incorporation into the lattice. We show that the small and oxidation-stable rubidium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cation</span></strong> (Rb<sup>+</sup>) can be embedded into a “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cation</span></strong> cascade” to create perovskite materials with excellent material properties. We achieved stabilized efficiencies of up to 21.6% (average value, 20.2%) on small areas (and a stabilized 19.0% on a cell 0.5 square centimeters in area) as well as an electroluminescence of 3.8%. The open-circuit voltage of 1.24 volts at a band gap of 1.63 electron volts leads to a loss in potential of 0.39 volts, versus 0.4 volts for commercial silicon cells. Polymer-coated cells maintained 95% of their initial performance at 85°C for 500 hours under full illumination and maximum power point tracking.</p>

Gene expression kinetics governs stimulus-specific decoration of the <i>Salmonella</i> outer membrane
<p>Lipid A is the innermost component of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecules that occupy the outer leaflet of the outer membrane in Gram-negative bacteria. Lipid A is recognized by the host immune system and targeted by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cation</span></strong>ic antimicrobial compounds. In <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhimurium, the phosphates of lipid A are chemically modified by enzymes encoded by targets of the transcriptional regulator PmrA. These modifi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cation</span></strong>s increase resistance to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cation</span></strong>ic peptide antibiotic polymyxin B by reducing the negative charge of the LPS. We report the mechanism by which <i>Salmonella</i> produces different lipid A profiles when PmrA is activated by low Mg<sup>2+</sup> versus a mildly acidic pH. Low Mg<sup>2+</sup> favored modifi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cation</span></strong> of the lipid A phosphates with 4-amino-4-deoxy-<sc>l</sc>-aminoarabinose (<sc>l</sc>-Ara4N) by activating the regulatory protein PhoP, which initially increased the LPS negative charge by promoting transcription of <i>lpxT</i>, encoding an enzyme that adds an additional phosphate group to lipid A. Later, PhoP activated PmrA posttranslationally, resulting in expression of PmrA-activated genes, including those encoding the LpxT inhibitor PmrR and enzymes responsible for the incorporation of <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N. By contrast, a mildly acidic pH favored modifi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cation</span></strong> of the lipid A phosphates with a mixture of <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N and phosphoethanolamine (pEtN) by simultaneously inducing the PhoP-activated <i>lpxT</i> and PmrA-activated <i>pmrR</i> genes. Although <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N reduces the LPS negative charge more than does pEtN, modifi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cation</span></strong> of lipid A phosphates solely with <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N required a prior transient increase in lipid A negative charge. Our findings demonstrate how bacteria tailor their cell surface to different stresses, such as those faced inside phagocytes.</p>

Teaching an old carbocation new tricks: Intermolecular C–H insertion reactions of vinyl cations
<p>Vinyl carbo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cation</span></strong>s have been the subject of extensive experimental and theoretical studies over the past five decades. Despite this long history in chemistry, the utility of vinyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cation</span></strong>s in chemical synthesis has been limited, with most reactivity studies focusing on solvolysis reactions or intramolecular processes. Here we report synthetic and mechanistic studies of vinyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cation</span></strong>s generated through silylium–weakly coordinating anion catalysis. We find that these reactive intermediates undergo mild intermolecular carbon-carbon bond–forming reactions, including carbon-hydrogen (C–H) insertion into unactivated sp<sup>3</sup> C–H bonds and reductive Friedel-Crafts reactions with arenes. Moreover, we conducted computational studies of these alkane C–H functionalization reactions and discovered that they proceed through nonclassical, ambimodal transition structures.

Structure of the human TRPM4 ion channel in a lipid nanodisc
<p>Transient receptor potential (TRP) melastatin 4 (TRPM4) is a widely expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cation</span></strong> channel associated with a variety of cardiovascular disorders. TRPM4 is activated by increased intracellular calcium in a voltage-dependent manner but, unlike many other TRP channels, is permeable to monovalent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cation</span></strong>s only. Here we present two structures of full-length human TRPM4 embedded in lipid n<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anod</span></strong>iscs at ~3-angstrom resolution, as determined by single-particle cryo–electron microscopy. These structures, with and without calcium bound, reveal a general architecture for this major subfamily of TRP channels and a well-defined calcium-binding site within the intracellular side of the S1-S4 domain. The structures correspond to two distinct closed states. Calcium binding induces conformational changes that likely prime the channel for voltage-dependent opening.</p>

Highly elastic binders integrating polyrotaxanes for silicon microparticle anodes in lithium ion batteries
<p>Lithium-ion batteries with ever-increasing energy densities are needed for batteries for advanced devices and all-electric vehicles. Silicon has been highlighted as a promising <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anod</span></strong>e material because of its superior specific capacity. During repeated charge-discharge cycles, silicon undergoes huge volume changes. This limits cycle life via particle pulverization and an unstable electrode-electrolyte interface, especially when the particle sizes are in the micrometer range. We show that the incorporation of 5 weight % polyrotaxane to conventional polyacrylic acid binder imparts extraordinary elasticity to the polymer network originating from the ring sliding motion of polyrotaxane. This binder combination keeps even pulverized silicon particles coalesced without disintegration, enabling stable cycle life for silicon microparticle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anod</span></strong>es at commercial-level areal capacities.</p>

The SlCBL10 Calcineurin B-Like Protein Ensures Plant Growth under Salt Stress by Regulating Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> Homeostasis<sup>1</sup>
<p>Characterization of a new tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) T-DNA mutant allowed for the isolation of the <i>CALCINEURIN B-LIKE PROTEIN 10</i> (<i>SlCBL10</i>) gene whose lack of function was responsible for the severe alterations observed in the shoot apex and reproductive organs under salinity conditions. Physiological studies proved that <i>SlCBL10</i> gene is required to maintain a proper low Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> ratio in growing tissues allowing tomato growth under salt stress. Expression analysis of the main responsible genes for Na<sup>+</sup> compartmentalization (i.e. <i>Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> EXCHANGERs</i>, <i>SALT OVERLY SENSITIVE</i>, <i>HIGH-AFFINITY K+ TRANSPORTER 1;2</i>, <i>H<sup>+</sup>-pyrophosphatase AVP1</i> [<i>SlAVP1</i>] and V-ATPase [<i>SlVHA-A1</i>]) supported a reduced capacity to accumulate Na<sup>+</sup> in <i>Slcbl10</i> mutant leaves, which resulted in a lower uploading of Na<sup>+</sup> from xylem, allowing the toxic ion to reach apex and flowers. Likewise, the tomato <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cation</span></strong> EXCHANGER 1</i> and <i>TWO-PORE CHANNEL 1</i> (<i>SlTPC1</i>), key genes for Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes to the vacuole, showed abnormal expression in <i>Slcbl10</i> plants indicating an impaired Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from vacuole. Additionally, complementation assay revealed that <i>SlCBL10</i> is a true ortholog of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>CBL10</i> gene, supporting that the essential function of CBL10 is conserved in Arabidopsis and tomato. Together, the findings obtained in this study provide new insights into the function of <i>SlCBL10</i> in salt stress tolerance. Thus, it is proposed that SlCBL10 mediates salt tolerance by regulating Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes in the vacuole, cooperating with the vacuolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cation</span></strong> channel <i>SlTPC1</i> and the two vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-pumps, <i>SlAVP1</i> and <i>SlVHA-A1</i>, which in turn are revealed as potential targets of <i>SlCBL10</i>.</p>

CDK5 inhibits the clathrin-dependent internalization of TRPV1 by phosphorylating the clathrin adaptor protein AP2μ2
<p>Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), a nonselective, ligand-gated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cation</span></strong> channel, responds to multiple noxious stimuli and is targeted by many kinases that influence its trafficking and activity. Studies on the internalization of TRPV1 have mainly focused on that induced by capsaicin or other agonists. Here, we report that constitutive internalization of TRPV1 occurred in a manner dependent on clathrin, dynamin, and adaptor protein complex 2 (AP2). The μ2 subunit of AP2 (AP2μ2) interacted directly with TRPV1 and was required for its constitutive internalization. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) phosphorylated AP2μ2 at Ser<sup>45</sup>, which reduced the interaction between TRPV1 and AP2μ2, leading to decreased TRPV1 internalization. Intrathecal delivery of a cell-penetrating fusion peptide corresponding to the Cdk5 phosphorylation site in AP2μ2, which competed with AP2μ2 for phosphorylation by Cdk5, increased the abundance of TRPV1 on the surface of dorsal root ganglion neurons and reduced complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA)–induced inflammatory thermal hyperalgesia in rats. In addition to describing a mechanism of TRPV1 constitutive internalization and its inhibition by CDK5, these findings demonstrate that CDK5 promotes inflammatory thermal hyperalgesia by reducing TRPV1 internalization, providing previously unidentified insights into the search for drug targets to treat pain.</p>

Polycystin 2 regulates mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, bioenergetics, and dynamics through mitofusin 2
<p>Mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) have an intimate functional relationship due to tethering proteins that bring their membranes in close (~30 nm) apposition. One function of this interorganellar junction is to increase the efficiency of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer into mitochondria, thus stimulating mitochondrial respiration. Here, we showed that the ER <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cation</span></strong>-permeant channel polycystin 2 (PC2) functions to reduce mitochondria-ER contacts. In cell culture models, PC2 knockdown led to a 50% increase in mitofusin 2 (MFN2) expression, an outer mitochondrial membrane GTPase. Live-cell super-resolution and electron microscopy analyses revealed enhanced MFN2-dependent tethering between the ER and mitochondria in PC2 knockdown cells. PC2 knockdown also led to increased ER-mediated mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, bioenergetic activation, and mitochondrial density. Mutation or deletion of the gene encoding for PC2 results in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), a condition characterized by numerous fluid-filled cysts. In cell culture models and mice with kidney-specific PC2 knockout, knockdown of MFN2 rescued defective mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer and diminished cell proliferation in kidney cysts. Consistent with these results, cyst-lining epithelial cells from human ADPKD kidneys had a twofold increase in mitochondria and MFN2 expression. Our data suggest that PC2 normally serves to limit key mitochondrial proteins at the ER-mitochondrial interface and acts as a checkpoint for mitochondrial biogenesis and bioenergetics. Loss of this regulation may contribute to the increased oxidative metabolism and aberrant cell proliferation typical of kidney cysts in ADPKD.</p>

TRPM7 channels mediate spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluctuations in growth plate chondrocytes that promote bone development
<p>During endochondral ossifi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cation</span></strong> of long bones, the proliferation and differentiation of chondrocytes cause them to be arranged into layered structures constituting the epiphyseal growth plate, where they secrete the cartilage matrix that is subsequently converted into trabecular bone. Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling has been implicated in chondrogenesis in vitro. Through fluorometric imaging of bone slices from embryonic mice, we demonstrated that live growth plate chondrocytes generated small, cell-autonomous Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluctuations that were associated with weak and intermittent Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Several genes encoding Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable channels were expressed in growth plate chondrocytes, but only pharmacological inhibitors of transient receptor potential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cation</span></strong> channel subfamily M member 7 (TRPM7) reduced the spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluctuations. The TRPM7-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was likely activated downstream of basal phospholipase C activity and was potentiated upon cell hyperpolarization induced by big-conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent K<sup>+</sup> channels. Bones from embryos in which <i>Trpm7</i> was conditionally knocked out during ex vivo culture exhibited reduced outgrowth and displayed histological abnormalities accompanied by insufficient autophosphorylation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in the growth plate. The link between TRPM7-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluctuations and CaMKII-dependent chondrogenesis was further supported by experiments with chondrocyte-specific <i>Trpm7</i> knockout mice. Thus, growth plate chondrocytes generate spontaneous, TRPM7-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluctuations that promote self-maturation and bone development.</p>

Pharmacological manipulation, genetic ablation, and siRNA-mediated knockdown in oviductal cells, as well as overexpression experiments in HEK 293T cells, confirmed the participation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cation</span></strong>ic channel TRPV4, different subunits of GABA<sub>A</sub> (α1 to α3, β2, and β3), and GABA<sub>B1</sub> in P4-induced responses.

Inhibition of somatosensory mechanotransduction by annexin A6
<p>Mechanically activated, slowly adapting currents in sensory neurons have been linked to noxious mechanosensation. The conotoxin NMB-1 (noxious mechanosensation blocker-1) blocks such currents and inhibits mechanical pain. Using a biotinylated form of NMB-1 in mass spectrometry analysis, we identified 67 binding proteins in sensory neurons and a sensory neuron–derived cell line, of which the top candidate was annexin A6, a membrane-associated calcium-binding protein. Annexin A6–deficient mice showed increased sensitivity to mechanical stimuli. Sensory neurons from these mice showed increased activity of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cation</span></strong> channel Piezo2, which mediates a rapidly adapting mechano-gated current linked to proprioception and touch, and a decrease in mechanically activated, slowly adapting currents. Conversely, overexpression of annexin A6 in sensory neurons inhibited rapidly adapting currents that were partially mediated by Piezo2. Furthermore, overexpression of annexin A6 in sensory neurons attenuated mechanical pain in a mouse model of osteoarthritis, a disease in which mechanically evoked pain is particularly problematic. These data suggest that annexin A6 can be exploited to inhibit chronic mechanical pain.</p>

The ion channel TRPM7 is required for B cell lymphopoiesis
<p>The transient receptor potential (TRP) family is a large family of widely expressed ion channels that regulate the intracellular concentration of ions and metals and respond to various chemical and physical stimuli. TRP subfamily M member 7 (TRPM7) is unusual in that it contains both an ion channel and a kinase domain. TRPM7 is a divalent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cation</span></strong> channel with preference for Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>. It is required for the survival of DT40 cells, a B cell line; however, deletion of TRPM7 in T cells does not impair their development. We found that expression of TRPM7 was required for B cell development in mice. Mice that lacked TRPM7 in B cells failed to generate peripheral B cells because of a developmental block at the pro-B cell stage. The loss of TRPM7 kinase activity alone did not affect the proportion of peripheral mature B cells or the development of B cells in the bone marrow. However, supplementation with a high concentration of extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> partially rescued the development of TRPM7-deficient B cells in vitro. Thus, our findings identify a critical role for TRPM7 ion channel activity in B cell development.</p>

Furthermore, mass spectrometry analysis indicated that c-di-AMP accumulated in bacteria grown in the presence of high K<sup>+</sup> concentrations but not in low concentrations.

We show how these conditions have a very high level of functional-group tolerance relative to classical electrochemical and chemical dissolving-metal reductions. Finally, we demonstrate that the same electrochemical conditions can be applied to other dissolving metal–type reductive transformations, including McMurry couplings, reductive ketone deoxygenations, and epoxide openings.</p>

Halide homogenization coincides with long-lived charge carrier decays, spatially homogeneous carrier dynamics (as visualized by ultrafast microscopy), and improved photovoltaic device performance. We found that rubidium and potassium phase-segregate in highly concentrated clusters.

Structures and gating mechanism of human TRPM2
<p>Transient receptor potential (TRP) melastatin 2 (TRPM2) is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cation</span></strong> channel associated with numerous diseases. It has a C-terminal NUDT9 homology (NUDT9H) domain responsible for binding adenosine diphosphate (ADP)–ribose (ADPR), and both ADPR and calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) are required for TRPM2 activation. Here we report cryo–electron microscopy structures of human TRPM2 alone, with ADPR, and with ADPR and Ca<sup>2+</sup>. NUDT9H forms both intra- and intersubunit interactions with the N-terminal TRPM homology region (MHR1/2/3) in the apo state but undergoes conformational changes upon ADPR binding, resulting in rotation of MHR1/2 and disruption of the intersubunit interaction. The binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> further engages transmembrane helices and the conserved TRP helix to cause conformational changes at the MHR arm and the lower gating pore to potentiate channel opening. These findings explain the molecular mechanism of concerted TRPM2 gating by ADPR and Ca<sup>2+</sup> and provide insights into the gating mechanism of other TRP channels.</p>

Catalytic palladium-oxyallyl cycloaddition
<p>Exploration of intermediates that enable chemoselective cycloaddition reactions and expeditious construction of fused- or bridged-ring systems is a continuous challenge for organic synthesis. As an intermediate of interest, the oxyallyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cation</span></strong> has been harnessed to synthesize architectures containing seven-membered rings via (4+3) cycloaddition. However, its potential to access five-membered skeletons is underdeveloped, largely due to the thermally forbidden (3+2) pathway. Here, the combination of a tailored precursor and a Pd(0) catalyst generates a Pd-oxyallyl intermediate that cyclizes with conjugated dienes to produce a diverse array of tetrahydrofuran skeletons. The cycloaddition overrides conventional (4+3) selectivity by proceeding through a stepwise pathway involving a Pd-allyl transfer and ring closure sequence. Subsequent treatment of the (3+2) adducts with a palladium catalyst converts the heterocycles to the carbocyclic cyclopentanones.</p>

A general synthesis approach for supported bimetallic nanoparticles via surface inorganometallic chemistry
<p>The synthesis of ultrasmall supported bimetallic nanoparticles (between 1 and 3 nanometers in diameter) with well-defined stoichiometry and intimacy between constituent metals remains a substantial challenge. We synthesized 10 different supported bimetallic nanoparticles via surface inorganometallic chemistry by decomposing and reducing surface-adsorbed heterometallic double complex salts, which are readily obtained upon sequential adsorption of target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cation</span></strong>s and anions on a silica substrate. For example, adsorption of tetraamminepalladium(II) [Pd(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub><sup>2+</sup>] followed by adsorption of tetrachloroplatinate [PtCl<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>] was used to form palladium-platinum (Pd-Pt) nanoparticles. These supported bimetallic nanoparticles show enhanced catalytic performance in acetylene selective hydrogenation, which clearly demonstrates a synergistic effect between constituent metals.</p>

Methylammonium-free, high-performance, and stable perovskite solar cells on a planar architecture
<p>Currently, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with high performances greater than 20% contain bromine (Br), causing a suboptimal bandgap, and the thermally unstable methylammonium (MA) molecule. Avoiding Br and especially MA can therefore result in more optimal bandgaps and stable perovskites. We show that inorganic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cation</span></strong> tuning, using rubidium and cesium, enables highly crystalline formamidinium-based perovskites without Br or MA. On a conventional, planar device architecture, using polymeric interlayers at the electron- and hole-transporting interface, we demonstrate an efficiency of 20.35% (stabilized), one of the highest for MA-free perovskites, with a drastically improved stability reached without the stabilizing influence of mesoporous interlayers. The perovskite is not heated beyond 100°C. Going MA-free is a new direction for perovskites that are inherently stable and compatible with tandems or flexible substrates, which are the main routes commercializing PSCs.</p>

Structure of the human PKD1-PKD2 complex
<p>Mutations in two genes, <i>PKD1</i> and <i>PKD2</i>, account for most cases of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, one of the most common monogenetic disorders. Here we report the 3.6-angstrom cryo–electron microscopy structure of truncated human PKD1-PKD2 complex assembled in a 1:3 ratio. PKD1 contains a voltage-gated ion channel (VGIC) fold that interacts with PKD2 to form the domain-swapped, yet noncanonical, transient receptor potential (TRP) channel architecture. The S6 helix in PKD1 is broken in the middle, with the extracellular half, S6a, resembling pore helix 1 in a typical TRP channel. Three positively charged, cavity-facing residues on S6b may block <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cation</span></strong> permeation. In addition to the VGIC, a five–transmembrane helix domain and a cytosolic PLAT domain were resolved in PKD1. The PKD1-PKD2 complex structure establishes a framework for dissecting the function and disease mechanisms of the PKD proteins.</p>

Observation of alkaline earth complexes M(CO)<sub>8</sub> (M = Ca, Sr, or Ba) that mimic transition metals

High-affinity adsorption leads to molecularly ordered interfaces on TiO<sub>2</sub> in air and solution
<p>Researchers around the world have observed the formation of molecularly ordered structures of unknown origin on the surface of titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) photocatalysts exposed to air and solution. Using a combination of atomic-scale microscopy and spectroscopy, we show that TiO<sub>2</sub> selectively adsorbs atmospheric carboxylic acids that are typically present in parts-per-billion concentrations while effectively repelling other adsorbates, such as alcohols, that are present in much higher concentrations. The high affinity of the surface for carboxylic acids is attributed to their bidentate binding. These self-assembled monolayers have the unusual property of being both hydrophobic and highly water-soluble, which may contribute to the self-cleaning properties of TiO<sub>2</sub>. This finding is relevant to TiO<sub>2</sub> photocatalysis, because the self-assembled carboxylate monolayers block the undercoordinated surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cation</span></strong> sites typically implicated in photocatalysis.</p>

Electrofluorochromism at the single-molecule level

Light-induced lattice expansion leads to high-efficiency perovskite solar cells
<p>Light-induced structural dynamics plays a vital role in the physical properties, device performance, and stability of hybrid perovskite–based optoelectronic devices. We report that continuous light illumination leads to a uniform lattice expansion in hybrid perovskite thin films, which is critical for obtaining high-efficiency photovoltaic devices. Correlated, in situ structural and device characterizations reveal that light-induced lattice expansion benefits the performances of a mixed-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cation</span></strong> pure-halide planar device, boosting the power conversion efficiency from 18.5 to 20.5%. The lattice expansion leads to the relaxation of local lattice strain, which lowers the energetic barriers at the perovskite-contact interfaces, thus improving the open circuit voltage and fill factor. The light-induced lattice expansion did not compromise the stability of these high-efficiency photovoltaic devices under continuous operation at full-spectrum 1-sun (100 milliwatts per square centimeter) illumination for more than 1500 hours.</p>

Structure of the cold- and menthol-sensing ion channel TRPM8
<p>Transient receptor potential melastatin (TRPM) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cation</span></strong> channels are polymodal sensors that are involved in a variety of physiological processes. Within the TRPM family, member 8 (TRPM8) is the primary cold and menthol sensor in humans. We determined the cryo–electron microscopy structure of the full-length TRPM8 from the collared flycatcher at an overall resolution of ~4.1 ångstroms. Our TRPM8 structure reveals a three-layered architecture. The amino-terminal domain with a fold distinct among known TRP structures, together with the carboxyl-terminal region, forms a large two-layered cytosolic ring that extensively interacts with the transmembrane channel layer. The structure suggests that the menthol-binding site is located within the voltage-sensor–like domain and thus provides a structural glimpse of the design principle of the molecular transducer for cold and menthol sensation.</p>

Lewis acid enhancement by hydrogen-bond donors for asymmetric catalysis
<p>Small-molecule dual hydrogen-bond (H-bond) donors such as ureas, thioureas, squaramides, and guanidinium ions enjoy widespread use as effective catalysts for promoting a variety of enantioselective reactions. However, these catalysts are only weakly acidic and therefore require highly reactive electrophilic substrates to be effective. We introduce here a mode of catalytic activity with chiral H-bond donors that enables enantioselective reactions of relatively unreactive electrophiles. Squaramides are shown to interact with silyl triflates by binding the triflate counterion to form a stable, yet highly Lewis acidic, complex. The silyl triflate-chiral squaramide combination promotes the generation of oxocarbenium intermediates from acetal substrates at low temperatures. Enantioselectivity in nucleophile additions to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cation</span></strong>ic intermediates is then controlled through a network of noncovalent interactions between the squaramide catalyst and the oxocarbenium triflate.</p>

Size effect in ion transport through angstrom-scale slits
<p>In the field of nanofluidics, it has been an ultimate but seemingly distant goal to controllably fabricate capillaries with dimensions approaching the size of small ions and water molecules. We report ion transport through ultimately narrow slits that are fabricated by effectively removing a single atomic plane from a bulk crystal. The atomically flat angstrom-scale slits exhibit little surface charge, allowing elucidation of the role of steric effects. We find that ions with hydrated diameters larger than the slit size can still permeate through, albeit with reduced mobility. The confinement also leads to a notable asymmetry between anions and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cation</span></strong>s of the same diameter. Our results provide a platform for studying the effects of angstrom-scale confinement, which is important for the development of nanofluidics, molecular separation, and other nanoscale technologies.</p>

Electric fields from the environment and stochastic hydrogen bond motions induce fluctuations of the proton double-minimum potential. Within the lifetime of a particular hydration geometry, the proton explores a multitude of positions on a sub-100-femtosecond time scale. The proton transfer vibration is strongly damped by its 20- to 40-femtosecond population decay.

Catalytic intermolecular hydroaminations of unactivated olefins with secondary alkyl amines

In this process, carbon-nitrogen bond formation proceeds through a key aminium radical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cation</span></strong> intermediate that is generated via electron transfer between an excited-state iridium photocatalyst and an amine substrate. These reactions are redox-neutral and completely atom-economical, exhibit broad functional group tolerance, and occur readily at room temperature under visible light irradiation.

Metal Tolerance Protein 8 Mediates Manganese Homeostasis and Iron Reallocation during Seed Development and Germination
<p>Metal accumulation in seeds is a prerequisite for germination and establishment of plants but also for micronutrient delivery to humans. To investigate metal transport processes and their interactions in seeds, we focused on METAL TOLERANCE PROTEIN8 (MTP8), a tonoplast transporter of the manganese (Mn) subclade of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cation</span></strong> diffusion facilitators, which in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) is expressed in embryos of seeds. The x-ray fluorescence imaging showed that expression of MTP8 was responsible for Mn localization in subepidermal cells on the abaxial side of the cotyledons and in cortical cells of the hypocotyl. Accordingly, under low Mn availability, MTP8 increased seed stores of Mn, required for efficient seed germination. In mutant embryos lacking expression of <i>VACUOLAR IRON TRANSPORTER1</i> (<i>VIT1</i>), MTP8 built up iron (Fe) hotspots in <i>MTP8</i>-expressing cells types, suggesting that MTP8 transports Fe in addition to Mn. In <i>mtp8 vit1</i> double mutant seeds, Mn and Fe were distributed in all cell types of the embryo. An Fe transport function of MTP8 was confirmed by its ability to complement Fe hypersensitivity of a yeast mutant defective in vacuolar Fe transport. Imbibing <i>mtp8-1</i> mutant seeds in the presence of Mn or subjecting seeds to wet-dry cycles showed that MTP8 conferred Mn tolerance. During germination, MTP8 promoted reallo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cation</span></strong> of Fe from the vasculature. These results indicate that cell type-specific accumulation of Mn and Fe in seeds depends on MTP8 and that this transporter plays an important role in the generation of seed metal stores as well as for metal homeostasis and germination efficiency under challenging environmental conditions.</p>

CNGC2 Is a Ca<sup>2+</sup> Influx Channel That Prevents Accumulation of Apoplastic Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the Leaf
<p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> is absorbed by roots and transported upward through the xylem to the apoplastic space of the leaf, after which it is deposited into the leaf cell. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the tonoplast-localized Ca<sup>2+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> transporters CATION EXCHANGER1 (CAX1) and CAX3 sequester Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the cytosol into the vacuole, but it is not known what transporter mediates the initial Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx from the apoplast to the cytosol. Here, we report that Arabidopsis <i>CYCLIC NUCLEOTIDE-GATED CHANNEL2</i> (<i>CNGC2</i>) encodes a protein with Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx channel activity and is expressed in the leaf areas surrounding the free endings of minor veins, which is the primary site for Ca<sup>2+</sup> unloading from the vasculature and influx into leaf cells. Under hydroponic growth conditions, with 0.1 m<sc>m</sc> Ca<sup>2+</sup>, both Arabidopsis <i>cngc2</i> and <i>cax1cax3</i> loss-of-function mutants grew normally. Increasing the Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration to 10 m<sc>m</sc> induced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation, cell death, and leaf senescence and partially suppressed the hypersensitive response to avirulent pathogens in the mutants but not in the wild type.

Our results indicate that CNGC2 likely has no direct roles in leaf development or the hypersensitive response but, instead, that CNGC2 could mediate Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into leaf cells. Finally, the in vivo extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging method developed in this study provides a new tool for investigating Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in plant cells.</p>

Network-Guided GWAS Improves Identification of Genes Affecting Free Amino Acids
<p>Amino acids are essential for proper growth and development in plants. Amino acids serve as building blocks for proteins but also are important for responses to stress and the biosynthesis of numerous essential compounds. In seed, the pool of free amino acids (FAAs) also contributes to alternative energy, desic<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cation</span></strong>, and seed vigor; thus, manipulating FAA levels can significantly impact a seed’s nutritional qualities. While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on branched-chain amino acids have identified some regulatory genes controlling seed FAAs, the genetic regulation of FAA levels, composition, and homeostasis in seeds remains mostly unresolved. Hence, we performed GWAS on 18 FAAs from a 313-ecotype Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) association panel. Specifically, GWAS was performed on 98 traits derived from known amino acid metabolic pathways (approach 1) and then on 92 traits generated from an unbiased correlation-based metabolic network analysis (approach 2), and the results were compared. The latter approach facilitated the discovery of additional novel metabolic interactions and single-nucleotide polymorphism-trait associations not identified by the former approach. The most prominent network-guided GWAS signal was for a histidine (His)-related trait in a region containing two genes: a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cation</span></strong>ic amino acid transporter (CAT4) and a polynucleotide phosphorylase resistant to inhibition with fosmidomycin. A reverse genetics approach confirmed CAT4 to be responsible for the natural variation of His-related traits across the association panel. Given that His is a semiessential amino acid and a potent metal chelator, CAT4 orthologs could be considered as candidate genes for seed quality biofortifi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cation</span></strong> in crop plants.</p>

The α-Terpineol to 1,8-Cineole Cyclization Reaction of Tobacco Terpene Synthases
<p>Flowers of <i>Nicotiana</i> species emit a characteristic blend including the cineole cassette monoterpenes. This set of terpenes is synthesized by multiproduct enzymes, with either 1,8-cineole or α-terpineol contributing most to the volatile spectrum, thus referring to cineole or terpineol synthase, respectively. To understand the molecular and structural requirements of the enzymes that favor the biochemical formation of α-terpineol and 1,8-cineole, site-directed mutagenesis, in silico modeling, and semiempiric calculations were performed. Our results indicate the formation of α-terpineol by a nucleophilic attack of water. During this attack, the α-terpinyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cation</span></strong> is stabilized by π-stacking with a tryptophan side chain (tryptophan-253). The hypothesized catalytic mechanism of α-terpineol-to-1,8-cineole conversion is initiated by a catalytic dyad (histidine-502 and glutamate-249), acting as a base, and a threonine (threonine-278) providing the subsequent rearrangement from terpineol to cineol by catalyzing the autoprotonation of (<i>S</i>)-(−)-α-terpineol, which is the favored enantiomer product of the recombinant enzymes. Furthermore, by site-directed mutagenesis, we were able to identify amino acids at positions 147, 148, and 266 that determine the different terpineol-cineole ratios in <i>Nicotiana</i> <i>suaveolens</i> cineole synthase and <i>Nicotiana</i> <i>langsdorffii</i> terpineol synthase. Since amino acid 266 is more than 10 ÅÅ away from the active site, an indirect effect of this amino acid exchange on the catalysis is discussed.</p>

Cell-Type-Specific H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase Activity in Root Tissues Enables K<sup>+</sup> Retention and Mediates Acclimation of Barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) to Salinity Stress
<p>While the importance of cell type specificity in plant adaptive responses is widely accepted, only a limited number of studies have addressed this issue at the functional level. We have combined electrophysiological, imaging, and biochemical techniques to reveal the physiological mechanisms conferring higher sensitivity of apical root cells to salinity in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>). We show that salinity appli<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cation</span></strong> to the root apex arrests root growth in a highly tissue- and treatment-specific manner. Although salinity-induced transient net Na<sup>+</sup> uptake was about 4-fold higher in the root apex compared with the mature zone, mature root cells accumulated more cytosolic and vacuolar Na<sup>+</sup>, suggesting that the higher sensitivity of apical cells to salt is not related to either enhanced Na<sup>+</sup> exclusion or sequestration inside the root. Rather, the above differential sensitivity between the two zones originates from a 10-fold difference in K<sup>+</sup> efflux between the mature zone and the apical region (much poorer in the root apex) of the root. Major factors contributing to this poor K<sup>+</sup> retention ability are (1) an intrinsically lower H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity in the root apex, (2) greater salt-induced membrane depolarization, and (3) a higher reactive oxygen species production under NaCl and a larger density of reactive oxygen species-activated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cation</span></strong> currents in the apex. Salinity treatment increased (2- to 5-fold) the content of 10 (out of 25 detected) amino acids in the root apex but not in the mature zone and changed the organic acid and sugar contents. The causal link between the observed changes in the root metabolic profile and the regulation of transporter activity is discussed.</p>

<i>claudin-10</i> isoform expression and cation selectivity change with salinity in salt-secreting epithelia of <i>Fundulus</i> <i>heteroclitus</i>
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Claudin-10 protein isoforms, which form putative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cation</span></strong> pores, change gene expression with salinity acclimation and alter ion selectivity of the paracellular pathway in salt-secreting epithelia of euryhaline mummichogs (<i>Fundulus heteroclitus</i>).</p>

Endocrine regulation of carbonate precipitate formation in marine fish intestine by stanniocalcin and PTHrP
<p>In marine fish, high epithelial bicarbonate secretion by the intestine generates luminal carbonate precipitates of divalent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cation</span></strong>s that play a key role in water and ion homeostasis. <i>In vitro</i> studies highlight the involvement of the calciotropic hormones PTHrP (parathyroid hormone-related protein) and stanniocalcin (STC) in the regulation of epithelial bicarbonate transport. The present study tested the hypothesis that calciotropic hormones have a regulatory role in carbonate precipitate formation <i>in vivo</i>. Sea bream (<i>Sparus aurata</i>) juveniles received single intraperitoneal injections of piscine PTHrP(1–34), the PTH/PTHrP receptor antagonist PTHrP(7–34) or purified sea bream STC, or were passively immunized with polyclonal rabbit antisera raised against sea bream STC (STC-Ab). Endocrine effects on the expression of the basolateral sodium bicarbonate co-transporter (Slc4a4.A), the apical anion exchangers Slc26a6.A and Slc26a3.B, and the V-type proton pump β-subunit (Atp6v1b) in the anterior intestine were evaluated. In keeping with their calciotropic nature, the hypocalcaemic factors PTHrP(7–34) and STC up-regulated gene expression of all transporters. In contrast, the hypercalcaemic factor PTHrP(1–34) and STC antibodies down-regulated transporters involved in the bicarbonate secretion cascade. Changes in intestine luminal precipitate contents provoked by calcaemic endocrine factors validated these results: 24 h post-injection either PTHrP(1–34) or immunization with STC-Ab reduced the carbonate precipitate content in the sea bream intestine. In contrast, the PTH/PTHrP receptor antagonist PTHrP(7–34) increased not only the precipitated fraction but also the concentration of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> equivalents in the intestinal fluid. These results confirm the hypothesis that calciotropic hormones have a regulatory role in carbonate precipitate formation <i>in vivo</i> in the intestine of marine fish. Furthermore, they illustrate for the first time in fish the counteracting effect of PTHrP and STC, and reveal an unexpected contribution of calcaemic factors to acid–base balance.</p>

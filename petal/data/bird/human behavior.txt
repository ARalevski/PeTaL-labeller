Analysis of shared heritability in common disorders of the brain
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ers of the brain can exhibit considerable epidemiological comorbidity and often share symptoms, provoking debate about their etiologic overlap. We quantified the genetic sharing of 25 brain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ers from genome-wide association studies of 265,218 patients and 784,643 control participants and assessed their relationship to 17 phenotypes from 1,191,588 individuals. Psychiatric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ers share common variant risk, whereas neurological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ers appear more distinct from one another and from the psychiatric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ers. We also identified significant sharing between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ers and a number of brain phenotypes, including cognitive measures. Further, we conducted simulations to explore how statistical power, diagnostic misclassification, and phenotypic heterogeneity affect genetic correlations. These results highlight the importance of common genetic variation as a risk factor for brain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ers and the value of heritability-based methods in understanding their etiology.</p>

Predator-driven natural selection on risk-taking behavior in anole lizards
<p>Biologists have long debated the role of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> in evolution, yet understanding of its role as a driver of adaptation is hampered by the scarcity of experimental studies of natural selection on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> in nature. After showing that individual <i>Anolis sagrei</i> lizards vary consistently in risk-taking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>s, we experimentally established populations on eight small islands either with or without <i>Leiocephalus carinatus</i>, a major ground predator. We found that selection predictably favors different risk-taking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>s under different treatments: Exploratory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> is favored in the absence of predators, whereas avoidance of the ground is favored in their presence. On predator islands, selection on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> is stronger than selection on morphology, whereas the opposite holds on islands without predators. Our field experiment demonstrates that selection can shape <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>al traits, paving the way toward adaptation to varying environmental contexts.</p>

Disorder-induced optical transition from spin Hall to random Rashba effect
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ered structures give rise to intriguing phenomena owing to the complex nature of their interaction with light. We report on photonic spin-symmetry breaking and unexpected spin-optical transport phenomena arising from subwavelength-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ered geometric phase structure. Weak <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>er induces a photonic spin Hall effect, observed via quantum weak measurements, whereas strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>er leads to spin-split modes in momentum space, a random optical Rashba effect. Study of the momentum space entropy reveals an optical transition upon reaching a critical point where the structure’s anisotropy axis vanishes. Incorporation of singular topology into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ered structure demonstrates repulsive vortex interaction depending on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>er strength. The photonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ered geometric phase can serve as a platform for the study of different phenomena emerging from complex media involving spin-orbit coupling.</p>

Parsing reward from aversion
<p>Starting from the moment we hear our alarms in the morning, our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emot</span></strong>ions guide the thousands of decisions we make every day. More specifically, it is the valence of our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emot</span></strong>ions that determines our subsequent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>. Valence is a concept that was originally defined in psychology and corresponds to the value we assign to the perceptions of our external and internal environments (<i>1</i>). Valence varies from negative, when we are afraid or anxious, to positive, when we are happy or peaceful. In the case of the morning alarm, if your <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emot</span></strong>ional state has a positive valence you might jump out of bed, eager to engage with whatever is motivating you. Conversely, if your <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emot</span></strong>ional state has a negative valence, you might choose to stay in bed to Avoid the causes of your negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emot</span></strong>ions.</p>

Unexpected rewards induce dopamine-dependent positive emotion–like state changes in bumblebees
<p>Whether invertebrates exhibit positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emot</span></strong>ion–like states and what mechanisms underlie such states remain poorly understood. We demonstrate that bumblebees exhibit dopamine-dependent positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emot</span></strong>ion–like states across <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>al contexts. After training with one rewarding and one unrewarding cue, bees that received pretest sucrose responded in a positive manner toward ambiguous cues. In a second experiment, pretest consumption of sucrose solution resulted in a shorter time to reinitiate foraging after a simulated predator attack. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>al changes were abolished with topical application of the dopamine antagonist fluphenazine. Further experiments established that pretest sucrose does not simply cause bees to become more exploratory. Our findings present a new opportunity for understanding the fundamental neural elements of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emot</span></strong>ions and may alter the view of how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emot</span></strong>ion states affect decision-making in animals.</p>

Intra- and interspecific challenges modulate cortisol but not androgen levels in a year-round territorial damselfish
<p>Interactions between individuals of different species are commonplace in animal communities. Some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>s displayed during these interspecific social interactions may be very similar to those displayed during intraspecific social interactions. However, whether functional analogies between intra- and interspecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>s translate at the proximate level into an overlap in their underlying endocrine mechanisms remains largely unknown. Because steroids both mediate social <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>s and respond to them, we approached this question by comparing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>al and steroid response of free-living dusky gregories (<i>Stegastes nigricans</i>) to standardized territorial intrusions (sTI) of either conspecific or heterospecific food competitors. <i>Stegastes nigricans</i> is a year-round territorial fish that ‘cultivates’ the algae on which it feeds and is highly aggressive to both intra- and interspecific intruders. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>al differences between intra- and interspecific aggressive responses to sTI were marginal, and sTI tests caused an increase in cortisol levels that was positively related with the levels of aggression. In contrast, androgen levels did not increase in response to sTI, yet they showed a positive relationship with agonistic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>. These results parallel a pattern that was first described for year-round territorial bird species. Furthermore, they suggest that changes in endocrine-hormone levels during territoriality might be independent of the species that induces the territorial response.</p>

A role for corticotropin-releasing factor signaling in the lateral habenula and its modulation by early-life stress
<p>Centrally released corticotropin-releasing factor or hormone (extrahypothalamic CRF or CRH) in the brain is involved in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>al and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emot</span></strong>ional responses to stress. The lateral habenula (LHb) is an epithalamic brain region involved in value-based decision-making and stress evasion. Through its inhibition of dopamine-mediated reward circuitry, the increased activity of the LHb is associated with addiction, depression, schizophrenia, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ers. We found that extrahypothalamic CRF neurotransmission increased neuronal excitability in the LHb. Through its receptor CRFR1 and subsequently protein kinase A (PKA), CRF application increased the intrinsic excitability of LHb neurons by affecting changes in small-conductance SK-type and large-conductance BK-type K<sup>+</sup> channels. CRF also reduced inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid–containing (GABAergic) synaptic transmission onto LHb neurons through endocannabinoid-mediated retrograde signaling. Maternal deprivation is a severe early-life stress that alters CRF neural circuitry and is likewise associated with abnormal mental health later in life. LHb neurons from pups deprived of maternal care exhibited increased intrinsic excitability, reduced GABAergic transmission, decreased abundance of SK2 channel protein, and increased activity of PKA, without any substantial changes in <i>Crh</i> or <i>Crhr1</i> expression. Furthermore, maternal deprivation blunted the response of LHb neurons to subsequent, acute CRF exposure. Activating SK channels or inhibiting postsynaptic PKA activity prevented the effects of both CRF and maternal deprivation on LHb intrinsic excitability, thus identifying potential pharmacological targets to reverse central CRF circuit dysregulation in patients with associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ers.</p>

Sustained rescue of prefrontal circuit dysfunction by antidepressant-induced spine formation
<p>The neurobiological mechanisms underlying the induction and remission of depressive episodes over time are not well understood.

Depression-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> was associated with targeted, branch-specific elimination of postsynaptic dendritic spines on prefrontal projection neurons. Antidepressant-dose ketamine reversed these effects by selectively rescuing eliminated spines and restoring coordinated activity in multicellular ensembles that predict motivated escape <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>. Prefrontal spinogenesis was required for the long-term maintenance of antidepressant effects on motivated escape <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> but not for their initial induction.</p>

Facing your fears

However, treating no-longer-threatening situations as dangerous may be maladaptive and lead to anxiety <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ers, including phobias and posttraumatic stress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>er. Central to many forms of therapy designed to tackle these anxiety <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ers is the idea that to overcome fear, one needs to face it. For instance, cognitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>al therapy and exposure therapy allow patients to confront the objects or situations that provoke their anxiety in the controlled environment of the therapist's office. With repeated exposures, the patients' anxiety levels gradually decline, and the objects or situations that they once feared no longer trouble them.

Breathing to inspire and arouse
<p>Breathing is one of the perpetual rhythms of life that is often taken for granted, its apparent simplicity belying the complex neural machinery involved.

In addition, cognition can strongly influence breathing. Conscious breathing during yoga, meditation, or psychotherapy can modulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emot</span></strong>ion, arousal state, or stress (<i>3</i>). Therefore, understanding the links between breathing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>, brain arousal state, and higher-order brain activity is of great interest. On page 1411 of this issue, Yackle <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) identify an apparently specialized, molecularly identifiable, small subset of ∼350 neurons in the mouse brain that forms a circuit for transmitting information about respiratory activity to other central nervous system neurons, specifically with a group of noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) in the brainstem, that influences arousal state (see the figure). This finding provides new insight into how the motor act of breathing can influence higher-order brain functions.</p>

Neurohormonal changes associated with ritualized combat and the formation of a reproductive hierarchy in the ant <i>Harpegnathos saltator</i>
<p>Dominance rank in animal societies is correlated with changes in both reproductive physiology and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>. In some social insects, dominance status is used to determine a reproductive division of labor, where a few colony members reproduce while most remain functionally sterile. Changes in reproduction and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> in this context must be coordinated through crosstalk between the brain and the reproductive system. We investigated a role for biogenic amines in forming this connection in the ant <i>Harpegnathos saltator</i>. In this species, workers engage in an elaborate dominance tournament to establish a group of reproductive workers termed gamergates. We analyzed biogenic amine content in the brains of gamergates, inside-workers and foragers under stable colony conditions and found that gamergates had the highest levels of dopamine. Dopamine levels were also positively correlated with increased ovarian activity among gamergates. Next, we experimentally induced workers to compete in a reproductive tournament to determine how dopamine may be involved in the establishment of a new hierarchy. Dopamine levels rose in aggressive workers at the start of a tournament, while workers that were policed by their nestmates (a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> that inhibits ovarian activity) showed a rapid decline in dopamine. In addition to dopamine, levels of serotonin and tyramine differed among castes, and these changes could contribute to differences in caste-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>al patterns observed among non-reproductive workers. Overall, these results provide support that biogenic amines link changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> and dominance with reproductive activity in <i>H. saltator</i> as well as drive differences in worker task performance.</p>

RasGRP1 promotes amphetamine-induced motor behavior through a Rhes interaction network (“Rhesactome”) in the striatum
<p>The striatum of the brain coordinates motor function. Dopamine-related drugs may be therapeutic to patients with striatal neurodegeneration, such as Huntington’s disease (HD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD), but these drugs have unwanted side effects. In addition to stimulating the release of norepinephrine, amphetamines, which are used for narcolepsy and attention-deficit/hyperactivity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>er (ADHD), trigger dopamine release in the striatum. The guanosine triphosphatase Ras homolog enriched in the striatum (Rhes) inhibits dopaminergic signaling in the striatum, is implicated in HD and L-dopa–induced dyskinesia, and has a role in striatal motor control. We found that the guanine nucleotide exchange factor RasGRP1 inhibited Rhes-mediated control of striatal motor activity in mice. RasGRP1 stabilized Rhes, increasing its synaptic accumulation in the striatum. Whereas partially Rhes-deficient (<i>Rhes</i><sup><i>+/−</i></sup>) mice had an enhanced locomotor response to amphetamine, this phenotype was attenuated by coincident depletion of RasGRP1. By proteomic analysis of striatal lysates from <i>Rhes</i>-heterozygous mice with wild-type or partial or complete knockout of <i>Rasgrp1</i>, we identified a diverse set of Rhes-interacting proteins, the “Rhesactome,” and determined that RasGRP1 affected the composition of the amphetamine-induced Rhesactome, which included PDE2A (phosphodiesterase 2A; a protein associated with major depressive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>er), LRRC7 (leucine-rich repeat–containing 7; a protein associated with bipolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>er and ADHD), and DLG2 (discs large homolog 2; a protein associated with chronic pain). Thus, this Rhes network provides insight into striatal effects of amphetamine and may aid the development of strategies to treat various neurological and psychological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ers associated with the striatal dysfunction.</p>

Learning-dependent chromatin remodeling highlights noncoding regulatory regions linked to autism
<p>Autism spectrum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>er (ASD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>er that is associated with genetic risk factors. Most human disease-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are not located in genes but rather are in regulatory regions that control gene expression. The function of regulatory regions is determined through epigenetic mechanisms. Parallels between the cellular basis of development and the formation of long-term memory have long been recognized, particularly the role of epigenetic mechanisms in both processes. We analyzed how learning alters chromatin accessibility in the mouse hippocampus using a new high-throughput sequencing bioinformatics strategy we call DEScan (differential enrichment scan). DEScan, which enabled the analysis of data from epigenomic experiments containing multiple replicates, revealed changes in chromatin accessibility at 2365 regulatory regions—most of which were promoters. Learning-regulated promoters were active during forebrain development in mice and were enriched in epigenetic modifications indicative of bivalent promoters. These promoters were disproportionally intronic, showed a complex relationship with gene expression and alternative splicing during memory consolidation and retrieval, and were enriched in the data set relative to known ASD risk genes. Genotyping in a clinical cohort within one of these promoters (<i>SHANK3</i> promoter 6) revealed that the SNP rs6010065 was associated with ASD. Our data support the idea that learning recapitulates development at the epigenetic level and demonstrate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>ally induced epigenetic changes in mice can highlight regulatory regions relevant to brain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ers in patients.</p>

Motor cortical control of vocal interaction in neotropical singing mice
<p>Like many adaptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>s, acoustic communication often requires rapid modification of motor output in response to sensory cues.

We find that males modify singing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> during social interactions on a subsecond time course that resembles both traditional sensorimotor tasks and conversational speech. We identify an orofacial motor cortical region and, via a series of perturbation experiments, demonstrate a hierarchical control of vocal production, with the motor cortex influencing the pacing of singing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> on a moment-by-moment basis, enabling precise vocal interactions.

Intense threat switches dorsal raphe serotonin neurons to a paradoxical operational mode
<p>Survival depends on the selection of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>s adaptive for the current environment. For example, a mouse should run from a rapidly looming hawk but should freeze if the hawk is coasting across the sky. Although serotonin has been implicated in adaptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>, environmental regulation of its functional role remains poorly understood. In mice, we found that stimulation of dorsal raphe serotonin neurons suppressed movement in low- and moderate-threat environments but induced escape <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> in high-threat environments, and that movement-related dorsal raphe serotonin neural dynamics inverted in high-threat environments. Stimulation of dorsal raphe γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons promoted movement in negative but not positive environments, and movement-related GABA neural dynamics inverted between positive and negative environments. Thus, dorsal raphe circuits switch between distinct operational modes to promote environment-specific adaptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>s.</p>

Cerebellar modulation of the reward circuitry and social behavior

Optogenetic activation of the cerebello-VTA projections was rewarding and, in a three-chamber social task, these projections were more active when the animal explored the social chamber.

The cerebellum gets social

Cell-autonomous clock of astrocytes drives circadian behavior in mammals

The median STF is scalable between events with different sizes, grows linearly, and is nearly triangular. The deviations from the median <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> are multiplicative and Gaussian—that is, they are proportionally larger for larger events. Our observations suggest that earthquake magnitudes cannot be predicted from the characteristics of rupture onsets.</p>

Observation of Anderson localization in disordered nanophotonic structures
<p>Anderson localization is an interference effect crucial to the understanding of waves in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ered media. However, localization is expected to become negligible when the features of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ered structure are much smaller than the wavelength. Here we experimentally demonstrate the localization of light in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ered dielectric multilayer with an average layer thickness of 15 nanometers, deep into the subwavelength regime. We observe strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>er-induced reflections that show that the interplay of localization and evanescence can lead to a substantial decrease in transmission, or the opposite feature of enhanced transmission. This deep-subwavelength Anderson localization exhibits extreme sensitivity: Varying the thickness of a single layer by 2 nanometers changes the reflection appreciably. This sensitivity, approaching the atomic scale, holds the promise of extreme subwavelength sensing.</p>

Coupling between distant biofilms and emergence of nutrient time-sharing
<p>Bacteria within communities can interact to organize their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>. It has been unclear whether such interactions can extend beyond a single community to coordinate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> of distant populations. We discovered that two <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> biofilm communities undergoing metabolic oscillations can become coupled through electrical signaling and synchronize their growth dynamics. Coupling increases competition by also synchronizing demand for limited nutrients. As predicted by mathematical modeling, we confirm that biofilms resolve this conflict by switching from in-phase to antiphase oscillations. This results in time-sharing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>, where each community takes turns consuming nutrients. Time-sharing enables biofilms to counterintuitively increase growth under reduced nutrient supply. Distant biofilms can thus coordinate their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> to resolve nutrient competition through time-sharing, a strategy used in engineered systems to allocate limited resources.</p>

Breathing control center neurons that promote arousal in mice
<p>Slow, controlled breathing has been used for centuries to promote mental calming, and it is used clinically to suppress excessive arousal such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">panic</span></strong> attacks. However, the physiological and neural basis of the relationship between breathing and higher-order brain activity is unknown. We found a neuronal subpopulation in the mouse preBotzinger complex (preBotC), the primary breathing rhythm generator, which regulates the balance between calm and arousal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>s. Conditional, bilateral genetic ablation of the ~175 <i>Cdh9</i>/<i>Dbx1</i> double-positive preBotC neurons in adult mice left breathing intact but increased calm <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>s and decreased time in aroused states.

Molecular and neural basis of contagious itch behavior in mice
<p>Socially contagious itch is ubiquitous in human society, but whether it exists in rodents is unclear. Using a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>al paradigm that does not entail prior training or reward, we found that mice scratched after observing a conspecific scratching. Molecular mapping showed increased neuronal activity in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus of mice that displayed contagious scratching. Ablation of gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) or GRPR neurons in the SCN abolished contagious scratching <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>, which was recapitulated by chemogenetic inhibition of SCN GRP neurons. Activation of SCN GRP/GRPR neurons evoked scratching <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>. These data demonstrate that GRP-GRPR signaling is necessary and sufficient for transmitting contagious itch information in the SCN. The findings may have implications for our understanding of neural circuits that control socially contagious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>s.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Shoot Removal Induces Chloroplast Development in Roots via Cytokinin Signaling
<p>The development of plant chloroplasts is regulated by various developmental, environmental, and hormonal cues. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), chloroplast development is repressed in roots via auxin signaling. However, roots develop chloroplasts when they are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detach</span></strong>ed from the shoot. In contrast to auxin, cytokinin positively affects chloroplast development in roots, but the role and signaling pathway of cytokinin in the root greening response remain unclear. To understand the regulatory pathways of chloroplast development in the plant stress response, we examined the mechanisms underlying the conditional greening of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detach</span></strong>ed roots. In wild-type Arabidopsis roots, shoot removal activates type B ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR (ARR)-mediated cytokinin signaling and induces chlorophyll accumulation and photosynthetic remodeling. ARR1 and ARR12 are essential for up-regulating nucleus- and plastid-encoded genes associated with chloroplast development in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detach</span></strong>ed roots. In this process, WOUND INDUCED DEDIFFERENTIATION1 and class B GATA transcription factors (B-GATAs) act upstream and downstream of ARRs, respectively. Overexpression of B-GATAs promotes root greening, as does shoot removal, dependent on a light signaling transcription factor, LONG HYPOCOTYL5. Auxin represses the root greening response independent of ARR signaling. <i>GNC-LIKE</i> (<i>GNL</i>), a B-GATA, is strongly up-regulated in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detach</span></strong>ed roots via ARR1 and ARR12 but is repressed by auxin, so <i>GNL</i> may function at the point of convergence of cytokinin and auxin signaling in the root greening response.</p>

Multiplex quantitative assays indicate a need for reevaluating reported small-molecule TrkB agonists
<p>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor, tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB), have emerged as key regulators of brain plasticity and represent disease-modifying targets for several brain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ers, including Alzheimer’s disease and major depressive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>er. Because of poor pharmacokinetic properties of BDNF, the interest in small-molecule TrkB agonists and modulators is high. Several compounds have been reported to act as TrkB agonists, and their increasing use in various nervous system <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>er models creates the perception that these are reliable probes. To examine key pharmacological parameters of these compounds in detail, we have developed and optimized a series of complementary quantitative assays that measure TrkB receptor activation, TrkB-dependent downstream signaling, and gene expression in different cellular contexts. Although BDNF and other neurotrophic factors elicited robust and dose-dependent receptor activation and downstream signaling, we were unable to reproduce these activities using the reported small-molecule TrkB agonists. Our findings indicate that experimental results obtained with these compounds must be carefully interpreted and highlight the challenge of developing reliable pharmacological activators of this key molecular target.</p>

Probing entanglement in a many-body–localized system
<p>An interacting quantum system that is subject to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>er may cease to thermalize owing to localization of its constituents, thereby marking the breakdown of thermodynamics. The key to understanding this phenomenon lies in the system’s entanglement, which is experimentally challenging to measure. We realize such a many-body–localized system in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ered Bose-Hubbard chain and characterize its entanglement properties through particle fluctuations and correlations. We observe that the particles become localized, suppressing transport and preventing the thermalization of subsystems. Notably, we measure the development of nonlocal correlations, whose evolution is consistent with a logarithmic growth of entanglement entropy, the hallmark of many-body localization. Our work experimentally establishes many-body localization as a qualitatively distinct phenomenon from localization in noninteracting, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ered systems.</p>

Many paths to preserve the body clock
<p>Robust daily oscillations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>, physiology, and biochemistry are driven by endogenous timekeeping machinery called the circadian clocks. Circadian clocks in mammals were originally considered properties of the nervous system, and the anatomical locus of this clock was determined to be the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus. The neurons that make up this structure are highly interconnected (coupled) and exhibit robust and coordinated rhythms of activity, and loss of rhythmicity results in loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>al rhythms such as daily activity. On page 187 of this issue, Brancaccio <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) reveal that SCNs that have been rendered “clockless” through genetic perturbation in mice can be restored to rhythmicity by rescuing the clocks in only the astrocytes, a type of glial cell. The idea that rhythmic astrocytes are sufficient to generate a functional circadian clock that can control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>al rhythms is surprising and suggests that the SCN can produce rhythms by means of more than one mechanism.</p>

Transcriptome-wide isoform-level dysregulation in ASD, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder
<p>Most genetic risk for psychiatric disease lies in regulatory regions, implicating pathogenic dysregulation of gene expression and splicing.

In this work, we integrated genotypes and RNA sequencing in brain samples from 1695 individuals with autism spectrum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>er (ASD), schizophrenia, and bipolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>er, as well as controls. More than 25% of the transcriptome exhibits differential splicing or expression, with isoform-level changes capturing the largest disease effects and genetic enrichments. Coexpression networks isolate disease-specific neuronal alterations, as well as microglial, astrocyte, and interferon-response modules defining previously unidentified neural-immune mechanisms. We integrated genetic and genomic data to perform a transcriptome-wide association study, prioritizing disease loci likely mediated by cis effects on brain expression. This transcriptome-wide characterization of the molecular pathology across three major psychiatric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ers provides a comprehensive resource for mechanistic insight and therapeutic development.</p>

Connecting neuronal circuits for movement
<p>Movement is the most common final output of nervous system activity and is essential for survival. But what makes this seemingly trivial statement so scientifically challenging? Neurons that contribute to when and how our body moves are distributed throughout the nervous system. Thus, even a simple movement such as arm flexion requires the coordinated activation of many different neuronal populations across multiple brain regions. A key question is how the nervous system produces diverse and precise actions aligned with the organisms' <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>al needs. These processes are affected in diseases such as Parkinson's or Huntington's, in which aberrant motor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> dominates. Recent studies are transformative in how we think about the control of movement. A common denominator of these studies is that brain regions that contribute to motor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> can no longer be considered as interacting boxes. Instead, deep circuit-level insight based on specific neuronal populations emerges as being critical to revealing motor system organization and understanding its function. It is likely that insights at this level can also help to design more specific and direct interventions for diseases of the motor system and neuroprosthetics applied after injuries.</p>

Topological insulator laser: Theory

These attributes make topological insulator systems ideal candidates for enabling applications in quantum computation and spintronics. We propose a concept that exploits topological effects in a unique way: the topological insulator laser. These are lasers whose lasing mode exhibits topologically protected transport without magnetic fields. The underlying topological properties lead to a highly efficient laser, robust to defects and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>er, with single-mode lasing even at very high gain values. The topological insulator laser alters current understanding of the interplay between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>er and lasing, and at the same time opens exciting possibilities in topological physics, such as topologically protected transport in systems with gain. On the technological side, the topological insulator laser provides a route to arrays of semiconductor lasers that operate as one single-mode high-power laser coupled efficiently into an output port.</p>

Structure-property relationships from universal signatures of plasticity in disordered solids

Experimental results and computations enabled us to measure the spatial correlations and strain response of softness, as well as two measures of plasticity: the size of rearrangements and the yield strain. All four quantities maintained remarkable commonality in their values for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ered packings of objects ranging from atoms to grains, spanning seven orders of magnitude in diameter and 13 orders of magnitude in elastic modulus.

Direct activation of these neurons in the PVN or their terminals in the VTA enhanced prosocial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>s. Conversely, inhibition of PVN OXT axon terminals in the VTA decreased social interactions. OXT increased excitatory drive onto reward-specific VTA dopamine (DA) neurons.

A central neural circuit for itch sensation

However, how itch information is transmitted to the brain and what central circuits underlie the itch-induced scratching <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> remain largely unknown. We found that the spinoparabrachial pathway was activated during itch processing and that optogenetic suppression of this pathway impaired itch-induced scratching <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>s. Itch-mediating spinal neurons, which express the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor, are disynaptically connected to the parabrachial nucleus via glutamatergic spinal projection neurons. Blockade of synaptic output of glutamatergic neurons in the parabrachial nucleus suppressed pruritogen-induced scratching <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>.

Plasticity in the Neurotransmitter Repertoire
<p>In the earliest days of neuroscience, it was thought that a neuron made and released only a single chemical, known as a neurotransmitter, to send a signal across a synapse to an adjacent neuron (<i>1</i>). At the same time, it was deeply mysterious why so many signaling molecules were used in nervous systems. Subsequently, it became clear that many, if not most, neurons (including those in mammals) make and release two or more neurotransmitters including small-molecules and neuropeptides (<i>2</i>–<i>4</i>). As the list of these potential cotransmitters and their receptors has increased, we are faced with understanding the functional relevance of this embarrassment of riches for neural circuits and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>. Neurotransmitters and neuromodulators (substances often released with small-molecule neurotransmitters) can elicit a variety of different actions on their neuron targets, including directly opening ion channels or acting through signal transduction pathways to alter neuronal excitability or synaptic transmission. Thus, characterizing the mixture of cotransmitters released by a neuron is important for understanding how neuronal circuits operate. The mechanisms that change the profile of neurotransmitter release provide opportunities for plastic changes in circuit function, and consequently in organism <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>. On page 449 of this issue, Dulcis <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) report changes in the neurotransmitter profile of neurons that underlie photoperiod-triggered changes in animal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>. The findings argue that neurotransmitter switching is a new mechanism for neuroplasticity (<i>6</i>) in adult nervous systems.</p>

Developmental Programming of Thermonastic Leaf Movement
<p>Plants exhibit diverse polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>s in response to directional and nondirectional environmental signals, termed tropic and nastic movements, respectively. The ways in which plants incorporate directional information into tropic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>s is well understood, but it is less well understood how nondirectional stimuli, such as ambient temperatures, specify the polarity of nastic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>s. Here, we demonstrate that a developmentally programmed polarity of auxin flow underlies thermo-induced leaf hyponasty in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). In warm environments, PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR4 (PIF4) stimulates auxin production in the leaf. This results in the accumulation of auxin in leaf petioles, where PIF4 directly activates a gene encoding the PINOID (PID) protein kinase. PID is involved in polarization of the auxin transporter PIN-FORMED3 to the outer membranes of petiole cells. Notably, the leaf polarity-determining ASYMMETRIC LEAVES1 (AS1) directs the induction of <i>PID</i> to occur predominantly in the abaxial petiole region. These observations indicate that the integration of PIF4-mediated auxin biosynthesis and polar transport, and the AS1-mediated developmental shaping of polar auxin flow, coordinate leaf thermonasty, which facilitates leaf cooling in warm environments. We believe that leaf thermonasty is a suitable model system for studying the developmental programming of environmental adaptation in plants.</p>

Aperture effects in squid jet propulsion
<p>Squid are the largest jet propellers in nature as adults, but as paralarvae they are some of the smallest, faced with the inherent inefficiency of jet propulsion at a low Reynolds number. In this study we describe the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> and kinematics of locomotion in 1 mm paralarvae of <i>Dosidicus gigas</i>, the smallest squid yet studied. They swim with hop-and-sink <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> and can engage in fast jets by reducing the size of the mantle aperture during the contraction phase of a jetting cycle. We go on to explore the general effects of a variable mantle and funnel aperture in a theoretical model of jet propulsion scaled from the smallest (1 mm mantle length) to the largest (3 m) squid. Aperture reduction during mantle contraction increases propulsive efficiency at all squid sizes, although 1 mm squid still suffer from low efficiency (20%) because of a limited speed of contraction. Efficiency increases to a peak of 40% for 1 cm squid, then slowly declines. Squid larger than 6 cm must either reduce contraction speed or increase aperture size to maintain stress within maximal muscle tolerance. Ecological pressure to maintain maximum velocity may lead them to increase aperture size, which reduces efficiency. This effect might be ameliorated by nonaxial flow during the refill phase of the cycle. Our model's predictions highlight areas for future empirical work, and emphasize the existence of complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>al options for maximizing efficiency at both very small and large sizes.</p>

The effects of age and lifetime flight behavior on flight capacity in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>
<p>The effects of flight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> on physiology and senescence may be profound in insects because of the extremely high metabolic costs of flight. Flight capacity in insects decreases with age; in contrast, limiting flight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> extends lifespan and slows the age-related loss of antioxidant capacity and accumulation of oxidative damage in flight muscles. In this study, we tested the effects of age and lifetime flight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> on flight capacity by measuring wingbeat frequency, the ability to fly in a hypo-dense gas mixture, and metabolic rate in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Specifically, 5-day-old adult flies were separated into three life-long treatments: (1) those not allowed to fly (no flight), (2) those allowed – but not forced – to fly (voluntary flight) and (3) those mechanically stimulated to fly (induced flight). Flight capacity senesced earliest in flies from the no-flight treatment, followed by the induced-flight group and then the voluntary flight group. Wingbeat frequency senesced with age in all treatment groups, but was most apparent in the voluntary- and induced-flight groups. Metabolic rate during agitated flight senesced earliest and most rapidly in the induced flight group, and was low and uniform throughout age in the no-flight group. Early senescence in the induced-flight group was likely due to the acceleration of deleterious aging phenomena such as the rapid accumulation of damage at the cellular level, while the early loss of flight capacity and low metabolic rates in the no-flight group demonstrate that disuse effects can also significantly alter senescence patterns of whole-insect performance.</p>

The olfactory neuron AWC promotes avoidance of normally palatable food following chronic dietary restriction
<p>Changes in metabolic state alter foraging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> and food preference in animals. Here, I show that normally attractive food becomes repulsive to <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> if animals are chronically undernourished as a result of alimentary tract defects. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>al plasticity is achieved in two ways: increased food leaving and induction of aversive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> towards food. A particularly strong food avoider is defective in the chitin synthase that makes the pharyngeal lining. Food avoidance induced by underfeeding is mediated by cGMP signaling in the olfactory neurons AWC and AWB, and the gustatory neurons ASJ and ASK. Food avoidance is enhanced by increased population density and is reduced if the animals are unable to correctly interpret their nutritional state as a result of defects in the AMP kinase or TOR/S6kinase pathways. The TGF-β/DBL-1 pathway suppresses food avoidance and the cellular basis for this is distinct from its role in aversive olfactory learning of harmful food. This study suggests that nutritional state feedback via nutrient sensors, population size and olfactory neurons guides food preference in <i>C. elegans</i>.</p>

Aging and its modulation in a long-lived worker caste of the honey bee
<p>Highly social animals provide alternative aging models in which vastly different lifespan patterns are flexible, and linked to social caste. Research in these species aims to reveal how environment, including social cues, can shape the transition between short-lived and extremely long-lived phenotypes with negligible senescence. Among honey bee workers, short to intermediate lifespans are typical for summer castes, while the winter caste can live up to 10 times longer. For summer castes, experimental interventions could predictably accelerate, slow or revert functional senescence. In contrast, little is known about the partic ular conditions under which periods of negligible senescence in winter castes can be disrupted or sustained. We asked how manipulation of social environment in colonies with long-lived winter bees might alter the pace of functional senescence, measured as learning performance, as well as of cellular senescence, measured as lipofuscin accumulation. We show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>al senescence becomes rapidly detectable when the winter state is disrupted, and changes in social task <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>s and social environment (brood) are induced. Likewise, we found that cellular senescence was induced by such social intervention. However, cellular senescence showed marked regional differences, suggesting that particular brain regions age slower than others. Finally, by preventing post-winter colonies from brood rearing, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>al senescence became undetectable, even after transition to the usually short-lived phenotypes had occurred. We envision that social regulation of negligible functional senescence and highly dynamic accumulation of a universal symptom of cellular aging (lipofuscin) offers rewarding perspectives to target proximate mechanisms of slowed aging.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
Absence of strong strain effects in behavioral analyses of <i>Shank3</i>-deficient mice
<p>Haploinsufficiency of <i>SHANK3</i>, caused by chromosomal abnormalities or mutations that disrupt one copy of the gene, leads to a neurodevelopmental syndrome called Phelan-McDermid syndrome, symptoms of which can include absent or delayed speech, intellectual disability, neurological changes and autism spectrum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ers. The SHANK3 protein forms a key structural part of the post-synaptic density. We previously generated and characterized mice with a targeted disruption of <i>Shank3</i> in which exons coding for the ankyrin-repeat domain were deleted and expression of full-length Shank3 was disrupted. We documented specific deficits in synaptic function and plasticity, along with reduced reciprocal social interactions, in <i>Shank3</i> heterozygous mice. Changes in phenotype owing to a mutation at a single locus are quite frequently modulated by other loci, most dramatically when the entire genetic background is changed. In mice, each strain of laboratory mouse represents a distinct genetic background and alterations in phenotype owing to gene knockout or transgenesis are frequently different across strains, which can lead to the identification of important modifier loci. We have investigated the effect of genetic background on phenotypes of <i>Shank3</i> heterozygous, knockout and wild-type mice, using C57BL/6, 129SVE and FVB/Ntac strain backgrounds. We focused on observable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>s with the goal of carrying out subsequent analyses to identify modifier loci. Surprisingly, there were very modest strain effects over a large battery of analyses. These results indicate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>al phenotypes associated with <i>Shank3</i> haploinsufficiency are largely strain-independent.</p>

Behavioral abnormalities and Parkinson’s-like histological changes resulting from <i>Id2</i> inactivation in mice
<p>Characterizing dopaminergic neuronal development and function in novel genetic animal models might uncover strategies for researchers to develop disease-modifying treatments for neurologic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ers. <i>Id2</i> is a transcription factor expressed in the developing central nervous system. <i>Id2</i><sup>−/−</sup> mice have fewer dopaminergic neurons in the olfactory bulb and reduced olfactory discrimination, a pre-clinical marker of Parkinson’s disease. Here, we summarize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>al, histological and <i>in vitro</i> molecular biological analyses to determine whether midbrain dopaminergic neurons are affected by <i>Id2</i> loss. <i>Id2</i><sup>−/−</sup> mice were hyperactive at 1 and 3 months of age, but by 6 months showed reduced activity. <i>Id2</i><sup>−/−</sup> mice showed age-dependent histological alterations in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpC) associated with changes in locomotor activity. Reduced dopamine transporter (<i>DAT)</i> expression was observed at early ages in <i>Id2</i><sup>−/−</sup> mice and <i>DAT</i> expression was dependent on <i>Id2</i> expression in an <i>in vitro</i> dopaminergic differentiation model. Evidence of neurodegeneration, including activated caspase-3 and glial infiltration, were noted in the SNpC of older <i>Id2</i><sup>−/−</sup> mice. These findings document a novel role for <i>Id2</i> in the maintenance of midbrain dopamine neurons. The <i>Id2</i><sup>−/−</sup> mouse should provide unique opportunities to study the progression of neurodegenerative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ers involving the dopamine system.</p>

A dynamic cell adhesion surface regulates tissue architecture in growth plate cartilage
<p>The architecture and morphogenetic properties of tissues are founded in the tissue-specific regulation of cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>s. In endochondral bones, the growth plate cartilage promotes bone elongation via regulated chondrocyte maturation within an ordered, three-dimensional cell array. A key event in the process that generates this cell array is the transformation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ered resting chondrocytes into clonal columns of discoid proliferative cells aligned with the primary growth vector. Previous analysis showed that column-forming chondrocytes display planar cell divisions, and the resulting daughter cells rearrange by ∼90° to align with the lengthening column. However, these previous studies provided limited information about the mechanisms underlying this dynamic process. Here we present new mechanistic insights generated by application of a novel time-lapse confocal microscopy method along with immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. We show that, during cell division, daughter chondrocytes establish a cell-cell adhesion surface enriched in cadherins and β-catenin. Rearrangement into columns occurs concomitant with expansion of this adhesion surface in a process more similar to cell spreading than to migration. Column formation requires cell-cell adhesion, as reducing cadherin binding via chelation of extracellular calcium inhibits chondrocyte rearrangement. Importantly, physical indicators of cell polarity, such as cell body alignment, are not prerequisites for oriented cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>. Our results support a model in which regulation of adhesive surface dynamics and cortical tension by extrinsic signaling modifies the thermodynamic landscape to promote organization of daughter cells in the context of the three-dimensional growth plate tissue.</p>

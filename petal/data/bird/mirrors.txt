Quantum reference beacon–guided superresolution optical focusing in complex media
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al scattering is generally considered to be a nuisance of microscopy that limits imaging depth and spatial resolution. Wavefront shaping techniques enable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al imaging at unprecedented depth, but attaining superresolution within complex media remains a challenge. We used a quantum reference beacon (QRB), consisting of solid-state quantum emitters with spin-dependent fluorescence, to provide subwavelength guidestar feedback for wavefront shaping to achieve a superresolution <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al focus. We implemented the QRB-guided imaging with nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond nanocrystals, which enable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al focusing with a subdiffraction resolution below 186 nanometers (less than half the wavelength). QRB-assisted wavefront-shaping should find use in a range of applications, including deep-tissue quantum enhanced sensing and individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al excitation of magnetically coupled spin ensembles for applications in quantum information processing.</p>

Dynamic use of optic flow during pheromone tracking by the male silkmoth, <i>Bombyx mori</i>
<p>Several insects require both olfactory and visual cues during odour-source localisation to successfully locate an odour source. In the male silkmoth, <i>Bombyx mori</i>, detection of the female sex pheromone triggers a programmed walking pattern, starting from a surge (straight-line walking) followed by zigzag walking. Although pheromone-triggered behaviour in silkmoths is well understood, the role of visual cues remains obscure. To address this question, we performed behavioural experiments on tethered-walking moths by recording their locomotion during stimulation with a pheromone and a visual motion pattern (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong> flow). The experiments were conducted under open- and closed-loop visual stimuli. We found that the use of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong> flow input was determined by the behavioural state of surge and zigzagging. Silkmoths exhibited an optomotor response, which is a behavioural visual response, by turning towards the same direction as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong> flow stimuli only during surge, but not during zigzagging. In addition, modulation of the zigzag walking pattern was observed when the moths were presented with biased closed-loop visual stimuli (visual feedback with biased constant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong> flow); however, the directional preference mechanism was different from that of the optomotor response. Based on these findings, we suggest that the optomotor response is utilised for course control during straight-line walking, whereas the absence of optomotor response during zigzagging is used to effectively perform the programmed walking pattern. Considering the neural basis of programmed behaviour, we speculate that at least two visual pathways are involved in the state-dependent use of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong> flow during odour tracking behaviour in silkmoths.</p>

Optical skyrmion lattice in evanescent electromagnetic fields
<p>Topological defects play a key role in a variety of physical systems, ranging from high-energy to solid-state physics. A skyrmion is a type of topological defect that has shown promise for applications in the fields of magnetic storage and spintronics. We show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al skyrmion lattices can be generated using evanescent electromagnetic fields and demonstrate this using surface plasmon polaritons, imaged by phase-resolved near-field <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al microscopy.

Extending the generation of skyrmions to photonic systems provides various possibilities for applications in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al information processing, transfer, and storage.</p>

Detecting nanometric displacements with optical ruler metrology
<p>We introduce the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al ruler, an electromagnetic analog of a physical ruler, for nanoscale displacement metrology. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al ruler is a complex electromagnetic field in which singularities serve as the marks on the scale. It is created by the diffraction of light on a metasurface, with singularity marks then revealed by high-magnification interferometric observation. Using a Pancharatnam-Berry phase metasurface, we demonstrate a displacement resolving power of better than 1 nanometer (λ/800, where λ is the wavelength of light) at a wavelength of 800 nanometers. We argue that a resolving power of ~λ/4000, the typical size of an atom, may be achievable. An <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al ruler with dimensions of only a few tens of micrometers offers applications in nanometrology, nanomonitoring, and nanofabrication, particularly in the demanding and confined environment of future smart manufacturing tools.</p>

A silicon Brillouin laser

In this study, we have harnessed these engineered nonlinearities to demonstrate Brillouin lasing in silicon. Moreover, we show that this silicon-based Brillouin laser enters a regime of dynamics in which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al self-oscillation produces phonon linewidth narrowing.

Probing optically silent superfluid stripes in cuprates
<p>Unconventional superconductivity in the cuprates coexists with other types of electronic order. However, some of these orders are invisible to most experimental probes because of their symmetry. For example, the possible existence of superfluid stripes is not easily validated with linear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>s, because the stripe alignment causes interlayer superconducting tunneling to vanish on average. Here we show that this frustration is removed in the nonlinear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al response. A giant terahertz third harmonic, characteristic of nonlinear Josephson tunneling, is observed in La<sub>1.885</sub>Ba<sub>0.115</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> above the transition temperature <i>T</i><sub>c</sub> = 13 kelvin and up to the charge-ordering temperature <i>T</i><sub>co</sub> = 55 kelvin. We model these results by hypothesizing the presence of a pair density wave condensate, in which nonlinear mixing of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>ally silent tunneling modes drives large dipole-carrying supercurrents.</p>

Disorder-induced optical transition from spin Hall to random Rashba effect

We report on photonic spin-symmetry breaking and unexpected spin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al transport phenomena arising from subwavelength-scale disordered geometric phase structure. Weak disorder induces a photonic spin Hall effect, observed via quantum weak measurements, whereas strong disorder leads to spin-split modes in momentum space, a random <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al Rashba effect. Study of the momentum space entropy reveals an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al transition upon reaching a critical point where the structure’s anisotropy axis vanishes. Incorporation of singular topology into the disordered structure demonstrates repulsive vortex interaction depending on the disorder strength. The photonic disordered geometric phase can serve as a platform for the study of different phenomena emerging from complex media involving spin-orbit coupling.</p>

Arbitrary spin-to–orbital angular momentum conversion of light
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al elements that convert the spin angular momentum (SAM) of light into vortex beams have found applications in classical and quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>s. These elements—SAM-to–orbital angular momentum (OAM) converters—are based on the geometric phase and only permit the conversion of left- and right-circular polarizations (spin states) into states with opposite OAM. We present a method for converting arbitrary SAM states into total angular momentum states characterized by a superposition of independent OAM. We designed a metasurface that converts left- and right-circular polarizations into states with independent values of OAM and designed another device that performs this operation for elliptically polarized states. These results illustrate a general material-mediated connection between SAM and OAM of light and may find applications in producing complex structured light and in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al co</span></strong>mmunication.</p>

Large, valley-exclusive Bloch-Siegert shift in monolayer WS<sub>2</sub>
<p>Coherent interaction with off-resonance light can be used to shift the energy levels of atoms, molecules, and solids.

We observed an exceptionally large Bloch-Siegert shift in monolayer tungsten disulfide (WS<sub>2</sub>) under infrared <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al driving. By controlling the light helicity, we could confine the Bloch-Siegert shift to occur only at one valley, and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al Stark shift at the other valley, because the two effects obey opposite selection rules at different valleys.

Its nonreciprocal behavior arises from the chiral interaction between the atom and the transversally confined light. We demonstrate that the internal quantum state of the atom controls the operation direction of the circulator and that it features a strongly nonlinear response at the single-photon level. This enables, for example, photon number–dependent routing and novel quantum simulation protocols. Furthermore, such a circulator can in principle be prepared in a coherent superposition of its operational states and may become a key element for quantum information processing in scalable integrated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al circuits.</p>

Single-molecule optomechanics in “picocavities”
<p>Trapping light with noble metal nanostructures overcomes the diffraction limit and can confine light to volumes typically on the order of 30 cubic nanometers.

Extraordinary plasticity of an inorganic semiconductor in darkness
<p>Inorganic semiconductors generally tend to fail in a brittle manner. Here, we report that extraordinary “plasticity” can take place in an inorganic semiconductor if the deformation is carried out “in complete darkness.” Room-temperature deformation tests of zinc sulfide (ZnS) were performed under varying light conditions. ZnS crystals immediately fractured when they deformed under light irradiation. In contrast, it was found that ZnS crystals can be plastically deformed up to a deformation strain of ε<sub>t</sub> = 45% in complete darkness. In addition, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al bandgap of the deformed ZnS crystals was distinctly decreased after deformation. These results suggest that dislocations in ZnS become mobile in complete darkness and that multiplied dislocations can affect the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al bandgap over the whole crystal.

Probing the ultimate plasmon confinement limits with a van der Waals heterostructure

We synthesize the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al to near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy of SSS17a collected by the One-Meter Two-Hemisphere collaboration, finding that SSS17a is unlike other known transients. The source is best described by theoretical models of a kilonova consisting of radioactive elements produced by rapid neutron capture (the r-process). We conclude that SSS17a was the result of a binary neutron star merger, reinforcing the gravitational wave result.</p>

Light curves of the neutron star merger GW170817/SSS17a: Implications for r-process nucleosynthesis
<p>On 17 August 2017, gravitational waves (GWs) were detected from a binary neutron star merger, GW170817, along with a coincident short gamma-ray burst, GRB 170817A. An <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al transient source, Swope Supernova Survey 17a (SSS17a), was subsequently identified as the counterpart of this event. We present ultraviolet, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al, and infrared light curves of SSS17a extending from 10.9 hours to 18 days postmerger. We constrain the radioactively powered transient resulting from the ejection of neutron-rich material. The fast rise of the light curves, subsequent decay, and rapid color evolution are consistent with multiple ejecta components of differing lanthanide abundance. The late-time light curve indicates that SSS17a produced at least ~0.05 solar masses of heavy elements, demonstrating that neutron star mergers play a role in rapid neutron capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis in the universe.</p>

<i>Swift</i> and <i>NuSTAR</i> observations of GW170817: Detection of a blue kilonova
<p>With the first direct detection of merging black holes in 2015, the era of gravitational wave (GW) astrophysics began. A complete picture of compact object mergers, however, requires the detection of an electromagnetic (EM) counterpart. We report ultraviolet (UV) and x-ray observations by <i>Swift</i> and the <i>Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array</i> of the EM counterpart of the binary neutron star merger GW170817. The bright, rapidly fading UV emission indicates a high mass (≈0.03 solar masses) wind-driven outflow with moderate electron fraction (<i>Y</i><sub>e</sub> ≈ 0.27). Combined with the x-ray limits, we favor an observer viewing angle of ≈30° away from the orbital rotation axis, which avoids both obscuration from the heaviest elements in the orbital plane and a direct view of any ultrarelativistic, highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collim</span></strong>ated ejecta (a γ-ray burst afterglow).</p>

Purcell effect for active tuning of light scattering from semiconductor optical antennas

Control over the intrinsic properties, including their complex refractive index, size, and geometry, has been used to manipulate fundamental light absorption, scattering, and emission processes in nanostructured optoelectronic devices. In this study, we harness the electric and magnetic resonances of such antennas to achieve a very strong dependence of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al properties on the external environment. Specifically, we illustrate how the resonant scattering wavelength of single silicon nanowires is tunable across the entire visible spectrum by simply moving the height of the nanowires above a metallic mirror.

Coherently aligned nanoparticles within a biogenic single crystal: A biological prestressing strategy

This intriguing process uses coherent nanoprecipitates to induce compressive stresses on the host matrix, functionally resembling the Guinier–Preston zones known in classical metallurgy.

Giant nonlinear response at a plasmonic nanofocus drives efficient four-wave mixing
<p>Efficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al frequency mixing typically must accumulate over large interaction lengths because nonlinear responses in natural materials are inherently weak. This limits the efficiency of mixing processes owing to the requirement of phase matching. Here, we report efficient four-wave mixing (FWM) over micrometer-scale interaction lengths at telecommunications wavelengths on silicon. We used an integrated plasmonic gap waveguide that strongly confines light within a nonlinear organic polymer. The gap waveguide intensifies light by nanofocusing it to a mode cross-section of a few tens of nanometers, thus generating a nonlinear response so strong that efficient FWM accumulates over wavelength-scale distances. This technique opens up nonlinear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>s to a regime of relaxed phase matching, with the possibility of compact, broadband, and efficient frequency mixing integrated with silicon photonics.</p>

The image-forming mirror in the eye of the scallop
<p>Scallops possess a visual system comprising up to 200 eyes, each containing a concave mirror rather than a lens to focus light. The hierarchical organization of the multilayered mirror is controlled for image formation, from the component guanine crystals at the nanoscale to the complex three-dimensional morphology at the millimeter level. The layered structure of the mirror is tuned to reflect the wavelengths of light penetrating the scallop’s habitat and is tiled with a mosaic of square guanine crystals, which reduces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al aberrations. The mirror forms images on a double-layered retina used for separately imaging the peripheral and central fields of view.

Tunable excitons in bilayer graphene

Here, we report the observation of excitons in bilayer graphene (BLG) using photocurrent spectroscopy of high-quality BLG encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride. We observed two prominent excitonic resonances with narrow line widths that are tunable from the mid-infrared to the terahertz range. These excitons obey <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al selection rules distinct from those in conventional semiconductors and feature an electron pseudospin winding number of 2.

Observation of mean path length invariance in light-scattering media
<p>The microstructure of a medium strongly influences how light propagates through it. The amount of disorder it contains determines whether the medium is transparent or opaque. Theory predicts that exciting such a medium homogeneously and isotropically makes some of its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al properties depend only on the medium’s outer geometry. Here, we report an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al experiment demonstrating that the mean path length of light is invariant with respect to the microstructure of the medium it scatters through. Using colloidal solutions with varying concentration and particle size, the invariance of the mean path length is observed over nearly two orders of magnitude in scattering strength. Our results can be extended to a wide range of systems—however ordered, correlated, or disordered—and apply to all wave-scattering problems.</p>

A Fermi-degenerate three-dimensional optical lattice clock

Previously, atomic interactions have forced a compromise between clock stability, which benefits from a large number of atoms, and accuracy, which suffers from density-dependent frequency shifts. Here we demonstrate a scalable solution that takes advantage of the high, correlated density of a degenerate Fermi gas in a three-dimensional (3D) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al lattice to guard against on-site interaction shifts. We show that contact interactions are resolved so that their contribution to clock shifts is orders of magnitude lower than in previous experiments.

High-harmonic generation in graphene enhanced by elliptically polarized light excitation
<p>The electronic properties of graphene can give rise to a range of nonlinear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al responses. One of the most desirable nonlinear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al processes is high-harmonic generation (HHG) originating from coherent electron motion induced by an intense light field. Here, we report on the observation of up to ninth-order harmonics in graphene excited by mid-infrared laser pulses at room temperature. The HHG in graphene is enhanced by an elliptically polarized laser excitation, and the resultant harmonic radiation has a particular polarization. The observed ellipticity dependence is reproduced by a fully quantum mechanical treatment of HHG in solids. The zero-gap nature causes the unique properties of HHG in graphene, and our findings open up the possibility of investigating strong-field and ultrafast dynamics and nonlinear behavior of massless Dirac fermions.</p>

The response of a large body can be tuned with a single impurity, including cases such as engineering perfect magnetic conductor and epsilon-and-mu-near-zero media with nonmagnetic constituents.

Visualizing Embolism Propagation in Gas-Injected Leaves
<p>Because the xylem in leaves is thought to be at the greatest risk of cavitation, reliable and efficient methods to characterize leaf xylem vulnerability are of interest. We report a method to generate leaf xylem vulnerability curves (VCs) by gas injection. Using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al light transmission, we visualized embolism propagation in grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) and red oak (<i>Quercus rubra</i>) leaves injected with positive gas pressure. This resulted in a rapid, stepwise reduction of transmitted light, identical to that observed during leaf dehydration, confirming that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al method detects gas bubbles and provides insights into the air-seeding hypothesis. In red oak, xylem VCs generated using gas injection were similar to those generated using bench dehydration, but indicated 50% loss of conductivity at lower tension (∼0.4 MPa) in grapevine. In determining VC, this method eliminates the need to ascertain xylem tension, thus avoiding potential errors in water potential estimations. It is also much faster (1 h per VC). However, severing the petiole and applying high-pressure gas could affect air-seeding and the generated VC. We discuss potential artifacts arising from gas injection and recommend comparison of this method with a more standard procedure before it is assumed to be suitable for a given species.</p>

Low Vulnerability to Xylem Embolism in Leaves and Stems of North American Oaks
<p>Although recent findings suggest that xylem embolism represents a significant, drought-induced damaging process in land plants, substantial debate surrounds the capacity of long-vesseled, ring-porous species to resist embolism. We investigated whether recent methodological developments could help resolve this controversy within <i>Quercus</i>, a long-vesseled, ring-porous temperate angiosperm genus, and shed further light on the importance of xylem vulnerability to embolism as an indicator of drought tolerance. We used the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al technique to quantify leaf and stem xylem vulnerability to embolism of eight <i>Quercus</i> species from the Mediterranean-type climate region of California to examine absolute measures of resistance to embolism as well as any potential hydraulic segmentation between tissue types. We demonstrated that our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al assessment reflected flow impairment for a subset of our sample species by quantifying changes in leaf hydraulic conductance in dehydrating branches. Air-entry water potential varied 2-fold in leaves, ranging from −1.7 ± 0.25 MPa to −3.74 ± 0.23 MPa, and 4-fold in stems, ranging from −1.17 ± 0.04 MPa to −4.91 ± 0.3 MPa. Embolism occurred earlier in leaves than in stems in only one out of eight sample species, and plants always lost turgor before experiencing stem embolism. Our results show that long-vesseled North American <i>Quercus</i> species are more resistant to embolism than previously thought and support the hypothesis that avoiding stem embolism is a critical component of drought tolerance in woody trees. Accurately quantifying xylem vulnerability to embolism is essential for understanding species distributions along aridity gradients and predicting plant mortality during drought.</p>

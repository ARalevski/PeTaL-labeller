Association Between Fetal Congenital Heart Defects and Maternal Risk of Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy in the Same Pregnancy and Across Pregnancies
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Both pregnant women carrying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fetus</span></strong>es with heart defects and women with hypertensive disorders of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pregnanc</span></strong>y often exhibit angiogenic imbalances, suggesting that the same mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of the former and the pathophysiology of the latter. We conducted a register-based cohort study to determine whether offspring congenital heart defects are associated with an increased risk of hypertensive disorders of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pregnanc</span></strong>y and whether the mechanisms driving any association are primarily maternal or fetal.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Among singleton <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pregnanc</span></strong>ies without chromosomal abnormalities lasting ≥20 weeks in Denmark from 1978 to 2011 (n= 1 972 857), we identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pregnanc</span></strong>ies complicated by offspring congenital heart defects or early preterm preeclampsia, late preterm preeclampsia, term preeclampsia, and gestational hypertension. We used polytomous logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for associations between offspring congenital heart defects and maternal hypertensive disorders of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pregnanc</span></strong>y overall and for specific heart defects.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Offspring congenital heart defects were strongly associated with early preterm preeclampsia (OR, 7.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.11–8.03) and late preterm preeclampsia (OR, 2.82; 95% CI, 2.38–3.34) in the same <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pregnanc</span></strong>y and weakly associated with term preeclampsia (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.06–1.27), but they were not associated with gestational hypertension (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.92–1.25). Association strengths were consistent across heart defect types. Offspring congenital heart defects in a previous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pregnanc</span></strong>y were also strongly associated with preterm preeclampsia in subsequent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pregnanc</span></strong>ies (early preterm preeclampsia: OR, 2.37; 95% CI, 1.68–3.34; late preterm preeclampsia: OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.52–2.75) but were only modestly associated with term preeclampsia and not associated with gestational hypertension. Similarly, preterm preeclampsia in a previous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pregnanc</span></strong>y, but not term preeclampsia or gestational hypertension, was associated with offspring congenital heart defects in later <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pregnanc</span></strong>ies (early preterm preeclampsia: OR, 7.91; 95% CI, 6.06–10.3; late preterm preeclampsia: OR, 2.83; 95% CI, 2.11–3.79; term preeclampsia: OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.88–1.10; gestational hypertension: OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.92–1.38).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Linked pathophysiological mechanisms may be involved in some congenital heart defects and preterm preeclampsia.

Risk Factors for Coarctation of the Aorta on Prenatal Ultrasound
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Prenatal diagnosis of coarctation of the aorta (CoA) is still challenging and affected by high rates of false-positive diagnoses. The aim of this study was to ascertain the strength of association and to quantify the diagnostic accuracy of different ultrasound signs in predicting CoA prenatally.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases were searched. Random-effects and hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic model meta-analyses were used to analyze the data.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Seven hundred ninety-four articles were identified, and 12 (922 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fetus</span></strong>es at risk for CoA) articles were included. Mean mitral valve diameter <i>z</i> score was lower (<i>P</i><0.001) and the mean tricuspid valve diameter <i>z</i> score was higher in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fetus</span></strong>es with CoA than in those without CoA (<i>P</i>=0.01).

Pregnancy Outcomes in Women With Rheumatic Mitral Valve Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac disease is 1 of the major causes of maternal mortality. We studied <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pregnanc</span></strong>y outcomes in women with rheumatic mitral valve disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The Registry of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pregnanc</span></strong>y and Cardiac Disease is an international prospective registry, and consecutive pregnant women with cardiac disease were included. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pregnanc</span></strong>y outcomes in all women with rheumatic mitral valve disease and no pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pregnanc</span></strong>y valve replacement is described in the present study (n=390). A maternal cardiac event was defined as cardiac death, arrhythmia requiring treatment, heart failure, thromboembolic event, aortic dissection, endocarditis, acute coronary syndrome, and hospitalization for other cardiac reasons or cardiac intervention. Associations between patient characteristics and cardiac outcomes were checked in a 3-level model (patient–center–country).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Most patients came from emerging countries (75%). Mitral stenosis (MS) with or without mitral regurgitation (MR) was present in 273 women, isolated MR in 117. The degree of MS was mild in 20.9%, moderate in 39.2%, severe in 19.8%, and severity not classified in the remainder. Maternal death during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pregnanc</span></strong>y occurred in 1 patient with severe MS. Hospital admission occurred in 23.1% of the women with MS, and the main reason was heart failure (mild MS 15.8%, moderate 23.4%, severe 48.1%; <i>P</i><0.001). Heart failure occurred in 23.1% of patients with moderate or severe MR. An intervention during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pregnanc</span></strong>y was performed in 16 patients, 14 had percutaneous balloon mitral commissurotomy, and 2 had surgical valve replacement (1 for MS, 1 for MR). In multivariable modeling, pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pregnanc</span></strong>y New York Heart Association class >1 was an independent predictor of maternal cardiac events. Follow-up at 6 months postpartum was available for 53%, and 3 more patients died (1 with severe MS, 1 with moderate MS, 1 with moderate to severe MR).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Although mortality was only 1.9% during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pregnanc</span></strong>y, ≈50% of the patients with severe rheumatic MS and 23% of those with significant MR developed heart failure during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pregnanc</span></strong>y.

Tim-3 signaling in peripheral NK cells promotes maternal-fetal immune tolerance and alleviates pregnancy loss
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pregnanc</span></strong>y loss occurs in about 15% of clinically recognized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pregnanc</span></strong>ies, and defective maternal-fetal immune tolerance contributes to more than 50% of these events. We found that signaling by the type I membrane protein T cell immunoglobulin and mucin-containing protein 3 (Tim-3) in natural killer (NK) cells had an essential protective role during early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pregnanc</span></strong>y. Tim-3 on peripheral NK (pNK) cells was transiently increased in abundance during the first trimester of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pregnanc</span></strong>y, which depended on interleukin-4 (IL-4)–signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) and progesterone signaling. Tim-3<sup>+</sup> pNK cells displayed immunosuppressive activities, including the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines and the induction of regulatory T cells (T<sub>regs</sub>) in a transforming growth factor–β1 (TGF-β1)–dependent manner. Tim-3 on pNK cells was stimulated by its ligand galectin-9 (Gal-9), leading to signaling by the kinases c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and AKT. In recurrent miscarriage (RM) patients, Tim-3 abundance on pNK cells was reduced and the immunosuppressive activity of Tim-3<sup>+</sup> pNK cells was impaired. Compared to Tim-3<sup>+</sup> pNK cells from donors with normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pregnanc</span></strong>ies, RM patient Tim-3<sup>+</sup> pNK cells exhibited changes in DNA accessibility in certain genetic loci, which were reversed by inhibiting accessible chromatin reader proteins. Furthermore, Tim-3<sup>+</sup> pNK cells, but not Tim-3<sup>−</sup> pNK cells, reduced fetal loss in abortion-prone and NK cell–deficient mice. Together, our findings reveal a critical role for Tim-3–Gal-9 signaling–mediated immunoregulation by pNK cells in maternal-fetal immune tolerance and suggest that Tim-3 abundance on pNK cells is a potential biomarker for RM diagnosis.</p>

The Ly6/uPAR protein Bouncer is necessary and sufficient for species-specific fertilization
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization is fundamental for sexual reproduction, yet its molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. We found that an oocyte-expressed Ly6/uPAR protein, which we call Bouncer, is a crucial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization factor in zebrafish. Membrane-bound Bouncer mediates sperm-egg binding and is thus essential for sperm entry into the egg. Remarkably, Bouncer not only is required for sperm-egg interaction but is also sufficient to allow cross-species <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization between zebrafish and medaka, two fish species that diverged more than 200 million years ago. Our study thus identifies Bouncer as a key determinant of species-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization in fish. Bouncer’s closest homolog in tetrapods, SPACA4, is restricted to the male germline in internally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>izing vertebrates, which suggests that our findings in fish have relevance to human biology.</p>

Arabidopsis <i>LORELEI</i>, a Maternally Expressed Imprinted Gene, Promotes Early Seed Development
<p>In flowering plants, the female gametophyte controls pollen tube reception immediately before <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization and regulates seed development immediately after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization, although the controlling mechanisms remain poorly understood. Previously, we showed that <i>LORELEI</i> (<i>LRE</i>), which encodes a putative glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane protein, is critical for pollen tube reception by the female gametophyte before <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization and the initiation of seed development after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization. Here, we show that <i>LRE</i> is expressed in the synergid, egg, and central cells of the female gametophyte and in the zygote and proliferating endosperm of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed. Interestingly, <i>LRE</i> expression in the developing seeds was primarily from the matrigenic <i>LRE</i> allele, indicating that <i>LRE</i> expression is imprinted. However, <i>LRE</i> was biallelically expressed in 8-d-old seedlings, indicating that the patrigenic allele does not remain silenced throughout the sporophytic generation. Regulation of imprinted <i>LRE</i> expression is likely novel, as <i>LRE</i> was not expressed in pollen or pollen tubes of mutants defective for MET1, DDM1, RNA-dependent DNA methylation, or MSI-dependent histone methylation. Additionally, the patrigenic <i>LRE</i> allele inherited from these mutants was not expressed in seeds. Surprisingly, and contrary to the predictions of the parental conflict hypothesis, LRE promotes growth in seeds, as loss of the matrigenic but not the patrigenic <i>LRE</i> allele caused delayed initiation of seed development. Our results showed that <i>LRE</i> is a rare imprinted gene that functions immediately after double <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization and supported the model that a passage through the female gametophyte establishes monoalleleic expression of <i>LRE</i> in seeds and controls early seed development.</p>

Cysteine-rich peptides promote interspecific genetic isolation in <i>Arabidopsis</i>
<p>Reproductive isolation is a prerequisite for speciation. Failure of communication between female tissues of the pistil and paternal pollen tubes imposes hybridization barriers in flowering plants. <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> LURE1 (AtLURE1) peptides and their male receptor PRK6 aid attraction of the growing pollen tube to the ovule. Here, we report that the knockout of the entire <i>AtLURE1</i> gene family did not affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ity, indicating that AtLURE1-PRK6–mediated signaling is not required for successful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization within one <i>Arabidopsis</i> species. AtLURE1s instead function as pollen tube emergence accelerators that favor conspecific pollen over pollen from other species and thus promote reproductive isolation. We also identified maternal peptides XIUQIU1 to -4, which attract pollen tubes regardless of species. Cooperation between ovule attraction and pollen tube growth acceleration favors conspecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization and promotes reproductive isolation.</p>

Gene Regulatory Networks for the Haploid-to-Diploid Transition of <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>
<p>The sexual cycle of the unicellular <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> culminates in the formation of diploid zygotes that differentiate into dormant spores that eventually undergo meiosis. Mating between gametes induces rapid cell wall shedding via the enzyme g-lysin; cell fusion is followed by heterodimerization of sex-specific homeobox transcription factors, GSM1 and GSP1, and initiation of zygote-specific gene expression. To investigate the genetic underpinnings of the zygote developmental pathway, we performed comparative transcriptome analysis of both pre- and post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization samples. We identified 253 transcripts specifically enriched in early zygotes, 82% of which were not up-regulated in <i>gsp1</i> null zygotes. We also found that the GSM1/GSP1 heterodimer negatively regulates the vegetative wall program at the posttranscriptional level, enabling prompt transition from vegetative wall to zygotic wall assembly. Annotation of the g-lysin-induced and early zygote genes reveals distinct vegetative and zygotic wall programs, supported by concerted up-regulation of genes encoding cell wall-modifying enzymes and proteins involved in nucleotide-sugar metabolism. The haploid-to-diploid transition in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> is masterfully controlled by the GSM1/GSP1 heterodimer, translating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization and gamete coalescence into a bona fide differentiation program. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization-triggered integration of genes required to make related, but structurally and functionally distinct organelles—the vegetative versus zygote cell wall—presents a likely scenario for the evolution of complex developmental gene regulatory networks.</p>

Transcription Factor MYB26 Is Key to Spatial Specificity in Anther Secondary Thickening Formation
<p>Successful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization relies on the production and effective release of viable pollen. Failure of anther opening (dehiscence), results in male sterility, although the pollen may be fully functional. MYB26 regulates the formation of secondary thickening in the anther endothecium, which is critical for anther dehiscence and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ity. Here, we show that although the <i>MYB26</i> transcript shows expression in multiple floral organs, the MYB26 protein is localized specifically to the anther endothecium nuclei and that it directly regulates two <i>NAC</i> domain genes, <i>NST1</i> and <i>NST2</i>, which are critical for the induction of secondary thickening biosynthesis genes. However, there is a complex relationship of regulation between these genes and MYB26. Using DEX-inducible MYB26 lines and overexpression in the various mutant backgrounds, we have shown that MYB26 up-regulates both <i>NST1</i> and <i>NST2</i> expression. Surprisingly normal thickening and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ity rescue does not occur in the absence of MYB26, even with constitutively induced <i>NST1</i> and <i>NST2</i>, suggesting an additional essential role for MYB26 in this regulation. Combined overexpression of <i>NST1</i> and <i>NST2</i> in <i>myb26</i> facilitates limited ectopic thickening in the anther epidermis, but not in the endothecium, and thus fails to rescue dehiscence. Therefore, by a series of regulatory controls through MYB26, NST1, NST2, secondary thickening is formed specifically within the endothecium; this specificity is essential for anther opening.</p>

A killer-protector system, <i>S5</i>, composed of three adjacent genes (<i>ORF3</i>, <i>ORF4</i>, and <i>ORF5</i>), regulates female gamete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ity of <i>indica-japonica</i> hybrids. To characterize the processes underlying this system, we performed transcriptomic analyses of pistils from rice variety Balilla (BL), Balilla with transformed <i>ORF5+</i> (BL<i>5+</i>) producing sterile female gametes, and Balilla with transformed <i>ORF3+</i> and <i>ORF5+</i> (BL<i>3+5+</i>) producing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>e gametes. RNA sequencing of tissues collected before (MMC), during (MEI), and after (AME) meiosis of the megaspore mother cell detected 19,269 to 20,928 genes as expressed. Comparison between BL<i>5+</i> and BL showed that <i>ORF5+</i> induced differential expression of 8,339, 6,278, and 530 genes at MMC, MEI, and AME, respectively. At MMC, large-scale differential expression of cell wall-modifying genes and biotic and abiotic response genes indicated that cell wall integrity damage induced severe biotic and abiotic stresses. The processes continued to MEI and induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress as indicated by differential expression of ER stress-responsive genes, leading to programmed cell death at MEI and AME, resulting in abortive female gametes. In the BL<i>3+5+</i>/BL comparison, 3,986, 749, and 370 genes were differentially expressed at MMC, MEI, and AME, respectively. Large numbers of cell wall modification and biotic and abiotic response genes were also induced at MMC but largely suppressed at MEI without inducing ER stress and programed cell death , producing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>e gametes. These results have general implications for the understanding of biological processes underlying reproductive barriers.</p>

Diagnosis and Treatment of Fetal Cardiac Disease
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>The goal of this statement is to review available literature and to put forth a scientific statement on the current practice of fetal cardiac medicine, including the diagnosis and management of fetal cardiovascular disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>A writing group appointed by the American Heart Association reviewed the available literature pertaining to topics relevant to fetal cardiac medicine, including the diagnosis of congenital heart disease and arrhythmias, assessment of cardiac function and the cardiovascular system, and available treatment options. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association classification of recommendations and level of evidence for practice guidelines were applied to the current practice of fetal cardiac medicine. Recommendations relating to the specifics of fetal diagnosis, including the timing of referral for study, indications for referral, and experience suggested for performance and interpretation of studies, are presented. The components of a fetal echocardiogram are described in detail, including descriptions of the assessment of cardiac anatomy, cardiac function, and rhythm. Complementary modalities for fetal cardiac assessment are reviewed, including the use of advanced ultrasound techniques, fetal magnetic resonance imaging, and fetal magnetocardiography and electrocardiography for rhythm assessment. Models for parental counseling and a discussion of parental stress and depression assessments are reviewed. Available fetal therapies, including medical management for arrhythmias or heart failure and closed or open intervention for diseases affecting the cardiovascular system such as twin–twin transfusion syndrome, lung masses, and vascular tumors, are highlighted. Catheter-based intervention strategies to prevent the progression of disease in utero are also discussed. Recommendations for delivery planning strategies for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fetus</span></strong>es with congenital heart disease including models based on classification of disease severity and delivery room treatment will be highlighted. Outcome assessment is reviewed to show the benefit of prenatal diagnosis and management as they affect outcome for babies with congenital heart disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Fetal cardiac medicine has evolved considerably over the past 2 decades, predominantly in response to advances in imaging technology and innovations in therapies. The diagnosis of cardiac disease in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fetus</span></strong> is mostly made with ultrasound; however, new technologies, including 3- and 4-dimensional echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and fetal electrocardiography and magnetocardiography, are available. Medical and interventional treatments for select diseases and strategies for delivery room care enable stabilization of high-risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fetus</span></strong>es and contribute to improved outcomes. This statement highlights what is currently known and recommended on the basis of evidence and experience in the rapidly advancing and highly specialized field of fetal cardiac care.</p></sec>

Staying slim during pregnancy carries a price
<p>Japan’s obsession with slender women may harm unborn children and create long-term health problems for the Japanese population. Already, one in five Japanese women is starting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pregnanc</span></strong>y underweight, and many scientists have criticized the country’s official guidelines for weight gain during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pregnanc</span></strong>y as too strict. Now, a new study shows that many pregnant women strive to keep their weight gain below even those targets. This combination of factors has produced an unusually high percentage of low weight births, which is likely the reason that the height of the average adult Japanese has declined every year for those born after 1980. The trend could create long-term health problems, scientists warn, and effect longevity. </p>

Rapid genome shrinkage in a self-fertile nematode reveals sperm competition proteins
<p>To reveal impacts of sexual mode on genome content, we compared chromosome-scale assemblies of the outcrossing nematode <i>Caenorhabditis nigoni</i> to its self-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>e sibling species, <i>C. briggsae</i>. <i>C. nigoni</i>’s genome resembles that of outcrossing relatives but encodes 31% more protein-coding genes than <i>C. briggsae</i>. <i>C. nigoni</i> genes lacking <i>C. briggsae</i> orthologs were disproportionately small and male-biased in expression. These include the <i>male secreted short </i>(<i>mss</i>) gene family, which encodes sperm surface glycoproteins conserved only in outcrossing species. Sperm from <i>mss</i>-null males of outcrossing <i>C. remanei</i> failed to compete with wild-type sperm, despite normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ity in noncompetitive mating. Restoring <i>mss</i> to <i>C. briggsae</i> males was sufficient to enhance sperm competitiveness. Thus, sex has a pervasive influence on genome content that can be used to identify sperm competition factors.</p>

ELABELA deficiency promotes preeclampsia and cardiovascular malformations in mice
<p>Preeclampsia (PE) is a gestational hypertensive syndrome affecting between 5 and 8% of all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pregnanc</span></strong>ies. Although PE is the leading cause of fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality, its molecular etiology is still unclear. Here, we show that ELABELA (ELA), an endogenous ligand of the apelin receptor (APLNR, or APJ), is a circulating hormone secreted by the placenta. <i>Elabela</i> but not <i>Apelin</i> knockout pregnant mice exhibit PE-like symptoms, including proteinuria and elevated blood pressure due to defective placental angiogenesis. In mice, infusion of exogenous ELA normalizes hypertension, proteinuria, and birth weight. ELA, which is abundant in human placentas, increases the invasiveness of trophoblast-like cells, suggesting that it enhances placental development to prevent PE. The ELA-APLNR signaling axis may offer a new paradigm for the treatment of common <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pregnanc</span></strong>y-related complications, including PE.</p>

Circulating peptide prevents preeclampsia
<p>Preeclampsia (PE) is a devastating complication of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pregnanc</span></strong>y that puts both mother and child at risk for clinical complications. In severe cases, PE can progress to multi-organ dysfunction and death. Characterized by hypertension (high blood pressure) and proteinuria (protein in the urine), the syndrome occurs in up to 8% of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pregnanc</span></strong>ies. Although it is widely accepted that the pathophysiology of PE involves disturbance of normal blood vessel function in the placenta and the development and function of the placenta, the exact mechanisms underlying PE have not been defined. Discovery of the causal mechanisms in PE is urgently needed so that early assessment of risk and therapeutic interventions can be developed. On page 707 of this issue, Ho <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) report breakthrough insights into the mechanisms of PE. They reveal a central role for ELABELA (ELA), a recently discovered circulating peptide ligand, in placental vascular development and PE in mice.</p>

Pioneering study images activity in fetal brains

<i>ESA1</i> Is Involved in Embryo Sac Abortion in Interspecific Hybrid Progeny of Rice
<p>The emergence of sterile individuals in the hybrid backcross progeny of wild and cultivated rice limits the use of wild rice alleles for improving cultivated rice, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this sterility remain unclear. Here, we identified the semisterile introgression line YIL42, derived from a cross between the <i>indica</i> rice variety Teqing (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and <i>Oryza rufipogon</i> accession YJCWR (Yuanjiang common wild rice), which exhibits semisterility. Using positional cloning, we isolated <i>EMBRYO SAC ABORTION 1</i> (<i>ESA1</i>), which encodes a nuclear-membrane localized protein containing an armadillo repeat domain. A mutation in <i>ESA1</i> at position 1819 (<sup>T</sup>1819<sup>C</sup>) converts a stop codon into an Arg (R) codon, causing delayed termination of protein translation. Analysis of transgenic lines indicated that the difference in ESA1 protein structure between <i>O. rufipogon</i>–derived <i>ESA1</i> and Teqing-derived <i>esa1</i> affects female gamete abortion during early mitosis. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ity investigation and expression analysis indicated that the interaction between <i>ESA1</i><sup>T1819</sup> and unknown gene(s) of Teqing affects spikelet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ity of the hybrid backcross progeny. The <i>ESA1</i><sup>T1819</sup> allele is present in <i>O. rufipogon</i> but absent in <i>O. sativa</i>, suggesting that variation in <i>ESA1</i> may be associated with interspecific hybrid incompatibility between wild and cultivated rice. Our findings provide insight into the molecular mechanism underlying female sterility, which is useful for improving the panicle seed setting rate of rice and for developing a strategy to overcome interspecific hybrid sterility between cultivated rice and wild rice.</p>

SMALL AUXIN UP RNA62/75 Are Required for the Translation of Transcripts Essential for Pollen Tube Growth
<p>Successful pollen tube elongation is critical for double <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization, but the biological functions of pollen tube genes and the regulatory machinery underlying this crucial process are largely unknown. A previous translatomic study revealed two Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>SAUR</i> (<i>SMALL AUXIN UP RNA</i>) genes, <i>SAUR62</i> and <i>SAUR75</i>, whose expression is up-regulated by pollination. Here, we found that both SAUR62 and SAUR75 localized mainly to pollen tube nuclei. The siliques of homozygous <i>saur62</i> (<i>saur62/−</i>), <i>saur75</i> (<i>saur75/−</i>), and the <i>SAUR62</i>/<i>75</i> RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown line had many aborted seeds. These lines had normal pollen viability but defective in vitro and in vivo pollen tube growth, with branching phenotypes. Immunoprecipitation with transgenic SAUR62/75-GFP flowers revealed ribosomal protein RPL12 family members as potential interacting partners, and their individual interactions were confirmed further by yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays. Polysome profiling showed reduced 80S ribosome abundance in homozygous <i>saur62</i>, <i>saur75</i>, <i>ribosomal large subunit12c</i>, and <i>SAUR62/75</i> RNAi flowers, suggesting that SAUR62/75 play roles in ribosome assembly. To clarify their roles in translation, we analyzed total proteins from RNAi versus wild-type flowers by isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation, revealing significantly reduced expression of factors participating in pollen tube wall biogenesis and F-actin dynamics, which are critical for the elastic properties of tube elongation. Indeed, RNAi pollen tubes showed mislocalization of deesterified and esterified pectins and F-actin organization. Thus, the biological roles of SAUR62/75 and their RPL12 partners are critical in ribosomal pre-60S subunit assembly for efficient pollen tube elongation and subsequent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization.</p>

FERTILIZATION-INDEPENDENT SEED-Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 Plays a Dual Role in Regulating Type I MADS-Box Genes in Early Endosperm Development
<p>Early endosperm development presents a unique system in which to uncover epigenetic regulatory mechanisms because the contributing maternal and paternal genomes possess differential epigenetic modifications. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the initiation of endosperm coenocytic growth upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization and the transition to endosperm cellularization are regulated by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>IZATION-INDEPENDENT SEED (FIS)-Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), a putative H3K27 methyltransferase. Here, we address the possible role of the FIS-PRC2 complex in regulating the type I MADS-box gene family, which has been shown previously to regulate early endosperm development. We show that a subclass of type I MADS-box genes (C2 genes) was expressed in distinct domains of the coenocytic endosperm in wild-type seeds. Furthermore, the C2 genes were mostly up-regulated biallelically during the extended coenocytic phase of endosperm development in the FIS-PRC2 mutant background. Using allele-specific expression analysis, we also identified a small subset of C2 genes subjected to FIS-PRC2-dependent maternal or FIS-PRC2-independent paternal imprinting. Our data support a dual role for the FIS-PRC2 complex in the regulation of C2 type I MADS-box genes, as evidenced by a generalized role in the repression of gene expression at both alleles associated with endosperm cellularization and a specialized role in silencing the maternal allele of imprinted genes.</p>

Improving Plant Nitrogen Use Efficiency through Alteration of Amino Acid Transport Processes
<p>Improving the efficiency of nitrogen (N) uptake and utilization in plants could potentially increase crop yields while reducing N <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization and, subsequently, environmental pollution. Within most plants, N is transported primarily as amino acids. In this study, pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) plants overexpressing <i>AMINO ACID PERMEASE1</i> (<i>AAP1</i>) were used to determine if and how genetic manipulation of amino acid transport from source to sink affects plant N use efficiency. The modified plants were grown under low, moderate, or high N <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization regimes. The results showed that, independent of the N nutrition, the engineered plants allocate more N via the vasculature to the shoot and seeds and produce more biomass and higher seed yields than wild-type plants. Dependent on the amount of N supplied, the <i>AAP1</i>-overexpressing plants displayed improved N uptake or utilization efficiency, or a combination of the two. They also showed significantly increased N use efficiency in N-deficient as well as in N-rich soils and, impressively, required half the amount of N to produce as many fruits and seeds as control plants. Together, these data support that engineering N allocation from source to sink presents an effective strategy to produce crop plants with improved productivity as well as N use efficiency in a range of N environments.</p>

Enhanced Secondary- and Hormone Metabolism in Leaves of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal <i>Medicago truncatula</i>
<p>Arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM) are the most common symbiotic associations between a plant’s root compartment and fungi. They provide nutritional benefit (mostly inorganic phosphate [P<sub>i</sub>]), leading to improved growth, and nonnutritional benefits, including defense responses to environmental cues throughout the host plant, which, in return, delivers carbohydrates to the symbiont. However, how transcriptional and metabolic changes occurring in leaves of AM plants differ from those induced by P<sub>i</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization is poorly understood. We investigated systemic changes in the leaves of mycorrhized <i>Medicago truncatula</i> in conditions with no improved P<sub>i</sub> status and compared them with those induced by high-P<sub>i</sub> treatment in nonmycorrhized plants. Microarray-based genome-wide profiling indicated up-regulation by mycorrhization of genes involved in flavonoid, terpenoid, jasmonic acid (JA), and abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis as well as enhanced expression of <i>MYC2</i>, the master regulator of JA-dependent responses. Accordingly, total anthocyanins and flavonoids increased, and most flavonoid species were enriched in AM leaves. Both the AM and P<sub>i</sub> treatments corepressed iron homeostasis genes, resulting in lower levels of available iron in leaves. In addition, higher levels of cytokinins were found in leaves of AM- and P<sub>i</sub>-treated plants, whereas the level of ABA was increased specifically in AM leaves. Foliar treatment of nonmycorrhized plants with either ABA or JA induced the up-regulation of <i>MYC2</i>, but only JA also induced the up-regulation of flavonoid and terpenoid biosynthetic genes. Based on these results, we propose that mycorrhization and P<sub>i</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization share cytokinin-mediated improved shoot growth, whereas enhanced ABA biosynthesis and JA-regulated flavonoid and terpenoid biosynthesis in leaves are specific to mycorrhization.</p>

MAP Kinase PrMPK9-1 Contributes to the Self-Incompatibility Response
<p>Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) form important signaling modules for a variety of cellular responses in eukaryotic cells. In plants, MAPKs play key roles in growth and development as well as in immunity/stress responses. Pollen-pistil interactions are critical early events regulating pollination and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization and involve many signaling events. Self-incompatibility (SI) is an important mechanism to prevent self-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization and inbreeding in higher plants and also is known to utilize signaling to achieve incompatible pollen rejection. Although several pollen-expressed MAPKs exist, very little is known about their function. We previously identified a pollen-expressed MAPK (p56) from <i>Papaver rhoeas</i> that was rapidly activated during SI; several studies implicated its role in signaling to SI-induced programmed cell death involving a DEVDase. However, to date, the identity of the MAPK involved has been unknown. Here, we have identified and cloned a pollen-expressed <i>P. rhoeas</i> threonine-aspartate-tyrosine (TDY) MAPK, <i>PrMPK9-1</i>. Rather few data relating to the function of TDY MAPKs in plants currently exist. We provide evidence that <i>PrMPK9-1</i> has a cell type-specific function, with a distinct role from <i>AtMPK9</i>. To our knowledge, this is the first study implicating a function for a TDY MAPK in pollen. We show that PrMPK9-1 corresponds to p56 and demonstrate that it is functionally involved in mediating SI in <i>P. rhoeas</i> pollen: PrMPK9-1 is a key regulator for SI in pollen and acts upstream of programmed cell death involving actin and activation of a DEVDase. Our study provides an important advance in elucidating functional roles for this class of MAPKs.</p>

MONENSIN SENSITIVITY1 (MON1)/CALCIUM CAFFEINE ZINC SENSITIVITY1 (CCZ1)-Mediated Rab7 Activation Regulates Tapetal Programmed Cell Death and Pollen Development
<p>Programmed cell death (PCD)-triggered degradation of plant tapetum is essential for microspore development and pollen coat formation; however, little is known about the cellular mechanism regulating tapetal PCD. Here, we demonstrate that Rab7-mediated vacuolar transport of tapetum degradation-related cysteine proteases is crucial for tapetal PCD and pollen development in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), with the following evidence: (1) The <i>monensin sensitivity1</i> (<i>mon1</i>) mutants, which are defective in Rab7 activation, showed impaired male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ity due to a combined defect in both tapetum and male gametophyte development. (2) In anthers, <i>MON1</i> showed preferential high level expression in tapetal cell layers and pollen. (3) The <i>mon1</i> mutants exhibited delayed tapetum degeneration and tapetal PCD, resulting in abnormal pollen coat formation and decreased male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ity. (4) MON1/CALCIUM CAFFEINE ZINC SENSITIVITY1 (CCZ1)-mediated Rab7 activation was indispensable for vacuolar trafficking of tapetum degradation-related cysteine proteases, supporting that PCD-triggered tapetum degeneration requires Rab7-mediated vacuolar trafficking of these cysteine proteases. (5) <i>MON1</i> mutations also resulted in defective pollen germination and tube growth. Taken together, tapetal PCD and pollen development require successful MON1/CCZ1-mediated vacuolar transport in Arabidopsis.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Cis-Regulatory Evolution of Forkhead Box O1 (FOXO1), a Terminal Selector Gene for Decidual Stromal Cell Identity
<p>Studies in human and mouse have shown that decidual stromal cells (DSC), which develop in the innermost lining of uterus, mediate placentation by regulating maternal immune response against the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fetus</span></strong> and the extent of fetal invasion. Investigating when and how DSC evolved is thus a key step to reconstructing the evolutionary history of mammalian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pregnanc</span></strong>y. We present molecular evidence placing the origin of DSC in the stem lineage of eutherians (extant placental mammals). The transcription factor forkhead box O1 (<i>FOXO1</i>) is a part of the core regulatory transcription factor complex (CoRC) that establishes the cell type identity of DSC. Decidualization, the process through which DSC differentiate from endometrial stromal fibroblasts, requires transcriptional upregulation of <i>FOXO1</i>. Contrary to other examples in mammals where gene recruitment is caused by the origin of an alternative promoter, FOXO1 is transcribed from the same promoter in DSC as in endometrial stromal fibroblasts. Comparing the activities of <i>FOXO1</i> promoters from human, mouse, manatee (Afrotheria), and opossum (marsupial) revealed that <i>FOXO1</i> promoter evolved responsiveness to decidualization signals in the stem lineage of eutherians. This eutherian vs. marsupial pattern of promoter activity was not observed in some other cell types expressing <i>FOXO1</i>, suggesting that this cis-regulatory evolution occurred specifically in the context of the origin of DSC. Sequence comparison revealed eutherian-specifically conserved nucleotides that contribute to the eutherian promoter activity. We conclude that the cis-regulatory activity of a terminal selector gene for decidual stromal cell identity evolved in the stem lineage of eutherians supporting a model where decidual cells are a eutherian innovation.</p>

Development of the GABA-ergic signaling system and its role in larval swimming in sea urchin
<p>The present study aimed to elucidate the development and γ-amino butyric acid (GABA)-ergic regulation of larval swimming in the sea urchin <i>Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus</i> by cloning glutamate decarboxylase (<i>Hp-gad</i>), GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor (<i>Hp-gabrA</i>) and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-associated protein (<i>Hp-gabarap</i>), and by performing immunohistochemistry. The regulation of larval swimming was increasingly dependent on the GABAergic system, which was active from the 2 days post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization (d.p.f.) pluteus stage onwards. GABA-immunoreactive cells were detected as a subpopulation of secondary mesenchyme cells during gastrulation and eventually constituted the ciliary band and a subpopulation of blastocoelar cells during the pluteus stage. <i>Hp-gad</i> transcription was detected by RT-PCR during the period when Hp-Gad-positive cells were seen as a subpopulation of blastocoelar cells and on the apical side of the ciliary band from the 2 d.p.f. pluteus stage. Consistent with these observations, inhibition of GAD with 3-mercaptopropioninc acid inhibited GABA immunoreactivity and larval swimming dose dependently. <i>Hp-gabrA</i> amplimers were detected weakly in un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ized eggs and 4 d.p.f. plutei but strongly from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ized eggs to 2 d.p.f. plutei, and Hp-GabrA, together with GABA, was localized at the ciliary band in association with dopamine receptor D1 from the two-arm pluteus stage. <i>Hp-gabarap</i> transcription and protein expression were detected from the swimming blastula stage. Inhibition of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor by bicuculline inhibited larval swimming dose dependently. Inhibition of larval swimming by either 3-mercaptopropionic acid or bicuculline was more severe in older larvae (17 and 34 d.p.f. plutei) than in younger ones (1 d.p.f. prism larvae).</p>

Lipocalin 2 binds to membrane phosphatidylethanolamine to induce lipid raft movement in a PKA-dependent manner and modulates sperm maturation
<p>Mammalian sperm undergo multiple maturation steps after leaving the testis in order to become competent for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain unclear. In terms of identifying factors crucial for these processes <i>in vivo</i>, we found that lipocalin 2 (<i>Lcn2</i>), which is known as an innate immune factor inhibiting bacterial and malarial growth, can modulate sperm maturation. Most sperm that migrated to the oviduct of wild-type females underwent lipid raft reorganization and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein shedding, which are signatures of sperm maturation, but few did so in <i>Lcn2</i> null mice. Furthermore, we found that LCN2 binds to membrane phosphatidylethanolamine to reinforce lipid raft reorganization via a PKA-dependent mechanism and promotes sperm to acquire <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ity by facilitating cholesterol efflux. These observations imply that mammals possess a mode for sperm maturation in addition to the albumin-mediated pathway.</p>

Preterm Delivery and Maternal Cardiovascular Disease in Young and Middle-Aged Adult Women
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Preterm delivery has been shown to be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), but it is unknown whether this risk remains after adjustment for pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pregnanc</span></strong>y lifestyle and CVD risk factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We examined the association between history of having delivered an infant preterm (<37 weeks) and CVD in 70 182 parous women in the Nurses’ Health Study II. Multivariable Cox proportional-hazards models were used to estimate hazards ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for CVD events (myocardial infarction and stroke, n=949); we also adjusted for intermediates to determine the proportion of the association between preterm and CVD accounted for by postpartum development of CVD risk factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>After adjusting for age, race, parental education, and pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pregnanc</span></strong>y lifestyle and CVD risk factors, preterm delivery in the first <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pregnanc</span></strong>y was associated with an increased risk of CVD (HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.16–1.72) in comparison with women with a term delivery (≥37 weeks) in the first <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pregnanc</span></strong>y. When preterm delivery was split into moderate preterm (≥32 to <37 weeks) and very preterm (<32 weeks), the HRs were 1.22 (95% CI, 0.96–1.54) and 2.01 (95% CI, 1.47–2.75), respectively. The increased rate of CVD in the very preterm group persisted even among women whose first <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pregnanc</span></strong>y was not complicated by hypertensive disorders of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pregnanc</span></strong>y (HR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.38–2.93). In comparison with women with at least 2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pregnanc</span></strong>ies, all of which were delivered at term, women with a preterm first birth and at least 1 later preterm birth had a HR of CVD of 1.65 (95% CI, 1.20–2.28). The association between moderate preterm first birth and CVD was accounted for in part by the development of postpartum chronic hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and changes in body mass index (proportion accounted for, 14.5%; 95% CI, 4.0–41.1), as was the very-preterm-CVD relationship (13.1%; 95% CI, 9.0–18.7).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Preterm delivery is independently predictive of CVD and may be useful for CVD prevention efforts.

Structure-Activity Relation of AMOR Sugar Molecule That Activates Pollen-Tubes for Ovular Guidance
<p>Successful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization in flowering plants depends on the precise directional growth control of pollen tube through the female pistil tissue toward the female gametophyte contained in the ovule for delivery of nonmotile sperm cells. Cys-rich peptides LUREs secreted from the synergid cells on either side of the egg cell act as ovular attractants of pollen tubes. Competency control by the pistil is crucial for the response of pollen tubes to these ovular attractants. We recently reported that ovular 4-<i>O</i>-methyl-glucuronosyl arabinogalactan (AMOR) induces competency of the pollen tube to respond to ovular attractant LURE peptides in <i>Torenia fournieri.</i> The beta isomer of the terminal disaccharide 4-<i>O</i>-methyl-glucuronosyl galactose was essential and sufficient for the competency induction. However, critical and noncritical structures in the disaccharide have not been dissected deeply. Herein, we report the synthesis of new AMOR analogs and the structure-activity relationships for AMOR activity in the presence of these synthesized analogs. Removal of 4-<i>O</i>-methyl group or –COOH from the glucuronosyl residue of the disaccharide dramatically reduces AMOR activity. The pyranose backbone of the second sugar of disaccharide is essential for the activity but not hydroxy groups. The role of beta isomer of the disaccharide 4-Me-GlcA-β(1,6)-Gal is very specific for competency control, as there was no difference in effect among the sugar analogs tested for pollen germination. This study represents the first structure-activity relationship study, to our knowledge, of a sugar molecule involved in plant reproduction, which opens a way for modification of the molecule without loss of activity.</p>

KNS4/UPEX1: A Type II Arabinogalactan <i>β</i>-(1,3)-Galactosyltransferase Required for Pollen Exine Development
<p>Pollen exine is essential for protection from the environment of the male gametes of seed-producing plants, but its assembly and composition remain poorly understood. We previously characterized Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis</i> <i>thaliana</i>) mutants with abnormal pollen exine structure and morphology that we named <i>kaonashi</i> (<i>kns</i>). Here we describe the identification of the causal gene of <i>kns4</i> that was found to be a member of the CAZy glycosyltransferase 31 gene family, identical to <i>UNEVEN PATTERN OF EXINE1</i>, and the biochemical characterization of the encoded protein. The characteristic exine phenotype in the <i>kns4</i> mutant is related to an abnormality of the primexine matrix laid on the surface of developing microspores. Using light microscopy with a combination of type II arabinogalactan (AG) antibodies and staining with the arabinogalactan-protein (AGP)-specific β-Glc Yariv reagent, we show that the levels of AGPs in the <i>kns4</i> microspore primexine are considerably diminished, and their location differs from that of wild type, as does the distribution of pectin labeling. Furthermore, <i>kns4</i> mutants exhibit reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ity as indicated by shorter fruit lengths and lower seed set compared to the wild type, confirming that KNS4 is critical for pollen viability and development. KNS4 was heterologously expressed in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>, and was shown to possess β-(1,3)-galactosyltransferase activity responsible for the synthesis of AG glycans that are present on both AGPs and/or the pectic polysaccharide rhamnogalacturonan I. These data demonstrate that defects in AGP/pectic glycans, caused by disruption of <i>KNS4</i> function, impact pollen development and viability in Arabidopsis.</p>

The Genetic Control of Reproductive Development under High Ambient Temperature<xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>Ambient temperature has a large impact on reproductive development and grain yield in temperate cereals. However, little is known about the genetic control of development under different ambient temperatures. Here, we demonstrate that in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), high ambient temperatures accelerate or delay reproductive development depending on the photoperiod response gene <i>PHOTOPERIOD1</i> (<i>Ppd-H1</i>) and its upstream regulator <i>EARLY FLOWERING3</i> (<i>HvELF3</i>). A natural mutation in <i>Ppd-H1</i> prevalent in spring barley delayed floral development and reduced the number of florets and seeds per spike, while the wild-type <i>Ppd-H1</i> or a mutant <i>Hvelf3</i> allele accelerated floral development and maintained the seed number under high ambient temperatures. High ambient temperature delayed the expression phase and reduced the amplitude of clock genes and repressed the floral integrator gene <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T1</i> independently of the genotype. <i>Ppd-H1</i>-dependent variation in flowering time under different ambient temperatures correlated with relative expression levels of the <i>BARLEY MADS</i>-box genes <i>VERNALIZATION1</i> (<i>HvVRN1</i>), <i>HvBM3</i>, and <i>HvBM8</i> in the leaf. Finally, we show that <i>Ppd-H1</i> interacts with regulatory variation at <i>HvVRN1. Ppd-H1</i> only accelerated floral development in the background of a spring <i>HvVRN1</i> allele with a deletion in the regulatory intron. The full-length winter <i>Hvvrn1</i> allele was strongly down-regulated, and flowering was delayed by high temperatures irrespective of <i>Ppd-H1</i>. Our findings demonstrate that the photoperiodic and vernalization pathways interact to control flowering time and floret <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ity in response to ambient temperature in barley.</p>

SUPPRESSOR OF FRIGIDA (SUF4) Supports Gamete Fusion via Regulating Arabidopsis <i>EC1</i> Gene Expression
<p>The <i>EGG CELL1</i> (<i>EC1</i>) gene family of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) comprises five members that are specifically expressed in the egg cell and redundantly control gamete fusion during double <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization. We investigated the activity of all five <i>EC1</i> promoters in promoter-deletion studies and identified SUF4 (SUPPRESSOR OF FRIGIDA4), a C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> transcription factor, as a direct regulator of the <i>EC1</i> gene expression. In particular, we demonstrated that SUF4 binds to all five Arabidopsis <i>EC1</i> promoters, thus regulating their expression. The down-regulation of <i>SUF4</i> in homozygous <i>suf4-1</i> ovules results in reduced <i>EC1</i> expression and delayed sperm fusion, which can be rescued by expressing SUF4-β-glucuronidase under the control of the <i>SUF4</i> promoter. To identify more gene products able to regulate <i>EC1</i> expression together with SUF4, we performed coexpression studies that led to the identification of <i>MOM1</i> (<i>MORPHEUS’ MOLECULE1</i>), a component of a silencing mechanism that is independent of DNA methylation marks. In <i>mom1-3</i> ovules, both <i>SUF4</i> and <i>EC1</i> genes are down-regulated, and <i>EC1</i> genes show higher levels of histone 3 lysine-9 acetylation, suggesting that MOM1 contributes to the regulation of <i>SUF4</i> and <i>EC1</i> gene expression.</p>

IRREGULAR POLLEN EXINE1 Is a Novel Factor in Anther Cuticle and Pollen Exine Formation
<p>Anther cuticle and pollen exine are protective barriers for pollen development and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization. Despite that several regulators have been identified for anther cuticle and pollen exine development in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), few genes have been characterized in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) and the underlying regulatory mechanism remains elusive. Here, we report a novel male-sterile mutant in maize, <i>irregular pollen exine1</i> (<i>ipe1</i>), which exhibited a glossy outer anther surface, abnormal Ubisch bodies, and defective pollen exine. Using map-based cloning, the <i>IPE1</i> gene was isolated as a putative glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum. Transcripts of <i>IPE1</i> were preferentially accumulated in the tapetum during the tetrad and early uninucleate microspore stage. A biochemical assay indicated that <i>ipe1</i> anthers had altered constituents of wax and a significant reduction of cutin monomers and fatty acids. RNA sequencing data revealed that genes implicated in wax and flavonoid metabolism, fatty acid synthesis, and elongation were differentially expressed in <i>ipe1</i> mutant anthers. In addition, the analysis of transfer DNA insertional lines of the orthologous gene in Arabidopsis suggested that IPE1 and their orthologs have a partially conserved function in male organ development. Our results showed that IPE1 participates in the putative oxidative pathway of C16/C18 ω-hydroxy fatty acids and controls anther cuticle and pollen exine development together with MALE STERILITY26 and MALE STERILITY45 in maize.</p>

Rapid Functional and Sequence Differentiation of a Tandemly Repeated Species-Specific Multigene Family in <i>Drosophila</i>
<p>Gene clusters of recently duplicated genes are hotbeds for evolutionary change. However, our understanding of how mutational mechanisms and evolutionary forces shape the structural and functional evolution of these clusters is hindered by the high sequence identity among the copies, which typically results in their inaccurate representation in genome assemblies. The presumed testis-specific, chimeric gene <i>Sdic</i> originated, and tandemly expanded in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, contributing to increased male-male competition. Using various types of massively parallel sequencing data, we studied the organization, sequence evolution, and functional attributes of the different <i>Sdic</i> copies. By leveraging long-read sequencing data, we uncovered both copy number and order differences from the currently accepted annotation for the <i>Sdic</i> region. Despite evidence for pervasive gene conversion affecting the <i>Sdic</i> copies, we also detected signatures of two episodes of diversifying selection, which have contributed to the evolution of a variety of C-termini and miRNA binding site compositions. Expression analyses involving RNA-seq datasets from 59 different biological conditions revealed distinctive expression breadths among the copies, with three copies being transcribed in females, opening the possibility to a sexually antagonistic effect. Phenotypic assays using <i>Sdic</i> knock-out strains indicated that should this antagonistic effect exist, it does not compromise female <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ity. Our results strongly suggest that the genome consolidation of the <i>Sdic</i> gene cluster is more the result of a quick exploration of different paths of molecular tinkering by different copies than a mere dosage increase, which could be a recurrent evolutionary outcome in the presence of persistent sexual selection.</p>

Increased homeothermy during reproduction in a basal placental mammal
<p>Homeothermic endothermy, the maintenance of a high and stable body temperature (<i>T</i><sub>b</sub>) using heat produced by elevated metabolism, is energetically expensive. There is increasing evidence that the earliest endotherms were heterotherms that, rather than maintaining strict homeothermy, allowed <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> to fluctuate with large variations between active and rest-phase <i>T</i><sub>b</sub>. The high level of homeothermy observed in modern mammals is therefore likely to have evolved from an ancestral heterothermic state. One of the hypotheses for the evolution of endothermy is that homeothermy allows for greater energetic output during reproduction (parental care model). We tested this hypothesis by measuring metabolic rates over a range of ambient temperatures in both reproductive and non-reproductive greater hedgehog tenrecs (<i>Setifer setosus</i>), a physiologically primitive mammal from Madagascar. Tenrecs have some of the lowest metabolic rates and highest levels of <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> variability of any mammal and are therefore good models of the ancestral eutherian state. During <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pregnanc</span></strong>y and lactation, there was an increase in metabolism and <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> below the thermoneutral zone, accompanied by a decrease in <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> variability. The lower critical limit of the thermoneutral zone was estimated at ~25°C. However, whereas increases in resting metabolism were substantial below 20°C (up to 150% higher during reproduction), daytime rest-phase ambient temperatures at the study site rarely reached equivalent low levels. Thus, <i>S. setosus</i> provide an example for how relatively low-cost increases in homeothermy could have led to substantial increases in fitness by allowing for the faster production of young. The mechanisms necessary for increases in thermogenesis during reproduction would have further benefited the development of homeothermy in mammals.</p>

A novel mouse model of Warburg Micro syndrome reveals roles for RAB18 in eye development and organisation of the neuronal cytoskeleton
<p>Mutations in <i>RAB18</i> have been shown to cause the heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorder Warburg Micro syndrome (WARBM). Individuals with WARBM present with a range of clinical symptoms, including ocular and neurological abnormalities. However, the underlying cellular and molecular pathogenesis of the disorder remains unclear, largely owing to the lack of any robust animal models that phenocopy both the ocular and neurological features of the disease. We report here the generation and characterisation of a novel <i>Rab18</i>-mutant mouse model of WARBM. <i>Rab18</i>-mutant mice are viable and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>e. They present with congenital nuclear cataracts and atonic pupils, recapitulating the characteristic ocular features that are associated with WARBM. Additionally, <i>Rab18</i>-mutant cells exhibit an increase in lipid droplet size following treatment with oleic acid. Lipid droplet abnormalities are a characteristic feature of cells taken from WARBM individuals, as well as cells taken from individuals with other neurodegenerative conditions. Neurological dysfunction is also apparent in <i>Rab18</i>-mutant mice, including progressive weakness of the hind limbs. We show that the neurological defects are, most likely, not caused by gross perturbations in synaptic vesicle recycling in the central or peripheral nervous system. Rather, loss of <i>Rab18</i> is associated with widespread disruption of the neuronal cytoskeleton, including abnormal accumulations of neurofilament and microtubule proteins in synaptic terminals, and gross disorganisation of the cytoskeleton in peripheral nerves. Global proteomic profiling of peripheral nerves in <i>Rab18</i>-mutant mice reveals significant alterations in several core molecular pathways that regulate cytoskeletal dynamics in neurons. The apparent similarities between the WARBM phenotype and the phenotype that we describe here indicate that the <i>Rab18</i>-mutant mouse provides an important platform for investigation of the disease pathogenesis and therapeutic interventions.</p>

Phenotypic rescue of a <i>Drosophila</i> model of mitochondrial ANT1 disease
<p>A point mutation in the <i>Drosophila</i> gene that codes for the major adult isoform of adenine nuclear translocase (ANT) represents a model for human diseases that are associated with ANT insufficiency [<i>stress-sensitive B<sup>1</sup></i> (<i>sesB<sup>1</sup></i>)]. We characterized the organismal, bioenergetic and molecular phenotype of <i>sesB<sup>1</sup></i> flies then tested strategies to compensate the mutant phenotype. In addition to developmental delay and mechanical-stress-induced seizures, <i>sesB<sup>1</sup></i> flies have an impaired response to sound, defective male courtship, female sterility and curtailed lifespan. These phenotypes, excluding the latter two, are shared with the mitoribosomal protein S12 mutant, <i>tko<sup>25t</sup></i>. Mitochondria from <i>sesB<sup>1</sup></i> adults showed a decreased respiratory control ratio and downregulation of cytochrome oxidase. <i>sesB<sup>1</sup></i> adults exhibited ATP depletion, lactate accumulation and changes in gene expression that were consistent with a metabolic shift towards glycolysis, characterized by activation of lactate dehydrogenase and anaplerotic pathways. Females also showed downregulation of many genes that are required for oogenesis, and their eggs, although <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ized, failed to develop to the larval stages. The <i>sesB<sup>1</sup></i> phenotypes of developmental delay and mechanical-stress-induced seizures were alleviated by an altered mitochondrial DNA background. Female sterility was substantially rescued by somatic expression of alternative oxidase (AOX) from the sea squirt <i>Ciona intestinalis</i>, whereas AOX did not alleviate developmental delay. Our findings illustrate the potential of different therapeutic strategies for ANT-linked diseases, based on alleviating metabolic stress.</p>

Axon degeneration and PGC-1α-mediated protection in a zebrafish model of α-synuclein toxicity
<p>α-synuclein (aSyn) expression is implicated in neurodegenerative processes, including Parkinson’s disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). In animal models of these diseases, axon pathology often precedes cell death, raising the question of whether aSyn has compartment-specific toxic effects that could require early and/or independent therapeutic intervention. The relevance of axonal pathology to degeneration can only be addressed through longitudinal, <i>in vivo</i> monitoring of different neuronal compartments. With current imaging methods, dopaminergic neurons do not readily lend themselves to such a task in any vertebrate system. We therefore expressed human wild-type aSyn in zebrafish peripheral sensory neurons, which project elaborate superficial axons that can be continuously imaged <i>in vivo</i>. Axonal outgrowth was normal in these neurons but, by 2 days post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization (dpf), many aSyn-expressing axons became dystrophic, with focal varicosities or diffuse beading. Approximately 20% of aSyn-expressing cells died by 3 dpf. Time-lapse imaging revealed that focal axonal swelling, but not overt fragmentation, usually preceded cell death. Co-expressing aSyn with a mitochondrial reporter revealed deficits in mitochondrial transport and morphology even when axons appeared overtly normal. The axon-protective protein Wallerian degeneration slow (WldS) delayed axon degeneration but not cell death caused by aSyn. By contrast, the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α, which has roles in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and reactive-oxygen-species detoxification, abrogated aSyn toxicity in both the axon and the cell body. The rapid onset of axonal pathology in this system, and the relatively moderate degree of cell death, provide a new model for the study of aSyn toxicity and protection. Moreover, the accessibility of peripheral sensory axons will allow effects of aSyn to be studied in different neuronal compartments and might have utility in screening for novel disease-modifying compounds.</p>

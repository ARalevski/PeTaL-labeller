Long-term outcomes of cemented <i>versus</i> cementless humeral components in arthroplasty of the shoulder
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>In the initial development of total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA),   the humeral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent was usually fixed with cement. Cementless   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents were subsequently introduced. The aim of this study was   to compare the long-term outcome of cemented and cementless humeral   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents in arthroplasty of the shoulder.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>All patients who underwent primary arthroplasty of the shoulder   at our institution between 1970 and 2012 were included in the study.   There were 4636 patients with 1167 cemented humeral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents and   3469 cementless <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents. Patients with the two types of fixation   were matched for nine different covariates using a propensity score   analysis. A total of 551 well-balanced pairs of patients with cemented   and cementless <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents were available after matching for comparison   of the outcomes. The clinical outcomes which were analysed included loosening   of the humeral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent determined at revision surgery, periprosthetic   fractures, post-operative infection and operating time.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The overall five-, ten-, 15- and 20-year rates of survival were   98.9%, 97.2%, 95.5%, and 94.4%, respectively. Survival without loosening   at 20 years was 98% for cemented <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents and 92.4% for cementless   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents. After propensity score matching including fixation as   determined by the design of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent, humeral loosening was   also found to be significantly higher in the cementless group. Survival   without humeral loosening at 20 years was 98.7% for cemented <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents   and 91.0% for cementless <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents. There was no significant difference   in the risk of intra- or post-operative fracture. The rate of survival   without deep infection and the mean operating time were significantly   higher in the cemented group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Both types of fixation give rates of long-term survival of >   90%. Cemented <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents have better rates of survival without loosening   but this should be weighed against increased operating time and   the risk of bony destruction of the proximal humerus at the time   of revision of a cemented humeral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:666–73.</p></sec>

Fixation and clinical outcome of uncemented peri-apatite-coated <i>versus</i> cemented total knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The optimal method of tibial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent fixation remains uncertain   in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Hydroxyapatite coatings have been   applied to improve bone ingrowth in uncemented designs, but may   only coat the directly accessible surface. As peri-apatite (PA)   is solution deposited, this may increase the coverage of the implant   surface and thereby fixation. We assessed the tibial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent fixation   of uncemented PA-coated TKAs <i>versus</i> cemented TKAs.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Patients were randomised to PA-coated or cemented TKAs. In 60   patients (30 in each group), radiostereometric analysis of tibial   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent migration was evaluated as the primary outcome at baseline,   three months post-operatively and at one, two and five years. A   linear mixed-effects model was used to analyse the repeated measurements.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>After five years of follow-up, one (cemented) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent was revised   due to ligament instability. Overall, uncemented PA-coated tibial   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents migrated significantly more    (p = 0.003), with the mean maximum total point motion (MTPM) at   five years being 0.62 mm (95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.49 to   0.76) for cemented tibial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents and 0.97 mm (95% CI 0.81 to   1.15) for PA-coated tibial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents in TKA. However, between three   months and five years the cemented TKAs migrated significantly more   (p = 0.02), displaying a MTPM of 0.27 mm (95% CI, 0.19 to 0.36) <i>versus</i> 0.13   mm (95% CI, 0.01 to 0.25) for PA-coated tibial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents. One implant   in each group was considered at risk for aseptic loosening due to continuous   migration after five years of follow-up, albeit with different migration   patterns for each group (i.e. higher initial migration but diminishing   over time for the PA-coated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent <i>versus</i> gradually   increasing migration for the cemented <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The tibial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents of PA-coated TKAs showed more overall migration   compared with the tibial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents of cemented TKAs. However, <i>post   hoc</i> analysis showed that this difference was caused by   higher migration of PA-coated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents in the first three months,   after which a stable migration pattern was observed.

Proximal translation of > 1 mm within the first two years of revision total hip arthroplasty correctly predicts whether or not an acetabular component is loose in 80% of cases
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The purpose of this study was to determine the sensitivity, specificity   and predictive values of previously reported thresholds of proximal   translation and sagittal rotation of cementless acetabular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents   used for revision total hip arthroplasty (THA) at various times   during early follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Migration of cementless acetabular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents was measured retrospectively   in 84 patients (94 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents) using Ein-Bild-Rontgen-Analyse (EBRA-Cup)   in two groups of patients. In Group A, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents were recorded   as not being loose intra-operatively at re-revision THA (52 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents/48   patients) and Group B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents were recorded to be loose at re-revision   (42 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents/36 patients).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean proximal translation and sagittal rotation were significantly   higher in Group B than in Group A from three months onwards (p <   0.02). Proximal translation > 1.0 mm within 24 months had a positive   predictive value (PPV) of 90% and a specificity of 94%, but a sensitivity   of 64%. Proximal translation > 1.0 mm within the first 24 months correctly   identified 76 of 94 (81%) of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents to be either loose or not   loose.

Extra strengthening and work hardening in gradient nanotwinned metals
<p>Gradient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es exist ubiquitously in nature and are increasingly being introduced in engineering. However, understanding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al gradient–related mechanical behaviors in all gradient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es, including those in engineering materials, has been challenging. We explored the mechanical performance of a gradient nanotwinned <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e with highly tunable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al gradients in pure copper. A large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al gradient allows for superior work hardening and strength that can exceed those of the strongest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent of the gradient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e. We found through systematic experiments and atomistic simulations that this unusual behavior is afforded by a unique patterning of ultrahigh densities of dislocations in the grain interiors. These observations not only shed light on gradient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es, but may also indicate a promising route for improving the mechanical properties of materials through gradient design.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
A Family of NAI2-Interacting Proteins in the Biogenesis of the ER Body and Related Structures
<p>Plants produce different types of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived vesicles that accumulate and transport proteins, lipids, and metabolites. In the Brassicales, a distinct ER-derived <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e called the ER body is found throughout the epidermis of cotyledons, hypocotyls, and roots. NAI2 is a key factor for ER body formation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Homologs of NAI2 are found only in the Brassicales and therefore may have evolved specifically to enable ER body formation. Here, we report that three related Arabidopsis NAI2-interacting proteins (NAIP1, NAIP2, and NAIP3) play a critical role in the biogenesis of ER bodies and related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es. Analysis using GFP fusions revealed that all three NAIPs are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents of the ER bodies found in the cotyledons, hypocotyls, and roots. Genetic analysis with <i>naip</i> mutants indicates that they have a critical and redundant role in ER body formation. NAIP2 and NAIP3 are also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents of other vesicular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es likely derived from the ER that are formed independent of NAI2 and are present not only in the cotyledons, hypocotyls, and roots, but also in the rosettes. Thus, while NAIP1 is a specialized ER body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent, NAIP2 and NAIP3 are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents of different types of ER-derived <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es. Analysis of chimeric NAIP proteins revealed that their N-terminal domains play a major role in the functional specialization between NAIP1 and NAIP3. Unlike NAI2, NAIPs have homologs in all plants; therefore, NAIP-containing ER <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es, from which the ER bodies in the Brassicales may have evolved, are likely to be present widely in plants.</p>

Radiographic scoring system for the evaluation of stability of cementless acetabular components in the presence of osteolysis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The stability of cementless acetabular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents is an important   factor for surgical planning in the treatment of patients with pelvic   osteolysis after total hip arthroplasty (THA). However, the methods   for determining the stability of the acetabular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent from pre-operative   radiographs remain controversial. Our aim was to develop a scoring   system to help in the assessment of the stability of the acetabular   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent under these circumstances.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The new scoring system is based on the mechanism of failure of   these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents and the location of the osteolytic lesion, according   to the DeLee and Charnley classification. Each zone is evaluated   and scored separately. The sum of the individual scores from the   three zones is reported as a total score with a maximum of 10 points.   The study involved 96 revision procedures which were undertaken   for wear or osteolysis in 91 patients between July 2002 and December   2012. Pre-operative anteroposterior pelvic radiographs and Judet   views were reviewed. The stability of the acetabular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent was   confirmed intra-operatively.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Intra-operatively, it was found that 64 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents were well-fixed   and 32 were loose. Mean total scores in the well-fixed and loose   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents were 2.9 (0 to 7) and 7.2 (1 to 10), respectively (p   < 0.001). In hips with a low score (0 to 2), the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent was   only loose in one of 33 hips (3%). The incidence of loosening increased   with increasing scores: in those with scores of 3 and 4, two of   19 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents (10.5%) were loose; in hips with scores of 5 and 6, eight   of 19 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents (44.5%) were loose; in hips with scores of 7 or   8, 13 of 17 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents (70.6%) were loose; and for hips with scores   of 9 and 10, nine of nine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents (100%) were loose. Receiver-operating-characteristic curve   analysis demonstrated very good accuracy (area under the curve =   0.90, p < 0.001).

The apo-structure of the leucine sensor Sestrin2 is still elusive
<p>Sestrin2 is a GATOR2-interacting protein that directly binds leucine and is required for the inhibition of mTORC1 under leucine deprivation, indicating that it is a leucine sensor for the mTORC1 pathway. We recently reported the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of Sestrin2 in complex with leucine [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID, 5DJ4] and demonstrated that mutations in the leucine-binding pocket that alter the affinity of Sestrin2 for leucine result in a corresponding change in the leucine sensitivity of mTORC1 in cells. A lower resolution <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of human Sestrin2 (PDB ID, 5CUF), which was crystallized in the absence of exogenous leucine, showed Sestrin2 to be in a nearly identical conformation as the leucine-bound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e. On the basis of this observation, it has been argued that leucine binding does not affect the conformation of Sestrin2 and that Sestrin2 may not be a sensor for leucine. We show that simple analysis of the reported “apo”-Sestrin2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e reveals the clear presence of prominent, unmodeled electron density in the leucine-binding pocket that exactly accommodates the leucine observed in the higher resolution <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e. Refining the reported apo-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e with leucine eliminated the large <i>F</i><sub>obs</sub>-<i>F</i><sub>calc</sub> difference density at this position and improved the working and free R factors of the model. Consistent with this result, our own <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of Sestrin2 crystallized in the absence of exogenous leucine also contained electron density that is best explained by leucine. Thus, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of apo-Sestrin2 remains elusive.</p>

Comprehensive computational design of ordered peptide macrocycles
<p>Mixed-chirality peptide macrocycles such as cyclosporine are among the most potent therapeutics identified to date, but there is currently no way to systematically search the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al space spanned by such compounds. Natural proteins do not provide a useful guide: Peptide macrocycles lack regular secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es and hydrophobic cores, and can contain local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es not accessible with <sc>l</sc>-amino acids. Here, we enumerate the stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es that can be adopted by macrocyclic peptides composed of <sc>l</sc>- and <sc>d</sc>-amino acids by near-exhaustive backbone sampling followed by sequence design and energy landscape calculations. We identify more than 200 designs predicted to fold into single stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es, many times more than the number of currently available unbound peptide macrocycle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es. Nuclear magnetic resonance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es of 9 of 12 designed 7- to 10-residue macrocycles, and three 11- to 14-residue bicyclic designs, are close to the computational models. Our results provide a nearly complete coverage of the rich space of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es possible for short peptide macrocycles and vastly increase the available starting scaffolds for both rational drug design and library selection methods.</p>

D<sub>4</sub> dopamine receptor high-resolution structures enable the discovery of selective agonists
<p>Dopamine receptors are implicated in the pathogenesis and treatment of nearly every neuropsychiatric disorder. Although thousands of drugs interact with these receptors, our molecular understanding of dopaminergic drug selectivity and design remains clouded. To illuminate dopamine receptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e, function, and ligand recognition, we determined crystal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es of the D<sub>4</sub> dopamine receptor in its inactive state bound to the antipsychotic drug nemonapride, with resolutions up to 1.95 angstroms. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es suggest a mechanism for the control of constitutive signaling, and their unusually high resolution enabled a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e-based campaign for new agonists of the D<sub>4</sub> dopamine receptor. The ability to efficiently exploit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e for specific probe discovery—rapidly moving from elucidating receptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e to discovering previously unrecognized, selective agonists—testifies to the power of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e-based approaches.</p>

Unequivocal determination of complex molecular structures using anisotropic NMR measurements
<p>Assignment of complex molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data can be prone to interpretational mistakes. Residual dipolar couplings and residual chemical shift anisotropy provide a spatial view of the relative orientations between bonds and chemical shielding tensors, respectively, regardless of separation. Consequently, these data constitute a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reliabl</span></strong>e reporter of global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al validity. Anisotropic NMR parameters can be used to evaluate investigators’ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e proposals or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es generated by computer-assisted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e elucidation. Application of the method to several complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e assignment problems shows promising results that signal a potential paradigm shift from conventional NMR data interpretation, which may be of particular utility for compounds not amenable to x-ray crystallography.</p>

Protein structure determination using metagenome sequence data
<p>Despite decades of work by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al biologists, there are still ~5200 protein families with unknown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e outside the range of comparative modeling. We show that Rosetta <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e prediction guided by residue-residue contacts inferred from evolutionary information can accurately model proteins that belong to large families and that metagenome sequence data more than triple the number of protein families with sufficient sequences for accurate modeling. We then integrate metagenome data, contact-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e matching, and Rosetta <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e calculations to generate models for 614 protein families with currently unknown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es; 206 are membrane proteins and 137 have folds not represented in the Protein Data Bank. This approach provides the representative models for large protein families originally envisioned as the goal of the Protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e Initiative at a fraction of the cost.</p>

Promising early results for trabecular metal acetabular components used at revision total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of aseptic   loosening after the use of a cemented acetabular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent and a   Trabecular Metal (TM) acetabular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent (Zimmer Inc., Warsaw,   Indiana) at acetabular revision with bone impaction grafting.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 42 patients were included in the study.

Contemporary failure aetiologies of the primary, posterior-stabilised total knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The number of revision total knee arthroplasties (TKA) that are   performed is expected to increase. However, previous reports of   the causes of failure after TKA are limited in that they report   the causes at specific institutions, which are often dependent on   referral patterns. Our aim was to report the most common indications   for re-operations and revisions in a large series of posterior-stabilised   TKAs undertaken at a single institution, excluding referrals from   elsewhere, which may bias the causes of failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 5098 TKAs which were undertaken between 2000 and 2012   were included in the study. Re-operations, revisions with modular   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent exchange, and revisions with non-modular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent replacement   or removal were identified from the medical records. The mean follow-up   was five years (two to 12).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The Kaplan-Meier ten-year survival without a re-operation, modular   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent revision and non-modular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent revision was 95.7%,   99.3% and 95.3%, respectively. The most common indications for a   re-operation were: post-operative stiffness (58%), delayed wound healing   (21%), and patellar clunk (11%). The indications for isolated modular   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent revision were acute periprosthetic joint infection (PJI)   (64%) and instability (36%). The most common indications for non-modular   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent revision were chronic PJI (52%), aseptic loosening (17%), periprosthetic   fracture (10%), and instability (10%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Post-operative stiffness remains the most common indication for   re-operation after TKA.

Custom-made total ankle arthroplasty for the salvage of major talar bone loss
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>A failed total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) is often associated with   much bone loss. As an alternative to arthrodesis, the surgeon may   consider a custom-made talar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent to compensate for the bone   loss. Our aim in this study was to assess the functional and radiological   outcome after the use of such a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent at mid- to long-term follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 12 patients (five women and seven men, mean age 53   years; 36 to77) with a failed TAA and a large talar defect underwent   a revision procedure using a custom-made talar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent. The design   of the custom-made <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents was based on CT scans and standard   radiographs, when compared with the contralateral ankle.

High-Resolution Mapping of Chromatin Conformation in Cardiac Myocytes Reveals Structural Remodeling of the Epigenome in Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiovascular disease is associated with epigenomic changes in the heart; however, the endogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of cardiac myocyte chromatin has never been determined.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To investigate the mechanisms of epigenomic function in the heart, genome-wide chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) and DNA sequencing were performed in adult cardiac myocytes following development of pressure overload–induced hypertrophy. Mice with cardiac-specific deletion of CTCF (a ubiquitous chromatin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al protein) were generated to explore the role of this protein in chromatin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e and cardiac phenotype. Transcriptome analyses by RNA-seq were conducted as a functional readout of the epigenomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al changes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Depletion of CTCF was sufficient to induce heart failure in mice, and human patients with heart failure receiving mechanical unloading via left ventricular assist devices show increased CTCF abundance. Chromatin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al analyses revealed interactions within the cardiac myocyte genome at 5-kb resolution, enabling examination of intra- and interchromosomal events, and providing a resource for future cardiac epigenomic investigations. Pressure overload or CTCF depletion selectively altered boundary strength between topologically associating domains and A/B compartmentalization, measurements of genome accessibility. Heart failure involved decreased stability of chromatin interactions around disease-causing genes. In addition, pressure overload or CTCF depletion remodeled long-range interactions of cardiac enhancers, resulting in a significant decrease in local chromatin interactions around these functional elements.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These findings provide a high-resolution chromatin architecture resource for cardiac epigenomic investigations and demonstrate that global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al remodeling of chromatin underpins heart failure. The newly identified principles of endogenous chromatin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e have key implications for epigenetic therapy.</p></sec>

Three-dimensional genome structures of single diploid human cells
<p>Three-dimensional genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es play a key role in gene regulation and cell functions. Characterization of genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es necessitates single-cell measurements. This has been achieved for haploid cells but has remained a challenge for diploid cells. We developed a single-cell chromatin conformation capture method, termed Dip-C, that combines a transposon-based whole-genome amplification method to detect many chromatin contacts, called META (multiplex end-tagging amplification), and an algorithm to impute the two chromosome haplotypes linked by each contact. We reconstructed the genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es of single diploid human cells from a lymphoblastoid cell line and from primary blood cells with high spatial resolution, locating specific single-nucleotide and copy number variations in the nucleus. The two alleles of imprinted loci and the two X chromosomes were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>ally different. Cells of different types displayed statistically distinct genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es. Such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al cell typing is crucial for understanding cell functions.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Exploiting CELLULOSE SYNTHASE (CESA) Class Specificity to Probe Cellulose Microfibril Biosynthesis
<p>Cellulose microfibrils are the basic units of cellulose in plants. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of these microfibrils is at least partly determined by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of the cellulose synthase complex. In higher plants, this complex is composed of 18 to 24 catalytic subunits known as CELLULOSE SYNTHASE A (CESA) proteins. Three different classes of CESA proteins are required for cellulose synthesis and for secondary cell wall cellulose biosynthesis these classes are represented by CESA4, CESA7, and CESA8. To probe the relationship between CESA proteins and microfibril <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e, we created mutant cesa proteins that lack catalytic activity but retain sufficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al integrity to allow assembly of the cellulose synthase complex. Using a series of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants and genetic backgrounds, we found consistent differences in the ability of these mutant cesa proteins to complement the cellulose-deficient phenotype of the <i>cesa</i> null mutants. The best complementation was observed with catalytically inactive cesa4, while the equivalent mutation in cesa8 exhibited significantly lower levels of complementation. Using a variety of biophysical techniques, including solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance and Fourier transform infrared microscopy, to study these mutant plants, we found evidence for changes in cellulose microfibril <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e, but these changes largely correlated with cellulose content and reflected differences in the relative proportions of primary and secondary cell walls. Our results suggest that individual CESA classes have similar roles in determining cellulose microfibril <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e, and it is likely that the different effects of mutating members of different CESA classes are the consequence of their different catalytic activity and their influence on the overall rate of cellulose synthesis.</p>

Dislocation following total hip arthroplasty using dual mobility acetabular components
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this systematic review was to report the rate of dislocation   following the use of dual mobility (DM) acetabular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents in   primary and revision total hip arthroplasty (THA).</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A systematic review of the literature according to the Preferred   Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines   was performed. A comprehensive search of Pubmed/Medline, Cochrane   Library and Embase (Scopus) was conducted for English articles between   January 1974 and March 2016 using various combinations of the keywords “dual   mobility”, “dual-mobility”, “tripolar”, “double-mobility”, “double   mobility”, “hip”, “cup”, “socket”. The following data were extracted   by two investigators independently: demographics, whether the operation   was a primary or revision THA, length of follow-up, the design of   the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents, diameter of the femoral head, and type of fixation   of the acetabular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In all, 59 articles met our inclusion criteria.

Do varus or valgus outliers have higher forces in the medial or lateral compartments than those which are in-range after a kinematically aligned total knee arthroplasty?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of this study were to determine the proportion of patients   with outlier varus or valgus alignment in kinematically aligned   total knee arthroplasty (TKA), whether those with outlier varus   or valgus alignment have higher forces in the medial or lateral   compartments of the knee than those with in-range alignment and   whether measurements of the alignment of the limb, knee and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents   predict compartment forces.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The intra-operative forces in the medial and lateral compartments   were measured with an instrumented tibial insert in 67 patients   who underwent a kinematically aligned TKA during passive movement.

Aldehyde dehydrogenase, Ald4p, is a major component of mitochondrial fluorescent inclusion bodies in the yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>
<p>When <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> strain 3626 was cultured to the stationary phase in a medium that contained glucose, needle-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es that emitted autofluorescence were observed in almost all cells by fluorescence microscopy under UV excitation. The needle-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es completely overlapped with the profile of straight elongated mitochondria. Therefore, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es were designated as mitochondrial fluorescent inclusion bodies (MFIBs). The MFIB-enriched mitochondrial fractions were successfully isolated and 2D-gel electrophoresis revealed that a protein of 54 kDa was only highly concentrated in the fractions. Determination of the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the 54-kDa protein identified it as a mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase, Ald4p. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that anti-Ald4p antibody specifically stained MFIBs. Freeze-substitution electron microscopy demonstrated that cells that retained MFIBs had electron-dense filamentous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es with a diameter of 10 nm in straight elongated mitochondria. Immunoelectron microscopy showed that Ald4p was localized to the electron-dense filamentous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es in mitochondria. These results together showed that a major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent of MFIBs is Ald4p. In addition, we demonstrate that MFIBs are common features that appear in mitochondria of many species of yeast.</p>

The bacterial Ras/Rap1 site-specific endopeptidase RRSP cleaves Ras through an atypical mechanism to disrupt Ras-ERK signaling
<p>The Ras–extracellular signal–regulated kinase pathway is critical for controlling cell proliferation, and its aberrant activation drives the growth of various cancers. Because many pathogens produce toxins that inhibit Ras activity, efforts to develop effective Ras inhibitors to treat cancer could be informed by studies of Ras inhibition by pathogens. <i>Vibrio vulnificus</i> causes fatal infections in a manner that depends on multifunctional autoprocessing repeats-in-toxin, a toxin that releases bacterial effector domains into host cells. One such domain is the Ras/Rap1-specific endopeptidase (RRSP), which site-specifically cleaves the Switch I domain of the small GTPases Ras and Rap1. We solved the crystal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of RRSP and found that its backbone shares a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al fold with the EreA/ChaN-like superfamily of enzymes. Unlike other proteases in this family, RRSP is not a metalloprotease. Through nuclear magnetic resonance analysis and nucleotide exchange assays, we determined that the processing of KRAS by RRSP did not release any fragments or cause KRAS to dissociate from its bound nucleotide but instead only locally affected its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e. However, this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al alteration of KRAS was sufficient to disable guanine nucleotide exchange factor–mediated nucleotide exchange and prevent KRAS from binding to RAF. Thus, RRSP is a bacterial effector that represents a previously unrecognized class of protease that disconnects Ras from its signaling network while inducing limited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al disturbance in its target.</p>

<p>Voltage-gated sodium channel Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 represents a promising target for pain relief. Here we report the cryo–electron microscopy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es of the human Na<sub>v</sub>1.7-β1-β2 complex bound to two combinations of pore blockers and gating modifier toxins (GMTs), tetrodotoxin with protoxin-II and saxitoxin with huwentoxin-IV, both determined at overall resolutions of 3.2 angstroms. The two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es are nearly identical except for minor shifts of voltage-sensing domain II (VSD<sub>II</sub>), whose S3-S4 linker accommodates the two GMTs in a similar manner. One additional protoxin-II sits on top of the S3-S4 linker in VSD<sub>IV</sub>. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es may represent an inactivated state with all four VSDs “up” and the intracellular gate closed. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es illuminate the path toward mechanistic understanding of the function and disease of Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 and establish the foundation for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e-aided development of analgesics.</p>

Structure of the cold- and menthol-sensing ion channel TRPM8
<p>Transient receptor potential melastatin (TRPM) cation channels are polymodal sensors that are involved in a variety of physiological processes. Within the TRPM family, member 8 (TRPM8) is the primary cold and menthol sensor in humans. We determined the cryo–electron microscopy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of the full-length TRPM8 from the collared flycatcher at an overall resolution of ~4.1 ångstroms. Our TRPM8 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e reveals a three-layered architecture. The amino-terminal domain with a fold distinct among known TRP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es, together with the carboxyl-terminal region, forms a large two-layered cytosolic ring that extensively interacts with the transmembrane channel layer. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e suggests that the menthol-binding site is located within the voltage-sensor–like domain and thus provides a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al glimpse of the design principle of the molecular transducer for cold and menthol sensation.</p>

Single-stranded DNA and RNA origami
<p>Self-folding of an information-carrying polymer into a defined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e is foundational to biology and offers attractive potential as a synthetic strategy. Although multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent self-assembly has produced complex synthetic nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es, unimolecular folding has seen limited progress. We describe a framework to design and synthesize a single DNA or RNA strand to self-fold into a complex yet unknotted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e that approximates an arbitrary user-prescribed shape. We experimentally construct diverse multikilobase single-stranded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es, including a ~10,000-nucleotide (nt) DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e and a ~6000-nt RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e. We demonstrate facile replication of the strand in vitro and in living cells. The work here thus establishes unimolecular folding as a general strategy for constructing complex and replicable nucleic acid nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es, and expands the design space and material scalability for bottom-up nanotechnology.</p>

Mechanism of transmembrane signaling by sensor histidine kinases
<p>One of the major and essential classes of transmembrane (TM) receptors, present in all domains of life, is sensor histidine kinases, parts of two-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent signaling systems (TCSs). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al mechanisms of TM signaling by these sensors are poorly understood. We present crystal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es of the periplasmic sensor domain, the TM domain, and the cytoplasmic HAMP domain of the <i>Escherichia coli</i> nitrate/nitrite sensor histidine kinase NarQ in the ligand-bound and mutated ligand-free states. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es reveal that the ligand binding induces rearrangements and pistonlike shifts of TM helices. The HAMP domain protomers undergo leverlike motions and convert these pistonlike motions into helical rotations. Our findings provide the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al framework for complete understanding of TM TCS signaling and for development of antimicrobial treatments targeting TCSs.</p>

Bottom-up construction of a superstructure in a porous uranium-organic crystal
<p>Bottom-up construction of highly intricate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es from simple building blocks remains one of the most difficult challenges in chemistry. We report a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>ally complex, mesoporous uranium-based metal-organic framework (MOF) made from simple starting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e comprises 10 uranium nodes and seven tricarboxylate ligands (both crystallographically nonequivalent), resulting in a 173.3-angstrom cubic unit cell enclosing 816 uranium nodes and 816 organic linkers—the largest unit cell found to date for any nonbiological material. The cuboctahedra organize into pentagonal and hexagonal prismatic secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es, which then form tetrahedral and diamond quaternary topologies with unprecedented complexity. This packing results in the formation of colossal icosidodecahedral and rectified hexakaidecahedral cavities with internal diameters of 5.0 nanometers and 6.2 nanometers, respectively—ultimately giving rise to the lowest-density MOF reported to date.</p>

Systems Genetics Identifies a Novel Regulatory Domain of Amylose Synthesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>A deeper understanding of the regulation of starch biosynthesis in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) endosperm is crucial in tailoring digestibility without sacrificing grain quality. In this study, significant association peaks on chromosomes 6 and 7 were identified through a genomewide association study (GWAS) of debranched starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e from grains of a 320 <i>indica</i> rice diversity panel using genotyping data from the high-density rice array. A systems genetics approach that interrelates starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e data from GWAS to functional pathways from a gene regulatory network identified known genes with high correlation to the proportion of amylose and amylopectin. An SNP in the promoter region of <i>Granule Bound Starch Synthase I</i> was identified along with seven other SNPs to form haplotypes that discriminate samples into different phenotypic ranges of amylose. A GWAS peak on chromosome 7 between LOC_Os07g11020 and LOC_Os07g11520 indexed by a nonsynonymous SNP mutation on exon 5 of a bHLH transcription factor was found to elevate the proportion of amylose at the expense of reduced short-chain amylopectin. Linking starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e with starch digestibility by determining the kinetics of cooked grain amylolysis of selected haplotypes revealed strong association of starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e with estimated digestibility kinetics. Combining all results from grain quality genomics, systems genetics, and digestibility phenotyping, we propose target haplotypes for fine-tuning starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e in rice through marker-assisted breeding that can be used to alter the digestibility of rice grain, thus offering rice consumers a new diet-based intervention to mitigate the impact of nutrition-related noncommunicable diseases.</p>

The diagnostic performance of radiographic criteria to detect aseptic acetabular component loosening after revision total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>This study aimed to determine the diagnostic performance of radiographic   criteria to detect aseptic acetabular loosening after revision total   hip arthroplasty (THA).

The   area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves was   0.94 and 0.93, respectively. The thresholds of 2.5 mm proximal translation   or 2° sagittal rotation (EBRA) in combination with radiolucency   criteria had a sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 88% to detect   aseptic loosening. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive   value and negative predictive value (NPV) of radiolucency criteria   were 41%, 100%, 100% and 68% respectively. Manual measurements of   both proximal translation and sagittal rotation were very good diagnostic tests.   The area under the ROC curve was 0.86 and 0.92 respectively.

Can we predict which dysplastic hips will require acetabular augmentation during total hip arthroplasty based on pre-operative radiographs?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether an innovative   templating technique could predict the need for acetabular augmentation   during primary total hip arthroplasty for patients with dysplastic   hips.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We developed a simple templating technique to estimate acetabular   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent coverage at total hip arthroplasty, the True Cup: False   Cup (TC:FC) ratio. We reviewed all patients with dysplastic hips   who underwent primary total hip arthroplasty between 2005 and 2012.   Traditional radiological methods of assessing the degree of acetabular dysplasia   (Sharp’s angle, Tönnis angle, centre-edge angle) as well as the   TC:FC ratio were measured from the pre-operative radiographs. A   comparison of augmented and non-augmented hips was undertaken to   determine any difference in pre-operative radiological indices between   the two cohorts. The intra- and inter-observer reliability for all   radiological indices used in the study were also calculated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of the 128 cases reviewed, 33 (26%) needed acetabular augmentation.   We found no difference in the median Sharp’s angle (p = 0.10), Tönnis   angle (p = 0.28), or centre-edge angle (p = 0.07) between the two   groups. A lower TC:FC ratio was observed in the augmented group   compared with the non-augmented group (median = 0.66 <i>versus</i> 0.88, p < 0.001).   Intra-observer reliability was found to be high for all radiological   indices analysed (interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) > 0.7).   However, inter-observer reliability was more variable and was only   high for the TC: FC ratio (ICC > 0.7).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The TC: FC ratio gives an accurate estimate of acetabular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent   coverage.

Risk of early mortality after cemented compared with cementless total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>It has been suggested that cemented fixation of total hip arthroplasty   (THA) is associated with an increased peri-operative mortality compared   with cementless THA. Our aim was to investigate this through a nationwide   matched cohort study adjusting for age, comorbidity, and socioeconomic   background.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 178 784 patients with osteoarthritis who underwent   either cemented or cementless THA from the Swedish Hip Arthroplasty   Register were matched with 862 294 controls from the general population.   Information about the causes of death, comorbidities, and socioeconomic   background was obtained. Mortality within the first 90 days after   the operation was the primary outcome measure.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Patients who underwent cemented THA had an increased risk of   death during the first 14 days compared with the controls (hazard   ratio (HR) 1.3, confidence interval (CI) 1.11 to 1.44), corresponding   to an absolute increase in risk of five deaths per 10 000 observations.   No such early increase of risk was seen in those who underwent cementless THA.   Between days 15 and 29 the risk of mortality was decreased for those   with cemented THA (HR 0.7, CI 0.62 to 0.87). Between days 30 and   90 all patients undergoing THA, irrespective of the mode of fixation,   had a lower risk of death than controls. Patients selected for cementless   fixation were younger, healthier and had a higher level of education   and income than those selected for cemented THA. A supplementary   analysis of 16 556 hybrid THAs indicated that cementation of the   femoral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent was associated with a slight increase in mortality   up to 15 days, whereas no such increase in mortality was seen in   those with a cemented acetabular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent combined with a cementless   femoral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This nationwide matched cohort study indicates that patients   receiving cemented THA have a minimally increased relative risk   of early mortality that is reversed from day 15 and thereafter.   The absolute increase in risk is very small.

Heart Failure Stages Among Older Adults in the Community
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although heart failure (HF) disproportionately affects older adults, little data exist regarding the prevalence of American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association HF stages among older individuals in the community. Additionally, the role of contemporary measures of longitudinal strain and diastolic dysfunction in defining HF stages is unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>HF stages were classified in 6118 participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study (67–91 years of age) at the fifth study visit as follows: A (asymptomatic with HF risk factors but no cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al or functional abnormalities), B (asymptomatic with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al abnormalities, defined as left ventricular hypertrophy, dilation or dysfunction, or significant valvular disease), C1 (clinical HF without prior hospitalization), and C2 (clinical HF with earlier hospitalization).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Using the traditional definitions of HF stages, only 5% of examined participants were free of HF risk factors or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al heart disease (Stage 0), 52% were categorized as Stage A, 30% Stage B, 7% Stage C1, and 6% Stage C2.

Left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction was preserved in 77% and 65% in Stages C1 and C2, respectively. Incorporation of longitudinal strain and diastolic dysfunction into the Stage B definition reclassified 14% of the sample from Stage A to B and improved the net reclassification index (<i>P</i>=0.028) and integrated discrimination index (<i>P</i>=0.016). Abnormal LV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e, systolic function (based on LV ejection fraction and longitudinal strain), and diastolic function (based on e’, E/e’, and left atrial volume index) were each independently and additively associated with risk of incident HF hospitalization or death in Stage A and B participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The majority of older adults in the community are at risk for HF (Stages A or B), appreciably more compared with previous reports in younger community-based samples.

DNA-PKcs structure suggests an allosteric mechanism modulating DNA double-strand break repair
<p>DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) is a central <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent of nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), repairing DNA double-strand breaks that would otherwise lead to apoptosis or cancer. We have solved its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e in complex with the C-terminal peptide of Ku80 at 4.3 angstrom resolution using x-ray crystallography. We show that the 4128–amino acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e comprises three large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al units: the N-terminal unit, the Circular Cradle, and the Head. Conformational differences between the two molecules in the asymmetric unit are correlated with changes in accessibility of the kinase active site, which are consistent with an allosteric mechanism to bring about kinase activation. The location of KU80ct<sub>194</sub> in the vicinity of the breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) binding site suggests competition with BRCA1, leading to pathway selection between NHEJ and homologous recombination.</p>

Cryo-EM structures and atomic model of the HIV-1 strand transfer complex intasome
<p>Like all retroviruses, HIV-1 irreversibly inserts a viral DNA (vDNA) copy of its RNA genome into host target DNA (tDNA). The intasome, a higher-order nucleoprotein complex composed of viral integrase (IN) and the ends of linear vDNA, mediates integration. Productive integration into host chromatin results in the formation of the strand transfer complex (STC) containing catalytically joined vDNA and tDNA. HIV-1 intasomes have been refractory to high-resolution <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al studies. We used a soluble IN fusion protein to facilitate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al studies, through which we present a high-resolution cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of the core tetrameric HIV-1 STC and a higher-order form that adopts carboxyl-terminal domain rearrangements. The distinct STC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es highlight how HIV-1 can use the common retroviral intasome core architecture to accommodate different IN domain modules for assembly.</p>

The structure and flexibility of conical HIV-1 capsids determined within intact virions
<p>HIV-1 contains a cone-shaped capsid encasing the viral genome. This capsid is thought to follow fullerene geometry—a curved hexameric lattice of the capsid protein, CA, closed by incorporating 12 CA pentamers. Current models for core <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e are based on crystallography of hexameric and cross-linked pentameric CA, electron microscopy of tubular CA arrays, and simulations. Here, we report subnanometer-resolution cryo–electron tomography <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es of hexameric and pentameric CA within intact HIV-1 particles. Whereas the hexamer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e is compatible with crystallography studies, the pentamer forms using different interfaces. Determining multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es revealed how CA flexes to form the variably curved core shell. We show that HIV-1 CA assembles both aberrant and perfect fullerene cones, supporting models in which conical cores assemble de novo after maturation.</p>

Zika virus produces noncoding RNAs using a multi-pseudoknot structure that confounds a cellular exonuclease
<p>The outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) and associated fetal microcephaly mandates efforts to understand the molecular processes of infection. Related flaviviruses produce noncoding subgenomic flaviviral RNAs (sfRNAs) that are linked to pathogenicity in fetal mice. These viruses make sfRNAs by co-opting a cellular exonuclease via <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>ed RNAs called xrRNAs. We found that ZIKV-infected monkey and human epithelial cells, mouse neurons, and mosquito cells produce sfRNAs. The RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e that is responsible for ZIKV sfRNA production forms a complex fold that is likely found in many pathogenic flaviviruses. Mutations that disrupt the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e affect exonuclease resistance in vitro and sfRNA formation during infection.

Xist recruits the X chromosome to the nuclear lamina to enable chromosome-wide silencing
<p>The Xist long noncoding RNA orchestrates X chromosome inactivation, a process that entails chromosome-wide silencing and remodeling of the three-dimensional (3D) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of the X chromosome. Yet, it remains unclear whether these changes in nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e are mediated by Xist and whether they are required for silencing. Here, we show that Xist directly interacts with the Lamin B receptor, an integral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent of the nuclear lamina, and that this interaction is required for Xist-mediated silencing by recruiting the inactive X to the nuclear lamina and by doing so enables Xist to spread to actively transcribed genes across the X. Our results demonstrate that lamina recruitment changes the 3D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of DNA, enabling Xist and its silencing proteins to spread across the X to silence transcription.</p>

Simultaneous Femtosecond X-ray Spectroscopy and Diffraction of Photosystem II at Room Temperature
<sec><title>One Protein, Two Probes</title><p>A central challenge in the use of x-ray diffraction to characterize macromolecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e is the propensity of the high-energy radiation to damage the sample during data collection.

Healthy Roots and Leaves: Comparative Genome Structure of Horseradish and Watercress
<p>Horseradish (<i>Armoracia rusticana</i>) and watercress (<i>Nasturtium officinale</i>) are economically important cruciferous vegetable species with limited genomic resources. We used comparative chromosome painting to identify the extent of chromosomal collinearity between horseradish and watercress, and to reconstruct the origin and evolution of the two tetraploid genomes (2<i>n</i> = 4<i>x</i> = 32). Our results show that horseradish and watercress genomes originated from a common ancestral (<i>n</i> = 8) genome, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>ally resembling the Ancestral Crucifer Karyotype (<i>n</i> = 8), which, however, contained two unique translocation chromosomes (AK6/8 and AK8/6). Except for a 2.4-Mb unequal chromosome translocation in watercress, both genomes are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>ally identical. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al similarity of the two parental subgenomes might suggest an autotetraploid origin of horseradish and watercress genomes. The subgenome stasis, apart from the single-chromosome translocation, indicates that homeologous recombination played a limited role in postpolyploid evolution in both tetraploid genomes. The octoploid genome of one-rowed watercress (<i>N. microphyllum</i>, 2<i>n</i> = 8<i>x</i> = 64), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>ally mirroring the tetraploid horseradish and watercress genomes, originated via autopolyploidization from the immediate tetraploid predecessor of watercress or hybridization between this and another now-extinct tetraploid <i>Nasturtium</i> species. These comparative cytogenomic maps in horseradish and watercress represent a first stepping stone for future whole-genome sequencing efforts and genetic improvement of both crop species.</p>

Infrared Nanospectroscopy Reveals the Chemical Nature of Pit Membranes in Water-Conducting Cells of the Plant Xylem
<p>In the xylem of angiosperm plants, microscopic pits through the secondary cell walls connect the water-conducting vessels. Cellulosic meshes originated from primary walls, and middle lamella between adjacent vessels, called the pit membrane, separates one conduit from another. The intricate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of the nano-sized pores in pit membranes enables the passage of water under negative pressure without hydraulic failure due to obstruction by gas bubbles (i.e. embolism) under normal conditions or mild drought stress. Since the chemical composition of pit membranes affects embolism formation and bubble behavior, we directly measured pit membrane composition in <i>Populus nigra</i> wood. Here, we characterized the chemical composition of cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es by synchrotron infrared nanospectroscopy and atomic force microscopy-infrared nanospectroscopy with high spatial resolution. Characteristic peaks of cellulose, phenolic compounds, and proteins were found in the intervessel pit membranes of <i>P. nigra</i> wood. In addition, the vessel to parenchyma pit membranes and developing cell walls of the vascular cambium showed clear signals of cellulose, proteins, and pectin. We did not find a distinct peak of lignin and other compounds in these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es. Our investigation of the complex chemical composition of intervessel pit membranes furthers our understanding of the flow of water and bubbles between neighboring conduits. The advances presented here pave the way for further label-free studies related to the nanochemistry of plant cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents.</p>

Three-Dimensional Analysis of Chloroplast Structures Associated with Virus Infection
<p>Chloroplasts are multifunctional organelles whose morphology is affected by environmental stresses. Although the three-dimensional (3D) architecture of thylakoid membranes has been reported previously, a 3D visualization of chloroplast under stress has not been explored. In this work, we used a positive-strand RNA ((+)RNA) virus, barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) to observe chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al changes during infection by electron tomography. The analyses revealed remodeling of the chloroplast membranes, characterized by the clustering of outer membrane-invaginated spherules in inner membrane-derived packets. Diverse morphologies of cytoplasmic invaginations (CIs) were evident with spherules at the periphery and different sized openings connecting the CIs to the cytoplasm. Immunoelectron microscopy of these viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents verified that the aberrant membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es were sites for BSMV replication. The BSMV αa replication protein localized at the surface of the chloroplasts and played a prominent role in eliciting chloroplast membrane rearrangements. In sum, our results have revealed the 3D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of the chloroplasts induced by BSMV infection. These findings contribute to our understanding of chloroplast morphological changes under stress conditions and during assembly of plant (+)RNA virus replication complexes.</p>

Target RNA Secondary Structure Is a Major Determinant of miR159 Efficacy
<p>In plants, microRNA (miRNA)-target complementarity has long been considered the predominant factor determining the silencing outcome of the miRNA-target interaction, although the efficacy of such interactions have rarely been appraised in plants. Here, we perform in planta silencing efficacy assays on seven Arabidopsis <i>MYB</i> genes, all of which contain conserved miR159-binding sites of analogous complementarity. These genes were found to be differentially silenced by miR159; <i>MYB81</i>, <i>MYB97</i>, <i>MYB101</i>, <i>MYB104</i>, and <i>DUO1</i> were all poorly silenced, whereas <i>MYB33</i> and <i>MYB65</i> were strongly silenced. Curiously, this is consistent with previous genetic analysis defining <i>MYB33</i> and <i>MYB65</i> as the major functional targets of miR159. Neither the free energy of miR159-target complementarity, nor miRNA binding site accessibility, as determined by flanking region AU content, could fully explain the discrepancy of miR159 silencing efficacy. Instead, we found that <i>MYB33</i> and <i>MYB65</i> were both predicted to contain a distinctive RNA secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e abutting the miR159 binding site. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e is composed of two stem-loops (SLs) that are predicted to form in <i>MYB33</i>/65 homologs of species as evolutionary distant as gymnosperms. Functional analysis found that the RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e in <i>MYB33</i> correlated with strong silencing efficacy; introducing mutations to disrupt either SL attenuated miR159 efficacy, while introducing complementary mutations to restore the SLs, but not the sequence, restored strong miR159-mediated silencing. Therefore, it appears that this RNA secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e demarcates <i>MYB33</i>/<i>65</i> as sensitive targets of miR159, which underpins the narrow functional specificity of Arabidopsis miR159.</p>

Structural and Biochemical Characterization of Cinnamoyl-CoA Reductases
<p>Cinnamoyl-coenzyme A reductase (CCR) catalyzes the reduction of hydroxycinnamoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) esters using NADPH to produce hydroxycinnamyl aldehyde precursors in lignin synthesis. The catalytic mechanism and substrate specificity of cinnamoyl-CoA reductases from sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>), a strategic plant for bioenergy production, were deduced from crystal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es, site-directed mutagenesis, and kinetic and thermodynamic analyses. Although SbCCR1 displayed higher affinity for caffeoyl-CoA or <i>p</i>-coumaroyl-CoA than for feruloyl-CoA, the enzyme showed significantly higher activity for the latter substrate. Through molecular docking and comparisons between the crystal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es of the <i>Vitis vinifera</i> dihydroflavonol reductase and SbCCR1, residues threonine-154 and tyrosine-310 were pinpointed as being involved in binding CoA-conjugated phenylpropanoids. Threonine-154 of SbCCR1 and other CCRs likely confers strong substrate specificity for feruloyl-CoA over other cinnamoyl-CoA thioesters, and the T154Y mutation in SbCCR1 led to broader substrate specificity and faster turnover. Through data mining using our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al and biochemical information, four additional putative <i>CCR</i> genes were discovered from sorghum genomic data. One of these, SbCCR2, displayed greater activity toward <i>p</i>-coumaroyl-CoA than did SbCCR1, which could imply a role in the synthesis of defense-related lignin. Taken together, these findings provide knowledge about critical residues and substrate preference among CCRs and provide, to our knowledge, the first three-dimensional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e information for a CCR from a monocot species.</p>

Functional Analysis of Cellulose Synthase (CESA) Protein Class Specificity
<p>The cellulose synthase complex (CSC) exhibits a 6-fold symmetry and is known as a “rosette.” Each CSC is believed to contain between 18 and 24 CESA proteins that each synthesize an individual glucan chain. These chains form the microfibrils that confer the remarkable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al properties of cellulose. At least three different classes of CESA proteins are essential to form the CSC. However, while organization of the CSC determines microfibril <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e, how individual CESA proteins are organized within the CSC remains unclear. Parts of the plant CESA proteins map sufficiently well onto the bacterial CESA (BcsA) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e, indicating that they are likely to share a common catalytic mechanism. However, plant CESA proteins are much larger than the bacterial BcsA protein, prompting the suggestion that these plant-specific regions are important for interactions between CESA proteins and for conferring CESA class specificity. In this study, we have undertaken a comprehensive analysis of well-defined regions of secondary cell wall CESA proteins, with the aim of defining what distinguishes different CESA proteins and hence what determines the specificity of each CESA class. Our results demonstrate that CESA class specificity extends throughout the protein and not just in the highly variable regions. Furthermore, we find that different CESA isoforms vary greatly in their levels of site specificity and this is likely to be determined by the constraints imposed by their position within the CSC rather than their primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e.</p>

The validity and reproducibility of cross table radiographs compared with CT scans for the measurement of anteversion of the acetabular component after total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to assess the reproducibility and validity   of cross table radiographs for measuring the anteversion of the   acetabular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent after total hip arthroplasty (THA) and to compare   it with measurements using CT scans.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 29 patients who underwent THA between June 2010 and   January 2016 were included. There were 17 men and 12 women. Their   mean age was 43 years (26 to 65). Seven patients underwent a bilateral   procedure. Thus, 36 THAs were included in the study. Lateral radiographs   and CT scans were obtained post-operatively and radiographs repeated   three weeks later. The anteversion of the acetabular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent was   measured using the method described by Woo and Morrey and the ischiolateral   method described by Pulos et al and these were compared with the   results obtained from CT scans.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean anteversion was 18.35° (3° to 38°) using Woo and Morrey’s   method, 51.45° (30° to 85°) using the ischiolateral method and 21.22°   (2° to 48°) using CT scans. The Pearson correlation coefficient   was 0.754 for Woo and Morrey’s method and 0.925 for the ischiolateral   method. There was a linear correlation between the measurements   using the ischiolateral method and those using CT scans. We derived   a simple linear equation between the value of the CT scan and that   of ischiolateral method to deduce the CT scan value from that of ischiolateral   method and <i>vice versa</i>. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The anteversion of the acetabular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent measured using both   plain radiographic methods was consistently valid with good interobserver   reproducibility, but the ischiolateral method which is independent   of pelvic tilt was more accurate. As CT is costly, associated with   a high dose of radiation and not readily available, the ischiolateral method   can be used for assessing the anteversion of the acetabular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1006–11.</p></sec>

Biased agonists of the chemokine receptor CXCR3 differentially control chemotaxis and inflammation
<p>The chemokine receptor CXCR3 plays a central role in inflammation by mediating effector/memory T cell migration in various diseases; however, drugs targeting CXCR3 and other chemokine receptors are largely ineffective in treating inflammation. Chemokines, the endogenous peptide ligands of chemokine receptors, can exhibit so-called <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>ed agonism by selectively activating either G protein– or β-arrestin–mediated signaling after receptor binding. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>ed agonists might be used as more targeted therapeutics to differentially regulate physiological responses, such as immune cell migration. To test whether CXCR3-mediated physiological responses could be segregated by G protein– and β-arrestin–mediated signaling, we identified and characterized small-molecule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>ed agonists of the receptor. In a mouse model of T cell–mediated allergic contact hypersensitivity (CHS), topical application of a β-arrestin–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>ed, but not a G protein–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>ed, agonist potentiated inflammation. T cell recruitment was increased by the β-arrestin–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>ed agonist, and biopsies of patients with allergic CHS demonstrated coexpression of CXCR3 and β-arrestin in T cells. In mouse and human T cells, the β-arrestin–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>ed agonist was the most efficient at stimulating chemotaxis. Analysis of phosphorylated proteins in human lymphocytes showed that β-arrestin–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>ed signaling activated the kinase Akt, which promoted T cell migration. This study demonstrates that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>ed agonists of CXCR3 produce distinct physiological effects, suggesting discrete roles for different endogenous CXCR3 ligands and providing evidence that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>ed signaling can affect the clinical utility of drugs targeting CXCR3 and other chemokine receptors.</p>

Functional selectivity profiling of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor using pathway-wide BRET signaling sensors
<p>G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) are important therapeutic targets that exhibit functional selectivity (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>ed signaling), in which different ligands or receptor variants elicit distinct downstream signaling. Understanding all the signaling events and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>es that contribute to both the beneficial and adverse effects of GPCR stimulation by given ligands is important for drug discovery. Here, we report the design, validation, and use of pathway-selective bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) biosensors that monitor the engagement and activation of signaling effectors downstream of G proteins, including protein kinase C (PKC), phospholipase C (PLC), p63RhoGEF, and Rho. Combined with G protein and β-arrestin BRET biosensors, our sensors enabled real-time monitoring of GPCR signaling at different levels in downstream pathways in both native and engineered cells. Profiling of the responses to 14 angiotensin II (AngII) type 1 receptor (AT1R) ligands enabled the clustering of compounds into different subfamilies of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>ed ligands and showed that, in addition to the previously reported functional selectivity between Gα<sub>q</sub> and β-arrestin, there are also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>es among G protein subtypes. We also demonstrated that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>es observed at the receptor and G protein levels propagated to downstream signaling pathways and that these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>es could occur through the engagement of different G proteins to activate a common effector. We also used these tools to determine how naturally occurring AT1R variants affected signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>. This suite of BRET biosensors provides a useful resource for fingerprinting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>ed ligands and mutant receptors and for dissecting functional selectivity at various levels of GPCR signaling.</p>

G protein signaling–biased agonism at the κ-opioid receptor is maintained in striatal neurons
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>ed agonists of G protein–coupled receptors may present a means to refine receptor signaling in a way that separates side effects from therapeutic properties. Several studies have shown that agonists that activate the κ-opioid receptor (KOR) in a manner that favors G protein coupling over β-arrestin2 recruitment in cell culture may represent a means to treat pain and itch while avoiding sedation and dysphoria. Although it is attractive to speculate that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong> between G protein signaling and β-arrestin2 recruitment is the reason for these divergent behaviors, little evidence has emerged to show that these signaling pathways diverge in the neuronal environment. We further explored the influence of cellular context on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>ed agonism at KOR ligand–directed signaling toward G protein pathways over β-arrestin–dependent pathways and found that this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong> persists in striatal neurons. These findings advance our understanding of how a G protein–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>ed agonist signal differs between cell lines and primary neurons, demonstrate that measuring [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS binding and the regulation of adenylyl cyclase activity are not necessarily orthogonal assays in cell lines, and emphasize the contributions of the environment to assessing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>ed agonism.</p>

Fault-tolerant detection of a quantum error
<p>A critical component of any quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>–correcting scheme is detection of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>s by using an ancilla system. However, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>s occurring in the ancilla can propagate onto the logical qubit, irreversibly corrupting the encoded information. We demonstrate a fault-tolerant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>-detection scheme that suppresses spreading of ancilla <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>s by a factor of 5, while maintaining the assignment fidelity. The same method is used to prevent propagation of ancilla excitations, increasing the logical qubit dephasing time by an order of magnitude. Our approach is hardware-efficient, as it uses a single multilevel transmon ancilla and a cavity-encoded logical qubit, whose interaction is engineered in situ by using an off-resonant sideband drive. The results demonstrate that hardware-efficient approaches that exploit system-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong> models can yield advances toward fault-tolerant quantum computation.</p>

Histone Modifications Define Expression Bias of Homoeologous Genomes in Allotetraploid Cotton
<p>Histone modifications regulate gene expression in eukaryotes, but their roles in gene expression changes in interspecific hybrids or allotetraploids are poorly understood. Histone modifications can be mapped by immunostaining of metaphase chromosomes at the single cell level and/or by chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) for analyzing individual genes. Here, we comparatively analyzed immunostained metaphase chromosomes and ChIP-seq of individual genes, which revealed a chromatin basis for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>ed homoeologous gene expression in polyploids. We examined H3K4me3 density and transcriptome maps in root-tip cells of allotetraploid cotton (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>). The overall H3K4me3 levels were relatively equal between A and D chromosomes, which were consistent with equal numbers of expressed genes between the two subgenomes. However, intensities per chromosomal area were nearly twice as high in the D homeologs as in the A homeologs. Consistent with the cytological observation, ChIP-seq analysis showed that more D homeologs with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>ed H3K4me3 levels than A homeologs with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>ed modifications correlated with the greater number of the genes with D-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>ed expression than that with A-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>ed expression in most homeologous chromosome pairs. Two chromosomes displayed different expression levels compared with other chromosomes, which correlate with known translocations and may affect the local chromatin structure and expression levels for the genes involved. This example of genome-wide histone modifications that determine expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong> of homeologous genes in allopolyploids provides a molecular basis for the evolution and domestication of polyploid species, including many important crops.</p>

Biased agonists of the kappa opioid receptor suppress pain and itch without causing sedation or dysphoria
<p>Agonists targeting the kappa opioid receptor (KOR) have been promising therapeutic candidates because of their efficacy for treating intractable itch and relieving pain. Unlike typical opioid narcotics, KOR agonists do not produce euphoria or lead to respiratory suppression or overdose. However, they do produce dysphoria and sedation, side effects that have precluded their clinical development as therapeutics. KOR signaling can be fine-tuned to preferentially activate certain pathways over others, such that agonists can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong> signaling so that the receptor signals through G proteins rather than other effectors such as βarrestin2. We evaluated a newly developed G protein signaling–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>ed KOR agonist in preclinical models of pain, pruritis, sedation, dopamine regulation, and dysphoria. We found that triazole 1.1 retained the antinociceptive and antipruritic efficacies of a conventional KOR agonist, yet it did not induce sedation or reductions in dopamine release in mice, nor did it produce dysphoria as determined by intracranial self-stimulation in rats. These data demonstrated that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>ed agonists may be used to segregate physiological responses downstream of the receptor. Moreover, the findings suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>ed KOR agonists may present a means to treat pain and intractable itch without the side effects of dysphoria and sedation and with reduced abuse potential.</p>

G protein–coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) orchestrate biased agonism at the β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>ed agonists of G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs), which selectively activate either G protein– or β-arrestin–mediated signaling pathways, are of major therapeutic interest because they have the potential to show improved efficacy and specificity as drugs. Efforts to understand the mechanistic basis of this phenomenon have focused on the hypothesis that G proteins and β-arrestins preferentially couple to distinct GPCR conformations. However, because GPCR kinase (GRK)–dependent receptor phosphorylation is a critical prerequisite for the recruitment of β-arrestins to most GPCRs, GRKs themselves may play an important role in establishing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>ed signaling. We showed that an alanine mutant of the highly conserved residue tyrosine 219 (Y219A) in transmembrane domain five of the β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor (β<sub>2</sub>AR) was incapable of β-arrestin recruitment, receptor internalization, and β-arrestin–mediated activation of extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK), whereas it retained the ability to signal through G protein. We found that the impaired β-arrestin recruitment in cells was due to reduced GRK-mediated phosphorylation of the β<sub>2</sub>AR Y219A C terminus, which was recapitulated in vitro with purified components. Furthermore, in vitro ligation of a synthetically phosphorylated peptide onto the C terminus of β<sub>2</sub>AR Y219A rescued both the initial recruitment of β-arrestin and its engagement with the intracellular core of the receptor. These data suggest that the Y219A mutation generates a G protein–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>ed state primarily by conformational selection against GRK coupling, rather than against β-arrestin. Together, these findings highlight the importance of GRKs in modulating the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>ed agonism of GPCRs.</p>

Differential Codon Adaptation between dsDNA and ssDNA Phages in <i>Escherichia coli</i>
<p>Because phages use their host translation machinery, their codon usage should evolve toward that of highly expressed host genes. We used two indices to measure codon adaptation of phages to their host, <i>r</i><sub>RSCU</sub> (the correlation in relative synonymous codon usage [RSCU] between phages and their host) and Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) computed with highly expressed host genes as the reference set (because phage translation depends on host translation machinery). These indices used for this purpose are appropriate only when hosts exhibit little mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>, so only phages parasitizing <i>Escherichia coli</i> were included in the analysis. For double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) phages, both <i>r</i><sub>RSCU</sub> and CAI decrease with increasing number of transfer RNA genes encoded by the phage genome. <i>r</i><sub>RSCU</sub> is greater for dsDNA phages than for single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) phages, and the low <i>r</i><sub>RSCU</sub> values are mainly due to poor concordance in RSCU values for Y-ending codons between ssDNA phages and the <i>E. coli</i> host, consistent with the predicted effect of C→T mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong> in the ssDNA phages. Strong C→T mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong> would improve codon adaptation in codon families (e.g., Gly) where U-ending codons are favored over C-ending codons (“U-friendly” codon families) by highly expressed host genes but decrease codon adaptation in other codon families where highly expressed host genes favor C-ending codons against U-ending codons (“U-hostile” codon families). It is remarkable that ssDNA phages with increasing C→T mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong> also increased the usage of codons in the “U-friendly” codon families, thereby achieving CAI values almost as large as those of dsDNA phages. This represents a new type of codon adaptation.</p>

A calcium-sensing receptor mutation causing hypocalcemia disrupts a transmembrane salt bridge to activate β-arrestin–biased signaling
<p>The calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is a G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) that signals through G<sub>q/11</sub> and G<sub>i/o</sub> to stimulate cytosolic calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>i</sub>) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling to control extracellular calcium homeostasis. Studies of loss- and gain-of-function <i>CASR</i> mutations, which cause familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia type 1 (FHH1) and autosomal dominant hypocalcemia type 1 (ADH1), respectively, have revealed that the CaSR signals in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>ed manner. Thus, some mutations associated with FHH1 lead to signaling predominantly through the MAPK pathway, whereas mutations associated with ADH1 preferentially enhance Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>i</sub> responses. We report a previously unidentified ADH1-associated R680G CaSR mutation, which led to the identification of a CaSR structural motif that mediates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>ed signaling. Expressing CaSR<sup>R680G</sup> in HEK 293 cells showed that this mutation increased MAPK signaling without altering Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>i</sub> responses. Moreover, this gain of function in MAPK activity occurred independently of G<sub>q/11</sub> and G<sub>i/o</sub> and was mediated instead by a noncanonical pathway involving β-arrestin proteins. Homology modeling and mutagenesis studies showed that the R680G CaSR mutation selectively enhanced β-arrestin signaling by disrupting a salt bridge formed between Arg<sup>680</sup> and Glu<sup>767</sup>, which are located in CaSR transmembrane domain 3 and extracellular loop 2, respectively. Thus, our results demonstrate CaSR signaling through β-arrestin and the importance of the Arg<sup>680</sup>-Glu<sup>767</sup> salt bridge in mediating signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>.</p>

β-Arrestin–biased β-adrenergic signaling promotes extinction learning of cocaine reward memory
<p>Extinction learning of cocaine-associated contextual cues can help prevent cocaine addicts from relapsing. Pharmacological manipulation of β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) during extinction learning is being developed as a potential strategy to treat drug addiction. We demonstrated that the extinction learning of cocaine-associated memory was mediated by β-arrestin2–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>ed but not heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide–binding protein (G protein)–dependent β-adrenergic signaling. We found that administration of the non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>ed β-AR antagonist propranolol, but not the G protein–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>ed β-AR antagonist carvedilol, blocked extinction learning of cocaine-conditioned place preference and the associated ERK activation in the infralimbic prefrontal cortex. Overexpression of β-arrestin2 in the infralimbic prefrontal cortex promoted extinction learning, which was blocked by propranolol. Knockout of β-arrestin2 in the infralimbic prefrontal cortex, specifically in excitatory neurons, impaired extinction learning of cocaine-conditioned place preference, which was not rescued by carvedilol. β-Arrestin2 signaling in infralimbic excitatory neurons was also required for the extinction learning in the cocaine self-administration model. Our results suggest that β-arrestin–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>ed β-adrenergic signaling in the infralimbic prefrontal cortex regulates extinction learning of cocaine-associated memories and could be therapeutically targeted to treat addiction.</p>

Structural basis for chemokine recognition by a G protein–coupled receptor and implications for receptor activation
<p>Chemokines orchestrate cell migration for development, immune surveillance, and disease by binding to cell surface heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide–binding protein (G protein)–coupled receptors (GPCRs). The array of interactions between the nearly 50 chemokines and their 20 GPCR targets generates an extensive signaling network to which promiscuity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>ed agonism add further complexity. The receptor CXCR4 recognizes both monomeric and dimeric forms of the chemokine CXCL12, which is a distinct example of ligand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong> in the chemokine family. We demonstrated that a constitutively monomeric CXCL12 variant reproduced the G protein–dependent and β-arrestin–dependent responses that are associated with normal CXCR4 signaling and lead to cell migration. In addition, monomeric CXCL12 made specific contacts with CXCR4 that are not present in the structure of the receptor in complex with a dimeric form of CXCL12, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>ed agonist that stimulates only G protein–dependent signaling. We produced an experimentally validated model of an agonist-bound chemokine receptor that merged a nuclear magnetic resonance–based structure of monomeric CXCL12 bound to the amino terminus of CXCR4 with a crystal structure of the transmembrane domains of CXCR4. The large CXCL12:CXCR4 protein-protein interface revealed by this structure identified previously uncharacterized functional interactions that fall outside of the classical “two-site model” for chemokine-receptor recognition. Our model suggests a mechanistic hypothesis for how interactions on the extracellular face of the receptor may stimulate the conformational changes required for chemokine receptor–mediated signal transduction.</p>

Rotary and linear molecular motors driven by pulses of a chemical fuel

The directional rotation of [2]- and [3]catenane rotary molecular motors and the transport of substrates away from equilibrium by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linear</span></strong> molecular pump are induced by acid-base oscillations. The changes simultaneously switch the binding site affinities and the labilities of barriers on the track, creating an energy ratchet. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linear</span></strong> and rotary molecular motors are driven by aliquots of a chemical fuel, trichloroacetic acid. A single fuel pulse generates 360° unidirectional rotation of up to 87% of crown ethers in a [2]catenane rotary motor.</p>

Suppressing relaxation in superconducting qubits by quasiparticle pumping
<p>Dynamical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong> suppression techniques are commonly used to improve coherence in quantum systems. They reduce dephasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>s by applying control pulses designed to reverse erroneous coherent evolution driven by environmental noise. However, such methods cannot correct for irreversible processes such as energy relaxation. We investigate a complementary, stochastic approach to reducing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>s: Instead of deterministically reversing the unwanted qubit evolution, we use control pulses to shape the noise environment dynamically. In the context of superconducting qubits, we implement a pumping sequence to reduce the number of unpaired electrons (quasiparticles) in close proximity to the device. A 70% reduction in the quasiparticle density results in a threefold enhancement in qubit relaxation times and a comparable reduction in coherence variability.</p>

Dopamine neurons encode performance error in singing birds
<p>Many behaviors are learned through trial and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong> by matching performance to internal goals. Yet neural mechanisms of performance evaluation remain poorly understood. We recorded basal ganglia–projecting dopamine neurons in singing zebra finches as we controlled perceived song quality with distorted auditory feedback. Dopamine activity was phasically suppressed after distorted syllables, consistent with a worse-than-predicted outcome, and was phasically activated at the precise moment of the song when a predicted distortion did not occur, consistent with a better-than-predicted outcome. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong> response magnitude depended on distortion probability. Thus, dopaminergic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong> signals can evaluate behaviors that are not learned for reward and are instead learned by matching performance outcomes to internal goals.</p>

Modeling Major Adverse Outcomes of Pediatric and Adult Patients With Congenital Heart Disease Undergoing Cardiac Catheterization
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Risk standardization for adverse events after congenital cardiac catheterization is needed to equitably compare patient outcomes among different hospitals as a foundation for quality improvement. The goal of this project was to develop a risk-standardization methodology to adjust for patient characteristics when comparing major adverse outcomes in the NCDR’s (National Cardiovascular Data Registry) IMPACT Registry (Improving Pediatric and Adult Congenital Treatment).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Between January 2011 and March 2014, 39 725 consecutive patients within IMPACT undergoing cardiac catheterization were identified. Given the heterogeneity of interventional procedures for congenital heart disease, new procedure-type risk categories were derived with empirical data and expert opinion, as were markers of hemodynamic vulnerability. A multivariable hierarchical logistic regression model to identify patient and procedural characteristics predictive of a major adverse event or death after cardiac catheterization was derived in 70% of the cohort and validated in the remaining 30%.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The rate of major adverse event or death was 7.1% and 7.2% in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. Six procedure-type risk categories and 6 independent indicators of hemodynamic vulnerability were identified. The final risk adjustment model included procedure-type risk category, number of hemodynamic vulnerability indicators, renal insufficiency, single-ventricle physiology, and coagulation disorder. The model had good discrimination, with a C-statistic of 0.76 and 0.75 in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. Model <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calibr</span></strong>ation in the validation cohort was excellent, with a slope of 0.97 (standard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>, 0.04; <i>P</i> value [for difference from 1] =0.53) and an intercept of 0.007 (standard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>, 0.12; <i>P</i> value [for difference from 0] =0.95).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The creation of a validated risk-standardization model for adverse outcomes after congenital cardiac catheterization can support reporting of risk-adjusted outcomes in the IMPACT Registry as a foundation for quality improvement.</p></sec>

Long-Term Biased β-Arrestin Signaling Improves Cardiac Structure and Function in Dilated Cardiomyopathy

Our laboratory indicated that these effects may be attributable to changes at the level of the myofilaments. However, these signaling mechanisms remain unknown. Because a common finding in dilated cardiomyopathy is a reduction in the myofilament-Ca<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> response, we hypothesized that β-arrestin signaling would increase myofilament-Ca<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> responsiveness in a model of familial dilated cardiomyopathy and improve cardiac function and morphology.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We treated a dilated cardiomyopathy–linked mouse model expressing a mutant tropomyosin (Tm-E54K) for 3 months with either TRV120067, a β-arrestin 2–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>ed ligand of the angiotensin II receptor, or losartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker. At the end of the treatment protocol, we assessed cardiac function using echocardiography, the myofilament-Ca<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> response of detergent-extracted fiber bundles, and used proteomic approaches to understand changes in posttranslational modifications of proteins that may explain functional changes. We also assessed signaling pathways altered in vivo and by using isolated myocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>TRV120067- treated Tm-E54K mice showed improved cardiac structure and function, whereas losartan-treated mice had no improvement. Myofilaments of TRV120067-treated Tm-E54K mice had significantly improved myofilament-Ca<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> responsiveness, which was depressed in untreated Tm-E54K mice. We attributed these changes to increased MLC2v and MYPT1/2 phosphorylation seen only in TRV120067-treated mice. We found that the functional changes were attributable to an activation of ERK1/2-RSK3 signaling, mediated through β-arrestin, which may have a novel role in increasing MLC2v phosphorylation through a previously unrecognized interaction of β-arrestin localized to the sarcomere.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Long-term β-arrestin 2–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>ed agonism of the angiotensin II receptor may be a viable approach to the treatment of dilated cardiomyopathy by not only preventing maladaptive signaling, but also improving cardiac function by altering the myofilament-Ca<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> response via β-arrestin signaling pathways.</p></sec>

Biased antagonism of CXCR4 avoids antagonist tolerance
<p>Repeated dosing of drugs targeting G protein–coupled receptors can stimulate antagonist tolerance, which reduces their efficacy; thus, strategies to avoid tolerance are needed. The efficacy of AMD3100, a competitive antagonist of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 that mobilizes leukemic blasts from the bone marrow into the blood to sensitize them to chemotherapy, is reduced after prolonged treatment. Tolerance to AMD3100 increases the abundance of CXCR4 on the surface of leukemic blasts, which promotes their rehoming to the bone marrow. AMD3100 inhibits both G protein signaling by CXCR4 and β-arrestin1/2–dependent receptor endocytosis. We demonstrated that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>ed antagonists of G protein–dependent chemotaxis but not β-arrestin1/2 recruitment and subsequent receptor endocytosis avoided tolerance. The peptide antagonist X4-2-6, which is derived from transmembrane helix 2 and extracellular loop 1 of CXCR4, limited chemotaxis and signaling but did not promote CXCR4 accumulation on the cell surface or cause tolerance. The activity of X4-2-6 was due to its distinct mechanism of inhibition of CXCR4. The peptide formed a ternary complex with the receptor and its ligand, the chemokine CXCL12. Within this complex, X4-2-6 released the portion of CXCL12 critical for receptor-mediated activation of G proteins but enabled the rest of the chemokine to recruit β-arrestins to the receptor. In contrast, AMD3100 displaced all components of the chemokine responsible for CXCR4 activation. We further identified a small molecule with similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>ed antagonist properties to those of X4-2-6, which may provide a viable alternative to patients when antagonist tolerance prevents drugs from reaching efficacy.</p>

Biased signaling by thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor–specific antibodies determines thyrocyte survival in autoimmunity
<p>The thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) is a heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide–binding protein (G protein)–coupled receptor (GPCR). Autoimmune hyperthyroidism, commonly known as Graves’ disease (GD), is caused by stimulating autoantibodies to the TSHR. We previously described TSHR-specific antibodies (TSHR-Abs) in GD that recognize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linear</span></strong> epitopes in the cleavage region of the TSHR ectodomain (C-TSHR-Abs) and induce thyroid cell apoptosis instead of stimulating the TSHR. We found that C-TSHR-Abs entered the cell through clathrin-mediated endocytosis but did not trigger endosomal maturation and failed to undergo normal vesicular sorting and trafficking. We found that stimulating TSHR-Abs (S-TSHR-Abs) activated Gα<sub>s</sub> and, to a lesser extent, Gα<sub>q</sub> but that C-TSHR-Abs failed to activate any of the G proteins normally activated in response to TSH. Furthermore, specific inhibition of G proteins in the presence of S-TSHR-mAbs or TSH resulted in a similar failure of endosomal maturation as that caused by C-TSHR-mAbs. Hence, whereas S-TSHR-mAbs and TSH contributed to normal vesicular trafficking of TSHR through the activation of major G proteins, the C-TSHR-Abs resulted in GRK2- and β-arrestin-1–dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>ed signaling, which is interpreted as a danger signal by the cell. Our observations suggest that the binding of antibodies to different TSHR epitopes may decrease cell survival. Antibody-induced cell injury and the response to cell death amplify the loss of self-tolerance, which most likely helps to perpetuate GPCR-mediated autoimmunity.</p>

Catalyst-controlled stereoselective cationic polymerization of vinyl ethers
<p>The tacticity of vinyl polymers has a profound effect on their physical properties.

We have designed chiral counterions that systematically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong> the reactivity and chain-end stereochemical environment during cationic polymerization. This approach overrides conventional chain-end stereochemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong> to achieve catalyst-controlled stereoselective polymerization. We demonstrate that this method is general to vinyl ether substrates, providing access to a range of isotactic poly(vinyl ether)s with high degrees of isotacticity. The obtained materials display the tensile properties of commercial polyolefins but adhere more strongly to polar substrates by an order of magnitude, indicating their promise for next-generation engineering applications.</p>

Earth and Moon impact flux increased at the end of the Paleozoic
<p>The terrestrial impact crater record is commonly assumed to be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>ed, with erosion thought to eliminate older craters, even on stable terrains. Given that the same projectile population strikes Earth and the Moon, terrestrial selection effects can be quantified by using a method to date lunar craters with diameters greater than 10 kilometers and younger than 1 billion years. We found that the impact rate increased by a factor of 2.6 about 290 million years ago. The terrestrial crater record shows similar results, suggesting that the deficit of large terrestrial craters between 300 million and 650 million years ago relative to more recent times stems from a lower impact flux, not preservation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>. The almost complete absence of terrestrial craters older than 650 million years may indicate a massive global-scale erosion event near that time.</p>

We introduce an approach to measurement based on a microwave photon counter demonstrating raw single-shot measurement fidelity of 92%. Moreover, the intrinsic damping of the photon counter is used to extract the energy released by the measurement process, allowing repeated high-fidelity quantum nondemolition measurements. Our scheme provides access to the classical outcome of projective quantum measurement at the millikelvin stage and could form the basis for a scalable quantum-to-classical interface.</p>

Microphase separation of the architecturally distinct blocks results in physically cross-linked networks that display vibrant color, extreme softness, and intense strain stiffening on par with that of skin tissue. Each of these functional properties is regulated by the structure of one macromolecule, without the need for chemical cross-linking or additives. These materials remain stable under conditions characteristic of internal bodily environments and under ambient conditions, neither swelling in bodily fluids nor drying when exposed to air.</p>

Conversion of object identity to object-general semantic value in the primate temporal cortex
<p>At the final stage of the ventral visual stream, perirhinal neurons encode the identity of memorized objects through learning. However, it remains elusive whether and how object percepts alone, or concomitantly a nonphysical attribute of the objects (“learned”), are decoded from perirhinal activities. By combining monkey psychophysics with optogenetic and electrical stimulations, we found a focal spot of memory neurons where both stimulations led monkeys to preferentially judge presented objects as “already seen.” In an adjacent fringe area, where neurons did not exhibit selective responses to the learned objects, electrical stimulation induced the opposite behavioral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong> toward “never seen before,” whereas optogenetic stimulation still induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong> toward “already seen.” These results suggest that mnemonic judgment of objects emerges via the decoding of their nonphysical attributes encoded by perirhinal neurons.</p>

Biased partitioning of the multidrug efflux pump AcrAB-TolC underlies long-lived phenotypic heterogeneity

Mother cells inheriting old poles are phenotypically distinct and display increased drug efflux activity relative to daughters. Consequently, we find systematic and long-lived growth differences between mother and daughter cells in the presence of subinhibitory drug concentrations. A simple model for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>ed partitioning predicts a population structure of long-lived and highly heterogeneous phenotypes. This straightforward mechanism of generating sustained growth rate differences at subinhibitory antibiotic concentrations has implications for understanding the emergence of multidrug resistance in bacteria.</p>

Observed Arctic sea-ice loss directly follows anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emission

The observed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linear</span></strong> relationship implies a sustained loss of 3 ± 0.3 square meters of September sea-ice area per metric ton of CO<sub>2</sub> emission. On the basis of this sensitivity, Arctic sea ice will be lost throughout September for an additional 1000 gigatons of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Most models show a lower sensitivity, which is possibly linked to an underestimation of the modeled increase in incoming longwave radiation and of the modeled transient climate response.</p>

Characterization and Cloning of Grape Circular RNAs Identified the Cold Resistance-Related <i>Vv-circATS1</i>
<p>Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are widely distributed and play essential roles in a series of developmental processes, although none have been identified or characterized in grapevines (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>). In this study, we characterized the function of grape circRNA and uncovered thousands of putative back-splicing sites by global transcriptome analysis. Our results indicated that several reported circRNA prediction algorithms should be used simultaneously to obtain comprehensive and reliable circRNA predictions in plants. Furthermore, the length of introns flanking grape circRNAs was closely related to exon circularization. Although the longer introns flanking grape circRNAs appeared to circularize more efficiently, a 20- to 50-nt region seemed large enough to drive grape circRNA biogenesis. In addition, the endogenous introns flanking circularized exon(s) in conjunction with reverse complementary sequences could support the accurate and efficient circularization of various exons in grape, which constitutes a new tool for exploring the functional consequences caused by circRNA expression. Finally, we identified 475 differentially expressed circRNAs in grape leaves under cold stress. Overexpression of <i>Vv-circATS1</i>, a circRNA derived from <i>glycerol-3-P acyltransferase</i>, improved cold tolerance in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), while the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linear</span></strong> RNA derived from the same sequence cannot.

The Mitochondrial Endonuclease M20 Participates in the Down-Regulation of Mitochondrial DNA in Pollen Cells
<p>Maintaining the appropriate number of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) molecules is crucial for supporting mitochondrial metabolism and function in both plant and animal cells. For example, a substantial decrease in mtDNA levels occurs as a key part of pollen development. The molecular mechanisms regulating mtDNA copy number are largely unclear, particularly with regard to those that reduce mtDNA levels. Here, we identified and purified a 20-kD endonuclease, M20, from maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) pollen mitochondria. We found M20 to be an His-Asn-His/Asn (H-N-H/N) nuclease that degrades <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linear</span></strong> and circular DNA in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> or Mn<sup>2+</sup>. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) AtM20, which shared high sequence similarity with maize M20, localized to the mitochondria, had a similar H-N-H/N structure, and degraded both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linear</span></strong> and circular DNA. <i>AtM20</i> transcript levels increased during pollen development, in parallel with a rapid reduction in mtDNA. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 genome-editing techniques were used to generate knockout lines of <i>AtM20</i> (<i>atm20</i>), which exhibited a significant delay in the reduction in mtDNA levels in pollen vegetative cells but normal mtDNA levels in somatic cells. The delayed reduction in pollen mtDNA levels was rescued by the transgenic expression of <i>AtM20</i> in <i>atm20</i> plants. This study thus uncovers an endonucleolytic DNase in plant mitochondria and its crucial role in reducing mtDNA levels, pointing to the complex mechanism regulating mtDNA levels in plants.</p>

Genome-Wide Biases in the Rate and Molecular Spectrum of Spontaneous Mutations in <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> and <i>Vibrio fischeri</i>
<p>The vast diversity in nucleotide composition and architecture among bacterial genomes may be partly explained by inherent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>es in the rates and spectra of spontaneous mutations. Bacterial genomes with multiple chromosomes are relatively unusual but some are relevant to human health, none more so than the causative agent of cholera, <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>. Here, we present the genome-wide mutation spectra in wild-type and mismatch repair (MMR) defective backgrounds of two <i>Vibrio</i> species, the low-%GC squid symbiont <i>V. fischeri</i> and the pathogen <i>V. cholerae</i>, collected under conditions that greatly minimize the efficiency of natural selection. In apparent contrast to their high diversity in nature, both wild-type <i>V. fischeri</i> and <i>V. cholerae</i> have among the lowest rates for base-substitution mutations (bpsms) and insertion–deletion mutations (indels) that have been measured, below 10<sup>−</sup><sup>3</sup>/genome/generation. <i>Vibrio fischeri</i> and <i>V. cholerae</i> have distinct mutation spectra, but both are AT-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>ed and produce a surprising number of multi-nucleotide indels. Furthermore, the loss of a functional MMR system caused the mutation spectra of these species to converge, implying that the MMR system itself contributes to species-specific mutation patterns. Bpsm and indel rates varied among genome regions, but do not explain the more rapid evolutionary rates of genes on chromosome 2, which likely result from weaker purifying selection. More generally, the very low mutation rates of <i>Vibrio</i> species correlate inversely with their immense population sizes and suggest that selection may not only have maximized replication fidelity but also optimized other polygenic traits relative to the constraints of genetic drift.</p>

Brown and Polar Bear Y Chromosomes Reveal Extensive Male-Biased Gene Flow within Brother Lineages
<p>Brown and polar bears have become prominent examples in phylogeography, but previous phylogeographic studies relied largely on maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or were geographically restricted. The male-specific Y chromosome, a natural counterpart to mtDNA, has remained underexplored. Although this paternally inherited chromosome is indispensable for comprehensive analyses of phylogeographic patterns, technical difficulties and low variability have hampered its application in most mammals. We developed 13 novel Y-chromosomal sequence and microsatellite markers from the polar bear genome and screened these in a broad geographic sample of 130 brown and polar bears. We also analyzed a 390-kb-long Y-chromosomal scaffold using sequencing data from published male ursine genomes. Y chromosome evidence support the emerging understanding that brown and polar bears started to diverge no later than the Middle Pleistocene. Contrary to mtDNA patterns, we found 1) brown and polar bears to be reciprocally monophyletic sister (or rather brother) lineages, without signals of introgression, 2) male-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>ed gene flow across continents and on phylogeographic time scales, and 3) male dispersal that links the Alaskan ABC islands population to mainland brown bears. Due to female philopatry, mtDNA provides a highly structured estimate of population differentiation, while male-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>ed gene flow is a homogenizing force for nuclear genetic variation. Our findings highlight the importance of analyzing both maternally and paternally inherited loci for a comprehensive view of phylogeographic history, and that mtDNA-based phylogeographic studies of many mammals should be reevaluated. Recent advances in sequencing technology render the analysis of Y-chromosomal variation feasible, even in nonmodel organisms.</p>

Dynamic use of optic flow during pheromone tracking by the male silkmoth, <i>Bombyx mori</i>
<p>Several insects require both olfactory and visual cues during odour-source localisation to successfully locate an odour source. In the male silkmoth, <i>Bombyx mori</i>, detection of the female sex pheromone triggers a programmed walking pattern, starting from a surge (straight-line walking) followed by zigzag walking. Although pheromone-triggered behaviour in silkmoths is well understood, the role of visual cues remains obscure. To address this question, we performed behavioural experiments on tethered-walking moths by recording their locomotion during stimulation with a pheromone and a visual motion pattern (optic flow). The experiments were conducted under open- and closed-loop visual stimuli. We found that the use of optic flow input was determined by the behavioural state of surge and zigzagging. Silkmoths exhibited an optomotor response, which is a behavioural visual response, by turning towards the same direction as optic flow stimuli only during surge, but not during zigzagging. In addition, modulation of the zigzag walking pattern was observed when the moths were presented with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>ed closed-loop visual stimuli (visual feedback with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong>ed constant optic flow); however, the directional preference mechanism was different from that of the optomotor response. Based on these findings, we suggest that the optomotor response is utilised for course control during straight-line walking, whereas the absence of optomotor response during zigzagging is used to effectively perform the programmed walking pattern. Considering the neural basis of programmed behaviour, we speculate that at least two visual pathways are involved in the state-dependent use of optic flow during odour tracking behaviour in silkmoths.</p>

<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to assess the reproducibility and validity   of cross table radiographs for measuring the anteversion of the   acetabular component after total hip arthroplasty (THA) and to compare   it with measurements using CT scans.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 29 patients who underwent THA between June 2010 and   January 2016 were included. There were 17 men and 12 women. Their   mean age was 43 years (26 to 65). Seven patients underwent a bilateral   procedure. Thus, 36 THAs were included in the study. Lateral radiographs   and CT scans were obtained post-operatively and radiographs repeated   three weeks later. The anteversion of the acetabular component was   measured using the method described by Woo and Morrey and the ischiolateral   method described by Pulos et al and these were compared with the   results obtained from CT scans.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean anteversion was 18.35° (3° to 38°) using Woo and Morrey’s   method, 51.45° (30° to 85°) using the ischiolateral method and 21.22°   (2° to 48°) using CT scans. The Pearson correlation coefficient   was 0.754 for Woo and Morrey’s method and 0.925 for the ischiolateral   method. There was a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linear</span></strong> correlation between the measurements   using the ischiolateral method and those using CT scans. We derived   a simple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linear</span></strong> equation between the value of the CT scan and that   of ischiolateral method to deduce the CT scan value from that of ischiolateral   method and <i>vice versa</i>. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The anteversion of the acetabular component measured using both   plain radiographic methods was consistently valid with good interobserver   reproducibility, but the ischiolateral method which is independent   of pelvic tilt was more accurate. As CT is costly, associated with   a high dose of radiation and not readily available, the ischiolateral method   can be used for assessing the anteversion of the acetabular component.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1006–11.</p></sec>

Prediction of the pre-morbid 3D anatomy of the proximal humerus based on statistical shape modelling
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Restoring the pre-morbid anatomy of the proximal humerus is a   goal of anatomical shoulder arthroplasty, but reliance is placed   on the surgeon’s experience and on anatomical estimations. The purpose   of this study was to present a novel method, ‘Statistical Shape   Modelling’, which accurately predicts the pre-morbid proximal humeral anatomy   and calculates the 3D geometric parameters needed to restore normal   anatomy in patients with severe degenerative osteoarthritis or a   fracture of the proximal humerus.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>From a database of 57 humeral CT scans 3D humeral reconstructions   were manually created. The reconstructions were used to construct   a statistical shape model (SSM), which was then tested on a second   set of 52 scans. For each humerus in the second set, 3D reconstructions   of four diaphyseal segments of varying lengths were created. These   reconstructions were chosen to mimic severe osteoarthritis, a fracture   of the surgical neck of the humerus and a proximal humeral fracture   with diaphyseal extension. The SSM was then applied to the diaphyseal   segments to see how well it predicted proximal morphology, using   the actual proximal humeral morphology for comparison.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>With the metaphysis included, mimicking osteoarthritis, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>s   of prediction for retroversion, inclination, height, radius of curvature   and posterior and medial offset of the head of the humerus were   2.9° (± 2.3°), 4.0° (± 3.3°), 1.0 mm (± 0.8 mm), 0.8 mm (± 0.6 mm),   0.7 mm (± 0.5 mm) and 1.0 mm (± 0.7 mm), respectively. With the   metaphysis excluded, mimicking a fracture of the surgical neck,   the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>s of prediction for retroversion, inclination, height, radius   of curvature and posterior and medial offset of the head of the   humerus were 3.8° (± 2.9°), 3.9° (± 3.4°), 2.4 mm (± 1.9 mm), 1.3   mm (± 0.9 mm), 0.8 mm    (± 0.5 mm) and 0.9 mm (± 0.6 mm), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study reports a novel, computerised method that accurately   predicts the pre-morbid proximal humeral anatomy even in challenging   situations. This information can be used in the surgical planning   and operative reconstruction of patients with severe degenerative   osteoarthritis or with a fracture of the proximal humerus.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:927–33.</p></sec>

Lumbar surgery prior to total hip arthroplasty is associated with worse patient-reported outcomes
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of this study were to describe the prevalence of previous   lumbar surgery in patients who undergo total hip arthroplasty (THA)   and to investigate their patient-reported outcomes (PROMs) one year   post-operatively.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Data from the Swedish Hip Arthroplasty Register and the Swedish   Spine Register gathered between 2002 and 2012 were merged to identify   a group of patients who had undergone lumbar surgery before THA   (n = 997) and a carefully matched one-to-one control group. We investigated   differences in the one-year post-operative PROMs between the groups.   Linear regression analyses were used to explore the associations   between previous lumbar surgery and these PROMs following THA. The   prevalence of prior lumbar surgery was calculated as the ratio of   patients identified with previous lumbar surgery between 2002 and   2012, and divided by the total number of patients who underwent   a THA in 2012.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The prevalence of lumbar surgery prior to THA in 2012 was 3.5%   (351 of 10 082). Linear regression analyses showed an association   with more pain (B = 4.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.57 to 6.12),   worse EuroQol (EQ)-5D index, (B = -0.089, 95% CI -0.112 to -0.066),   worse EQ VAS (B = -6.75, 95% CI -8.58 to -4.92), and less satisfaction   (B = 6.04, 95% CI 4.05 to 8.02).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Lumbar spinal surgery prior to THA is associated with less reduction   of pain, worse health-related quality of life, and less satisfaction   one year after THA. This is useful information to share in the decision-making   process and may help establish realistic expectations of the outcomes   of THA in patients who also have previously undergone lumbar spinal   surgery.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:759–65.</p></sec>

Quantifying the ‘law of diminishing returns’ in magnetically controlled growing rods
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Magnetically controlled growing rods (MCGRs) allow non-invasive   correction of the spinal deformity in the treatment of early-onset   scoliosis. Conventional growing rod systems (CGRS) need repeated   surgical distractions: these are associated with the effect of the   ‘law of diminishing returns’.</p><p>The primary aim of this study was to quantify this effect in   MCGRs over sequential distractions. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 35 patients with a maximum follow-up of 57 months   were included in the study. There were 17 boys and 18 girls with   a mean age of 7.4 years (2 to 14). True Distraction (TD) was determined   by measuring the expansion gap on fluoroscopy. This was compared   with Intended Distraction (ID) and expressed as the ‘T/I’ ratio.   The T/I ratio and the Cobb angle were calculated at several time   points during follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean follow-up was 30 months (6 to 57). There was a significant   decrease in the mean T/I ratio over time (convex rod at 3 months   0.81, <sc>sd</sc> 0.58 <i>vs</i> 51 months 0.17, <sc>sd </sc>0.16,    p = 0.0001; concave rod at 3 months 0.93, <sc>sd</sc> 0.67 <i>vs</i> 51   months 0.18, <sc>sd</sc> 0.15, p = 0.0001). A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linear</span></strong> decline of   the mean T/I ratios was noted for both convex rods (r<sup>2</sup> =   0.90, p = 0.004) and concave rods (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.81, p = 0.015)   over 51 months. At the 24-month follow-up stage, there was a significant   negative correlation between the mean T/I ratio of the concave rod   with weight (r = -0.59, p = 0.01), age (r = -0.59, p = 0.01), and   BMI of the child (r = -0.54,    p = 0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The ‘law of diminishing returns’ is also seen after serial distraction   using MCGR. Compared to previously published data for CGRS, there   is a gradual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linear</span></strong> decline rather than a rapid initial decline   in lengthening. In older, heavier children a reduced distraction   ratio in the concave rod of the MCGR device is noted over time.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1658–64.</p></sec>

Evaluation of Codon Biology in <i>Citrus</i> and <i>Poncirus trifoliata</i> Based on Genomic Features and Frame Corrected Expressed Sequence Tags
<p><i>Citrus</i>, as one of the globally important fruit trees, has been an object of interest for understanding genetics and evolutionary process in fruit crops. Meta-analyses of 19 <i>Citrus</i> species, including 4 globally and economically important <i>Citrus sinensis</i>, <i>Citrus clementina</i>, <i>Citrus reticulata</i>, and 1 <i>Citrus</i> relative <i>Poncirus trifoliata</i>, were performed. We observed that codons ending with A- or T- at the wobble position were preferred in contrast to C- or G- ending codons, indicating a close association with AT richness of <i>Citrus</i> species and <i>P. trifoliata</i>. The present study postulates a large repertoire of a set of optimal codons for the <i>Citrus</i> genus and <i>P. trifoliata</i> and demonstrates that GCT and GGT are evolutionary conserved optimal codons. Our observation suggested that mutational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong> is the dominating force in shaping the codon usage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bias</span></strong> (CUB) in <i>Citrus</i> and <i>P. trifoliata</i>. Correspondence analysis (COA) revealed that the principal axis [axis 1; COA/relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU)] contributes only a minor portion (∼10.96%) of the recorded variance. In all analysed species, except <i>P. trifoliata</i>, Gravy and aromaticity played minor roles in resolving CUB. Compositional constraints were found to be strongly associated with the amino acid signatures in <i>Citrus</i> species and <i>P. trifoliata</i>. Our present analysis postulates compositional constraints in <i>Citrus</i> species and <i>P. trifoliata</i> and plausible role of the stress with GC<sub>3</sub> and coevolution pattern of amino acid.</p>

Dual role for Hox genes and Hox co-factors in conferring leg motoneuron survival and identity in <i>Drosophila</i>
<p>Adult <i>Drosophila</i> walk using six multi-jointed legs, each controlled by ∼50 leg motoneurons (MNs). Although MNs have stereotyped morphologies, little is known about how they are specified. Here, we describe the function of Hox genes and <i>homothorax</i> (<i>hth</i>), which encodes a Hox co-factor, in <i>Drosophila</i> leg MN development. Removing either Hox or Hth function from a single neuroblast (NB) lineage results in MN apoptosis. A single Hox gene, <i>Antennapedia</i> (<i>Antp</i>), is primarily responsible for MN survival in all three thoracic segments. When cell death is blocked, partially penetrant axon branching <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>s are observed in Hox mutant MNs. When single MNs are mutant, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>s in both dendritic and axon arborizations are observed. Our data also suggest that Antp levels in post-mitotic MNs are important for specifying their identities. Thus, in addition to being essential for survival, Hox and <i>hth</i> are required to specify accurate MN morphologies in a level-dependent manner.</p>

Association Between Urinary Sodium and Potassium Excretion and Blood Pressure Among Adults in the United States
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Higher levels of sodium and lower levels of potassium intake are associated with higher blood pressure. However, the shape and magnitude of these associations can vary by study participant characteristics or intake assessment method. Twenty-four–hour urinary excretion of sodium and potassium are unaffected by recall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>s and represent all sources of intake, and were collected for the first time in a nationally representative US survey. Our objective was to assess the associations of blood pressure and hypertension with 24-hour urinary excretion of sodium and potassium among US adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Cross-sectional data were obtained from 766 participants age 20 to 69 years with complete blood pressure and 24-hour urine collections in the 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a nationally representative survey of the US noninstitutionalized population. Usual 24-hour urinary electrolyte excretion (sodium, potassium, and their ratio) was estimated from ≤2 collections on nonconsecutive days, adjusting for day-to-day variability in excretion. Outcomes included systolic and diastolic blood pressure from the average of 3 measures and hypertension status, based on average blood pressure ≥140/90 and antihypertensive medication use.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>After multivariable adjustment, each 1000-mg difference in usual 24-hour sodium excretion was directly associated with systolic (4.58 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.64–6.51) and diastolic (2.25 mm Hg; 95% CI, 0.83–3.67) blood pressures. Each 1000-mg difference in potassium excretion was inversely associated with systolic blood pressure (–3.72 mm Hg; 95% CI, –6.01 to –1.42). Each 0.5 U difference in sodium-to-potassium ratio was directly associated with systolic blood pressure (1.72 mm Hg; 95% CI, 0.76–2.68). Hypertension was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linear</span></strong>ly associated with progressively higher sodium and lower potassium excretion; in comparison with the lowest quartile of excretion, the adjusted odds of hypertension for the highest quartile was 4.22 (95% CI, 1.36–13.15) for sodium, and 0.38 (95% CI, 0.17–0.87) for potassium (<i>P</i><0.01 for trends).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These cross-sectional results show a strong dose-response association between urinary sodium excretion and blood pressure, and an inverse association between urinary potassium excretion and blood pressure, in a nationally representative sample of US adults.</p></sec>

Cardiovascular Risk Prediction Functions Underestimate Risk in HIV Infection
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk is elevated in HIV-infected individuals, with contributions from both traditional and nontraditional risk factors. The accuracy of established CVD risk prediction functions in HIV is uncertain. We sought to assess the performance of 3 established CVD risk prediction functions in a longitudinal cohort of HIV-infected men.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The FHS (Framingham Heart Study) functions for hard coronary heart disease (FHS CHD) and atherosclerotic CVD (FHS ASCVD) and the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association ASCVD function were applied to the Partners HIV cohort. Risk scores were calculated between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2008. Outcomes included CHD (myocardial infarction or coronary death) for the FHS CHD function and ASCVD (myocardial infarction, stroke, or coronary death) for the FHS ASCVD and American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association ASCVD functions. We investigated the accuracy of CVD risk prediction for each function when applied to the HIV cohort using comparison of Cox regression coefficients, discrimination, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calibr</span></strong>ation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The HIV cohort was comprised of 1272 men followed for a median of 4.4 years. There were 78 (6.1%) ASCVD events; the 5-year incidence rate was 16.4 per 1000 person-years. Discrimination was moderate to poor as indicated by the low <i>c</i> statistic (0.68 for FHS CHD, 0.65 for American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association ASCVD, and 0.67 for FHS ASCVD). Observed CVD risk exceeded the predicted risk for each of the functions in most deciles of predicted risk. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calibr</span></strong>ation, or goodness of fit of the models, was consistently poor, with significant χ<sup>2</sup> <i>P</i> values for all functions. Re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calibr</span></strong>ation did not significantly improve model fit.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Cardiovascular risk prediction functions developed for use in the general population are inaccurate in HIV infection and systematically underestimate risk in a cohort of HIV-infected men. Development of tailored CVD risk prediction functions incorporating traditional CVD risk factors and HIV-specific factors is likely to result in more accurate risk estimation to guide preventative CVD care.</p></sec>

Increase in Endovascular Therapy in Get With The Guidelines-Stroke After the Publication of Pivotal Trials
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Beginning in December 2014, a series of pivotal trials showed that endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) was highly effective, prompting calls to reorganize stroke systems of care. However, there are few data on how these trials influenced the frequency of EVT in clinical practice. We used data from the Get With The Guidelines-Stroke program to determine how the frequency of EVT changed in US practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We analyzed prospectively collected data from a cohort of 2 437 975 patients with ischemic stroke admitted to 2222 participating hospitals between April 2003 and the third quarter of 2016. Weighted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linear</span></strong> regression with 2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linear</span></strong> splines and a knot at January 2015 was used to compare the slope of the change in EVT use before and after the pivotal trials were published. Potentially eligible patients were defined as last known well to arrival time ≤4.5 hours and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score ≥6.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The frequency of EVT use was slowly increasing before January 2015 but then sharply accelerated thereafter. In the third quarter 2016, EVT was provided to 3.3% of all patients with ischemic stroke at all hospitals, representing 15.1% of all patients who were potentially eligible for EVT based on stroke duration and severity. At EVT-capable hospitals, 7.5% of all patients with ischemic stroke were treated in the third quarter of 2016, including 27.3% of the potentially eligible patients. From 2013 to 2016, case volumes nearly doubled at EVT-capable hospitals. Mean case volume per EVT-capable hospital was 37.6 per year in the last 4 quarters. EVT case volumes increased in nearly all US states from 2014 to the last 4 quarters, but with persistent geographic variation unexplained by differences in potential patient eligibility.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>EVT use is increasing rapidly; however, there are still opportunities to treat more patients. Reorganizing stroke systems to route patients to adequately resourced EVT-capable hospitals might increase treatment of eligible patients, improve outcomes, and reduce disparities.</p></sec>

Age and Outcomes of Primary Prevention Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators in Patients With Nonischemic Systolic Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The DANISH study (Danish Study to Assess the Efficacy of ICDs [Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators] in Patients With Non-Ischemic Systolic Heart Failure on Mortality) did not demonstrate an overall effect on all-cause mortality with ICD implantation. However, the prespecified subgroup analysis suggested a possible age-dependent association between ICD implantation and mortality with survival benefit seen only in the youngest patients. The nature of this relationship between age and outcome of a primary prevention ICD in patients with nonischemic systolic heart failure warrants further investigation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>All 1116 patients from the DANISH study were included in this prespecified subgroup analysis. We assessed the relationship between ICD implantation and mortality by age, and an optimal age cutoff was estimated nonparametrically with selection impact curves. Modes of death were divided into sudden cardiac death and nonsudden death and compared between patients younger and older than this age cutoff with the use of χ<sup>2</sup> analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Median age of the study population was 63 years (range, 21–84 years). There was a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linear</span></strong>ly decreasing relationship between ICD and mortality with age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.003–1.06; <i>P</i>=0.03). An optimal age cutoff for ICD implantation was present at ≤70 years. There was an association between reduced all-cause mortality and ICD in patients ≤70 years of age (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.51–0.96; <i>P</i>=0.03) but not in patients >70 years of age (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.68–1.62; <i>P</i>=0.84). For patients ≤70 years old, the sudden cardiac death rate was 1.8 (95% CI, 1.3–2.5) and nonsudden death rate was 2.7 (95% CI, 2.1–3.5) events per 100 patient-years, whereas for patients >70 years old, the sudden cardiac death rate was 1.6 (95% CI, 0.8–3.2) and nonsudden death rate was 5.4 (95% CI, 3.7–7.8) events per 100 patient-years. This difference in modes of death between the 2 age groups was statistically significant (<i>P</i>=0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In patients with systolic heart failure not caused by ischemic heart disease, the association between the ICD and survival decreased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linear</span></strong>ly with increasing age.

Performance and Validation of a Novel Biomarker-Based Stroke Risk Score for Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Atrial fibrillation is associated with increased but variable risk of stroke. Our aim was to validate the recently developed biomarker-based ABC (age, biomarkers [high-sensitivity troponin and N-terminal fragment B-type natriuretic peptide], and clinical history of prior stroke/transient ischemic attack)-stroke risk score and compare its performance with the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>VASc and ATRIA (Anticoagulation and Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation) risk scores.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The ABC-stroke score includes age, biomarkers (N-terminal fragment B-type natriuretic peptide and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin), and clinical history (prior stroke). This validation was based on 8356 patients, 16 137 person-years of follow-up, and 219 adjudicated stroke or systemic embolic events in anticoagulated patients with atrial fibrillation in the RE-LY study (Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy). Levels of N-terminal fragment B-type natriuretic peptide, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT), and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) were determined in plasma samples obtained at study entry.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The ABC-stroke score was well <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calibr</span></strong>ated with 0.76 stroke/systemic embolic events per 100 person-years in the predefined low (<1%/y) risk group, 1.48 in the medium (1%–2%/y) risk group, and 2.60 in the high (>2%/y) risk group for the ABC-stroke score with hs-cTnT. Hazard ratios for stroke/systemic embolic events were 1.95 for medium- versus low-risk groups, and 3.44 for high- versus low-risk groups. ABC-stroke score achieved <i>C</i> indices of 0.65 with both hs-cTnT and hs-cTnI, in comparison with 0.60 for CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>VASc (<i>P</i>=0.004 for hs-cTnT and <i>P</i>=0.022 hs-cTnI) and 0.61 for ATRIA scores (<i>P</i>=0.005 hs-cTnT and <i>P</i>=0.034 for hs-cTnI).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The biomarker-based ABC-stroke score was well <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calibr</span></strong>ated and consistently performed better than both the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>VASc and ATRIA stroke scores.

Predicting the 10-Year Risks of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease in Chinese Population
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The accurate assessment of individual risk can be of great value to guiding and facilitating the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). However, prediction models in common use were formulated primarily in white populations. The China-PAR project (Prediction for ASCVD Risk in China) is aimed at developing and validating 10-year risk prediction equations for ASCVD from 4 contemporary Chinese cohorts.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Two prospective studies followed up together with a unified protocol were used as the derivation cohort to develop 10-year ASCVD risk equations in 21 320 Chinese participants. The external validation was evaluated in 2 independent Chinese cohorts with 14 123 and 70 838 participants. Furthermore, model performance was compared with the Pooled Cohort Equations reported in the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Over 12 years of follow-up in the derivation cohort with 21 320 Chinese participants, 1048 subjects developed a first ASCVD event. Sex-specific equations had C statistics of 0.794 (95% confidence interval, 0.775–0.814) for men and 0.811 (95% confidence interval, 0.787–0.835) for women. The predicted rates were similar to the observed rates, as indicated by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calibr</span></strong>ation χ<sup>2</sup> of 13.1 for men (<i>P</i>=0.16) and 12.8 for women (<i>P</i>=0.17). Good internal and external validations of our equations were achieved in subsequent analyses. Compared with the Chinese equations, the Pooled Cohort Equations had lower C statistics and much higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calibr</span></strong>ation χ<sup>2</sup> values in men.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our project developed effective tools with good performance for 10-year ASCVD risk prediction among a Chinese population that will help to improve the primary prevention and management of cardiovascular disease.</p></sec>

Contextual interference during adaptation to asymmetric split-belt treadmill walking results in transfer of unique gait mechanics
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Specific biomechanical gait adaptations occur as a result of variance of stepping <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>s during walking. Humans optimize a novel gait pattern based on different levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong> variance.</p>

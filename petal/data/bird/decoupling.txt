A coupled-clock system drives the automaticity of human sinoatrial nodal pacemaker cells
<p>The spontaneous rhythmic action potentials generated by the sinoatrial node (SAN), the primary pacemaker in the heart, dictate the regular and optimal cardiac contractions that pump blood around the body. Although the heart rate of humans is substantially slower than that of smaller experimental animals, current perspectives on the biophysical mechanisms underlying the automaticity of sinoatrial nodal pacemaker cells (SANCs) have been gleaned largely from studies of animal hearts. Using human SANCs, we demonstrated that spontaneous rhythmic local Ca<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>es generated by a Ca<sup>2+</sup> clock were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed to electrogenic surface membrane molecules (the M clock) to trigger rhythmic action potentials, and that Ca<sup>2+</sup>–cAMP–protein kinase A (PKA) signaling regulated clock <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing. When these clocks became un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed, SANCs failed to generate spontaneous action potentials, showing a depolarized membrane potential and disorganized local Ca<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>es that failed to activate the M clock. β-Adrenergic receptor (β-AR) stimulation, which increases cAMP concentrations and clock <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing in other species, restored spontaneous, rhythmic action potentials in some nonbeating “arrested” human SANCs by increasing intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations and synchronizing diastolic local Ca<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>es. When β-AR stimulation was withdrawn, the clocks again became un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed, and SANCs reverted to a nonbeating arrested state. Thus, automaticity of human pacemaker cells is driven by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed-clock system driven by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-cAMP-PKA signaling. Extreme clock un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing led to failure of spontaneous action potential generation, which was restored by re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing of the clocks. Clock <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing and action potential firing in some of these arrested cells can be restored by β-AR stimulation–induced augmentation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-cAMP-PKA signaling.</p>

Ligand- and voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels differentially regulate the mode of vesicular neuropeptide release in mammalian sensory neurons
<p>Neuropeptides <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>ed from dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons play essential roles in the neurotransmission of sensory inputs, including those underlying nociception and pathological pain. Neuropeptides are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>ed from intracellular vesicles through two modes: a partial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e mode called “kiss-and-run” (KAR) and a full <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e mode called “full fusion–like” (FFL). Using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, we traced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e of pH-sensitive green fluorescent protein–tagged neuropeptide Y (pHluorin-NPY) from individual dense-core vesicles in the soma and axon of single DRG neurons after Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through either voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VGCCs) or ligand-gated transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channels. We found that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through VGCCs stimulated FFL and a greater single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e of neuropeptides. In contrast, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through TRPV1 channels stimulated KAR and a pulsed but prolonged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e of neuropeptides that was partially mediated by Dynamin 1, which limits fusion pore expansion. Suppressing the Ca<sup>2+</sup> gradient to an extent similar to that seen after TRPV1 activation abolished the VGCC preference for FFL. The findings suggest that by generating a steeper Ca<sup>2+</sup> gradient, VGCCs promote a more robust fusion pore opening that facilitates FFL. Thus, KAR and FFL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e modes are differentially regulated by the two principal types of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable channels in DRG neurons.</p>

Unusual transcription factor protects against heart failure
<p>The heart pumps blood to the rest of the body in a coordinated and steadfast manner. This pumping function is achieved through synchronous contraction of billions of cardiomyocytes (heart muscle cells), which is governed by phasic increases in intracellular calcium. As such, cardiomyocytes have evolved intricate cellular structures that tightly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>e external electrical impulses to the triggering of calcium ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e from intracellular stores and subsequent activation of force-producing proteins, a process termed excitation-contraction (E-C) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing. A key component of this molecular ultrastructure is the cardiac dyad, a microdomain that juxtaposes the plasma membrane L-type calcium channel with the calcium-sensitive ryanodine receptor (RyR) channel complex, the molecular gatekeeper for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e of calcium ions from sarcoplasmic reticulum stores in cardiomyocytes. The cardiac dyad is physically stabilized by a membrane-associated scaffold protein called junctophilin-2 (JP2), which facilitates physiologic calcium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e during E-C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing. Excessive stress or injury to cardiomyocytes results in defective E-C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing, reduced pumping capacity, and the clinical syndrome of heart failure, a leading cause of death worldwide. On page 1375 of this issue, Guo <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) report the surprising discovery that during cardiac stress, a proteolytically cleaved fragment of JP2 can translocate to the cardiomyocyte nucleus and function as a transcription factor that can protect against heart failure pathogenesis. Thus, in addition to its “day job” as a structural protein, this suggest that JP2 can “moonlight” in the nucleus as part of a homeostatic feedback response to cardiac stress.</p>

Chemical synapses without synaptic vesicles: Purinergic neurotransmission through a CALHM1 channel-mitochondrial signaling complex
<p>Conventional chemical synapses in the nervous system involve a presynaptic accumulation of neurotransmitter-containing vesicles, which fuse with the plasma membrane to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e neurotransmitters that activate postsynaptic receptors. In taste buds, type II receptor cells do not have conventional synaptic features but nonetheless show regulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e of their afferent neurotransmitter, ATP, through a large-pore, voltage-gated channel, CALHM1. Immunohistochemistry revealed that CALHM1 was localized to points of contact between the receptor cells and sensory nerve fibers. Ultrastructural and super-resolution light microscopy showed that the CALHM1 channels were consistently associated with distinctive, large (1- to 2-μm) mitochondria spaced 20 to 40 nm from the presynaptic membrane. Pharmacological disruption of the mitochondrial respiratory chain limited the ability of taste cells to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e ATP, suggesting that the immediate source of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>ed ATP was the mitochondrion rather than a cytoplasmic pool of ATP. These large mitochondria may serve as both a reservoir of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>able ATP and the site of synthesis. The juxtaposition of the large mitochondria to areas of membrane displaying CALHM1 also defines a restricted compartment that limits the influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> upon opening of the nonselective CALHM1 channels. These findings reveal a distinctive organelle signature and functional organization for regulated, focal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e of purinergic signals in the absence of synaptic vesicles.</p>

Microtubule structures underlying the sarcoplasmic reticulum support peripheral coupling sites to regulate smooth muscle contractility
<p>Junctional membrane complexes facilitate excitation-contraction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing in skeletal and cardiac muscle cells by forming subcellular invaginations that maintain close (≤20 nm) proximity of ryanodine receptors (RyRs) on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) with voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in the plasma membrane. In fully differentiated smooth muscle cells, junctional membrane complexes occur as distributed sites of peripheral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing. We investigated the role of the cytoskeleton in maintaining peripheral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing and associated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling networks within native smooth muscle cells of mouse and rat cerebral arteries. Using live-cell confocal and superresolution microscopy, we found that the tight interactions between the SR and the plasma membrane in these cells relied on arching microtubule structures present at the periphery of smooth muscle cells and were independent of the actin cytoskeleton. Loss of peripheral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing associated with microtubule depolymerization altered the spatiotemporal properties of localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks generated by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e of Ca<sup>2+</sup> through type 2 RyRs (RyR2s) on the SR and decreased the number of sites of colocalization between RyR2s and large-conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> (BK) channels. The reduced BK channel activity associated with the loss of SR–plasma membrane interactions was accompanied by increased pressure–induced constriction of cerebral resistance arteries. We conclude that microtubule structures maintain peripheral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing in contractile smooth muscle cells, which is crucial for the regulation of contractility and cerebral vascular tone.</p>

Heterobiaryl synthesis by contractive C–C coupling via P(V) intermediates

Mechanistic studies imply that ligand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing is an asynchronous process involving migration of one heterocycle to the ipso position of the other around a central pentacoordinate P(V) atom. The strategy can be applied to complex drug-like molecules containing multiple reactive sites and polar functional groups, and also enables convergent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing of drug fragments and late-stage heteroarylation of pharmaceuticals.</p>

An in Vivo Imaging Assay Detects Spatial Variability in Glucose Release from Plant Roots
<p>Plants secrete a plethora of metabolites into the rhizosphere that allow them to obtain nutrients necessary for growth and modify microbial communities around the roots. Plants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e considerable amounts of photosynthetically fixed carbon into the rhizosphere; hence, it is important to understand how carbon moves from the roots into the rhizosphere. Approaches used previously to address this question involved radioactive tracers, fluorescent probes, and biosensors to study sugar movement in the roots and into the rhizosphere. Although quite effective for studying sugar movement, it has been challenging to obtain data on spatial and temporal variability in sugar exudation using these techniques. In this study, we developed a gel-based enzyme-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed colorimetric and fluorometric assay to image glucose (Glc) in vivo and used this assay to show that there is spatial variability in Glc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e from plant roots.

These findings were confirmed independently by quantifying Glc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e in well-watered and water-stressed maize primary roots using high-performance anion-exchange chromatography. Additionally, we demonstrated differential patterns of Glc exudation in different monocot and eudicot plant species.

Transcriptome and Degradome Sequencing Reveals Dormancy Mechanisms of <i>Cunninghamia lanceolata</i> Seeds<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Seeds with physiological dormancy usually experience primary and secondary dormancy in the nature; however, little is known about the differential regulation of primary and secondary dormancy. We combined multiple approaches to investigate cytological changes, hormonal levels, and gene expression dynamics in <i>Cunninghamia lanceolata</i> seeds during primary dormancy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e and secondary dormancy induction. Light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy revealed that protein bodies in the embryo cells coalesced during primary dormancy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e and then separated during secondary dormancy induction. Transcriptomic profiling demonstrated that expression of genes negatively regulating gibberellic acid (GA) sensitivity reduced specifically during primary dormancy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e, whereas the expression of genes positively regulating abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis increased during secondary dormancy induction. Parallel analysis of RNA ends revealed uncapped transcripts for ∼55% of all unigenes. A negative correlation between fold changes in expression levels of uncapped versus capped mRNAs was observed during primary dormancy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e. However, this correlation was loose during secondary dormancy induction. Our analyses suggest that the reversible changes in cytology and gene expression during dormancy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e and induction are related to ABA/GA balance. Moreover, mRNA degradation functions as a critical posttranscriptional regulator during primary dormancy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e. These findings provide a mechanistic framework for understanding physiological dormancy in seeds.</p>

CRAC channels regulate astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and gliotransmitter release to modulate hippocampal GABAergic transmission
<p>Astrocytes are the major glial subtype in the brain and mediate numerous functions ranging from metabolic support to gliotransmitter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e through signaling mechanisms controlled by Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Despite intense interest, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx pathways in astrocytes remain obscure, hindering mechanistic insights into how Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed to downstream astrocyte-mediated effector functions. Here, we identified store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e–activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> (CRAC) channels encoded by Orai1 and STIM1 as a major route of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry for driving sustained and oscillatory Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in astrocytes after stimulation of metabotropic purinergic and protease-activated receptors. Using synaptopHluorin as an optical reporter, we showed that the opening of astrocyte CRAC channels stimulated vesicular exocytosis to mediate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e of gliotransmitters, including ATP. Furthermore, slice electrophysiological recordings showed that activation of astrocytes by protease-activated receptors stimulated interneurons in the CA1 hippocampus to increase inhibitory postsynaptic currents on CA1 pyramidal cells. These results reveal a central role for CRAC channels as regulators of astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, gliotransmitter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e, and astrocyte-mediated tonic inhibition of CA1 pyramidal neurons.</p>

Hippocampal mGluR1-dependent long-term potentiation requires NAADP-mediated acidic store Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling

In neurons, NAADP and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling contribute to synaptic plasticity, a process of activity-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) [or, alternatively, long-term depression (LTD)] of synaptic strength and neuronal transmission that is critical for neuronal function and memory formation.

Mitotic phosphorylation regulates Hsp72 spindle localization by uncoupling ATP binding from substrate release
<p>Hsp72 is a member of the 70-kDa heat shock family of molecular chaperones (Hsp70s) that comprise a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and a substrate-binding domain (SBD) connected by a linker that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>es the exchange of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e of the protein substrate. Mitotic phosphorylation of Hsp72 by the kinase NEK6 at Thr<sup>66</sup> located in the NBD promotes the localization of Hsp72 to the mitotic spindle and is required for efficient spindle assembly and chromosome congression and segregation. We determined the crystal structure of the Hsp72 NBD containing a genetically encoded phosphoserine at position 66. This revealed structural changes that stabilized interactions between subdomains within the NBD. ATP binding to the NBD of unmodified Hsp72 resulted in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e of substrate from the SBD, but phosphorylated Hsp72 retained substrate in the presence of ATP. Mutations that prevented phosphorylation-dependent subdomain interactions restored the connection between ATP binding and substrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e.

Plasticity in the Neurotransmitter Repertoire
<p>In the earliest days of neuroscience, it was thought that a neuron made and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>ed only a single chemical, known as a neurotransmitter, to send a signal across a synapse to an adjacent neuron (<i>1</i>). At the same time, it was deeply mysterious why so many signaling molecules were used in nervous systems. Subsequently, it became clear that many, if not most, neurons (including those in mammals) make and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e two or more neurotransmitters including small-molecules and neuropeptides (<i>2</i>–<i>4</i>). As the list of these potential cotransmitters and their receptors has increased, we are faced with understanding the functional relevance of this embarrassment of riches for neural circuits and behavior. Neurotransmitters and neuromodulators (substances often <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>ed with small-molecule neurotransmitters) can elicit a variety of different actions on their neuron targets, including directly opening ion channels or acting through signal transduction pathways to alter neuronal excitability or synaptic transmission. Thus, characterizing the mixture of cotransmitters <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>ed by a neuron is important for understanding how neuronal circuits operate. The mechanisms that change the profile of neurotransmitter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e provide opportunities for plastic changes in circuit function, and consequently in organism behavior. On page 449 of this issue, Dulcis <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) report changes in the neurotransmitter profile of neurons that underlie photoperiod-triggered changes in animal behavior. The findings argue that neurotransmitter switching is a new mechanism for neuroplasticity (<i>6</i>) in adult nervous systems.</p>

Spatiotemporal Coupling of Vessel Cavitation and Discharge of Stored Xylem Water in a Tree Sapling
<p>Water discharge from stem internal storage compartments is thought to minimize the risk of vessel cavitation. Based on this concept, one would expect that water storage compartments involved in the buffering of xylem tensions empty before the onset of vessel cavitation under drought stress, and potentially refill after soil saturation. However, scant in vivo data exist that elucidate this localized spatiotemporal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing. In this study on intact saplings of American chestnut (<i>Castanea dentata</i>), x-ray computed microtomography (microCT) showed that the xylem matrix surrounding vessels <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>es stored water and becomes air-filled either concurrent to or after vessel cavitation under progressive drought stress. Among annual growth rings, the xylem matrix of the current year remained largely water-filled even under severe drought stress. In comparison, microtomography images collected on excised stems showed that applied pressures of much greater than 0 MPa were required to induce water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e from the xylem matrix. Viability staining highlighted that water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e from the xylem matrix was associated primarily with emptying of dead fibers. Refilling of the xylem matrix and vessels was detected in intact saplings when the canopy was bagged and stem water potential was close to 0 MPa, and in leafless saplings over the winter period. In conclusion, this study indicates that the bulk of water stored in the xylem matrix is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>ed after the onset of vessel cavitation, and suggests that capillary water contributes to overall stem water storage under drought but is not used primarily for the prevention of drought-induced vessel cavitation in this species.</p>

Evolutionary and Functional Analysis of Membrane-Bound NAC Transcription Factor Genes in Soybean
<p>Functional divergence is thought to be an important evolutionary driving force for the retention of duplicate genes. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) membrane-bound NAC transcription factor (NTL) genes. NTLs are thought to be components of stress signaling and unique in their requirement for proteolytic cleavage to free them from the membrane. Most of the 15 <i>GmNTL</i> genes appear to have evolved under strong purifying selection. By analyzing the phylogenetic tree and gene synteny, we identified seven duplicate gene pairs generated by the latest whole-genome duplication. The members of each pair were shown to have variously diverged at the transcriptional (organ specificity and responsiveness to stress), posttranscriptional (alternative splicing), and protein (proteolysis-mediated membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e and transactivation activity) levels. The dormant (full-length protein) and active (protein without a transmembrane motif) forms of one pair of duplicated gene products (GmNTL1/GmNLT11) were each separately constitutively expressed in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The heteroexpression of active but not dormant forms of these proteins caused improved tolerance to abiotic stresses, suggesting that membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e was required for their functionality. Arabidopsis carrying the dormant form of GmNTL1 was more tolerant to hydrogen peroxide, which induces its membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e. Tolerance was not increased in the line carrying dormant GmNTL11, which was not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>ed by hydrogen peroxide treatment.

Detailed Echocardiographic Phenotyping in Breast Cancer Patients
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiovascular disease in patients with breast cancer is of growing concern. The longitudinal effects of commonly used therapies, including doxorubicin and trastuzumab, on cardiac remodeling and function remain unknown in this population. We aimed to define the changes in echocardiographic parameters of structure, function, and ventricular-arterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing, and their associations with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and heart failure symptoms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a longitudinal prospective cohort study of 277 breast cancer participants receiving doxorubicin (Dox), trastuzumab (Tras), or both (Dox+Tras), we obtained 1249 echocardiograms over a median follow-up of 2.0 (interquartile range, 1.0–3.0) years. Left ventricular structure, diastolic and contractile function, and ventricular-arterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing measures were quantified in a core laboratory blinded to participant characteristics. We evaluated changes in echocardiographic parameters over time, and used repeated-measures regression models to define their association with LVEF decline and recovery.

With Dox, there was a sustained, modest decrease in LVEF over the follow-up duration (1-year change in LVEF –3.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI], –4.4% to –2.8%; 3-year change –3.8%; 95% CI, –5.1% to –2.5%). With Tras, a similar LVEF decline was observed at 1 year (–4.5%; 95% CI, –6.0% to –2.9%) and 3 years (–2.8%; 95%CI, –5.3 to –0.4%).

Photoperiod and temperature responses of bud swelling and bud burst in four temperate forest tree species
<p>Spring phenology of temperate forest trees is optimized to maximize the length of the growing season while minimizing the risk of freezing damage. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e from winter dormancy is environmentally mediated by species-specific responses to temperature and photoperiod. We investigated the response of early spring phenology to temperature and photoperiod at different stages of dormancy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e in cuttings from four temperate tree species in controlled environments. By tracking bud development, we were able to identify the onset of bud swelling and bud growth in <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> L., <i>Fagus sylvatica</i> L., <i>Quercus petraea</i> (Mattuschka) Liebl. and <i>Picea abies</i> (L.) H. Karst. At a given early stage of dormancy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e, the onset and duration of the bud swelling prior to bud burst are driven by concurrent temperature and photoperiod, while the maximum growth rate is temperature dependent only, except for <i>Fagus</i>, where long photoperiods also increased bud growth rates. Similarly, the later bud burst was controlled by temperature and photoperiod (in the photoperiod sensitive species <i>Fagus, Quercus</i> and <i>Picea</i>). We conclude that photoperiod is involved in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e of dormancy during the ecodormancy phase and may influence bud burst in trees that have experienced sufficient chilling. This study explored and documented the early bud swelling period that precedes and defines later phenological stages such as canopy greening in conventional phenological works. It is the early bud growth resumption that needs to be understood in order to arrive at a causal interpretation and modelling of tree phenology at a large scale. Classic spring phenology events mark visible endpoints of a cascade of processes as evidenced here.</p>

Disabling the Gβγ-SNARE interaction disrupts GPCR-mediated presynaptic inhibition, leading to physiological and behavioral phenotypes
<p>G protein–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed receptors (GPCRs) that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>e to G<sub>i/o</sub> proteins modulate neurotransmission presynaptically by inhibiting exocytosis. Release of Gβγ subunits from activated G proteins decreases the activity of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VGCCs), decreasing excitability. A less understood Gβγ-mediated mechanism downstream of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry is the binding of Gβγ to SNARE complexes, which facilitate the fusion of vesicles with the cell plasma membrane in exocytosis. Here, we generated mice expressing a form of the SNARE protein SNAP25 with premature truncation of the C terminus and that were therefore partially deficient in this interaction. SNAP25Δ3 homozygote mice exhibited normal presynaptic inhibition by GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors, which inhibit VGCCs, but defective presynaptic inhibition by receptors that work directly on the SNARE complex, such as 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) 5-HT<sub>1b</sub> receptors and adrenergic α<sub>2a</sub> receptors. Simultaneously stimulating receptors that act through both mechanisms showed synergistic inhibitory effects. SNAP25Δ3 homozygote mice had various behavioral phenotypes, including increased stress-induced hyperthermia, defective spatial learning, impaired gait, and supraspinal nociception. These data suggest that the inhibition of exocytosis by G<sub>i/o</sub>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed GPCRs through the Gβγ-SNARE interaction is a crucial component of numerous physiological and behavioral processes.</p>

Rapid change of superconductivity and electron-phonon coupling through critical doping in Bi-2212
<p>Electron-boson <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing plays a key role in superconductivity for many systems. However, in copper-based high–critical temperature (<i>T</i><sub>c</sub>) superconductors, its relation to superconductivity remains controversial despite strong spectroscopic fingerprints. In this study, we used angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to find a pronounced correlation between the superconducting gap and the bosonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing strength near the Brillouin zone boundary in Bi<sub>2</sub>Sr<sub>2</sub>CaCu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8+δ</sub>. The bosonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing strength rapidly increases from the overdoped Fermi liquid regime to the optimally doped strange metal, concomitant with the quadrupled superconducting gap and the doubled gap-to-<i>T</i><sub>c</sub> ratio across the pseudogap boundary. This synchronized lattice and electronic response suggests that the effects of electronic interaction and the electron-phonon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing (EPC) reinforce each other in a positive-feedback loop upon entering the strange-metal regime, which in turn drives a stronger superconductivity.</p>

Femtosecond electron-phonon lock-in by photoemission and x-ray free-electron laser
<p>The interactions that lead to the emergence of superconductivity in iron-based materials remain a subject of debate. It has been suggested that electron-electron correlations enhance electron-phonon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing in iron selenide (FeSe) and related pnictides, but direct experimental verification has been lacking. Here we show that the electron-phonon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing strength in FeSe can be quantified by combining two time-domain experiments into a “coherent lock-in” measurement in the terahertz regime. X-ray diffraction tracks the light-induced femtosecond coherent lattice motion at a single phonon frequency, and photoemission monitors the subsequent coherent changes in the electronic band structure. Comparison with theory reveals a strong enhancement of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing strength in FeSe owing to correlation effects. Given that the electron-phonon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing affects superconductivity exponentially, this enhancement highlights the importance of the cooperative interplay between electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions.</p>

RPA binds histone H3-H4 and functions in DNA replication–coupled nucleosome assembly

Multiple involved histone chaperones have been identified, but how nucleosome assembly is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed to DNA replication remains elusive. Here we show that replication protein A (RPA), an essential replisome component that binds single-stranded DNA, has a role in replication-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed nucleosome assembly. RPA directly binds free H3-H4. Assays using a synthetic sequence that mimics freshly unwound single-stranded DNA at replication fork showed that RPA promotes DNA-(H3-H4) complex formation immediately adjacent to double-stranded DNA. Further, an RPA mutant defective in H3-H4 binding exhibited attenuated nucleosome assembly on nascent chromatin. Thus, we propose that RPA functions as a platform for targeting histone deposition to replication fork, through which RPA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>es nucleosome assembly with ongoing DNA replication.</p>

Different Routes for Conifer- and Sinapaldehyde and Higher Saccharification upon Deficiency in the Dehydrogenase CAD1
<p>In the search for renewable energy sources, genetic engineering is a promising strategy to improve plant cell wall composition for biofuel and bioproducts generation. Lignin is a major factor determining saccharification efficiency and, therefore, is a prime target to engineer. Here, lignin content and composition were modified in poplar (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus alba</i>) by specifically down-regulating <i>CINNAMYL ALCOHOL DEHYDROGENASE1</i> (<i>CAD1</i>) by a hairpin-RNA-mediated silencing approach, which resulted in only 5% residual <i>CAD1</i> transcript abundance. These transgenic lines showed no biomass penalty despite a 10% reduction in Klason lignin content and severe shifts in lignin composition. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and thioacidolysis revealed a strong increase (up to 20-fold) in sinapaldehyde incorporation into lignin, whereas coniferaldehyde was not increased markedly. Accordingly, ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based phenolic profiling revealed a more than 24,000-fold accumulation of a newly identified compound made from 8-8 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing of two sinapaldehyde radicals. However, no additional cinnamaldehyde <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing products could be detected in the CAD1-deficient poplars. Instead, the transgenic lines accumulated a range of hydroxycinnamate-derived metabolites, of which the most prominent accumulation (over 8,500-fold) was observed for a compound that was identified by purification and nuclear magnetic resonance as syringyl lactic acid hexoside. Our data suggest that, upon down-regulation of <i>CAD1</i>, coniferaldehyde is converted into ferulic acid and derivatives, whereas sinapaldehyde is either oxidatively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed into S′(8-8)S′ and lignin or converted to sinapic acid and derivatives. The most prominent sink of the increased flux to hydroxycinnamates is syringyl lactic acid hexoside. Furthermore, low-extent saccharification assays, under different pretreatment conditions, showed strongly increased glucose (up to +81%) and xylose (up to +153%) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e, suggesting that down-regulating <i>CAD1</i> is a promising strategy for improving lignocellulosic biomass for the sugar platform industry.</p>

Heat Shock Protein HSP101 Affects the Release of Ribosomal Protein mRNAs for Recovery after Heat Shock
<p>Heat shock (HS) is known to have a profound impact on gene expression at different levels, such as inhibition of protein synthesis, in which HS blocks translation initiation and induces the sequestration of mRNAs into stress granules (SGs) or P-bodies for storage and/or decay. SGs prevent the degradation of the stored mRNAs, which can be reengaged into translation in the recovery period. However, little is known on the mRNAs stored during the stress, how these mRNAs are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>ed from SGs afterward, and what the functional importance is of this process. In this work, we report that Arabidopsis <i>HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN101</i> (<i>HSP101</i>) knockout mutant (<i>hsp101</i>) presented a defect in translation recovery and SG dissociation after HS. Using RNA sequencing and RNA immunoprecipitation approaches, we show that mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins (RPs) were preferentially stored during HS and that these mRNAs were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>ed and translated in an HSP101-dependent manner during recovery. By <sup>15</sup>N incorporation and polysome profile analyses, we observed that these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>ed mRNAs contributed to the production of new ribosomes to enhance translation. We propose that, after HS, HSP101 is required for the efficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e of RP mRNAs from SGs resulting in a rapid restoration of the translation machinery by producing new RPs.</p>

Structure of the C-terminal guanine nucleotide exchange factor module of Trio in an autoinhibited conformation reveals its oncogenic potential
<p>The C-terminal guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) module of Trio (TrioC) transfers signals from the Gα<sub>q/11</sub> subfamily of heterotrimeric G proteins to the small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) RhoA, enabling Gα<sub>q/11</sub>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed G protein–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed receptors (GPCRs) to control downstream events, such as cell motility and gene transcription. This conserved signal transduction axis is crucial for tumor growth in uveal melanoma. Previous studies indicate that the GEF activity of the TrioC module is autoinhibited, with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e of autoinhibition upon Gα<sub>q/11</sub> binding. Here, we determined the crystal structure of TrioC in its basal state and found that the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain interacts with the Dbl homology (DH) domain in a manner that occludes the Rho GTPase binding site, thereby suggesting the molecular basis of TrioC autoinhibition. Biochemical and biophysical assays revealed that disruption of the autoinhibited conformation destabilized and activated the TrioC module in vitro. Last, mutations in the DH-PH interface found in patients with cancer activated TrioC and, in the context of full-length Trio, led to increased abundance of guanosine triphosphate–bound RhoA (RhoA·GTP) in human cells. These mutations increase mitogenic signaling through the RhoA axis and, therefore, may represent cancer drivers operating in a Gα<sub>q/11</sub>-independent manner.</p>

G protein–coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) orchestrate biased agonism at the β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor
<p>Biased agonists of G protein–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed receptors (GPCRs), which selectively activate either G protein– or β-arrestin–mediated signaling pathways, are of major therapeutic interest because they have the potential to show improved efficacy and specificity as drugs. Efforts to understand the mechanistic basis of this phenomenon have focused on the hypothesis that G proteins and β-arrestins preferentially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>e to distinct GPCR conformations. However, because GPCR kinase (GRK)–dependent receptor phosphorylation is a critical prerequisite for the recruitment of β-arrestins to most GPCRs, GRKs themselves may play an important role in establishing biased signaling. We showed that an alanine mutant of the highly conserved residue tyrosine 219 (Y219A) in transmembrane domain five of the β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor (β<sub>2</sub>AR) was incapable of β-arrestin recruitment, receptor internalization, and β-arrestin–mediated activation of extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK), whereas it retained the ability to signal through G protein. We found that the impaired β-arrestin recruitment in cells was due to reduced GRK-mediated phosphorylation of the β<sub>2</sub>AR Y219A C terminus, which was recapitulated in vitro with purified components. Furthermore, in vitro ligation of a synthetically phosphorylated peptide onto the C terminus of β<sub>2</sub>AR Y219A rescued both the initial recruitment of β-arrestin and its engagement with the intracellular core of the receptor. These data suggest that the Y219A mutation generates a G protein–biased state primarily by conformational selection against GRK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing, rather than against β-arrestin. Together, these findings highlight the importance of GRKs in modulating the biased agonism of GPCRs.</p>

G protein–coupled receptors control the sensitivity of cells to the morphogen Sonic Hedgehog
<p>The morphogen Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) patterns tissues during development by directing cell fates in a concentration-dependent manner. The SHH signal is transmitted across the membrane of target cells by the heptahelical transmembrane protein Smoothened (SMO), which activates the GLI family of transcription factors through a mechanism that is undefined in vertebrates. Using CRISPR-edited null alleles and small-molecule inhibitors, we systematically analyzed the epistatic interactions between SMO and three proteins implicated in SMO signaling: the heterotrimeric G protein subunit Gα<sub>S</sub>, the G protein–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed receptor kinase 2 (GRK2), and the Gα<sub>S</sub>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed receptor GPR161. Our experiments uncovered a signaling mechanism that modifies the sensitivity of target cells to SHH and consequently changes the shape of the SHH dose-response curve. In both fibroblasts and spinal neural progenitors, the loss of GPR161, previously implicated as an inhibitor of basal SHH signaling, increased the sensitivity of target cells across the entire spectrum of SHH concentrations. Even in cells lacking GPR161, GRK2 was required for SHH signaling, and Gα<sub>s</sub>, which promotes the activation of protein Kinase A (PKA), antagonized SHH signaling. We propose that the sensitivity of target cells to Hedgehog morphogens, and the consequent effects on gene expression and differentiation outcomes, can be controlled by signals from G protein–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed receptors that converge on Gα<sub>s</sub> and PKA.</p>

Synergistic regulation of serotonin and opioid signaling contributes to pain insensitivity in Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 knockout mice
<p>Genetic loss of the voltage-gated sodium channel Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 (Na<sub>v</sub>1.7<sup>−/−</sup>) results in lifelong insensitivity to pain in mice and humans. One underlying cause is an increase in the production of endogenous opioids in sensory neurons. We analyzed whether Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 deficiency altered nociceptive heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide–binding protein–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed receptor (GPCR) signaling, such as initiated by GPCRs that respond to serotonin (pronociceptive) or opioids (antinociceptive), in sensory neurons. We found that the nociceptive neurons of Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 knockout (Na<sub>v</sub>1.7<sup>−/−</sup>) mice, but not those of Na<sub>v</sub>1.8 knockout (Na<sub>v</sub>1.8<sup>−/−</sup>) mice, exhibited decreased pronociceptive serotonergic signaling through the 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptors, which are Gα<sub>s</sub>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed GPCRs that stimulate the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate resulting in protein kinase A (PKA) activity, as well as reduced abundance of the RIIβ regulatory subunit of PKA. Simultaneously, the efficacy of antinociceptive opioid signaling mediated by the Gα<sub>i</sub>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed mu opioid receptors was increased. Consequently, opioids inhibited more efficiently tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium currents, which are important for pain-initiating neuronal activity in nociceptive neurons. Thus, Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 controls the efficacy and balance of GPCR-mediated pro- and antinociceptive intracellular signaling, such that without Na<sub>v</sub>1.7, the balance is shifted toward antinociception, resulting in lifelong endogenous analgesia.</p>

A gut feeling
<p>The anatomist Friedrich S. Merkel predicted in 1880 that sensory systems are composed of epithelial cells and sensory nerves, which together transform environmental cues into neural signals that trigger our rich sensory experiences (<i>1</i>). We now know that this hypothesis mostly holds true for the canonical senses of vision, hearing, taste, and touch. Perhaps surprisingly, the peripheral outposts of these classical sensory systems (eyes, ears, tongue, and skin) are dwarfed by the human body's largest sensory organ—the gut. Enteroendocrine cells, which are rare epithelial cells that decorate the gut lining, have long been suspected to be sensory receptor cells that inform the brain about ingested nutrients (<i>2</i>). Since their description, these cells were assumed to play a role in metabolism and gut physiology by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>ing slow-acting peptide hormones that stimulate neurons throughout the gut and in the brain. On page 1219 of this issue, Kaelberer <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) challenge this view by demonstrating that gut enteroendocrine cells locally excite sensory nerves through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e of the neurotransmitter glutamate. A recent study of enterochromaffin cells, a subset of enteroendocrine cells, also found that gut signals are transmitted at epithelial-neural synapses through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e of the neurotransmitter serotonin (<i>4</i>). Together, these findings overturn a decades-old dogma that enteroendocrine cells signal exclusively through hormones.</p>

Modular radical cross-coupling with sulfones enables access to sp<sup>3</sup>-rich (fluoro)alkylated scaffolds
<p>Cross-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing chemistry is widely applied to carbon-carbon bond formation in the synthesis of medicines, agrochemicals, and other functional materials. Recently, single-electron–induced variants of this reaction class have proven particularly useful in the formation of C(sp<sup>2</sup>)–C(sp<sup>3</sup>) linkages, although certain compound classes have remained a challenge. Here, we report the use of sulfones to activate the alkyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing partner in nickel-catalyzed radical cross-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing with aryl zinc reagents. This method’s tolerance of fluoroalkyl substituents proved particularly advantageous for the streamlined preparation of pharmaceutically oriented fluorinated scaffolds that previously required multiple steps, toxic reagents, and nonmodular retrosynthetic blueprints. Five specific sulfone reagents facilitate the rapid assembly of a vast set of compounds, many of which contain challenging fluorination patterns.</p>

Structure of the yeast spliceosomal postcatalytic P complex

Here we report a cryo–electron microscopy structure of the postcatalytic P complex at 3.3-angstrom resolution, revealing that the 3′ ss is mainly recognized through non–Watson-Crick base pairing with the 5′ ss and branch point. Furthermore, one or more unidentified proteins become stably associated with the P complex, securing the 3′ exon and potentially regulating activity of the helicase Prp22. Prp22 binds nucleotides 15 to 21 in the 3′ exon, enabling it to pull the intron-exon or ligated exons in a 3′ to 5′ direction to achieve 3′-ss proofreading or exon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e, respectively.</p>

Translational termination without a stop codon
<p>Ribosomes stall when they encounter the end of messenger RNA (mRNA) without an in-frame stop codon. In bacteria, these “nonstop” complexes can be rescued by alternative ribosome-rescue factor A (ArfA). We used electron cryomicroscopy to determine structures of ArfA bound to the ribosome with 3′-truncated mRNA, at resolutions ranging from 3.0 to 3.4 angstroms. ArfA binds within the ribosomal mRNA channel and substitutes for the absent stop codon in the A site by specifically recruiting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e factor 2 (RF2), initially in a compact preaccommodated state. A similar conformation of RF2 may occur on stop codons, suggesting a general mechanism for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e-factor–mediated translational termination in which a conformational switch leads to peptide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e only when the appropriate signal is present in the A site.</p>

β-cell–mimetic designer cells provide closed-loop glycemic control

RNA interference is essential for cellular quiescence
<p>Quiescent cells play a predominant role in most organisms. Here we identify RNA interference (RNAi) as a major requirement for quiescence (G<sub>0</sub> phase of the cell cycle) in <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i>. RNAi mutants lose viability at G<sub>0</sub> entry and are unable to maintain long-term quiescence. We identified suppressors of G<sub>0</sub> defects in cells lacking Dicer (<i>dcr1</i>Δ), which mapped to genes involved in chromosome segregation, RNA polymerase–associated factors, and heterochromatin formation. We propose a model in which RNAi promotes the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e of RNA polymerase in cycling and quiescent cells: (i) RNA polymerase II <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e mediates heterochromatin formation at centromeres, allowing proper chromosome segregation during mitotic growth and G<sub>0</sub> entry, and (ii) RNA polymerase I <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e prevents heterochromatin formation at ribosomal DNA during quiescence maintenance. Our model may account for the codependency of RNAi and histone H3 lysine 9 methylation throughout eukaryotic evolution.</p>

A coherent Ising machine for 2000-node optimization problems

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Hydroxystilbenes Are Monomers in Palm Fruit Endocarp Lignins
<p>Lignin, the plant cell wall polymer that binds fibers together but makes processing difficult, is traditionally formed from three monomers, the so-called monolignols (<i>p</i>-coumaryl, coniferyl, and sinapyl alcohols). Recently, we discovered, in grass lignins, a phenolic monomer that falls outside the canonical lignin biosynthetic pathway, the flavone tricin. As we show here, palm fruit (macaéíéííéíúba [<i>Acrocomia aculeata</i>], carnauba [<i>Copernicia prunifera</i>], and coconut [<i>Cocos nucifera</i>]) endocarps contain lignin polymers derived in part from a previously unconsidered class of lignin monomers, the hydroxystilbenes, including the valuable compounds piceatannol and resveratrol. Piceatannol could be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>ed from these lignins upon derivatization followed by reductive cleavage, a degradative method that cleaves β-ether bonds, indicating that at least a fraction is incorporated through labile ether bonds. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of products from the copolymerization of piceatannol and monolignols confirms the structures in the natural polymer and demonstrates that piceatannol acts as an authentic monomer participating in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing and cross-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing reactions during lignification. Therefore, palm fruit endocarps contain a new class of stilbenolignin polymers, further expanding the definition of lignin and implying that compounds such as piceatannol and resveratrol are potentially available in what is now essentially a waste product.</p>

A Key Role for Apoplastic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in Norway Spruce Phenolic Metabolism
<p>Apoplastic events such as monolignol oxidation and lignin polymerization are difficult to study in intact trees. To investigate the role of apoplastic hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) in gymnosperm phenolic metabolism, an extracellular lignin-forming cell culture of Norway spruce (<i>Picea abies</i>) was used as a research model. Scavenging of apoplastic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by potassium iodide repressed lignin formation, in line with peroxidases activating monolignols for lignin polymerization. Time-course analyses <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed to candidate substrate-product pair network propagation revealed differential accumulation of low-molecular-weight phenolics, including (glycosylated) oligolignols, (glycosylated) flavonoids, and proanthocyanidins, in lignin-forming and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-scavenging cultures and supported that monolignols are oxidatively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed not only in the cell wall but also in the cytoplasm, where they are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed to other monolignols and proanthocyanidins. Dilignol glycoconjugates with reduced structures were found in the culture medium, suggesting that cells are able to transport glycosylated dilignols to the apoplast. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that scavenging of apoplastic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> resulted in remodulation of the transcriptome, with reduced carbon flux into the shikimate pathway propagating down to monolignol biosynthesis. Aggregated coexpression network analysis identified candidate enzymes and transcription factors for monolignol oxidation and apoplastic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production in addition to potential H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> receptors. The results presented indicate that the redox state of the apoplast has a profound influence on cellular metabolism.</p>

Reconstitution of Abscisic Acid Signaling from the Receptor to DNA via bHLH Transcription Factors
<p>The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) confers drought tolerance in plants through stomatal closure and regulation of gene expression. The complex consisting of the ABA receptor PYRABACTIN RESISTANCE/REGULATORY COMPONENTS OF ABA RECEPTOR (PYR/RCAR), type 2C protein phosphatase (PP2C), and SNF1-related protein kinase 2 (SnRK2) has a key role in ABA signaling. Basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcriptional activator ABA-RESPONSIVE KINASE SUBSTRATE1 (AKS1, also known as FBH3) is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>ed from DNA by phosphorylation-induced monomerization in response to ABA in guard cells. Here we reconstituted the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e of AKS1 from DNA via the ABA signaling core complex in vitro. We first obtained evidence to confirm that AKS1 is an endogenous substrate for SnRK2s. Phosphorylation of AKS1 and activation of SnRK2 showed the same time course in response to ABA in guard cells. AKS1 was bound to SnRK2.6 in vivo. Three ABA-responsive SnRK2s (SnRK2.2/SRK2D, SnRK2.3/SRK2I, and SnRK2.6/SRK2E/OST1) phosphorylated AKS1 in vitro, and the phosphorylation was eliminated by the triple mutation of SnRK2s in plants. We reconstituted the AKS1 phosphorylation in vitro via the signaling complex containing the ABA receptor PYR1, a PP2C, HYPERSENSITIVE TO ABA1 (HAB1), and a protein kinase, SnRK2.6 in response to ABA. We further reconstituted the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e of AKS1 from the target gene of <i>POTASSIUM CHANNEL IN ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA 1</i> (<i>KAT1</i>) via the complex in response to ABA. These results demonstrate that AKS1 provides a link between the signaling complex and ABA-responsive genes and furnish evidence for a minimal signaling mechanism from ABA perception to DNA.</p>

Metabolic Control of Tobacco Pollination by Sugars and Invertases
<p>Pollination in flowering plants is initiated by germination of pollen grains on stigmas followed by fast growth of pollen tubes representing highly energy-consuming processes. The symplastic isolation of pollen grains and tubes requires import of Suc available in the apoplast. We show that the functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing of Suc cleavage by invertases and uptake of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>ed hexoses by monosaccharide transporters are critical for pollination in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>). Transcript profiling, in situ hybridization, and immunolocalization of extracellular invertases and two monosaccharide transporters in vitro and in vivo support the functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing in supplying carbohydrates for pollen germination and tube growth evidenced by spatiotemporally coordinated expression. Detection of vacuolar invertases in maternal tissues by these approaches revealed metabolic cross talk between male and female tissues and supported the requirement for carbohydrate supply in transmitting tissue during pollination. Tissue-specific expression of an invertase inhibitor and addition of the chemical invertase inhibitor miglitol strongly reduced extracellular invertase activity and impaired pollen germination. Measurements of (competitive) uptake of labeled sugars identified two import pathways for exogenously available Suc into the germinating pollen operating in parallel: direct Suc uptake and via the hexoses after cleavage by extracellular invertase. Reduction of extracellular invertase activity in pollen decreases Suc uptake and severely compromises pollen germination. We further demonstrate that Glc as sole carbon source is sufficient for pollen germination, whereas Suc is supporting tube growth, revealing an important regulatory role of both the invertase substrate and products contributing to a potential metabolic and signaling-based multilayer regulation of pollination by carbohydrates.</p>

Dirigent Protein Mode of Action Revealed by the Crystal Structure of AtDIR6
<p>Dirigent proteins impart stereoselectivity to phenoxy radical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing reactions in plants and, thus, play an essential role in the biosynthesis of biologically active natural products. This includes the regioselective and enantioselective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing and subsequent cyclization of two coniferyl alcohol radicals to pinoresinol as the committed step of lignan biosynthesis. The reaction is controlled by dirigent proteins, which, depending on the species and protein, direct the reaction to either (+)- or (−)-pinoresinol. We present the crystal structure of the (−)-pinoresinol forming DIRIGENT PROTEIN6 (AtDIR6) from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) with data to 1.4 Å resolution. The structure shows AtDIR6 as an eight-stranded antiparallel β-barrel that forms a trimer with spatially well-separated cavities for substrate binding. The binding cavities are two lobed, exhibiting two opposing pockets, each lined with a set of hydrophilic and potentially catalytic residues, including essential aspartic acids. These residues are conserved between (+) and (−)-pinoresinol-forming DIRs and required for activity. The structure supports a model in which two substrate radicals bind to each of the DIR monomers. With the aromatic rings fixed in the two pockets, the propionyl side chains face each other for radical-radical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ing, and stereoselectivity is determined by the exact positioning of the side chains. Extensive mutational analysis supports a previously unrecognized function for DIRs in catalyzing the cyclization of the bis-quinone methide reaction intermediate to yield (+)- or (−)-pinoresinol.</p>

Expansion of Secretin-Like G Protein-Coupled Receptors and Their Peptide Ligands via Local Duplications Before and After Two Rounds of Whole-Genome Duplication
<p>In humans, the secretin-like G protein-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coupl</span></strong>ed receptor (GPCR) family comprises 15 members with 18 corresponding peptide ligand genes. Although members have been identified in a large variety of vertebrate and nonvertebrate species, the origin and relationship of these proteins remain unresolved. To address this issue, we employed large-scale genome comparisons to identify genome fragments with conserved synteny and matched these fragments to linkage groups in reconstructed early gnathostome ancestral chromosomes (<i>GAC</i>). This genome comparison revealed that most receptor and peptide genes were clustered in three <i>GAC</i> linkage groups and suggested that the ancestral forms of five peptide subfamilies (corticotropin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>ing hormone-like, calcitonin-like, parathyroid hormone-like, glucagon-like, and growth hormone-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>ing hormone-like) and their cognate receptor families emerged through tandem local gene duplications before two rounds (2R) of whole-genome duplication. These subfamily genes have, then, been amplified by 2R whole-genome duplication, followed by additional local duplications and gene loss prior to the divergence of land vertebrates and teleosts. This study delineates a possible evolutionary scenario for whole secretin-like peptide and receptor family members and may shed light on evolutionary mechanisms for expansion of a gene family with a large number of paralogs.</p>

TALK-1 channels control β cell endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis
<p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">handl</span></strong>ing by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) serves critical roles in controlling pancreatic β cell function and becomes perturbed during the pathogenesis of diabetes. ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis is determined by ion movements across the ER membrane, including K<sup>+</sup> flux through K<sup>+</sup> channels. We demonstrated that K<sup>+</sup> flux through ER-localized TALK-1 channels facilitated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the ER in mouse and human β cells. We found that β cells from mice lacking TALK-1 exhibited reduced basal cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> and increased ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations, suggesting reduced ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak. These changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis were presumably due to TALK-1–mediated ER K<sup>+</sup> flux, because we recorded K<sup>+</sup> currents mediated by functional TALK-1 channels on the nuclear membrane, which is continuous with the ER. Moreover, overexpression of K<sup>+</sup>-impermeable TALK-1 channels in HEK293 cells did not reduce ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores. Reduced ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> content in β cells is associated with ER stress and islet dysfunction in diabetes, and islets from TALK-1–deficient mice fed a high-fat diet showed reduced signs of ER stress, suggesting that TALK-1 activity exacerbated ER stress. Our data establish TALK-1 channels as key regulators of β cell ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> and suggest that TALK-1 may be a therapeutic target to reduce ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">handl</span></strong>ing defects in β cells during the pathogenesis of diabetes.</p>

Thirst-associated preoptic neurons encode an aversive motivational drive
<p>Water deprivation produces a drive to seek and consume water. How neural activity creates this motivation remains poorly understood. We used activity-dependent genetic labeling to characterize neurons activated by water deprivation in the hypothalamic median preoptic nucleus (MnPO). Single-cell transcriptional profiling revealed that dehydration-activated MnPO neurons consist of a single excitatory cell type. After optogenetic activation of these neurons, mice drank water and performed an operant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lever</span></strong>-pressing task for water reward with rates that scaled with stimulation frequency. This stimulation was aversive, and instrumentally pausing stimulation could reinforce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lever</span></strong>-pressing. Activity of these neurons gradually decreased over the course of an operant session. Thus, the activity of dehydration-activated MnPO neurons establishes a scalable, persistent, and aversive internal state that dynamically controls thirst-motivated behavior.</p>

Cardiomyocyte glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors directly and antagonistically regulate heart disease in mice
<p>Stress is increasingly associated with heart dysfunction and is linked to higher mortality rates in patients with cardiometabolic disease. Glucocorticoids are primary stress hormones that regulate homeostasis through two nuclear receptors, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), both of which are present in cardiomyocytes. To examine the specific and coordinated roles that these receptors play in mediating the direct effects of stress on the heart, we generated mice with cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of GR (cardioGRKO), MR (cardioMRKO), or both GR and MR (cardioGRMRdKO). The cardioGRKO mice spontaneously developed cardiac hypertrophy and left ventricular systolic dysfunction and died prematurely from heart failure. In contrast, the cardioMRKO mice exhibited normal heart morphology and function. Despite the presence of myocardial stress, the cardioGRMRdKO mice were resistant to the cardiac remodeling, left ventricular dysfunction, and early death observed in the cardioGRKO mice. Gene expression analysis revealed the loss of gene changes associated with impaired Ca<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">handl</span></strong>ing, increased oxidative stress, and enhanced cell death and the presence of gene changes that limited the hypertrophic response and promoted cardiomyocyte survival in the double knockout hearts. Reexpression of MR in cardioGRMRdKO hearts reversed many of the cardioprotective gene changes and resulted in cardiac failure. These findings reveal a critical role for balanced cardiomyocyte GR and MR stress signaling in cardiovascular health. Therapies that shift stress signaling in the heart to favor more GR and less MR activity may provide an improved approach for treating heart disease.</p>

U.N. HIV/AIDS agency assailed for culture of harassment
<p>An independent panel that evaluated sexual harassment, bullying, and abuses of power at the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) issued a blistering report that called for a change in leadership to address what it called a "vacuum of accountability." UNAIDS, based in Geneva, Switzerland, is the global command center in the fight against HIV/AIDS, issuing authoritative epidemiological updates and staging campaigns to improve prevention and treatment—and, ironically, to promote human rights. But the panel report says there's a "boy's club" culture at UNAIDS, and it strongly faults the executive director, Michel Sidibé, for fostering a patriarchal environment that is marred further by nepotism and retaliation against employees who complain. Sidibé requested that the panel convene after two staffers were accused of sexual harassment and there was criticism of his <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">handl</span></strong>ing of the incidents. The Programme Coordinating Board that oversees UNAIDS is meeting this week and reviewing the panel's recommendations.</p>

Lectins modulate the microbiota of social amoebae
<p>The social amoeba <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> maintains a microbiome during multicellular development; bacteria are carried in migrating slugs and as endosymbionts within amoebae and spores. Bacterial carriage and endosymbiosis are induced by the secreted lectin discoidin I that binds bacteria, protects them from extracellular killing, and alters their retention within amoebae. This altered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">handl</span></strong>ing of bacteria also occurs with bacteria coated by plant lectins and leads to DNA transfer from bacteria to amoebae. Thus, lectins alter the cellular response of <i>D. discoideum</i> to bacteria to establish the amoebae’s microbiome. Mammalian cells can also maintain intracellular bacteria when presented with bacteria coated with lectins, so heterologous lectins may induce endosymbiosis in animals. Our results suggest that endogenous or environmental lectins may influence microbiome homeostasis across eukaryotic phylogeny.</p>

Hydraulically amplified self-healing electrostatic actuators with muscle-like performance
<p>Existing soft actuators have persistent challenges that restrain the potential of soft robotics, highlighting a need for soft transducers that are powerful, high-speed, efficient, and robust. We describe a class of soft actuators, termed hydraulically amplified self-healing electrostatic (HASEL) actuators, which harness a mechanism that couples electrostatic and hydraulic forces to achieve a variety of actuation modes. We introduce prototypical designs of HASEL actuators and demonstrate their robust, muscle-like performance as well as their ability to repeatedly self-heal after dielectric breakdown—all using widely available materials and common fabrication techniques. A soft gripper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">handl</span></strong>ing delicate objects and a self-sensing artificial muscle powering a robotic arm illustrate the wide potential of HASEL actuators for next-generation soft robotic devices.</p>

A generative vision model that trains with high data efficiency and breaks text-based CAPTCHAs
<p>Learning from a few examples and generalizing to markedly different situations are capabilities of human visual intelligence that are yet to be matched by leading machine learning models. By drawing inspiration from systems neuroscience, we introduce a probabilistic generative model for vision in which message-passing–based inference <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">handl</span></strong>es recognition, segmentation, and reasoning in a unified way. The model demonstrates excellent generalization and occlusion-reasoning capabilities and outperforms deep neural networks on a challenging scene text recognition benchmark while being 300-fold more data efficient. In addition, the model fundamentally breaks the defense of modern text-based CAPTCHAs (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) by generatively segmenting characters without CAPTCHA-specific heuristics. Our model emphasizes aspects such as data efficiency and compositionality that may be important in the path toward general artificial intelligence.</p>

Renewable acrylonitrile production
<p>Acrylonitrile (ACN) is a petroleum-derived compound used in resins, polymers, acrylics, and carbon fiber. We present a process for renewable ACN production using 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP), which can be produced microbially from sugars. The process achieves ACN molar yields exceeding 90% from ethyl 3-hydroxypropanoate (ethyl 3-HP) via dehydration and nitrilation with ammonia over an inexpensive titanium dioxide solid acid catalyst. We further describe an integrated process modeled at scale that is based on this chemistry and achieves near-quantitative ACN yields (98 ± 2%) from ethyl acrylate. This endothermic approach eliminates runaway reaction hazards and achieves higher yields than the standard propylene ammoxidation process. Avoidance of hydrogen cyanide as a by-product also improves process safety and mitigates product <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">handl</span></strong>ing requirements.</p>

The balance between immunity and inflammation
<p>Lungs execute two critical functions that can be at odds with one another: eliminating harmful toxins, particulates, and microbes; and exchanging gas through uninflamed structures—alveoli—to collect oxygen and discharge carbon dioxide. Lungs have a multilayered response to unwanted invaders, offering physical barriers as well as arranging immune cells at airway surfaces. Yet, lungs have the “Goldilocks” challenge of deploying this armory with just the right amount of inflammation. Consequently, lung immunity must be choreographed so that invaders are purged quickly, inflammation tempered, and homeostasis preserved. In this issue, two papers reveal how lung immunity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">handl</span></strong>es these tasks and what happens when things go awry. Shlezinger <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) on page 1037 unveil a c<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lever</span></strong> trick that neutrophils play on inhaled fungal spores to resist life-threatening infections. This may reveal new treatment strategies.

DeepStack: Expert-level artificial intelligence in heads-up no-limit poker
<p>Artificial intelligence has seen several breakthroughs in recent years, with games often serving as milestones. A common feature of these games is that players have perfect information.

It combines recursive reasoning to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">handl</span></strong>e information asymmetry, decomposition to focus computation on the relevant decision, and a form of intuition that is automatically learned from self-play using deep learning. In a study involving 44,000 hands of poker, DeepStack defeated, with statistical significance, professional poker players in heads-up no-limit Texas hold’em. The approach is theoretically sound and is shown to produce strategies that are more difficult to exploit than prior approaches.</p>

Structural basis for the gating mechanism of the type 2 ryanodine receptor RyR2
<p>RyR2 is a high-conductance intracellular calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) channel that controls the release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum of a variety of cells. Here, we report the structures of RyR2 from porcine heart in both the open and closed states at near-atomic resolutions determined using single-particle electron cryomicroscopy. Structural comparison reveals a breathing motion of the overall cytoplasmic region resulted from the interdomain movements of amino-terminal domains (NTDs), Helical domains, and Handle domains, whereas almost no intradomain shifts are observed in these armadillo repeats–containing domains. Outward rotations of the Central domains, which integrate the conformational changes of the cytoplasmic region, lead to the dilation of the cytoplasmic gate through coupled motions. Our structural and mutational characterizations provide important insights into the gating and disease mechanism of RyRs.</p>

Bioorthogonal Noncanonical Amino Acid Tagging (BONCAT) Enables Time-Resolved Analysis of Protein Synthesis in Native Plant Tissue
<p>Proteomic plasticity undergirds stress responses in plants, and understanding such responses requires accurate measurement of the extent to which proteins levels are adjusted to counter external stimuli. Here, we adapt bioorthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) to interrogate protein synthesis in vegetative Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings. BONCAT relies on the translational incorporation of a noncanonical amino acid probe into cellular proteins. In this study, the probe is the Met surrogate azidohomoalanine (Aha), which carries a reactive azide moiety in its amino acid side chain. The azide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">handl</span></strong>e in Aha can be selectively conjugated to dyes and functionalized beads to enable visualization and enrichment of newly synthesized proteins. We show that BONCAT is sensitive enough to detect Arabidopsis proteins synthesized within a 30-min interval defined by an Aha pulse and that the method can be used to detect proteins made under conditions of light stress, osmotic shock, salt stress, heat stress, and recovery from heat stress. We further establish that BONCAT can be coupled to tandem liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to identify and quantify proteins synthesized during heat stress and recovery from heat stress. Our results are consistent with a model in which, upon the onset of heat stress, translation is rapidly reprogrammed to enhance the synthesis of stress mitigators and is again altered during recovery. All experiments were carried out with commercially available reagents, highlighting the accessibility of the BONCAT method to researchers interested in stress responses as well as translational and posttranslational regulation in plants.</p>

<i>pheno</i>Seeder - A Robot System for Automated Handling and Phenotyping of Individual Seeds
<p>The enormous diversity of seed traits is an intriguing feature and critical for the overwhelming success of higher plants. In particular, seed mass is generally regarded to be key for seedling development but is mostly approximated by using scanning methods delivering only two-dimensional data, often termed seed size. However, three-dimensional traits, such as the volume or mass of single seeds, are very rarely determined in routine measurements. Here, we introduce a device named <i>pheno</i>Seeder, which enables the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">handl</span></strong>ing and phenotyping of individual seeds of very different sizes. The system consists of a pick-and-place robot and a modular setup of sensors that can be versatilely extended. Basic biometric traits detected for individual seeds are two-dimensional data from projections, three-dimensional data from volumetric measures, and mass, from which seed density is also calculated. Each seed is tracked by an identifier and, after phenotyping, can be planted, sorted, or individually stored for further evaluation or processing (e.g. in routine seed-to-plant tracking pipelines). By investigating seeds of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), rapeseed (<i>Brassica napus</i>), and barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), we observed that, even for apparently round-shaped seeds of rapeseed, correlations between the projected area and the mass of seeds were much weaker than between volume and mass. This indicates that simple projections may not deliver good proxies for seed mass. Although throughput is limited, we expect that automated seed phenotyping on a single-seed basis can contribute valuable information for applications in a wide range of wild or crop species, including seed classification, seed sorting, and assessment of seed quality.</p>

Gastrointestinal and renal responses to variable water intake in whitebellied sunbirds and New Holland honeyeaters
<p>Nectarivores face a constant challenge in terms of water balance, experiencing water loading or dehydration when switching between food plants or between feeding and fasting. To understand how whitebellied sunbirds and New Holland honeyeaters meet the challenges of varying preformed water load, we used the elimination of intramuscular-injected [<sup>14</sup>C]-<sc>l</sc>-glucose and <sup>3</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O to quantify intestinal and renal water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">handl</span></strong>ing on diets varying in sugar concentration. Both sunbirds and honeyeaters showed significant modulation of intestinal water absorption, allowing excess water to be shunted through the intestine when on dilute diets. Despite reducing their fractional water absorption, both species showed linear increases in water flux and fractional body water turnover as water intake increased (both afternoon and morning), suggesting that the modulation of fractional water absorption was not sufficient to completely offset dietary water loads. In both species, glomerular filtration rate was independent of water gain (but was higher for the afternoon), as was renal fractional water reabsorption (measured in the afternoon). During the natural overnight fast, both sunbirds and honeyeaters arrested whole kidney function. Evaporative water loss in sunbirds was variable but correlated with water gain. Both sunbirds and honeyeaters appear to modulate intestinal water absorption as an important component of water regulation to help deal with massive preformed water loads. Shutting down glomerular filtration rate during the overnight fast is another way of saving energy for osmoregulatory function. Birds maintain osmotic balance on diets varying markedly in preformed water load by varying both intestinal water absorption and excretion through the intestine and kidneys.</p>

Runx1 Deficiency Protects Against Adverse Cardiac Remodeling After Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Myocardial infarction (MI) is a leading cause of heart failure and death worldwide. Preservation of contractile function and protection against adverse changes in ventricular architecture (cardiac remodeling) are key factors to limiting progression of this condition to heart failure. Consequently, new therapeutic targets are urgently required to achieve this aim. Expression of the Runx1 transcription factor is increased in adult cardiomyocytes after MI; however, the functional role of Runx1 in the heart is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To address this question, we have generated a novel tamoxifen-inducible cardiomyocyte-specific <i>Runx1</i>-deficient mouse. Mice were subjected to MI by means of coronary artery ligation. Cardiac remodeling and contractile function were assessed extensively at the whole-heart, cardiomyocyte, and molecular levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p><i>Runx1</i>-deficient mice were protected against adverse cardiac remodeling after MI, maintaining ventricular wall thickness and contractile function. Furthermore, these mice lacked eccentric hypertrophy, and their cardiomyocytes exhibited markedly improved calcium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">handl</span></strong>ing. At the mechanistic level, these effects were achieved through increased phosphorylation of phospholamban by protein kinase A and relief of sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase inhibition.

Large Cardiac Muscle Patches Engineered From Human Induced-Pluripotent Stem Cell–Derived Cardiac Cells Improve Recovery From Myocardial Infarction in Swine

In vivo assessments were conducted in a porcine model of myocardial infarction (MI). Animal groups included: MI hearts treated with 2 hCMPs (MI+hCMP, n=13), MI hearts treated with 2 cell-free open fibrin patches (n=14), or MI hearts with neither experimental patch (n=15); a fourth group of animals underwent sham surgery (Sham, n=8). Cardiac function and infarct size were evaluated by MRI, arrhythmia incidence by implanted loop recorders, and the engraftment rate by calculation of quantitative polymerase chain reaction measurements of expression of the human Y chromosome. Additional studies examined the myocardial protein expression profile changes and potential mechanisms of action that related to exosomes from the cell patch.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The hCMPs began to beat synchronously within 1 day of fabrication, and after 7 days of dynamic culture stimulation, in vitro assessments indicated the mechanisms related to the improvements in electronic mechanical coupling, calcium-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">handl</span></strong>ing, and force generation, suggesting a maturation process during the dynamic culture. The engraftment rate was 10.9±1.8% at 4 weeks after the transplantation. The hCMP transplantation was associated with significant improvements in left ventricular function, infarct size, myocardial wall stress, myocardial hypertrophy, and reduced apoptosis in the periscar boarder zone myocardium. hCMP transplantation also reversed some MI-associated changes in sarcomeric regulatory protein phosphorylation. The exosomes released from the hCMP appeared to have cytoprotective properties that improved cardiomyocyte survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We have fabricated a clinically relevant size of hCMP with trilineage cardiac cells derived from human induced-pluripotent stem cells. The hCMP matures in vitro during 7 days of dynamic culture. Transplantation of this type of hCMP results in significantly reduced infarct size and improvements in cardiac function that are associated with reduction in left ventricular wall stress. The hCMP treatment is not associated with significant changes in arrhythmogenicity.</p></sec>

Tomo-Seq Identifies SOX9 as a Key Regulator of Cardiac Fibrosis During Ischemic Injury
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac ischemic injury induces a pathological remodeling response, which can ultimately lead to heart failure. Detailed mechanistic insights into molecular signaling pathways relevant for different aspects of cardiac remodeling will support the identification of novel therapeutic targets.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Although genome-wide transcriptome analysis on diseased tissues has greatly advanced our understanding of the regulatory networks that drive pathological changes in the heart, this approach has been disadvantaged by the fact that the signals are derived from tissue homogenates. Here we used tomo-seq to obtain a genome-wide gene expression signature with high spatial resolution spanning from the infarcted area to the remote to identify new regulators of cardiac remodeling. Cardiac tissue samples from patients suffering from ischemic heart disease were used to validate our findings.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Tracing transcriptional differences with a high spatial resolution across the infarcted heart enabled us to identify gene clusters that share a comparable expression profile. The spatial distribution patterns indicated a separation of expressional changes for genes involved in specific aspects of cardiac remodeling, such as fibrosis, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, and calcium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">handl</span></strong>ing (<i>Col1a2</i>, <i>Nppa</i>, and <i>Serca2</i>). Subsequent correlation analysis allowed for the identification of novel factors that share a comparable transcriptional regulation pattern across the infarcted tissue. The strong correlation between the expression levels of these known marker genes and the expression of the coregulated genes could be confirmed in human ischemic cardiac tissue samples. Follow-up analysis identified SOX9 as common transcriptional regulator of a large portion of the fibrosis-related genes that become activated under conditions of ischemic injury. Lineage-tracing experiments indicated that the majority of COL1-positive fibroblasts stem from a pool of SOX9-expressing cells, and in vivo loss of <i>Sox9</i> blunted the cardiac fibrotic response on ischemic injury. The colocalization between SOX9 and COL1 could also be confirmed in patients suffering from ischemic heart disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Based on the exact local expression cues, tomo-seq can serve to reveal novel genes and key transcription factors involved in specific aspects of cardiac remodeling.

Calcineurin (<i>PPP3CB</i>) mRNA was not increased, nor was <i>RCAN1</i> mRNA level, indicating a lack of calcineurin activation. Furthermore, myocyte enhancer factor 2 and nuclear factor of activated T cell transcription factor activity was not increased in HCM, suggesting that calcineurin pathway activation is not an upstream cause of increased CAMKII protein abundance or activation. <i>SERCA2A</i> mRNA transcript levels were reduced in HCM regardless of genotype, as was sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticular calcium ATPase 2/phospholamban protein ratio (45% reduced; <i>P</i>=0.03). <sup>45</sup>Ca sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticular calcium ATPaseuptake assay showed reduced uptake velocity in HCM regardless of genotype (<i>P</i>=0.01). The cardiac ryanodine receptor was not altered in transcript, protein, or phosphorylated (pS2808, pS2814) protein abundance, and [<sup>3</sup>H]ryanodine binding was not different in HCM, consistent with no major modification of the ryanodine receptor.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Human HCM demonstrates calcium mis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">handl</span></strong>ing through both genotype-specific and common pathways. Posttranslational activation of the CaMKII pathway is specific to sarcomere mutation–positive HCM, whereas sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticular calcium ATPase 2 abundance and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca uptake are depressed in both sarcomere mutation–positive and –negative HCM.</p></sec>

Microtubule-Mediated Defects in Junctophilin-2 Trafficking Contribute to Myocyte Transverse-Tubule Remodeling and Ca<sup>2+</sup> Handling Dysfunction in Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Cardiac dysfunction in failing hearts of human patients and animal models is associated with both microtubule densification and transverse-tubule (T-tubule) remodeling. Our objective was to investigate whether microtubule densification contributes to T-tubule remodeling and excitation–contraction coupling dysfunction in heart disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>In a mouse model of pressure overload–induced cardiomyopathy by transaortic banding, colchicine, a microtubule depolymerizer, significantly ameliorated T-tubule remodeling and cardiac dysfunction. In cultured cardiomyocytes, microtubule depolymerization with nocodazole or colchicine profoundly attenuated T-tubule impairment, whereas microtubule polymerization/stabilization with taxol accelerated T-tubule remodeling. In situ immunofluorescence of heart tissue sections demonstrated significant disorganization of junctophilin-2 (JP2), a protein that bridges the T-tubule and sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes, in transaortic banded hearts as well as in human failing hearts, whereas colchicine injection significantly preserved the distribution of JP2 in transaortic banded hearts. In isolated mouse cardiomyocytes, prolonged culture or treatment with taxol resulted in pronounced redistribution of JP2 from T-tubules to the peripheral plasma membrane, without changing total JP2 expression. Nocodazole treatment antagonized JP2 redistribution. Moreover, overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of kinesin 1, a microtubule motor protein responsible for anterograde trafficking of proteins, protected against JP2 redistribution and T-tubule remodeling in culture. Finally, nocodazole treatment improved Ca<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">handl</span></strong>ing in cultured myocytes by increasing the amplitude of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and reducing the frequency of Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion—</title><p>Our data identify a mechanistic link between microtubule densification and T-tubule remodeling and reveal microtubule-mediated JP2 redistribution as a novel mechanism for T-tubule disruption, loss of excitation–contraction coupling, and heart failure.</p></sec>

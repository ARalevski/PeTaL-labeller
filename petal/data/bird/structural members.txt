Long-term outcomes of cemented <i>versus</i> cementless humeral components in arthroplasty of the shoulder
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>In the initial development of total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA),   the humeral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent was usually fixed with cement. Cementless   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents were subsequently int<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rod</span></strong>uced. The aim of this study was   to compare the long-term outcome of cemented and cementless humeral   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents in arthroplasty of the shoulder.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>All patients who underwent primary arthroplasty of the shoulder   at our institution between 1970 and 2012 were included in the study.   There were 4636 patients with 1167 cemented humeral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents and   3469 cementless <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents. Patients with the two types of fixation   were matched for nine different covariates using a propensity score   analysis. A total of 551 well-balanced pairs of patients with cemented   and cementless <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents were available after matching for comparison   of the outcomes. The clinical outcomes which were analysed included loosening   of the humeral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent determined at revision surgery, periprosthetic   fractures, post-operative infection and operating time.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The overall five-, ten-, 15- and 20-year rates of survival were   98.9%, 97.2%, 95.5%, and 94.4%, respectively. Survival without loosening   at 20 years was 98% for cemented <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents and 92.4% for cementless   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents. After propensity score matching including fixation as   determined by the design of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent, humeral loosening was   also found to be significantly higher in the cementless group. Survival   without humeral loosening at 20 years was 98.7% for cemented <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents   and 91.0% for cementless <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents. There was no significant difference   in the risk of intra- or post-operative fracture. The rate of survival   without deep infection and the mean operating time were significantly   higher in the cemented group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Both types of fixation give rates of long-term survival of >   90%. Cemented <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents have better rates of survival without loosening   but this should be weighed against increased operating time and   the risk of bony destruction of the proximal humerus at the time   of revision of a cemented humeral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:666–73.</p></sec>

Fixation and clinical outcome of uncemented peri-apatite-coated <i>versus</i> cemented total knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The optimal method of tibial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent fixation remains uncertain   in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Hydroxyapatite coatings have been   applied to improve bone ingrowth in uncemented designs, but may   only coat the directly accessible surface. As peri-apatite (PA)   is solution deposited, this may increase the coverage of the implant   surface and thereby fixation. We assessed the tibial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent fixation   of uncemented PA-coated TKAs <i>versus</i> cemented TKAs.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Patients were randomised to PA-coated or cemented TKAs. In 60   patients (30 in each group), radiostereometric analysis of tibial   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent migration was evaluated as the primary outcome at baseline,   three months post-operatively and at one, two and five years. A   linear mixed-effects model was used to analyse the repeated measurements.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>After five years of follow-up, one (cemented) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent was revised   due to ligament instability. Overall, uncemented PA-coated tibial   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents migrated significantly more    (p = 0.003), with the mean maximum total point motion (MTPM) at   five years being 0.62 mm (95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.49 to   0.76) for cemented tibial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents and 0.97 mm (95% CI 0.81 to   1.15) for PA-coated tibial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents in TKA. However, between three   months and five years the cemented TKAs migrated significantly more   (p = 0.02), displaying a MTPM of 0.27 mm (95% CI, 0.19 to 0.36) <i>versus</i> 0.13   mm (95% CI, 0.01 to 0.25) for PA-coated tibial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents. One implant   in each group was considered at risk for aseptic loosening due to continuous   migration after five years of follow-up, albeit with different migration   patterns for each group (i.e. higher initial migration but diminishing   over time for the PA-coated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent <i>versus</i> gradually   increasing migration for the cemented <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The tibial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents of PA-coated TKAs showed more overall migration   compared with the tibial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents of cemented TKAs.

Activation mechanism of a human SK-calmodulin channel complex elucidated by cryo-EM structures
<p>Small-conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> (SK) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s mediate neuron excitability and are associated with synaptic transmission and plasticity. They also regulate immune responses and the size of blood cells. Activation of SK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s requires calmodulin (CaM), but how CaM binds and opens SK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s has been unclear. Here we report cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es of a human SK4-CaM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> complex in closed and activated states at 3.4- and 3.5-angstrom resolution, respectively. Four CaM molecules bind to one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> tetramer. Each lobe of CaM serves a distinct function: The C-lobe binds to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> constitutively, whereas the N-lobe interacts with the S4-S5 linker in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner. The S4-S5 linker, which contains two distinct helices, undergoes conformational changes upon CaM binding to open the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> pore. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es reveal the gating mechanism of SK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s and provide a basis for understanding SK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> pharmacology.</p>

VAMP721 Conformations Unmask an Extended Motif for K<sup>+</sup> Channel Binding and Gating Control
<p>Soluble <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins play a major role in membrane fusion and contribute to cell expansion, signaling, and polar growth in plants. The SNARE SYP121 of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> that facilitates vesicle fusion at the plasma membrane also binds with, and regulates, K<sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s already present at the plasma membrane to affect K<sup>+</sup> uptake and K<sup>+</sup>-dependent growth. Here, we report that its cognate partner VAMP721, which assembles with SYP121 to drive membrane fusion, binds to the KAT1 K<sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> via two sites on the protein, only one of which contributes to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>-gating control. Binding to the VAMP721 SNARE domain suppressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> gating. By contrast, interaction with the amino-terminal longin domain conferred specificity on VAMP721 binding without influencing gating. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> binding was defined by a linear motif within the longin domain. The SNARE domain is thought to wrap around this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e when not assembled with SYP121 in the SNARE complex. Fluorescence lifetime analysis showed that mutations within this motif, which suppressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> binding and its effects on gating, also altered the conformational displacement between the VAMP721 SNARE and longin domains. The presence of these two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>-binding sites on VAMP721, one also required for SNARE complex assembly, implies a well-defined sequence of events coordinating K<sup>+</sup> uptake and the final stages of vesicle traffic. It suggests that binding begins with VAMP721, and subsequently with SYP121, thereby coordinating K<sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> gating during SNARE assembly and vesicle fusion. Thus, our findings also are consistent with the idea that the K<sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s are nucleation points for SNARE complex assembly.</p>

Extra strengthening and work hardening in gradient nanotwinned metals
<p>Gradient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es exist ubiquitously in nature and are increasingly being int<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rod</span></strong>uced in engineering. However, understanding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al gradient–related mechanical behaviors in all gradient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es, including those in engineering materials, has been challenging. We explored the mechanical performance of a gradient nanotwinned <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e with highly tunable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al gradients in pure copper. A large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al gradient allows for superior work hardening and strength that can exceed those of the strongest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent of the gradient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e. We found through systematic experiments and atomistic simulations that this unusual behavior is afforded by a unique patterning of ultrahigh densities of dislocations in the grain interiors. These observations not only shed light on gradient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es, but may also indicate a promising route for improving the mechanical properties of materials through gradient design.</p>

A Family of NAI2-Interacting Proteins in the Biogenesis of the ER Body and Related Structures
<p>Plants p<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rod</span></strong>uce different types of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived vesicles that accumulate and transport proteins, lipids, and metabolites. In the Brassicales, a distinct ER-derived <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e called the ER body is found throughout the epidermis of cotyledons, hypocotyls, and roots. NAI2 is a key factor for ER body formation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Homologs of NAI2 are found only in the Brassicales and therefore may have evolved specifically to enable ER body formation. Here, we report that three related Arabidopsis NAI2-interacting proteins (NAIP1, NAIP2, and NAIP3) play a critical role in the biogenesis of ER bodies and related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es. Analysis using GFP fusions revealed that all three NAIPs are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents of the ER bodies found in the cotyledons, hypocotyls, and roots. Genetic analysis with <i>naip</i> mutants indicates that they have a critical and redundant role in ER body formation. NAIP2 and NAIP3 are also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents of other vesicular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es likely derived from the ER that are formed independent of NAI2 and are present not only in the cotyledons, hypocotyls, and roots, but also in the rosettes. Thus, while NAIP1 is a specialized ER body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent, NAIP2 and NAIP3 are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents of different types of ER-derived <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es. Analysis of chimeric NAIP proteins revealed that their N-terminal domains play a major role in the functional specialization between NAIP1 and NAIP3. Unlike NAI2, NAIPs have homologs in all plants; therefore, NAIP-containing ER <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es, from which the ER bodies in the Brassicales may have evolved, are likely to be present widely in plants.</p>

Radiographic scoring system for the evaluation of stability of cementless acetabular components in the presence of osteolysis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The stability of cementless acetabular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents is an important   factor for surgical planning in the treatment of patients with pelvic   osteolysis after total hip arthroplasty (THA). However, the methods   for determining the stability of the acetabular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent from pre-operative   radiographs remain controversial. Our aim was to develop a scoring   system to help in the assessment of the stability of the acetabular   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent under these circumstances.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The new scoring system is based on the mechanism of failure of   these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents and the location of the osteolytic lesion, according   to the DeLee and Charnley classification. Each zone is evaluated   and scored separately. The sum of the individual scores from the   three zones is reported as a total score with a maximum of 10 points.   The study involved 96 revision procedures which were undertaken   for wear or osteolysis in 91 patients between July 2002 and December   2012. Pre-operative anteroposterior pelvic radiographs and Judet   views were reviewed. The stability of the acetabular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent was   confirmed intra-operatively.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Intra-operatively, it was found that 64 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents were well-fixed   and 32 were loose. Mean total scores in the well-fixed and loose   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents were 2.9 (0 to 7) and 7.2 (1 to 10), respectively (p   < 0.001). In hips with a low score (0 to 2), the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent was   only loose in one of 33 hips (3%). The incidence of loosening increased   with increasing scores: in those with scores of 3 and 4, two of   19 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents (10.5%) were loose; in hips with scores of 5 and 6, eight   of 19 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents (44.5%) were loose; in hips with scores of 7 or   8, 13 of 17 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents (70.6%) were loose; and for hips with scores   of 9 and 10, nine of nine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents (100%) were loose.

The apo-structure of the leucine sensor Sestrin2 is still elusive
<p>Sestrin2 is a GATOR2-interacting protein that directly binds leucine and is required for the inhibition of mTORC1 under leucine deprivation, indicating that it is a leucine sensor for the mTORC1 pathway. We recently reported the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of Sestrin2 in complex with leucine [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID, 5DJ4] and demonstrated that mutations in the leucine-binding pocket that alter the affinity of Sestrin2 for leucine result in a corresponding change in the leucine sensitivity of mTORC1 in cells. A lower resolution <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of human Sestrin2 (PDB ID, 5CUF), which was crystallized in the absence of exogenous leucine, showed Sestrin2 to be in a nearly identical conformation as the leucine-bound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e. On the basis of this observation, it has been argued that leucine binding does not affect the conformation of Sestrin2 and that Sestrin2 may not be a sensor for leucine. We show that simple analysis of the reported “apo”-Sestrin2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e reveals the clear presence of prominent, unmodeled electron density in the leucine-binding pocket that exactly accommodates the leucine observed in the higher resolution <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e. Refining the reported apo-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e with leucine eliminated the large <i>F</i><sub>obs</sub>-<i>F</i><sub>calc</sub> difference density at this position and improved the working and free R factors of the model. Consistent with this result, our own <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of Sestrin2 crystallized in the absence of exogenous leucine also contained electron density that is best explained by leucine. Thus, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of apo-Sestrin2 remains elusive.</p>

Structure of the human voltage-gated sodium channel Na<sub>v</sub>1.4 in complex with β1
<p>Voltage-gated sodium (Na<sub>v</sub>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s, which are responsible for action potential generation, are implicated in many human diseases. Despite decades of rigorous characterization, the lack of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of any human Na<sub>v</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> has hampered mechanistic understanding. Here, we report the cryo–electron microscopy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of the human Na<sub>v</sub>1.4-β1 complex at 3.2-Å resolution. Accurate model building was made for the pore domain, the voltage-sensing domains, and the β1 subunit, providing insight into the molecular basis for Na<sup>+</sup> permeation and kinetic asymmetry of the four repeats. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al analysis of reported functional residues and disease mutations corroborates an allosteric blocking mechanism for fast inactivation of Na<sub>v</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e provides a path toward mechanistic investigation of Na<sub>v</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s and drug discovery for Na<sub>v</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>opathies.</p>

We describe a framework to design and synthesize a single DNA or RNA strand to self-fold into a complex yet unknotted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e that approximates an arbitrary user-prescribed shape. We experimentally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong> diverse multikilobase single-stranded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es, including a ~10,000-nucleotide (nt) DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e and a ~6000-nt RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e. We demonstrate facile replication of the strand in vitro and in living cells. The work here thus establishes unimolecular folding as a general strategy for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ing complex and replicable nucleic acid nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es, and expands the design space and material scalability for bottom-up nanotechnology.</p>

Comprehensive computational design of ordered peptide macrocycles
<p>Mixed-chirality peptide macrocycles such as cyclosporine are among the most potent therapeutics identified to date, but there is currently no way to systematically search the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al space spanned by such compounds. Natural proteins do not provide a useful guide: Peptide macrocycles lack regular secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es and hydrophobic cores, and can contain local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es not accessible with <sc>l</sc>-amino acids. Here, we enumerate the stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es that can be adopted by macrocyclic peptides composed of <sc>l</sc>- and <sc>d</sc>-amino acids by near-exhaustive backbone sampling followed by sequence design and energy landscape calculations. We identify more than 200 designs predicted to fold into single stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es, many times more than the number of currently available unbound peptide macrocycle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es. Nuclear magnetic resonance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es of 9 of 12 designed 7- to 10-residue macrocycles, and three 11- to 14-residue bicyclic designs, are close to the computational models. Our results provide a nearly complete coverage of the rich space of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es possible for short peptide macrocycles and vastly increase the available starting scaffolds for both rational drug design and library selection methods.</p>

Quantifying the ‘law of diminishing returns’ in magnetically controlled growing rods
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Magnetically controlled growing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rod</span></strong>s (MCGRs) allow non-invasive   correction of the spinal deformity in the treatment of early-onset   scoliosis. Conventional growing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rod</span></strong> systems (CGRS) need repeated   surgical distractions: these are associated with the effect of the   ‘law of diminishing returns’.</p><p>The primary aim of this study was to quantify this effect in   MCGRs over sequential distractions. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 35 patients with a maximum follow-up of 57 months   were included in the study. There were 17 boys and 18 girls with   a mean age of 7.4 years (2 to 14). True Distraction (TD) was determined   by measuring the expansion gap on fluoroscopy. This was compared   with Intended Distraction (ID) and expressed as the ‘T/I’ ratio.   The T/I ratio and the Cobb angle were calculated at several time   points during follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean follow-up was 30 months (6 to 57). There was a significant   decrease in the mean T/I ratio over time (convex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rod</span></strong> at 3 months   0.81, <sc>sd</sc> 0.58 <i>vs</i> 51 months 0.17, <sc>sd </sc>0.16,    p = 0.0001; concave <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rod</span></strong> at 3 months 0.93, <sc>sd</sc> 0.67 <i>vs</i> 51   months 0.18, <sc>sd</sc> 0.15, p = 0.0001). A linear decline of   the mean T/I ratios was noted for both convex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rod</span></strong>s (r<sup>2</sup> =   0.90, p = 0.004) and concave <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rod</span></strong>s (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.81, p = 0.015)   over 51 months. At the 24-month follow-up stage, there was a significant   negative correlation between the mean T/I ratio of the concave <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rod</span></strong>   with weight (r = -0.59, p = 0.01), age (r = -0.59, p = 0.01), and   BMI of the child (r = -0.54,    p = 0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The ‘law of diminishing returns’ is also seen after serial distraction   using MCGR.

Membrane depolarization activates BK channels through ROCK-mediated β1 subunit surface trafficking to limit vasoconstriction
<p>Membrane depolarization of smooth muscle cells (myocytes) in the small arteries that regulate regional organ blood flow leads to vasoconstriction. Membrane depolarization also activates large-conductance calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>)–activated potassium (BK) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s, which limits Ca<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> activity that promotes vasoconstriction, thus leading to vasodilation. We showed that in human and rat arterial myocytes, membrane depolarization rapidly increased the cell surface abundance of auxiliary BK β1 subunits but not that of the pore-forming BKα <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s. Membrane depolarization stimulated voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s, leading to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and the activation of Rho kinase (ROCK) 1 and 2. ROCK1/2-mediated activation of Rab11A promoted the delivery of β1 subunits to the plasma membrane by Rab11A-positive recycling endosomes. These additional β1 subunits associated with BKα <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s already at the plasma membrane, leading to an increase in apparent Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity and activation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s in pressurized arterial myocytes and vasodilation. Thus, membrane depolarization activates BK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s through stimulation of ROCK- and Rab11A-dependent trafficking of β1 subunits to the surface of arterial myocytes.</p>

The conformational state of hERG1 channels determines integrin association, downstream signaling, and cancer progression
<p>Ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration in normal and neoplastic cells through cell-cell and cell–extracellular matrix (ECM) transmembrane receptors called integrins. K<sup>+</sup> flux through the human ether-à-go-go–related gene 1 (hERG1) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> shapes action potential firing in excitable cells such as cardiomyocytes. Its abundance is often aberrantly high in tumors, where it modulates integrin-mediated signaling. We found that hERG1 interacted with the β<sub>1</sub> integrin subunit at the plasma membrane of human cancer cells. This interaction was not detected in cardiomyocytes because of the presence of the hERG1 auxiliary subunit KCNE1 (potassium voltage-gated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> subfamily E regulatory subunit 1), which blocked the β<sub>1</sub> integrin–hERG1 interaction. Although open hERG1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s did not interact as strongly with β<sub>1</sub> integrins as did closed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s, current flow through hERG1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s was necessary to activate the integrin-dependent phosphorylation of Tyr<sup>397</sup> in focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in both normal and cancer cells. In immunodeficient mice, proliferation was inhibited in breast cancer cells expressing forms of hERG1 with impaired K<sup>+</sup> flow, whereas metastasis of breast cancer cells was reduced when the hERG1/β<sub>1</sub> integrin interaction was disrupted. We conclude that the interaction of β<sub>1</sub> integrins with hERG1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s in cancer cells stimulated distinct signaling pathways that depended on the conformational state of hERG1 and affected different aspects of tumor progression.</p>

Structures of human Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 channel in complex with auxiliary subunits and animal toxins
<p>Voltage-gated sodium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 represents a promising target for pain relief. Here we report the cryo–electron microscopy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es of the human Na<sub>v</sub>1.7-β1-β2 complex bound to two combinations of pore blockers and gating modifier toxins (GMTs), tet<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rod</span></strong>otoxin with protoxin-II and saxitoxin with huwentoxin-IV, both determined at overall resolutions of 3.2 angstroms. The two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es are nearly identical except for minor shifts of voltage-sensing domain II (VSD<sub>II</sub>), whose S3-S4 linker accommodates the two GMTs in a similar manner. One additional protoxin-II sits on top of the S3-S4 linker in VSD<sub>IV</sub>. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es may represent an inactivated state with all four VSDs “up” and the intracellular gate closed. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es illuminate the path toward mechanistic understanding of the function and disease of Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 and establish the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">foundat</span></strong>ion for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e-aided development of analgesics.</p>

Structural basis for the modulation of voltage-gated sodium channels by animal toxins
<p>Animal toxins that modulate the activity of voltage-gated sodium (Na<sub>v</sub>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s are broadly divided into two categories—pore blockers and gating modifiers. The pore blockers tet<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rod</span></strong>otoxin (TTX) and saxitoxin (STX) are responsible for puffer fish and shellfish poisoning in humans, respectively. Here, we present <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es of the insect Na<sub>v</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> Na<sub>v</sub>PaS bound to a gating modifier toxin Dc1a at 2.8 angstrom-resolution and in the presence of TTX or STX at 2.6-Å and 3.2-Å resolution, respectively. Dc1a inserts into the cleft between VSD<sub>II</sub> and the pore of Na<sub>v</sub>PaS, making key contacts with both domains. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es with bound TTX or STX reveal the molecular details for the specific blockade of Na<sup>+</sup> access to the selectivity filter from the extracellular side by these guanidinium toxins.

Structure of the cold- and menthol-sensing ion channel TRPM8
<p>Transient receptor potential melastatin (TRPM) cation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s are polymodal sensors that are involved in a variety of physiological processes. Within the TRPM family, member 8 (TRPM8) is the primary cold and menthol sensor in humans. We determined the cryo–electron microscopy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of the full-length TRPM8 from the collared flycatcher at an overall resolution of ~4.1 ångstroms. Our TRPM8 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e reveals a three-layered architecture. The amino-terminal domain with a fold distinct among known TRP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es, together with the carboxyl-terminal region, forms a large two-layered cytosolic ring that extensively interacts with the transmembrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> layer. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e suggests that the menthol-binding site is located within the voltage-sensor–like domain and thus provides a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al glimpse of the design principle of the molecular transducer for cold and menthol sensation.</p>

Structure of the human TRPM4 ion channel in a lipid nanodisc
<p>Transient receptor potential (TRP) melastatin 4 (TRPM4) is a widely expressed cation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> associated with a variety of cardiovascular disorders. TRPM4 is activated by increased intracellular calcium in a voltage-dependent manner but, unlike many other TRP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s, is permeable to monovalent cations only. Here we present two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es of full-length human TRPM4 embedded in lipid nanodiscs at ~3-angstrom resolution, as determined by single-particle cryo–electron microscopy. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es, with and without calcium bound, reveal a general architecture for this major subfamily of TRP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s and a well-defined calcium-binding site within the intracellular side of the S1-S4 domain. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es correspond to two distinct closed states.

D<sub>4</sub> dopamine receptor high-resolution structures enable the discovery of selective agonists
<p>Dopamine receptors are implicated in the pathogenesis and treatment of nearly every neuropsychiatric disorder. Although thousands of drugs interact with these receptors, our molecular understanding of dopaminergic drug selectivity and design remains clouded. To illuminate dopamine receptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e, function, and ligand recognition, we determined crystal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es of the D<sub>4</sub> dopamine receptor in its inactive state bound to the antipsychotic drug nemonapride, with resolutions up to 1.95 angstroms. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es suggest a mechanism for the control of constitutive signaling, and their unusually high resolution enabled a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e-based campaign for new agonists of the D<sub>4</sub> dopamine receptor. The ability to efficiently exploit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e for specific probe discovery—rapidly moving from elucidating receptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e to discovering previously unrecognized, selective agonists—testifies to the power of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e-based approaches.</p>

<sec><title>Aims</title><p>This paper describes the methodology, validation and reliability   of a new computer-assisted method which uses models of the patient’s   bones and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents to measure their migration and polyethylene   wear from radiographs after total hip arthroplasty (THA).</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Models of the patient’s acetabular and femoral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent obtained   from the manufacturer and models of the patient’s pelvis and femur   built from a single computed tomography (CT) scan, are used by a   computer program to measure the migration of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents and   the penetration of the femoral head from anteroposterior and lateral radiographs   taken at follow-up visits. The program simulates the radiographic   setup and matches the position and orientation of the models to   outlines of the pelvis, the acetabular and femoral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent, and   femur on radiographs. Changes in position and orientation reflect   the migration of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents and the penetration of the femoral   head. Validation was performed using radiographs of phantoms simulating   known migration and penetration, and the clinical feasibility of   measuring migration was assessed in two patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Migration of the acetabular and femoral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents can be measured   with limits of agreement (LOA) of 0.37 mm and 0.33 mm, respectively.

High-Resolution Mapping of Chromatin Conformation in Cardiac Myocytes Reveals Structural Remodeling of the Epigenome in Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiovascular disease is associated with epigenomic changes in the heart; however, the endogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of cardiac myocyte chromatin has never been determined.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To investigate the mechanisms of epigenomic function in the heart, genome-wide chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) and DNA sequencing were performed in adult cardiac myocytes following development of pressure overload–induced hypertrophy. Mice with cardiac-specific deletion of CTCF (a ubiquitous chromatin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al protein) were generated to explore the role of this protein in chromatin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e and cardiac phenotype. Transcriptome analyses by RNA-seq were conducted as a functional readout of the epigenomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al changes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Depletion of CTCF was sufficient to induce heart failure in mice, and human patients with heart failure receiving mechanical unloading via left ventricular assist devices show increased CTCF abundance. Chromatin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al analyses revealed interactions within the cardiac myocyte genome at 5-kb resolution, enabling examination of intra- and interchromosomal events, and providing a resource for future cardiac epigenomic investigations. Pressure overload or CTCF depletion selectively altered boundary strength between topologically associating domains and A/B compartmentalization, measurements of genome accessibility. Heart failure involved decreased stability of chromatin interactions around disease-causing genes. In addition, pressure overload or CTCF depletion remodeled long-range interactions of cardiac enhancers, resulting in a significant decrease in local chromatin interactions around these functional elements.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These findings provide a high-resolution chromatin architecture resource for cardiac epigenomic investigations and demonstrate that global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al remodeling of chromatin underpins heart failure. The newly identified principles of endogenous chromatin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e have key implications for epigenetic therapy.</p></sec>

Intracellular cavity of sensor domain controls allosteric gating of TRPA1 channel
<p>Transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) is a temperature-sensitive ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> activated by various pungent and irritant compounds that can p<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rod</span></strong>uce pain in humans. Its activation involves an allosteric mechanism whereby electrophilic agonists evoke interactions within cytosolic domains and open the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> pore through an integrated nexus formed by intracellular membrane proximal regions that are densely packed beneath the lower segment of the S1–S4 sensor domain. Studies indicate that this part of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> may contain residues that form a water-accessible cavity that undergoes changes in solvation during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> gating. We identified conserved polar residues facing the putative lower crevice of the sensor domain that were crucial determinants of the electrophilic, voltage, and calcium sensitivity of the TRPA1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>. This part of the sensor may also comprise a domain capable of binding to membrane phosphoinositides through which gating of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> is regulated in a state-dependent manner.</p>

Three-dimensional genome structures of single diploid human cells
<p>Three-dimensional genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es play a key role in gene regulation and cell functions. Characterization of genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es necessitates single-cell measurements. This has been achieved for haploid cells but has remained a challenge for diploid cells. We developed a single-cell chromatin conformation capture method, termed Dip-C, that combines a transposon-based whole-genome amplification method to detect many chromatin contacts, called META (multiplex end-tagging amplification), and an algorithm to impute the two chromosome haplotypes linked by each contact. We re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ed the genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es of single diploid human cells from a lymphoblastoid cell line and from primary blood cells with high spatial resolution, locating specific single-nucleotide and copy number variations in the nucleus. The two alleles of imprinted loci and the two X chromosomes were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>ally different. Cells of different types displayed statistically distinct genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es. Such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al cell typing is crucial for understanding cell functions.</p>

Cryo-EM structure of a mitochondrial calcium uniporter
<p>Calcium transport plays an important role in regulating mitochondrial physiology and pathophysiology. The mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) is a calcium-selective ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> that is the primary mediator for calcium uptake into the mitochondrial matrix. Here, we present the cryo–electron microscopy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of the full-length MCU from <i>Neurospora crassa</i> to an overall resolution of ~3.7 angstroms. Our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e reveals a tetrameric architecture, with the soluble and transmembrane domains adopting different symmetric arrangements within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>. The conserved W-D-Φ-Φ-E-P-V-T-Y sequence motif of MCU pore forms a selectivity filter comprising two acidic rings separated by one helical turn along the central axis of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> pore. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e combined with mutagenesis gives insight into the basis of calcium recognition.</p>

An evolutionarily conserved gene family encodes proton-selective ion channels
<p>Ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s form the basis for cellular electrical signaling. Despite the scores of genetically identified ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s selective for other monatomic ions, only one type of proton-selective ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> has been found in eukaryotic cells. By comparative transcriptome analysis of mouse taste receptor cells, we identified Otopetrin1 (OTOP1), a protein required for development of gravity-sensing otoconia in the vestibular system, as forming a proton-selective ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>. We found that murine OTOP1 is enriched in acid-detecting taste receptor cells and is required for their zinc-sensitive proton conductance. Two related murine genes, <i>Otop2</i> and <i>Otop3</i>, and a <i>Drosophila</i> ortholog also encode proton <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s. Evolutionary conservation of the gene family and its widespread tissue distribution suggest a broad role for proton <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s in physiology and pathophysiology.</p>

TRPM channels come into focus
<p>Transient receptor potential (TRP) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s were first identified in photoreceptors of the fruit fly (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). In mammals, six major families of TRP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s play key roles in sensing stimuli such as light, temperature, membrane lipids, and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. In 2013, two landmark publications revealed the cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of the heat- and capsaicin-activated TRPV1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> (<i>3</i>, <i>4</i>). Two articles in this issue report cryo-EM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es of cation-selective TRPM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s. On page 228, Autzen <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) describe TRPM4, which is activated by intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and involved in controlling arterial tone, cardiac rhythm, and the immune response (<i>6</i>). On page 237, Yin <i>et al.</i> (<i>7</i>) report on TRPM8, which senses cold and menthol and may serve as a cancer biomarker (<i>8</i>).</p>

Structural insights into ion conduction by channelrhodopsin 2
<p>The light-gated ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>rhodopsin 2 (ChR2) from <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> is a major optogenetic tool. Photon absorption starts a well-characterized photocycle, but the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al basis for the regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> opening remains unclear. We present high-resolution <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es of ChR2 and the C128T mutant, which has a markedly increased open-state lifetime. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e reveals two cavities on the intracellular side and two cavities on the extracellular side. They are connected by extended hydrogen-bonding networks involving water molecules and side-chain residues. Central is the retinal Schiff base that controls and synchronizes three gates that separate the cavities. Separate from this network is the DC gate that comprises a water-mediated bond between C128 and D156 and interacts directly with the retinal Schiff base. Comparison with the C128T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e reveals a direct connection of the DC gate to the central gate and suggests how the gating mechanism is affected by subtle tuning of the Schiff base’s interactions.</p>

Bottom-up construction of a superstructure in a porous uranium-organic crystal
<p>Bottom-up <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ion of highly intricate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es from simple building blocks remains one of the most difficult challenges in chemistry. We report a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>ally complex, mesoporous uranium-based metal-organic framework (MOF) made from simple starting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e comprises 10 uranium nodes and seven tricarboxylate ligands (both crystallographically nonequivalent), resulting in a 173.3-angstrom cubic unit cell enclosing 816 uranium nodes and 816 organic linkers—the largest unit cell found to date for any nonbiological material. The cuboctahedra organize into pentagonal and hexagonal prismatic secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es, which then form tetrahedral and diamond quaternary topologies with unprecedented complexity. This packing results in the formation of colossal icosidodecahedral and rectified hexakaidecahedral cavities with internal diameters of 5.0 nanometers and 6.2 nanometers, respectively—ultimately giving rise to the lowest-density MOF reported to date.</p>

Unequivocal determination of complex molecular structures using anisotropic NMR measurements

Structure of a eukaryotic voltage-gated sodium channel at near-atomic resolution
<p>Voltage-gated sodium (Na<sub>v</sub>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s are responsible for the initiation and propagation of action potentials. They are associated with a variety of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>opathies and are targeted by multiple pharmaceutical drugs and natural toxins. Here, we report the cryogenic electron microscopy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of a putative Na<sub>v</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> from American cockroach (designated Na<sub>v</sub>PaS) at 3.8 angstrom resolution. The voltage-sensing domains (VSDs) of the four repeats exhibit distinct conformations. The entrance to the asymmetric selectivity filter vestibule is guarded by heavily glycosylated and disulfide bond–stabilized extracellular loops. On the cytoplasmic side, a conserved amino-terminal domain is placed below VSD<sub>I</sub>, and a carboxy-terminal domain binds to the III-IV linker. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of Na<sub>v</sub>PaS establishes an important <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">foundat</span></strong>ion for understanding function and disease mechanism of Na<sub>v</sub> and related voltage-gated calcium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Exploiting CELLULOSE SYNTHASE (CESA) Class Specificity to Probe Cellulose Microfibril Biosynthesis
<p>Cellulose microfibrils are the basic units of cellulose in plants. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of these microfibrils is at least partly determined by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of the cellulose synthase complex. In higher plants, this complex is composed of 18 to 24 catalytic subunits known as CELLULOSE SYNTHASE A (CESA) proteins. Three different classes of CESA proteins are required for cellulose synthesis and for secondary cell wall cellulose biosynthesis these classes are represented by CESA4, CESA7, and CESA8. To probe the relationship between CESA proteins and microfibril <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e, we created mutant cesa proteins that lack catalytic activity but retain sufficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al integrity to allow assembly of the cellulose synthase complex. Using a series of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants and genetic backgrounds, we found consistent differences in the ability of these mutant cesa proteins to complement the cellulose-deficient phenotype of the <i>cesa</i> null mutants. The best complementation was observed with catalytically inactive cesa4, while the equivalent mutation in cesa8 exhibited significantly lower levels of complementation. Using a variety of biophysical techniques, including solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance and Fourier transform infrared microscopy, to study these mutant plants, we found evidence for changes in cellulose microfibril <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e, but these changes largely correlated with cellulose content and reflected differences in the relative proportions of primary and secondary cell walls. Our results suggest that individual CESA classes have similar roles in determining cellulose microfibril <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e, and it is likely that the different effects of mutating members of different CESA classes are the consequence of their different catalytic activity and their influence on the overall rate of cellulose synthesis.</p>

Do varus or valgus outliers have higher forces in the medial or lateral compartments than those which are in-range after a kinematically aligned total knee arthroplasty?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of this study were to determine the proportion of patients   with outlier varus or valgus alignment in kinematically aligned   total knee arthroplasty (TKA), whether those with outlier varus   or valgus alignment have higher forces in the medial or lateral   compartments of the knee than those with in-range alignment and   whether measurements of the alignment of the limb, knee and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents   predict compartment forces.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The intra-operative forces in the medial and lateral compartments   were measured with an instrumented tibial insert in 67 patients   who underwent a kinematically aligned TKA during passive movement.

Aldehyde dehydrogenase, Ald4p, is a major component of mitochondrial fluorescent inclusion bodies in the yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>
<p>When <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> strain 3626 was cultured to the stationary phase in a medium that contained glucose, needle-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es that emitted autofluorescence were observed in almost all cells by fluorescence microscopy under UV excitation. The needle-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es completely overlapped with the profile of straight elongated mitochondria. Therefore, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es were designated as mitochondrial fluorescent inclusion bodies (MFIBs). The MFIB-enriched mitochondrial fractions were successfully isolated and 2D-gel electrophoresis revealed that a protein of 54 kDa was only highly concentrated in the fractions. Determination of the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the 54-kDa protein identified it as a mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase, Ald4p. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that anti-Ald4p antibody specifically stained MFIBs. Freeze-substitution electron microscopy demonstrated that cells that retained MFIBs had electron-dense filamentous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es with a diameter of 10 nm in straight elongated mitochondria. Immunoelectron microscopy showed that Ald4p was localized to the electron-dense filamentous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es in mitochondria. These results together showed that a major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent of MFIBs is Ald4p. In addition, we demonstrate that MFIBs are common features that appear in mitochondria of many species of yeast.</p>

Structure of the human PKD1-PKD2 complex
<p>Mutations in two genes, <i>PKD1</i> and <i>PKD2</i>, account for most cases of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, one of the most common monogenetic disorders. Here we report the 3.6-angstrom cryo–electron microscopy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of truncated human PKD1-PKD2 complex assembled in a 1:3 ratio. PKD1 contains a voltage-gated ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> (VGIC) fold that interacts with PKD2 to form the domain-swapped, yet noncanonical, transient receptor potential (TRP) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> architecture. The S6 helix in PKD1 is broken in the middle, with the extracellular half, S6a, resembling pore helix 1 in a typical TRP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>. Three positively charged, cavity-facing residues on S6b may block cation permeation. In addition to the VGIC, a five–transmembrane helix domain and a cytosolic PLAT domain were resolved in PKD1. The PKD1-PKD2 complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e establishes a framework for dissecting the function and disease mechanisms of the PKD proteins.</p>

Hybrid molecular-colloidal liquid crystals
<p>Order and fluidity often coexist, with examples ranging from biological membranes to liquid crystals, but the symmetry of these soft-matter systems is typically higher than that of the constituent building blocks. We dispersed micrometer-long inorganic colloidal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rod</span></strong>s in a nematic liquid crystalline fluid of molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rod</span></strong>s. Both types of uniaxial building blocks, while freely diffusing, interact to form an orthorhombic nematic fluid, in which like-sized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rod</span></strong>s are roughly parallel to each other and the molecular ordering direction is orthogonal to that of colloidal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rod</span></strong>s. A coarse-grained model explains the experimental temperature-concentration phase diagram with one biaxial and two uniaxial nematic phases, as well as the orientational distributions of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rod</span></strong>s. Displaying properties of biaxial optical crystals, these hybrid molecular-colloidal fluids can be switched by electric and magnetic fields.</p>

Structure of the DASH/Dam1 complex shows its role at the yeast kinetochore-microtubule interface
<p>Kinetochores connect mitotic-spindle microtubules with chromosomes, allowing microtubule depolymerization to pull chromosomes apart during anaphase while resisting detachment as the microtubule shortens. The hete<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rod</span></strong>ecameric DASH/Dam1 complex (DASH/Dam1c), an essential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent of yeast kinetochores, assembles into a microtubule-encircling ring. The ring associates with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rod</span></strong>like Ndc80 complexes to organize the kinetochore-microtubule interface. We report the cryo–electron microscopy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e (at ~4.5-angstrom resolution) of a DASH/Dam1c ring and a molecular model of its ordered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ents, validated by evolutionary direct-coupling analysis. Integrating this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e with that of the Ndc80 complex and with published interaction data yields a molecular picture of kinetochore-microtubule attachment, including how flexible, C-terminal extensions of DASH/Dam1c subunits project and contact widely separated sites on the Ndc80 complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rod</span></strong> and how phosphorylation at previously identified sites might regulate kinetochore assembly.</p>

Mechanism of transmembrane signaling by sensor histidine kinases
<p>One of the major and essential classes of transmembrane (TM) receptors, present in all domains of life, is sensor histidine kinases, parts of two-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent signaling systems (TCSs). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al mechanisms of TM signaling by these sensors are poorly understood. We present crystal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es of the periplasmic sensor domain, the TM domain, and the cytoplasmic HAMP domain of the <i>Escherichia coli</i> nitrate/nitrite sensor histidine kinase NarQ in the ligand-bound and mutated ligand-free states. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es reveal that the ligand binding induces rearrangements and pistonlike shifts of TM helices. The HAMP domain protomers undergo leverlike motions and convert these pistonlike motions into helical rotations. Our findings provide the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al framework for complete understanding of TM TCS signaling and for development of antimicrobial treatments targeting TCSs.</p>

Cryo-EM structures of the triheteromeric NMDA receptor and its allosteric modulation
<p><i>N</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are heterotetrameric ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s assembled as diheteromeric or triheteromeric complexes. Here, we report <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es of the triheteromeric GluN1/GluN2A/GluN2B receptor in the absence or presence of the GluN2B-specific allosteric modulator Ro 25-6981 (Ro), determined by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). In the absence of Ro, the GluN2A and GluN2B amino-terminal domains (ATDs) adopt “closed” and “open” clefts, respectively. Upon binding Ro, the GluN2B ATD clamshell transitions from an open to a closed conformation. Consistent with a predominance of the GluN2A subunit in ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> gating, the GluN2A subunit interacts more extensively with GluN1 subunits throughout the receptor, in comparison with the GluN2B subunit. Differences in the conformation of the pseudo-2-fold–related GluN1 subunits further reflect receptor asymmetry. The triheteromeric NMDAR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es provide the first view of the most common NMDA receptor assembly and show how incorporation of two different GluN2 subunits modifies receptor symmetry and subunit interactions, allowing each subunit to uniquely influence receptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e and function, thus increasing receptor complexity.</p>

Nodulin Intrinsic Protein 7;1 Is a Tapetal Boric Acid Channel Involved in Pollen Cell Wall Formation
<p>Boron is an essential plant micronutrient that plays a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al role in the rhamnogalacturonan II <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compon</span></strong>ent of the pectic cell wall. To prevent boron deficiency under limiting conditions, its uptake, distribution, and homeostasis are mediated by boric acid transporters and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> proteins. Among the membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong>s that facilitate boric acid uptake are the type II nodulin intrinsic protein (NIP) subfamily of aquaporin-like proteins. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) possesses three NIP II genes (<i>NIP5;1</i>, <i>NIP6;1</i>, and <i>NIP7;1</i>) that show distinct tissue expression profiles (predominantly expressed in roots, stem nodes, and developing flowers, respectively). Orthologs of each are represented in all dicots. Here, we show that purified and reconstituted NIP7;1 is a boric acid facilitator. By using native promoter-reporter fusions, we show that NIP7;1 is expressed predominantly in anthers of young flowers in a narrow developmental window, floral stages 9 and 10, with protein accumulation solely within tapetum cells, where it is localized to the plasma membrane. Under limiting boric acid conditions, loss-of-function T-DNA mutants (<i>nip7;1-1</i> and <i>nip7;1-2</i>) show reduced fertility, including shorter siliques and an increase in aborted seeds, compared with the wild type. Under these conditions, <i>nip7;1</i> mutant pollen grains show morphological defects, increased aggregation, defective exine cell wall formation, reduced germination frequency, and decreased viability. During stages 9 and 10, the tapetum is essential for supplying materials to the pollen microspore cell wall. We propose that NIP7;1 serves as a gated boric acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">channel</span></strong> in developing anthers that aids in the uptake of this critical micronutrient by tapetal cells.</p>

Systems Genetics Identifies a Novel Regulatory Domain of Amylose Synthesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>A deeper understanding of the regulation of starch biosynthesis in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) endosperm is crucial in tailoring digestibility without sacrificing grain quality. In this study, significant association peaks on chromosomes 6 and 7 were identified through a genomewide association study (GWAS) of debranched starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e from grains of a 320 <i>indica</i> rice diversity panel using genotyping data from the high-density rice array. A systems genetics approach that interrelates starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e data from GWAS to functional pathways from a gene regulatory network identified known genes with high correlation to the proportion of amylose and amylopectin. An SNP in the promoter region of <i>Granule Bound Starch Synthase I</i> was identified along with seven other SNPs to form haplotypes that discriminate samples into different phenotypic ranges of amylose. A GWAS peak on chromosome 7 between LOC_Os07g11020 and LOC_Os07g11520 indexed by a nonsynonymous SNP mutation on exon 5 of a bHLH transcription factor was found to elevate the proportion of amylose at the expense of reduced short-chain amylopectin. Linking starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e with starch digestibility by determining the kinetics of cooked grain amylolysis of selected haplotypes revealed strong association of starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e with estimated digestibility kinetics. Combining all results from grain quality genomics, systems genetics, and digestibility phenotyping, we propose target haplotypes for fine-tuning starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e in rice through marker-assisted breeding that can be used to alter the digestibility of rice grain, thus offering rice consumers a new diet-based intervention to mitigate the impact of nutrition-related noncommunicable diseases.</p>

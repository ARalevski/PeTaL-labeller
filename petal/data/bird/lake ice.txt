Gastrointestinal and renal responses to variable water intake in whitebellied sunbirds and New Holland honeyeaters
<p>Nectarivores face a constant challenge in terms of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> balance, experiencing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> loading or dehydration when switching between food plants or between feeding and fasting. To understand how whitebellied sunbirds and New Holland honeyeaters meet the challenges of varying preformed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> load, we used the elimination of intramuscular-injected [<sup>14</sup>C]-<sc>l</sc>-glucose and <sup>3</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O to quantify intestinal and renal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> handling on diets varying in sugar concentration. Both sunbirds and honeyeaters showed significant modulation of intestinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> absorption, allowing excess <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> to be shunted through the intestine when on dilute diets. Despite reducing their fractional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> absorption, both species showed linear increases in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> flux and fractional body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> turnover as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> intake increased (both afternoon and morning), suggesting that the modulation of fractional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> absorption was not sufficient to completely offset dietary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> loads. In both species, glomerular filtration rate was independent of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> gain (but was higher for the afternoon), as was renal fractional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> reabsorption (measured in the afternoon). During the natural overnight fast, both sunbirds and honeyeaters arrested whole kidney function. Evaporative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> loss in sunbirds was variable but correlated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> gain. Both sunbirds and honeyeaters appear to modulate intestinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> absorption as an important component of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> regulation to help deal with massive preformed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> loads. Shutting down glomerular filtration rate during the overnight fast is another way of saving energy for osmoregulatory function. Birds maintain osmotic balance on diets varying markedly in preformed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> load by varying both intestinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> absorption and excretion through the intestine and kidneys.</p>

Spatiotemporal Coupling of Vessel Cavitation and Discharge of Stored Xylem Water in a Tree Sapling
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> discharge from stem internal storage compartments is thought to minimize the risk of vessel cavitation. Based on this concept, one would expect that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> storage compartments involved in the buffering of xylem tensions empty before the onset of vessel cavitation under drought stress, and potentially refill after soil saturation. However, scant in vivo data exist that elucidate this localized spatiotemporal coupling. In this study on intact saplings of American chestnut (<i>Castanea dentata</i>), x-ray computed microtomography (microCT) showed that the xylem matrix surrounding vessels releases stored <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> and becomes air-filled either concurrent to or after vessel cavitation under progressive drought stress. Among annual growth rings, the xylem matrix of the current year remained largely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-filled even under severe drought stress. In comparison, microtomography images collected on excised stems showed that applied pressures of much greater than 0 MPa were required to induce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> release from the xylem matrix. Viability staining highlighted that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> release from the xylem matrix was associated primarily with emptying of dead fibers. Refilling of the xylem matrix and vessels was detected in intact saplings when the canopy was bagged and stem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> potential was close to 0 MPa, and in leafless saplings over the winter period. In conclusion, this study indicates that the bulk of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> stored in the xylem matrix is released after the onset of vessel cavitation, and suggests that capillary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> contributes to overall stem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> storage under drought but is not used primarily for the prevention of drought-induced vessel cavitation in this species.</p>

Components of Water Use Efficiency Have Unique Genetic Signatures in the Model C<sub>4</sub> Grass <i>Setaria</i>
<p>Plant growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use are interrelated processes influenced by genetically controlled morphological and biochemical characteristics. Improving plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use efficiency (WUE) to sustain growth in different environments is an important breeding objective that can improve crop yields and enhance agricultural sustainability. However, genetic improvement of WUE using traditional methods has proven difficult due to the low throughput and environmental heterogeneity of field settings. To overcome these limitations, this study utilizes a high-throughput phenotyping platform to quantify plant size and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use of an interspecific <i>Setaria italica</i> × <i>Setaria viridis</i> recombinant inbred line population at daily intervals in both well-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>ed and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-limited conditions. Our findings indicate that measurements of plant size and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use are correlated strongly in this system; therefore, a linear modeling approach was used to partition this relationship into predicted values of plant size given <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use and deviations from this relationship at the genotype level. The resulting traits describing plant size, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use, and WUE all were heritable and responsive to soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> availability, allowing for a genetic dissection of the components of plant WUE under different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>ing treatments. Linkage mapping identified major loci underlying two different pleiotropic components of WUE. This study indicates that alleles controlling WUE derived from both wild and domesticated accessions can be utilized to predictably modulate trait values given a specified precipitation regime in the model C<sub>4</sub> genus <i>Setaria</i>.</p>

Storage Compartments for Capillary Water Rarely Refill in an Intact Woody Plant
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> storage is thought to play an integral role in the maintenance of whole-plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> balance. The contribution of both living and dead cells to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> storage can be derived from rehydration and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-release curves on excised plant material, but the underlying tissue-specific emptying/refilling dynamics remain unclear. Here, we used x-ray computed microtomography to characterize the refilling of xylem fibers, pith cells, and vessels under both excised and in vivo conditions in <i>Laurus nobilis</i>. In excised stems supplied with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> uptake exhibited a biphasic response curve, and x-ray computed microtomography images showed that high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> storage capacitance was associated with fiber and pith refilling as driven by capillary forces: fibers refilled more rapidly than pith cells, while vessel refilling was minimal. In excised stems that were sealed, fiber and pith refilling was associated with vessel emptying, indicating a link between tissue connectivity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> storage. In contrast, refilling of fibers, pith cells, and vessels was negligible in intact saplings over two time scales, 24 h and 3 weeks. However, those compartments did refill slowly when the shoot was covered to prevent transpiration. Collectively, our data (1) provide direct evidence that storage compartments for capillary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> refill in excised stems but rarely under in vivo conditions, (2) highlight that estimates of capacitance from excised samples should be interpreted with caution, as certain storage compartments may not be utilized in the intact plant, and (3) question the paradigm that fibers play a substantial role in daily discharge/recharge of stem capacitance in an intact tree.</p>

Tree Physiology
Temperate tree species show identical response in tree water deficit but different sensitivities in sap flow to summer soil drying
<p>Temperate forests are expected to be particularly vulnerable to drought and soil drying because they are not adapted to such conditions and perform best in mesic environments. Here we ask (i) how sensitively four common temperate tree species (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i>, <i>P<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ice</span></strong>a abies</i>, <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> and <i>Fraxinus excelsior</i>) respond in their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> relations to summer soil drying and seek to determine (ii) if species-specific responses to summer soil drying are related to the onset of declining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> status across the four species. Throughout 2012 and 2013 we determined tree <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit (TWD) as a proxy for tree <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> status from recorded stem radius changes and monitored sap flow rates with sensors on 16 mature trees studied in the field at Lageren, Switzerland. All tree species responded equally in their relative maximum TWD to the onset of declining soil moisture. This implies that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> supply of all tree species was affected by declining soil moisture and that none of the four species was able to fully maintain its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> status, e.g., by access to alternative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> sources in the soil. In contrast we found strong and highly species-specific responses of sap flow to declining soil moisture with the strongest decline in <i>P. abies</i> (92%), followed by <i>F. sylvatica</i> (53%) and <i>A. pseudoplatanus</i> (48%). <i>F. excelsior</i> did not significantly reduce sap flow. We hypothesize the species-specific responses in sap flow to declining soil moisture that occur despite a simultaneous increase in relative TWD in all species reflect how fast these species approach critical levels of their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> status, which is most likely influenced by species-specific traits determining the hydraulic properties of the species tree.</p>

Organ-coordinated response of early post-germination mahogany seedlings to drought
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit tolerance during post-germination stages is critical for seedling recruitment. In this work, we studied the effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit on morphological and biochemical responses in different organs of newly germinated mahogany (<i>Swietenia macrophylla</i> King) seedlings, a woody species that occurs in the Amazon rainforest. The root : shoot ratio increased under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit. The leaf number and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> potential were not altered, although reductions in leaf area and stomatal conductance were observed. Osmotic potential became more negative in leaves of seedlings under severe stress. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit increased fructose, glucose, sucrose and myo-inositol levels in leaves. Stems accumulated fructose, glucose and <sc>l</sc>-proline. Nitric oxide (NO) levels increased in the vascular cylinder of roots under severe stress while superoxide anion levels decreased due to augmented superoxide dismutase activity in this organ. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit induced glutathione reductase activity in both roots and stems. Upon moderate or severe stress, catalase activity decreased in leaves and remained unaffected in the other seedling organs, allowing for an increase of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) levels in leaves. Overall, the increase of signaling molecules in distinct organs—NO in roots, <sc>l</sc>-proline in stems and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and myo-inositol in leaves—contributed to the response of mahogany seedlings to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit by triggering biochemical processes that resulted in the attenuation of oxidative stress and the establishment of osmotic adjustment. Therefore, this body of evidence reveals that the development of newly germinated mahogany seedlings may occur in both natural habitats and crop fields even when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> availability is greatly limited.</p>

A liquid-liquid transition in supercooled aqueous solution related to the HDA-LDA transition
<p>Simulations and theory suggest that the thermodynamic anomalies of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> may be related to a phase transition between two supercooled liquid states, but so far this phase transition has not been observed experimentally because of preemptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ice</span></strong> crystallization. We used calorimetry, infrared spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-rich hydrazinium trifluoroacetate solution in which the local hydrogen bond structure surrounding a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> molecule resembles that in neat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> at elevated pressure, but which does not crystallize upon cooling. Instead, this solution underwent a sharp, reversible phase transition between two homogeneous liquid states. The hydrogen-bond structures of these two states are similar to those established for high- and low-density amorphous (HDA and LDA) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>. Such structural similarity supports theories that predict a similar sharp transition in pure <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> under pressure if <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ice</span></strong> crystallization could be suppressed.</p>

Exposed subsurface ice sheets in the Martian mid-latitudes
<p>Thick deposits cover broad regions of the Martian mid-latitudes with a smooth mantle; erosion in these regions creates scarps that expose the internal structure of the mantle. We investigated eight of these locations and found that they expose deposits of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ice</span></strong> that can be >100 meters thick, extending downward from depths as shallow as 1 to 2 meters below the surface. The scarps are actively retreating because of sublimation of the exposed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ice</span></strong>. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ice</span></strong> deposits likely originated as snowfall during Mars’ high-obliquity periods and have now compacted into massive, fractured, and layered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ice</span></strong>. We expect the vertical structure of Martian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ice</span></strong>-rich deposits to preserve a record of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ice</span></strong> deposition and past climate.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Going with the Flow: Multiscale Insights into the Composite Nature of Water Transport in Roots
<p>As <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> often limits crop production, a more complete understanding of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> capture and transport is necessary. Here, we developed MECHA, a mathematical model that computes the flow of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> across the root at the scale of walls, membranes, and plasmodesmata of individual cells, and used it to test hypotheses related to root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> transport in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). The model uses detailed root anatomical descriptions and a minimal set of experimental cell properties, including the conductivity of plasma membranes, cell walls, and plasmodesmata, which yield quantitative and scale-consistent estimations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> pathways and root radial hydraulic conductivity (<i>k</i><sub>r</sub>). MECHA revealed that the mainstream hydraulic theories derived independently at the cell and root segment scales are compatible only if osmotic potentials within the apoplastic domains are uniform. The results suggested that the convection-diffusion of apoplastic solutes explained most of the offset between estimated <i>k</i><sub>r</sub> in pressure clamp and osmotic experiments, while the contribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-filled intercellular spaces was limited. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses quantified the relative impact of cortex and endodermis cell conductivity of plasma membranes on root <i>k</i><sub>r</sub> and suggested that only the latter contributed substantially to <i>k</i><sub>r</sub> due to the composite nature of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> flow across roots. The explicit root hydraulic anatomy framework brings insights into contradictory interpretations of experiments from the literature and suggests experiments to efficiently address questions pertaining to root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> relations. Its scale consistency opens avenues for cross-scale communication in the world of root hydraulics.</p>

Acclimation of <i>Betula alleghaniensis</i> Britton to moderate soil water deficit: small morphological changes make for important consequences in crown display
<p>In the context of the predicted increasing frequency of summer droughts in the northeastern deciduous forest of North America due to climate change, we investigated the acclimation capacity of yellow birch, an economically important native tree species, to soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit. We carried out an integrated examination of allocation of biomass, leaf physiology, branching pattern and in situ 3D crown display. Potted seedlings were subjected to moderate soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit for four consecutive months during their second growing season. Individuals under soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit showed a 40% decrease in biomass accumulation but no change in the relative allocation of biomass to the different plant compartments. Net CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rates at leaf level decreased under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit (~15%) but could not alone explain the total reduction in growth, excluding the carbon starvation hypothesis. The observed reduction in net CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rates was related to a decrease in stomatal conductance and chlorophyll content. <i>STAR</i><sub>zen</sub> (in situ silhouette to total leaf area ratio; a proxy for light interception efficiency) decreased under soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit due to shifts in biomass allocation within the branch compartment from long upper axes to short bottom axes. Despite the fact that the understanding of the processes involved in growth reduction and branching pattern alteration will need more attention in future research, we conclude that under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit yellow birch at young stages will: (i) experience a substantial loss of growth and biomass; and (ii) acclimate through architectural plasticity rather than through changes in the relative allocation of root biomass to enhance its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> management.</p>

Low–interfacial toughness materials for effective large-scale deicing
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ice</span></strong> accretion has adverse effects on a range of commercial and residential activities. The force required to remove <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ice</span></strong> from a surface is typically considered to scale with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ice</span></strong>d area. This imparts a scalability limit to the use of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ice</span></strong>phobic coatings for structures with large surface areas, such as power lines or ship hulls. We describe a class of materials that exhibit a low interfacial toughness with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ice</span></strong>, resulting in systems for which the forces required to remove large areas of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ice</span></strong> (a few square centimeters or greater) are both low and independent of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ice</span></strong>d area. We further demonstrate that coatings made of such materials allow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ice</span></strong> to be shed readily from large areas (~1 square meter) merely by self-weight.</p>

Seasonal exposure of carbon dioxide ice on the nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is one of the most abundant species in cometary nuclei, but because of its high volatility, CO<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ice</span></strong> is generally only found beneath the surface. We report the infrared spectroscopic identification of a CO<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ice</span></strong>–rich surface area located in the Anhur region of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Spectral modeling shows that about 0.1% of the 80- by 60-meter area is CO<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ice</span></strong>. This exposed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ice</span></strong> was observed a short time after the comet exited local winter; following the increased illumination, the CO<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ice</span></strong> completely disappeared over about 3 weeks.

Observed Arctic sea-ice loss directly follows anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emission
<p>Arctic sea <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ice</span></strong> is retreating rapidly, raising prospects of a future <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ice</span></strong>-free Arctic Ocean during summer. Because climate-model simulations of the sea-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ice</span></strong> loss differ substantially, we used a robust linear relationship between monthly-mean September sea-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ice</span></strong> area and cumulative carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions to infer the future evolution of Arctic summer sea <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ice</span></strong> directly from the observational record. The observed linear relationship implies a sustained loss of 3 ± 0.3 square meters of September sea-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ice</span></strong> area per metric ton of CO<sub>2</sub> emission. On the basis of this sensitivity, Arctic sea <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ice</span></strong> will be lost throughout September for an additional 1000 gigatons of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Most models show a lower sensitivity, which is possibly linked to an underestimation of the modeled increase in incoming longwave radiation and of the modeled transient climate response.</p>

Combined effects of defoliation and water stress on pine growth and non-structural carbohydrates
<p>Climate change is expected to increase both pest insect damage and the occurrence of severe drought. There is therefore a need to better understand the combined effects of biotic and abiotic damage on tree growth in order to predict the multi-factorial effect of climate change on forest ecosystem productivity. Indeed, the effect of stress interactions on tree growth is an increasingly important topic that greatly lacks experiments and data, and it is unlikely that the impact of combined stresses can be extrapolated from the outcomes of studies that focused on a single stress. We developed an original manipulative study under real field conditions where we applied artificial defoliation and induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> stress on 10-year-old (∼10 m high) maritime pine trees (<i>Pinus pinaster</i> Ait.). Tree response to combined stresses was quantitatively assessed following tree secondary growth and carbohydrate pools. Such a design allowed us to address the crucial question of combined stresses on trees under stand conditions, sharing soil supplies with neighboring trees. Our initial hypotheses were that (i) moderate defoliation can limit the impact of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> stress on tree growth through reduced transpiration demand by a tree canopy partly defoliated and that (ii) defoliation results in reduced non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) pools, affecting tree tolerance to drought. Our results showed additive effects of defoliation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> stress on tree growth and contradict our initial hypothesis. Indeed, under stand conditions, we found that partial defoliation does not limit the impact of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> stress through reduced transpiration. Our study also highlighted that, even if NSC in all organs were affected by defoliation, tree response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> stress was not triggered. We found that stem NSC were maintained or increased during the entire growing season, supporting literature-based hypotheses such as an active maintenance of the hydraulic system or another limiting resource for tree growth under defoliation. We also observed a significant decrease in root carbohydrates, which suggests a shift in the root carbon balance under defoliation. The decrease in carbohydrate supply under defoliation may not counterbalance the carbon use for mineral and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> uptakes or a translocation to other tissues.</p>

Anomalously low dielectric constant of confined water
<p>The dielectric constant ε of interfacial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> has been predicted to be smaller than that of bulk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> (ε ≈ 80) because the rotational freedom of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> dipoles is expected to decrease near surfaces, yet experimental evidence is lacking.

Our experiments reveal the presence of an interfacial layer with vanishingly small polarization such that its out-of-plane ε is only ~2.

Enhanced water permeability and tunable ion selectivity in subnanometer carbon nanotube porins
<p>Fast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> transport through carbon nanotube pores has raised the possibility to use them in the next generation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> treatment technologies. We report that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> permeability in 0.8-nanometer-diameter carbon nanotube porins (CNTPs), which confine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> down to a single-file chain, exceeds that of biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> transporters and of wider CNT pores by an order of magnitude. Intermolecular hydrogen-bond rearrangement, required for entry into the nanotube, dominates the energy barrier and can be manipulated to enhance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> transport rates.

Water harvesting from air with metal-organic frameworks powered by natural sunlight

Extensive water ice within Ceres’ aqueously altered regolith: Evidence from nuclear spectroscopy
<p>The surface elemental composition of dwarf planet Ceres constrains its regolith <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ice</span></strong> content, aqueous alteration processes, and interior evolution. Using nuclear spectroscopy data acquired by NASA’s Dawn mission, we determined the concentrations of elemental hydrogen, iron, and potassium on Ceres. The data show that surface materials were processed by the action of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> within the interior. The non-icy portion of Ceres’ carbon-bearing regolith contains similar amounts of hydrogen to those present in aqueously altered carbonaceous chondrites; however, the concentration of iron on Ceres is lower than in the aforementioned chondrites. This allows for the possibility that Ceres experienced modest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ice</span></strong>-rock fractionation, resulting in differences between surface and bulk composition. At mid-to-high latitudes, the regolith contains high concentrations of hydrogen, consistent with broad expanses of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ice</span></strong>, confirming theoretical predictions that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ice</span></strong> can survive for billions of years just beneath the surface.</p>

Genetic Control of Plasticity in Root Morphology and Anatomy of Rice in Response to Water Deficit
<p>Elucidating the genetic control of rooting behavior under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-deficit stress is essential to breed climate-robust r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ice</span></strong> (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) cultivars. Using a diverse panel of 274 <i>indica</i> genotypes grown under control and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-deficit conditions during vegetative growth, we phenotyped 35 traits, mostly related to root morphology and anatomy, involving 45,000 root-scanning images and nearly 25,000 cross sections from the root-shoot junction. The phenotypic plasticity of these traits was quantified as the relative change in trait value under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-deficit compared with control conditions. We then carried out a genome-wide association analysis on these traits and their plasticity, using 45,608 high-quality single-nucleotide polymorphisms. One hundred four significant loci were detected for these traits under control conditions, 106 were detected under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-deficit stress, and 76 were detected for trait plasticity. We predicted 296 (control), 284 (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-deficit stress), and 233 (plasticity) a priori candidate genes within linkage disequilibrium blocks for these loci. We identified key a priori candidate genes regulating root growth and development and relevant alleles that, upon validation, can help improve r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ice</span></strong> adaptation to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-deficit stress.</p>

Limited acclimation in leaf anatomy to experimental drought in tropical rainforest trees
<p>Dry periods are predicted to become more frequent and severe in the future in some parts of the tropics, including Amazonia, potentially causing reduced productivity, higher tree mortality and increased emissions of stored carbon. Using a long-term (12 year) through-fall exclusion (TFE) experiment in the tropics, we test the hypothesis that trees produce leaves adapted to cope with higher levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> stress, by examining the following leaf characteristics: area, thickness, leaf mass per area, vein density, stomatal density, the thickness of palisade mesophyll, spongy mesophyll and both of the epidermal layers, internal cavity volume and the average cell sizes of the palisade and spongy mesophyll. We also test whether differences in leaf anatomy are consistent with observed differential drought-induced mortality responses among taxa, and look for relationships between leaf anatomy, and leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> relations and gas exchange parameters. Our data show that trees do not produce leaves that are more xeromorphic in response to 12 years of soil moisture deficit. However, the drought treatment did result in increases in the thickness of the adaxial epidermis (TFE: 20.5 ± 1.5 µm, control: 16.7 ± 1.0 µm) and the internal cavity volume (TFE: 2.43 ± 0.50 mm<sup>3</sup> cm<sup>−2</sup>, control: 1.77 ± 0.30 mm<sup>3 </sup>cm<sup>−2</sup>). No consistent differences were detected between drought-resistant and drought-sensitive taxa, although interactions occurred between drought-sensitivity status and drought treatment for the palisade mesophyll thickness (<i>P</i> = 0.034) and the cavity volume of the leaves (<i>P</i> = 0.025). The limited response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit probably reflects a tight co-ordination between leaf morphology, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> relations and photosynthetic properties. This suggests that there is little plasticity in these aspects of plant anatomy in these taxa, and that phenotypic plasticity in leaf traits may not facilitate the acclimation of Amazonian trees to the predicted future reductions in dry season <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> availability.</p>

Slowdown in Antarctic mass loss from solid Earth and sea-level feedbacks

Quantitative analysis of the radar signals shows that this bright feature has high relative dielectric permittivity (>15), matching that of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-bearing materials.

Thirst-associated preoptic neurons encode an aversive motivational drive
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deprivation produces a drive to seek and consume <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>. How neural activity creates this motivation remains poorly understood. We used activity-dependent genetic labeling to characterize neurons activated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deprivation in the hypothalamic median preoptic nucleus (MnPO). Single-cell transcriptional profiling revealed that dehydration-activated MnPO neurons consist of a single excitatory cell type. After optogenetic activation of these neurons, m<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ice</span></strong> drank <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> and performed an operant lever-pressing task for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> reward with rates that scaled with stimulation frequency. This stimulation was aversive, and instrumentally pausing stimulation could reinforce lever-pressing. Activity of these neurons gradually decreased over the course of an operant session. Thus, the activity of dehydration-activated MnPO neurons establishes a scalable, persistent, and aversive internal state that dynamically controls thirst-motivated behavior.</p>

Greater role for Atlantic inflows on sea-ice loss in the Eurasian Basin of the Arctic Ocean
<p>Arctic sea-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ice</span></strong> loss is a leading indicator of climate change and can be attributed, in large part, to atmospheric forcing. Here, we show that recent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ice</span></strong> reductions, weakening of the halocline, and shoaling of the intermediate-depth Atlantic Water layer in the eastern Eurasian Basin have increased winter ventilation in the ocean interior, making this region structurally similar to that of the western Eurasian Basin. The associated enhanced release of oceanic heat has reduced winter sea-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ice</span></strong> formation at a rate now comparable to losses from atmospheric thermodynamic forcing, thus explaining the recent reduction in sea-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ice</span></strong> cover in the eastern Eurasian Basin. This encroaching “atlantification” of the Eurasian Basin represents an essential step toward a new Arctic climate state, with a substantially greater role for Atlantic inflows.</p>

Active sites in heterogeneous ice nucleation—the example of K-rich feldspars
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ice</span></strong> formation on aerosol particles is a process of crucial importance to Earth’s climate and the environmental sciences, but it is not understood at the molecular level.

Here we report direct electron-microscopic observations of deposition growth of aligned <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ice</span></strong> crystals on feldspar, an atmospherically important component of mineral dust. Our molecular-scale computer simulations indicate that this alignment arises from the preferential nucleation of prismatic crystal planes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ice</span></strong> on high-energy (100) surface planes of feldspar. The microscopic patches of (100) surface, exposed at surface defects such as steps, cracks, and cavities, are thought to be responsible for the high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ice</span></strong> nucleation efficacy of potassium (K)–feldspar particles.</p>

The Hydrogen Isotope Composition δ<sup>2</sup>H Reflects Plant Performance
<p>The stable carbon (δ<sup>13</sup>C) and oxygen (δ<sup>18</sup>O) isotope compositions in plant matter reflect photosynthetic and transpirative conditions in plants, respectively. However, the nature of hydrogen isotope composition (δ<sup>2</sup>H) and what it reflects of plant performance is poorly understood. Using durum wheat (<i>Triticum turgidum</i> var <i>durum</i>), this study evaluated the effect of different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> and nitrogen growing field conditions on transpiration and how this effect influenced the performance of δ<sup>2</sup>H in autotrophic (flag leaf), mixotrophic (ears), and heterotrophic (grains and roots) organs. Moreover, δ<sup>2</sup>H was compared with the δ<sup>13</sup>C and δ<sup>18</sup>O in the same organs. Isotope compositions were analyzed in dry matter, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-soluble fraction, and in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> from different tissues of a set of genotypes. Similar to δ<sup>13</sup>C, the δ<sup>2</sup>H correlated negatively with stomatal conductance, whereas no correlation was observed for δ<sup>18</sup>O. Moreover, δ<sup>2</sup>H was not only affected by changes in transpiration but also by photosynthetic reactions, probably as a consequence of NADPH formation in autotrophic organs. Compared with the δ<sup>2</sup>H of stem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>, plant δ<sup>2</sup>H was strongly diminished in photosynthetic organs such as the flag leaves, whereas it strongly increased in heterotrophic organs such as grains and roots. In heterotrophic organs, δ<sup>2</sup>H was associated with postphotosynthetic effects because there are several processes that lead to <sup>2</sup>H-enrichment of carbohydrates. In summary, δ<sup>2</sup>H exhibited specific features that inform about the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> conditions of the wheat crop, together with the photosynthetic characteristics of the plant part considered. Moreover, correlations of δ<sup>2</sup>H with grain yield illustrate that this isotope can be used to assess plant performance under different growing conditions.</p>

Abscisic Acid Down-Regulates Hydraulic Conductance of Grapevine Leaves in Isohydric Genotypes Only<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plants evolved different strategies to cope with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> stress. While isohydric species maintain their midday leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> potential (Ψ<sub>M</sub>) under soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit by closing their stomata, anisohydric species maintain higher stomatal aperture and exhibit substantial reductions in Ψ<sub>M</sub>. It was hypothesized that isohydry is related to a locally higher sensitivity of stomata to the drought-hormone abscisic acid (ABA). Interestingly, recent lines of evidence in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) suggested that stomatal responsiveness is also controlled by an ABA action on leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> supply upstream from stomata. Here, we tested the possibility in grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) that different genotypes ranging from near isohydric to more anisohydric may have different sensitivities in these ABA responses. Measurements on whole plants in drought conditions were combined with assays on detached leaves fed with ABA. Two different methods consistently showed that leaf hydraulic conductance (K<sub>leaf</sub>) was down-regulated by exogenous ABA, with strong variations depending on the genotype. Importantly, variation between isohydry and anisohydry correlated with K<sub>leaf</sub> sensitivity to ABA, with K<sub>leaf</sub> in the most anisohydric genotypes being unresponsive to the hormone. We propose that the observed response of K<sub>leaf</sub> to ABA may be part of the overall ABA regulation of leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> status.</p>

Stress-Related Gene Expression Reflects Morphophysiological Responses to Water Deficit
<p>Acclimation to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit (WD) enables plants to maintain growth under unfavorable environmental conditions, although the mechanisms are not completely understood. In this study, the natural variation of long-term acclimation to moderate and severe soil WD was investigated in 18 Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) accessions using PHENOPSIS, an automated phenotyping platform. Soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> content was adjusted at an early stage of plant development and maintained at a constant level until reproductive age was achieved. The accessions were selected based on the expression levels of <i>ANNEXIN1</i>, a drought-related marker. Severe WD conditions had a greater effect on most of the measured morphophysiological traits than moderate WD conditions. Multivariate analyses indicated that trait responses associated with plant size and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> management drove most of the variation. Accessions with similar responses at these two levels were grouped in clusters that displayed different response strategies to WD. The expression levels of selected stress-response genes revealed large natural variation under WD conditions. Responses of morphophysiological traits, such as projected rosette area, transpiration rate, and rosette <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> content, were correlated with changes in the expression of stress-related genes, such as <i>NINE-CIS-EPOXYCAROTENOID DIOXYGENASE3</i> and <i>N-MYC DOWNREGULATED-LIKE1</i> (<i>NDL1</i>), in response to WD. Interestingly, the morphophysiological acclimation response to WD also was reflected in the gene expression levels (most notably those of <i>NDL1</i>, <i>CHALCONE SYNTHASE</i>, and <i>MYB DOMAIN PROTEIN44</i>) in plants cultivated under well-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>ed conditions. Our results may lead to the development of biomarkers and predictors of plant morphophysiological responses based on gene expression patterns.</p>

Variable Mesophyll Conductance among Soybean Cultivars Sets a Tradeoff between Photosynthesis and Water-Use-Efficiency
<p>Photosynthetic efficiency is a critical determinant of crop yield potential, although it remains below the theoretical optimum in modern crop varieties. Enhancing mesophyll conductance (i.e. the rate of carbon dioxide diffusion from substomatal cavities to the sites of carboxylation) may increase photosynthetic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use efficiencies. To improve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use efficiency, mesophyll conductance should be increased without concomitantly increasing stomatal conductance. Here, we partition the variance in mesophyll conductance to within- and among-cultivar components across soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) grown under both controlled and field conditions and examine the covariation of mesophyll conductance with photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use efficiency, and leaf mass per area. We demonstrate that mesophyll conductance varies more than 2-fold and that 38% of this variation is due to cultivar identity. As expected, mesophyll conductance is positively correlated with photosynthetic rates. However, a strong positive correlation between mesophyll and stomatal conductance among cultivars apparently impedes positive scaling between mesophyll conductance and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use efficiency in soybean. Contrary to expectations, photosynthetic rates and mesophyll conductance both increased with increasing leaf mass per area. The presence of genetic variation for mesophyll conductance suggests that there is potential to increase photosynthesis and mesophyll conductance by selecting for greater leaf mass per area. Increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use efficiency, though, is unlikely unless there is simultaneous stabilizing selection on stomatal conductance.</p>

Monitoring of Freezing Dynamics in Trees: A Simple Phase Shift Causes Complexity

Field experiments during late winter on <i>P<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ice</span></strong>a abies</i> growing at the alpine timberline revealed three distinct freezing patterns: (1) from the top of the tree toward the base, (2) from thin branches toward the main stem’s top and base, and (3) from the base toward the top. Infrared imaging showed freezing within branches from their base toward distal parts. Such complex freezing causes dynamic and heterogenous patterns in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> potential and probably in cavitation. This study highlights the interaction between environmental conditions upon freezing and thawing and demonstrates the enormous complexity of freezing processes in trees. Diameter shrinkage, which indicated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> fluxes within the stem, and acoustic emission analysis, which indicated cavitation events near the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ice</span></strong> front upon freezing, were both related to minimum temperature and, upon thawing, related to vapor pressure deficit and soil temperature.

Outside-Xylem Vulnerability, Not Xylem Embolism, Controls Leaf Hydraulic Decline during Dehydration<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[CC-BY]</sup></xref>
<p>Leaf hydraulic supply is crucial to maintaining open stomata for CO<sub>2</sub> capture and plant growth. During drought-induced dehydration, the leaf hydraulic conductance (<i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub>) declines, which contributes to stomatal closure and, eventually, to leaf death. Previous studies have tended to attribute the decline of <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> to embolism in the leaf vein xylem. We visualized at high resolution and quantified experimentally the hydraulic vulnerability of xylem and outside-xylem pathways and modeled their respective influences on plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> transport. Evidence from all approaches indicated that the decline of <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> during dehydration arose first and foremost due to the vulnerability of outside-xylem tissues. In vivo x-ray microcomputed tomography of dehydrating leaves of four diverse angiosperm species showed that, at the turgor loss point, only small fractions of leaf vein xylem conduits were embolized, and substantial xylem embolism arose only under severe dehydration. Experiments on an expanded set of eight angiosperm species showed that outside-xylem hydraulic vulnerability explained 75% to 100% of <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> decline across the range of dehydration from mild <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> stress to beyond turgor loss point. Spatially explicit modeling of leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> transport pointed to a role for reduced membrane conductivity consistent with published data for cells and tissues. Plant-scale modeling suggested that outside-xylem hydraulic vulnerability can protect the xylem from tensions that would induce embolism and disruption of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> transport under mild to moderate soil and atmospheric droughts. These findings pinpoint outside-xylem tissues as a central locus for the control of leaf and plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> transport during progressive drought.</p>

Stability of Single-Parent Gene Expression Complementation in Maize Hybrids upon Water Deficit Stress
<p>Heterosis is the superior performance of F1 hybrids compared with their homozygous, genetically distinct parents. In this study, we monitored the transcriptomic divergence of the maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) inbred lines B73 and Mo17 and their reciprocal F1 hybrid progeny in primary roots under control and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit conditions simulated by polyethylene glycol treatment. Single-parent expression (SPE) of genes is an extreme instance of gene expression complementation, in which genes are active in only one of two parents but are expressed in both reciprocal hybrids. In this study, 1,997 genes only expressed in B73 and 2,024 genes only expressed in Mo17 displayed SPE complementation under control and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit conditions. As a consequence, the number of active genes in hybrids exceeded the number of active genes in the parental inbred lines significantly independent of treatment. SPE patterns were substantially more stable to expression changes by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit treatment than other genotype-specific expression profiles. While, on average, 75% of all SPE patterns were not altered in response to polyethylene glycol treatment, only 17% of the remaining genotype-specific expression patterns were not changed by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit. Nonsyntenic genes that lack syntenic orthologs in other grass species, and thus evolved late in the grass lineage, were significantly overrepresented among SPE genes. Hence, the significant overrepresentation of nonsyntenic genes among SPE patterns and their stability under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> limitation might suggest a function of these genes during the early developmental manifestation of heterosis under fluctuating environmental conditions in hybrid progeny of the inbred lines B73 and Mo17.</p>

Optogenetic manipulation of stomatal kinetics improves carbon assimilation, water use, and growth
<p>Stomata serve dual and often conflicting roles, facilitating carbon dioxide influx into the plant leaf for photosynthesis and restricting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> efflux via transpiration. Strategies for reducing transpiration without incurring a cost for photosynthesis must circumvent this inherent coupling of carbon dioxide and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> vapor diffusion. We expressed the synthetic, light-gated K<sup>+</sup> channel BLINK1 in guard cells surrounding stomatal pores in <i>Arabidopsis</i> to enhance the solute fluxes that drive stomatal aperture. BLINK1 introduced a K<sup>+</sup> conductance and accelerated both stomatal opening under light exposure and closing after irradiation. Integrated over the growth period, BLINK1 drove a 2.2-fold increase in biomass in fluctuating light without cost in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use by the plant. Thus, we demonstrate the potential of enhancing stomatal kinetics to improve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use efficiency without penalty in carbon fixation.</p>

Our looming lead problem
<p>On 25 April 2014, Flint Mayor Dayne Walling ceremoniously shut off a valve to the Detroit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> supply and opened the flow of the Flint River into local homes and businesses. He marked the occasion by drinking from a glass filled with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> from the new source. Eighteen months later, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> supply was switched back to Detroit. What occurred in between—the city's failure to control infrastructure corrosion, the deterioration of fresh <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> entering Flint residences, citizen complaints, government denials, elevated lead levels in children, and public outcry—would become the basis for a crisis that rose to national attention in 2015. <i>What the Eyes Don't See </i>by Mona Hanna-Attisha and <i>The Poisoned City </i>by Anna Clark are the first two books to document in detail this horrible disaster.</p>

Quantification of drought during the collapse of the classic Maya civilization
<p>The demise of Lowland Classic Maya civilization during the Terminal Classic Period (~800 to 1000 CE) is a well-cited example of how past climate may have affected ancient societies. Attempts to estimate the magnitude of hydrologic change, however, have met with equivocal success because of the qualitative and indirect nature of available climate proxy data. We reconstructed the past isotopic composition (δ<sup>18</sup>O, δD, <sup>17</sup>O-excess, and d-excess) of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lake</span></strong> Chichancanab, Mexico, using a technique that involves isotopic analysis of the structurally bound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> in sedimentary gypsum, which was deposited under drought conditions. The triple oxygen and hydrogen isotope data provide a direct measure of past changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lake</span></strong> hydrology. We modeled the data and conclude that annual precipitation decreased between 41 and 54% (with intervals of up to 70% rainfall reduction during peak drought conditions) and that relative humidity declined by 2 to 7% compared to present-day conditions.</p>

Friction at the bed does not control fast glacier flow
<p>The largest uncertainty in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ice</span></strong> sheet models used to predict future sea level rise originates from our limited understanding of processes at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ice</span></strong>/bed interface. Near glacier termini, where basal sliding controls <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ice</span></strong> flow, most predictive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ice</span></strong> sheet models use a parameterization of sliding that has been theoretically derived for glacier flow over a hard bed. We find that this sliding relation does not apply to the 140 Greenland glaciers that we analyzed. There is no relationship between basal sliding and frictional stress at the glacier bed, contrary to theoretical predictions. There is a strong relationship between sliding speed and net pressure at the glacier bed. This latter finding is in agreement with earlier observations of mountain glaciers that have been largely overlooked by the glaciological community.</p>

Polyamide membranes with nanoscale Turing structures for water purification
<p>The emergence of Turing structures is of fundamental importance, and designing these structures and developing their applications have practical effects in chemistry and biology. We use a facile route based on interfacial polymerization to generate Turing-type polyamide membranes for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> purification. Manipulation of shapes by control of reaction conditions enabled the creation of membranes with bubble or tube structures. These membranes exhibit excellent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-salt separation performance that surpasses the upper-bound line of traditional desalination membranes. Furthermore, we show the existence of high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> permeability sites in the Turing structures, where <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> transport through the membranes is enhanced.</p>

Breakup of last glacial deep stratification in the South Pacific
<p>Stratification of the deep Southern Ocean during the Last Glacial Maximum is thought to have facilitated carbon storage and subsequent release during the deglaciation as stratification broke down, contributing to atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> rise. Here, we present neodymium isotope evidence from deep to abyssal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>s in the South Pacific that confirms stratification of the deep<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> column during the Last Glacial Maximum. The results indicate a glacial northward expansion of Ross Sea Bottom <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> and a Southern Hemisphere climate trigger for the deglacial breakup of deep stratification. It highlights the important role of abyssal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>s in sustaining a deep glacial carbon reservoir and Southern Hemisphere climate change as a prerequisite for the destabilization of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> column and hence the deglacial release of sequestered CO<sub>2</sub> through upwelling.</p>

High-energy, high-fat lifestyle challenges an Arctic apex predator, the polar bear
<p>Regional declines in polar bear (<i>Ursus maritimus</i>) populations have been attributed to changing sea <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ice</span></strong> conditions, but with limited information on the causative mechanisms. By simultaneously measuring field metabolic rates, daily activity patterns, body condition, and foraging success of polar bears moving on the spring sea <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ice</span></strong>, we found that high metabolic rates (1.6 times greater than previously assumed) coupled with low intake of fat-rich marine mammal prey resulted in an energy deficit for more than half of the bears examined. Activity and movement on the sea <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ice</span></strong> strongly influenced metabolic demands. Consequently, increases in mobility resulting from ongoing and forecasted declines in and fragmentation of sea <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ice</span></strong> are likely to increase energy demands and may be an important factor explaining observed declines in body condition and survival.</p>

Optical imaging of surface chemistry and dynamics in confinement

The second harmonic images reported on the orientational order of interfacial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>, induced by charge-dipole interactions between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> molecules and surface charges. The images were converted into surface potential maps. Spatially resolved surface acid dissociation constant (p<i>K</i><sub>a,s</sub>) values were determined for the silica deprotonation reaction by following pH-induced chemical changes on the curved and confined surfaces of a glass microcapillary immersed in aqueous solutions. These values ranged from 2.3 to 10.7 along the wall of a single capillary because of surface heterogeneities. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> molecules that rotate along an oscillating external electric field were also imaged.</p>

Atomic-layered Au clusters on α-MoC as catalysts for the low-temperature water-gas shift reaction
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-gas shift (WGS) reaction (where carbon monoxide plus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> yields dihydrogen and carbon dioxide) is an essential process for hydrogen generation and carbon monoxide removal in various energy-related chemical operations. This equilibrium-limited reaction is favored at a low working temperature. Potential application in fuel cells also requires a WGS catalyst to be highly active, stable, and energy-efficient and to match the working temperature of on-site hydrogen generation and consumption units. We synthesized layered gold (Au) clusters on a molybdenum carbide (α-MoC) substrate to create an interfacial catalyst system for the ultralow-temperature WGS reaction. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> was activated over α-MoC at 303 kelvin, whereas carbon monoxide adsorbed on adjacent Au sites was apt to react with surface hydroxyl groups formed from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> splitting, leading to a high WGS activity at low temperatures.</p>

Selective anaerobic oxidation of methane enables direct synthesis of methanol
<p>Direct functionalization of methane in natural gas remains a key challenge. We present a direct stepwise method for converting methane into methanol with high selectivity (~97%) over a copper-containing zeolite, based on partial oxidation with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>. The activation in helium at 673 kelvin (K), followed by consecutive catalyst exposures to 7 bars of methane and then <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> at 473 K, consistently produced 0.204 mole of CH<sub>3</sub>OH per mole of copper in zeolite. Isotopic labeling confirmed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> as the source of oxygen to regenerate the zeolite active centers and renders methanol desorption energetically favorable. On the basis of in situ x-ray absorption spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations, we propose a mechanism involving methane oxidation at Cu<sup>II</sup> oxide active centers, followed by Cu<sup>I</sup> reoxidation by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> with concurrent formation of hydrogen.</p>

Spectroscopic snapshots of the proton-transfer mechanism in water
<p>The Grotthuss mechanism explains the anomalously high proton mobility in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> as a sequence of proton transfers along a hydrogen-bonded (H-bonded) network. However, the vibrational spectroscopic signatures of this process are masked by the diffuse nature of the key bands in bulk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>. Here we report how the much simpler vibrational spectra of cold, composition-selected heavy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> clusters, D<sup>+</sup>(D<sub>2</sub>O)<i><sub>n</sub></i>, can be exploited to capture clear markers that encode the collective reaction coordinate along the proton-transfer event. By complexing the solvated hydronium “Eigen” cluster [D<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>(D<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>3</sub>] with increasingly strong H-bond acceptor molecules (D<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, CO, and D<sub>2</sub>O), we are able to track the frequency of every O-D stretch vibration in the complex as the transferring hydron is incrementally pulled from the central hydronium to a neighboring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> molecule.</p>

Vibrationally Promoted Dissociation of Water on Ni(111)

Low Water Potential and At14a-Like1 (AFL1) Effects on Endocytosis and Actin Filament Organization
<p>At14a-Like1 (AFL1) is a stress-induced protein of unknown function that promotes growth during low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> potential stress and drought. Previous analysis indicated that AFL1 may have functions related to endocytosis and regulation of actin filament organization, processes for which the effects of low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> potential are little known. We found that low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> potential led to a decrease in endocytosis, as measured by uptake of the membrane-impermeable dye FM4-64. Ectopic expression of AFL1 reversed the decrease in FM4-64 uptake seen in wild type, while reduced AFL1 expression led to further inhibition of FM4-64 uptake. Increased AFL1 also made FM4-64 uptake less sensitive to the actin filament disruptor Latrunculin B (LatB). LatB decreased AFL1-Clathrin Light Chain colocalization, further indicating that effects of AFL1 on endocytosis may be related to actin filament organization or stability. Consistent with this hypothesis, ectopic AFL1 expression made actin filaments less sensitive to disruption by LatB or Cytochalasin D and led to increased actin filament skewness and decreased occupancy, indicative of more bundled actin filaments. This latter effect could be partially mimicked by the actin filament stabilizer Jasplakinolide (JASP). However, AFL1 did not substantially inhibit actin filament dynamics, indicating that AFL1 acts via a different mechanism than JASP-induced stabilization. AFL1 partially colocalized with actin filaments but not with microtubules, further indicating actin-filament–related function of AFL1. These data provide insight into endocytosis and actin filament responses to low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> potential stress and demonstrate an involvement of AFL1 in these key cellular processes.</p>

Carbonic Anhydrase Mutants in <i>Zea mays</i> Have Altered Stomatal Responses to Environmental Signals
<p>Stomata regulate transpirational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> loss and CO<sub>2</sub> uptake for photosynthesis in response to changing environmental conditions. Research investigating stomatal movement has mostly been conducted in C<sub>3</sub> eudicot species, which have very different CO<sub>2</sub> requirements for photosynthesis relative to C<sub>4</sub> grasses. Carbonic anhydrase (CA) catalyzes the hydration of CO<sub>2</sub>, and its activity has been linked to stomatal aperture regulation in eudicots. The number of <i>Ca</i> genes and their evolutionary history differ between monocots and dicots, and many questions remain unanswered about potential neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization of grass <i>Ca</i> paralogs and their roles in photosynthesis and stomatal conductance. To investigate the roles of different <i>Ca</i> genes in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), we examined stomatal responses in <i>ca1</i> and <i>ca2</i> single mutants as well as a <i>ca1ca2</i> double mutant. The <i>ca1</i> and <i>ca2</i> single mutants had 10% and 87% of the CA activity exhibited by the wild type, respectively, while <i>ca1ca2</i> had less than 5% of wild-type CA activity. The <i>ca</i> mutants had higher stomatal conductance than the wild type and slower stomatal closure in response to increases in CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure. Contrary to previous reports in eudicots, <i>ca</i> mutants showed slowed stomatal closure in response to the light-dark transition and did not show differences in stomatal density compared with the wild type. These results implicate CA-mediated signaling in the control of stomatal movement but not stomatal development. Drought experiments with <i>ca1ca2</i> mutant plants suggest a role for CA in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-use efficiency and reveal that <i>Z. mays</i> is not optimized for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-use efficiency under well-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>ed conditions.</p>

Overexpression of RING Domain E3 Ligase ZmXerico1 Confers Drought Tolerance through Regulation of ABA Homeostasis
<p>Drought stress is one of the main environmental problems encountered by crop growers. Reduction in arable land area and reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> availability make it paramount to identify and develop strategies to allow crops to be more resilient in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-limiting environments. The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays an important role in the plants’ response to drought stress through its control of stomatal aperture and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> transpiration, and transgenic modulation of ABA levels therefore represents an attractive avenue to improve the drought tolerance of crops. Several steps in the ABA-signaling pathway are controlled by ubiquitination involving really interesting new genes (RING) domain-containing proteins. We characterized the maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) RING protein family and identified two novel RING-H2 genes called <i>ZmXerico1</i> and <i>ZmXerico2</i>. Expression of <i>ZmXerico</i> genes is induced by drought stress, and we show that overexpression of <i>ZmXerico1</i> and <i>ZmXerico2</i> in Arabidopsis and maize confers ABA hypersensitivity and improved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use efficiency, which can lead to enhanced maize yield performance in a controlled drought-stress environment. Overexpression of <i>ZmXerico1</i> and <i>ZmXerico2</i> in maize results in increased ABA levels and decreased levels of ABA degradation products diphaseic acid and phaseic acid. We show that ZmXerico1 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, where ABA 8′-hydroxylases have been shown to be localized, and that it functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. We demonstrate that ZmXerico1 plays a role in the control of ABA homeostasis through regulation of ABA 8′-hydroxylase protein stability, representing a novel control point in the regulation of the ABA pathway.</p>

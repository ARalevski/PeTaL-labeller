Fast molecular outflow from a dusty star-forming galaxy in the early Universe
<p>Galaxies grow inefficiently, with only a small percentage of the available gas converted into stars each free-fall time. Feedback processes, such as outflowing winds driven by radiation pressure, supernovae, or supermassive black hole accretion, can act to halt star formation if they heat or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expel</span></strong> the gas supply. We report a molecular outflow launched from a dust-rich star-forming galaxy at redshift 5.3, 1 billion years after the Big Bang. The outflow reaches velocities up to 800 kilometers per second relative to the galaxy, is resolved into multiple clumps, and carries mass at a rate within a factor of 2 of the star formation rate. Our results show that molecular outflows can remove a large fraction of the gas available for star formation from galaxies at high redshift.</p>

Competing chromosomes explain junk DNA
<p>The vast majority of eukaryotes have two copies of each chromosome and reproduce sexually. Meiosis is a vital process that produces gametes (eggs and sperm) by reducing the number of chromosome copies to one; fertilization between egg and sperm restores the chromosome copy number to two. During female meiosis, one set of chromosomes is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expel</span></strong>led into a tiny cell called a polar body, whereas the other is segregated into the egg. It is a fundamental tenet of genetics that there is a random, 50% chance for any particular chromosome to be segregated into the egg versus the polar body. However, cases in which one copy of a chromosome is inherited with greater than 50% frequency have been reported in many species (<i>1</i>), but the molecular mechanism of this preferential inheritance has remained obscure. Recent work has indicated that centromeres, the chromosomal regions that form attachments to microtubules that mediate chromosome segregation during meiosis, compete with each other for inheritance during female meiosis (<i>2</i>). Thus, the essential DNA sequences that mediate accurate chromosome segregation are actually “selfish” (or parasitic) genetic elements that have invaded our genome. On page 668 of this issue, Akera <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) provide the most detailed molecular mechanism to date that explains how a parasitic DNA sequence has used the asymmetry of oocyte meiosis to ensure its own inheritance and therefore its spread through populations.</p>

An Integral View of Fast Shocks Around Supernova 1006
<sec><title>A Supernova in 3D</title><p>When a star explodes, it <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expel</span></strong>s matter at supersonic speeds. <bold>Nikolić <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 45, published online 14 February) used integral-field spectroscopy to obtain high-resolution, spatially resolved spectra of the shock waves associated with supernova 1006. The physical characteristics of the shocks around this supernova exhibit a strong spatial variation that suggests the presence of suprathermal (∼10 to 100 keV) protons, which are the potential seeds for generating cosmic rays.</p></sec>

Heterogeneous fates and dynamic rearrangement of regenerative epidermis-derived cells during zebrafish fin regeneration
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> The fate of regenerative epidermis cells during zebrafish fin regeneration has been elucidated: they transiently contribute to the regenerated epidermis, but many are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expel</span></strong>led by dynamic epidermal rearrangement.</p>

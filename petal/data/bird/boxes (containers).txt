The B-Box Domain Protein BBX21 Promotes Photomorphogenesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>B-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing (BBX) proteins play critical roles in a variety of cellular and developmental processes in plants. BBX21 (also known as SALT TOLERANCE HOMOLOG2), which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>s two B-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong> domains in tandem at the N terminus, has been previously demonstrated as a key component involved in the COP1-HY5 signaling hub. However, the exact molecular and physiological roles of B-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong> domains in BBX21 are largely unclear. Here, we found that structurally disruption of the second B-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong> domain, but not the first one, in BBX21 completely abolishes its biological and physiological activity in conferring hyperphotomorphogenetic phenotype in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Intact B-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong> domains in BBX21 are not required for interaction with COP1 and its degradation by COP1 via the 26S proteasome system. However, disruption of the second B-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong> of BBX21 nearly impairs its ability for binding of <i>T/G-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong></i> within the <i>HY5</i> promoter both in vitro and in vivo, as well as controlling <i>HY5</i> and HY5-regulated gene expression in Arabidopsis seedlings. Taken together, this study provides a mechanistic framework in which BBX21 directly binds to the <i>T/G-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong></i> present in the <i>HY5</i> promoter possibly through its second B-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong> domain, which in turn controls <i>HY5</i> and HY5-regulated gene expression to promote photomorphogenesis.</p>

Comparison of the elution properties of commercially available gentamicin and bone cement containing vancomycin with ‘home-made’ preparations
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Vancomycin is commonly added to acrylic bone cement during revision   arthroplasty surgery.

The G-Box Transcriptional Regulatory Code in Arabidopsis
<p>Plants have significantly more transcription factor (TF) families than animals and fungi, and plant TF families tend to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong> more genes; these expansions are linked to adaptation to environmental stressors. Many TF family members bind to similar or identical sequence motifs, such as G-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong>es (CACGTG), so it is difficult to predict regulatory relationships. We determined that the flanking sequences near G-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong>es help determine in vitro specificity but that this is insufficient to predict the transcription pattern of genes near G-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong>es. Therefore, we constructed a gene regulatory network that identifies the set of bZIPs and bHLHs that are most predictive of the expression of genes downstream of perfect G-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong>es. This network accurately predicts transcriptional patterns and reconstructs known regulatory subnetworks. Finally, we present Ara-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong>-cis (ara<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong>cis.org), a Web site that provides interactive visualizations of the G-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong> regulatory network, a useful resource for generating predictions for gene regulatory relations.</p>

Biotin Attachment Domain-Containing Proteins Irreversibly Inhibit Acetyl CoA Carboxylase
<p>The first committed step in fatty acid synthesis is mediated by acetyl-CoA car<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong>ylase (ACCase), a biotin-dependent enzyme that car<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong>ylates acetyl-CoA to produce malonyl-CoA. ACCase can be feedback regulated by short-term or long-term exposure to fatty acids in the form of Tween 80 (predominantly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing oleic acid), which results in reversible or irreversible ACCase inhibition, respectively. Biotin attachment domain-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing (BADC) proteins are inactive analogs of biotin car<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong>yl transfer proteins that lack biotin, and their incorporation into ACCase down-regulates its activity by displacing active (biotin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing) biotin car<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong>yltransferase protein subunits. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) lines <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing T-DNA insertions in <i>BADC1</i>, <i>BADC2</i>, and <i>BADC3</i> were used to generate <i>badc1 badc2</i> and <i>badc1 badc3</i> double mutants. The <i>badc1 badc3</i> mutant exhibited normal growth and development; however, ACCase activity was 26% higher in <i>badc1 badc3</i> and its seeds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ed 30.1% more fatty acids and 32.6% more triacylgycerol relative to wild-type plants. To assess whether BADC contributes to the irreversible phase of ACCase inhibition, cell suspension cultures were generated from the leaves of <i>badc1 badc3</i> and wild-type plants and treated with 10 m<sc>m</sc> Tween 80. Reversible ACCase inhibition was similar in <i>badc1 badc3</i> and wild-type cultures after 2 d of Tween 80 treatment, but irreversible inhibition was reduced by 50% in <i>badc1 badc3</i> relative to wild-type plants following 4 d of Tween 80 treatment. In this study, we present evidence for two important homeostatic roles for BADC proteins in down-regulating ACCase activity: by acting during normal growth and development and by contributing to its long-term irreversible feedback inhibition resulting from the oversupply of fatty acids.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
A murine <i>Zic3</i> transcript with a premature termination codon evades nonsense-mediated decay during axis formation
<p>The ZIC transcription factors are key mediators of embryonic development and <i>ZIC3</i> is the gene most commonly associated with <i>situs</i> defects (heterotaxy) in humans. Half of patient <i>ZIC3</i> mutations introduce a premature termination codon (PTC). <i>In vivo</i>, PTC-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing transcripts might be targeted for nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). NMD efficiency is known to vary greatly between transcripts, tissues and individuals and it is possible that differences in survival of PTC-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing transcripts partially explain the striking phenotypic variability that characterizes ZIC3-associated congenital defects. For example, the PTC-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing transcripts might encode a C-terminally truncated protein that retains partial function or that dominantly interferes with other ZIC family members. Here we describe the katun (<i>Ka</i>) mouse mutant, which harbours a mutation in the <i>Zic3</i> gene that results in a PTC. At the time of axis formation there is no discernible decrease in this PTC-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing transcript <i>in vivo</i>, indicating that the mammalian <i>Zic3</i> transcript is relatively insensitive to NMD, prompting the need to re-examine the molecular function of the truncated proteins predicted from human studies and to determine whether the N-terminal portion of ZIC3 possesses dominant-negative capabilities. A combination of <i>in vitro</i> studies and analysis of the <i>Ka</i> phenotype indicate that it is a null allele of <i>Zic3</i> and that the N-terminal portion of ZIC3 does not encode a dominant-negative molecule. Heterotaxy in patients with PTC-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing <i>ZIC3</i> transcripts probably arises due to loss of ZIC3 function alone.</p>

Genome hypermobility by lateral transduction
<p>Genetic transduction is a major evolutionary force that underlies bacterial adaptation. Here we report that the temperate bacteriophages of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> engage in a distinct form of transduction we term lateral transduction. Staphylococcal prophages do not follow the previously described excision-replication-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">packag</span></strong>ing pathway but instead excise late in their lytic program. Here, DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">packag</span></strong>ing initiates in situ from integrated prophages, and large metameric spans including several hundred kilobases of the <i>S. aureus</i> genome are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">packag</span></strong>ed in phage heads at very high frequency. In situ replication before DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">packag</span></strong>ing creates multiple prophage genomes so that lateral-transducing particles form during normal phage maturation, transforming parts of the <i>S. aureus</i> chromosome into hypermobile regions of gene transfer.</p>

How are DNAs woven into chromosomes?
<p>It was not recognized that chromosomes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong> one immensely long DNA molecule until Kleinschmidt <i>et al.</i> published electron micrographs of a lysed bacterial cell with DNA spilling out that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ed no apparent breaks and, indeed, not even any free ends (<i>1</i>). We now know that before replication, each of our chromosomes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>s a single DNA molecule of immense length. If the DNA of an average human chromatid were a wire with a diameter of 2 mm, then this wire would be 50 km long. The vast length of chromosomal DNAs poses a number of fundamental problems. For example, how are they <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">packag</span></strong>ed during cell division into cylindrical threadlike chromatids? On page 672 of this issue, Terakawa <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) describe an activity associated with a protein complex called condensin that has the potential to answer this. Remarkably, it might also explain chromosome segregation in bacteria as well as the mechanism that regulates enhancer-promoter interactions during development.</p>

B-Box Containing Proteins BBX30 and BBX31, Acting Downstream of HY5, Negatively Regulate Photomorphogenesis in <i>Arabidopsis</i>
<p>Light-mediated seedling development is coordinately controlled by a variety of key regulators. Here, we identified two B-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong> (BBX)-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing proteins, BBX30 and BBX31, as repressors of photomorphogenesis. ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5, a central regulator of light signaling, directly binds to the <i>G-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong> cis-</i>element present in the promoters of <i>BBX30</i> and <i>BBX31</i> and negatively controls their transcription levels in the light. Seedlings with mutations in <i>BBX30</i> or <i>BBX31</i> are hypersensitive to light, whereas the overexpression of <i>BBX30</i> or <i>BBX31</i> leads to hypo-photomorphogenic growth in the light. Furthermore, transgenic and phenotypic analysis revealed that the B-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong> domain of BBX30 or BBX31 is essential for their respective functioning in the regulation of photomorphogenic development in plants. In conclusion, BBX30 and BBX31 act as key negative regulators of light signaling, and their transcription is repressed by ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 through directly associating with their promoters.</p>

Prolines in Transit Peptides Are Crucial for Efficient Preprotein Translocation into Chloroplasts
<p>Chloroplasts import many preproteins that can be classified based on their physicochemical properties. The cleavable N-terminal transit peptide (TP) of chloroplast preproteins <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>s all the information required for import into chloroplasts through Toc/Tic translocons. The question of whether and how the physicochemical properties of preproteins affect TP-mediated import into chloroplasts has not been elucidated. Here, we present evidence that Pro residues in TP mediate efficient translocation through the chloroplast envelope membranes for proteins <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing transmembrane domains (TMDs) or proteins prone to aggregation. By contrast, the translocation of soluble proteins through the chloroplast envelope membranes is less dependent on TP prolines. Proless TPs failed to mediate protein translocation into chloroplasts; instead, these mutant TPs led to protein mistargeting to the chloroplast envelope membranes or nonspecific protein aggregation during import into chloroplasts. The mistargeting of TMD-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing proteins caused by Pro-less TPs in wild-type protoplasts was mimicked by wild-type TPs in <i>hsp93-V</i> protoplasts, in which preprotein translocation is compromised. We propose that the physicochemical properties of chloroplast proteins affect protein translocation through the chloroplast envelope, and prolines in TP have a crucial role in the efficient translocation of TMD-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing proteins.</p>

TATA Box Insertion Provides a Selection Mechanism Underpinning Adaptations to Fe Deficiency
<p>Intraspecific genetic variation is essential for the responses and adaption of plants to evolutionary challenges, such as changing environmental conditions. The development of the Earth’s aerobic atmosphere has increased the demand for iron (Fe) in organisms, and Fe deficiency has become a limiting environmental factor for plant growth. Here, we demonstrate that genus <i>Malus</i> adapt to Fe deficiency through modification of the <i>Iron-Regulated Transporter1</i> (<i>IRT1</i>) promoter. Specifically, an <i>IRT1</i> mutant allele with a TATA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong> insertion in the promoter region upstream of the coding region exhibited increased <i>IRT1</i> expression. The altered <i>IRT1</i> promoter is responsible for enhancing Fe uptake. Increasing the number of synthetic repeat TATA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong>es correlates with increased promoter activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the insertion of the TATA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong> correlates with an increase in transcriptional activation via specific binding of the transcription factor IID (MDP0000939369). Taken together, these results indicate that an allelic insertion of a TATA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong> in a gene promoter has allowed apple to adapt to the selective pressure posed by Fe deficiency. More broadly, this study reveals a new mechanism for enhancing gene expression to help plants adapt to different environments, providing new insights into molecular genetic divergence in plants.</p>

A Nitrogen-Fixing Subunit Essential for Accumulating 4Fe-4S-Containing Photosystem I Core Proteins
<p>Nitrogen-fixation-subunit-U (NFU)-type proteins have been shown to be involved in the biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters. We investigated the molecular function of a chloroplastic NFU-type iron-sulfur scaffold protein, NFU3, in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) using genetics approaches. Loss-of-function mutations in the <i>NFU3</i> gene caused yellow pigmentation in leaves, reductions in plant size, leaf size, and growth rate, delay in flowering and seeding, and decreases in seed production. Biochemical and physiological analyses indicated that these defects are due to the substantial reductions in the abundances of 4Fe-4S-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing photosystem I (PSI) core subunits PsaA (where Psa stands for PSI), PsaB, and PsaC and a nearly complete loss of PSI activity. In addition to the substantial decreases in the amounts of PSI core proteins, the content of 3Fe-4S-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing ferredoxin-dependent glutamine oxoglutarate aminotransferases declined significantly in the <i>nfu3</i> mutants. Furthermore, the absorption spectrum of the recombinant NFU3 protein showed features characteristic of 4Fe-4S and 3Fe-4S clusters, and the in vitro reconstitution experiment indicated an iron-sulfur scaffold function of NFU3. These data demonstrate that NFU3 is involved in the assembly and transfer of 4Fe-4S and 3Fe-4S clusters and that NFU3 is required for the accumulation of 4Fe-4S- and 3Fe-4S-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing proteins, especially 4Fe-4S-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing PSI core subunits, in the Arabidopsis chloroplast.</p>

Chemical responses to modified lignin composition in tension wood of hybrid poplar (<i>Populus tremula × Populus alba</i>)
<p>The effect of altering the expression level of the <i>F5H</i> gene was investigated in three wood tissues (normal, opposite and tension wood) in 1-year-old hybrid poplar clone 717 (<i>Populus tremula × Populus alba</i> L.), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing the <i>F5H</i> gene under the control of the <i>C4H</i> promoter. Elevated expression of the <i>F5H</i> gene in poplar has been previously reported to increase the percent syringyl content of lignin. The wild-type and three transgenic lines were inclined 45° for 3 months to induce tension wood formation. Tension and opposite wood from inclined trees, along with normal wood from control trees, were analyzed separately for carbohydrates, lignin, cellulose crystallinity and microfibril angle (MFA). In the wild-type poplar, the lignin in tension wood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ed a significantly higher percentage of syringyl than normal wood or opposite wood. However, there was no significant difference in the percent syringyl content of the three wood types within each of the transgenic lines. Increasing the <i>F5H</i> gene expression caused an increase in the percent syringyl content and a slight decrease in the total lignin in normal wood. In tension wood, the addition of a gelatinous layer in the fiber walls resulted in a consistently lower percentage of total lignin in the tissue. Acid-soluble lignin was observed to increase by up to 2.3-fold in the transgenic lines. Compared with normal wood and opposite wood, cell wall crystallinity in tension wood was higher and the MFA was smaller, as expected, with no evidence of an effect from modifying the syringyl monomer ratio. Tension wood in all the lines <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ed consistently higher total sugar and glucose percentages when compared with normal wood within the respective lines. However, both sugar and glucose percentages were lower in the tension wood of transgenic lines when compared with the tension wood of wild-type trees. Evaluating the response of trees with altered syringyl content to gravity will improve our understanding of the changes in cell wall chemistry and ultrastructural properties of normal, opposite and tension wood in plants.</p>

Distinct control of PERIOD2 degradation and circadian rhythms by the oncoprotein and ubiquitin ligase MDM2
<p>The circadian clock relies on posttranslational modifications to set the timing for degradation of core regulatory components, which drives clock progression. Ubiquitin-modifying enzymes that target clock components for degradation mainly recognize phosphorylated substrates. Degradation of the circadian clock component PERIOD 2 (PER2) is mediated by its phospho-specific recognition by β-transducin repeat–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing proteins (β-TrCPs), which are F-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong>–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing proteins that function as substrate recognition subunits of the SCF<sup>β-TRCP</sup> ubiquitin ligase complex. However, this mode of regulating PER2 stability falls short of explaining the persistent oscillatory phenotypes reported in biological systems lacking functional elements of the phospho-dependent PER2 degradation machinery. We identified PER2 as a previously uncharacterized substrate for the ubiquitin ligase mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2) and found that MDM2 targeted PER2 for degradation in a manner independent of PER2 phosphorylation. Deregulation of MDM2 plays a major role in oncogenesis by contributing to the accumulation of genomic and epigenomic alterations that favor tumor development. MDM2-mediated PER2 turnover was important for defining the circadian period length in mammalian cells, a finding that emphasizes the connection between the circadian clock and cancer. Our results not only broaden the range of specific substrates of MDM2 beyond the cell cycle to include circadian components but also identify a previously unknown regulator of the clock as a druggable node that is often found to be deregulated during tumorigenesis.</p>

Tetraspanin microdomains control localized protein kinase C signaling in B cells
<p>Activation of B cells by the binding of antigens to the B cell receptor (BCR) requires the protein kinase C (PKC) family member PKCβ. Because PKCs must translocate to the plasma membrane to become activated, we investigated the mechanisms regulating their spatial distribution in mouse and human B cells. Through live-cell imaging, we showed that BCR-stimulated production of the second messenger diacylglycerol (DAG) resulted in the translocation of PKCβ from the cytosol to plasma membrane regions <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing the tetraspanin protein CD53. CD53 was specifically enriched at sites of BCR signaling, suggesting that BCR-dependent PKC signaling was initiated at these tetraspanin microdomains. Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy studies confirmed the molecular recruitment of PKC to CD53-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing microdomains, which required the amino terminus of CD53. Furthermore, we showed that <i>Cd53</i>-deficient B cells were defective in the phosphorylation of PKC substrates. Consistent with this finding, PKC recruitment to the plasma membrane was impaired in both mouse and human <i>CD53</i>-deficient B cells compared to that in their wild-type counterparts. These data suggest that CD53 promotes BCR-dependent PKC signaling by recruiting PKC to the plasma membrane so that it can phosphorylate its substrates and that tetraspanin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing microdomains can act as signaling hotspots in the plasma membrane.</p>

PDZRN3 destabilizes endothelial cell-cell junctions through a PKCζ-containing polarity complex to increase vascular permeability
<p>Endothelial cells serve as a barrier between blood and tissues. Maintenance of the endothelial cell barrier depends on the integrity of intercellular junctions, which is regulated by a polarity complex that includes the ζ isoform of atypical protein kinase C (PKCζ) and partitioning defective 3 (PAR3). We revealed that the E3 ubiquitin ligase PDZ domain–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing ring finger 3 (PDZRN3) regulated endothelial intercellular junction integrity. Endothelial cell–specific overexpression of <i>Pdzrn3</i> led to early embryonic lethality with severe hemorrhaging and altered organization of endothelial intercellular junctions. Conversely, endothelial-specific loss of <i>Pdzrn3</i> prevented vascular leakage in a mouse model of transient ischemic stroke, an effect that was mimicked by pharmacological inhibition of PKCζ. PDZRN3 regulated Wnt signaling and associated with a complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing PAR3, PKCζ, and the multi-PDZ domain protein MUPP1 (Discs Lost–multi-PDZ domain protein 1) and targeted MUPP1 for proteasomal degradation in transfected cells. Transient ischemic stroke increased the ubiquitination of MUPP1, and deficiency of MUPP1 in endothelial cells was associated with decreased localization of PKCζ and PAR3 at intercellular junctions. In endothelial cells, <i>Pdzrn3</i> overexpression increased permeability through a PKCζ-dependent pathway. In contrast, <i>Pdzrn3</i> depletion enhanced PKCζ accumulation at cell-cell contacts and reinforced the cortical actin cytoskeleton under stress conditions. These findings reveal how PDZRN3 regulates vascular permeability through a PKCζ-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing complex.</p>

Sulfur isotopes in diamonds reveal differences in continent construction

We find that the sulfur isotope record in worldwide diamond inclusions is consistent with changes in tectonic processes that formed the continental lithosphere in the Archean.

Although artificial metalloenzymes have been developed that catalyze abiological transformations with high stereoselectivity, the activities of these artificial enzymes are much lower than those of natural enzymes. Here, we report a reconstituted artificial metalloenzyme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing an iridium porphyrin that exhibits kinetic parameters similar to those of natural enzymes. In particular, variants of the P450 enzyme CYP119 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing iridium in place of iron catalyze insertions of carbenes into C–H bonds with up to 98% enantiomeric excess, 35,000 turnovers, and 2550 hours<sup>−1</sup> turnover frequency. This activity leads to intramolecular carbene insertions into unactivated C–H bonds and intermolecular carbene insertions into C–H bonds. These results lift the restrictions on merging chemical catalysis and biocatalysis to create highly active, productive, and selective metalloenzymes for abiological reactions.</p>

Myosins XI Are Involved in Exocytosis of Cellulose Synthase Complexes
<p>In plants, cellulose is synthesized at the cell surface by plasma membrane (PM)-localized cellulose synthase (CESA) complexes (CSCs). The molecular and cellular mechanisms that underpin delivery of CSCs to the PM, however, are poorly understood. Cortical microtubules have been shown to interact with CESA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing compartments and mark the site for CSC delivery, but are not required for the delivery itself. Here, we demonstrate that myosin XI and the actin cytoskeleton mediate CSC delivery to the PM by coordinating the exocytosis of CESA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing compartments. Measurement of cellulose content indicated that cellulose biosynthesis was significantly reduced in a <i>myosin xik xi1 xi2</i> triple-knockout mutant. By combining genetic and pharmacological disruption of myosin activity with quantitative live-cell imaging, we observed decreased abundance of PM-localized CSCs and reduced delivery rate of CSCs in myosin-deficient cells. These phenotypes correlated with a significant increase in failed vesicle secretion events at the PM as well as an abnormal accumulation of CESA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing compartments at the cell cortex. Through high-resolution spatiotemporal assays of cortical vesicle behavior, we identified defects in CSC vesicle tethering and fusion at the PM. Furthermore, disruption of myosin activity reduced the delivery of several other secretory markers to the PM and reduced constitutive and receptor-mediated endocytosis. These findings reveal a previously undescribed role for myosin in vesicle secretion and cellulose production at the cytoskeleton-PM-cell wall nexus.</p>

Heterologous Expression of <i>AtBBX21</i> Enhances the Rate of Photosynthesis and Alleviates Photoinhibition in <i>Solanum</i> <i>tuberosum</i><xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>B-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong> (BBX) proteins are zinc-finger transcription factors <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing one or two B-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong> motifs. BBX proteins act as key factors in the networks regulating growth and development. The relevance of BBX21 to light and abscisic acid signaling in seedling development is well established; however, its importance in adult plant development and agronomic species is poorly understood. Therefore, we studied the effect of heterologous expression of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>BBX21</i> in potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>) var Spunta. Three independent <i>AtBBX21-</i>expressing lines and the wild-type control were cultivated under sunlight and at controlled temperatures in a greenhouse. By anatomical, physiological, biochemical, and gene expression analysis, we demonstrated that <i>AtBBX21</i>-expressing plants were more robust and produced more tubers than wild-type plants. Interestingly, <i>AtBBX21-</i>expressing plants had higher rates of photosynthesis, with a significant increase in photosynthetic gene expression, and higher stomatal conductance, with increased size of the stomatal opening, without any associated decline in water use efficiency. Furthermore, <i>AtBBX21</i>-expressing potato plants had reduced photoinhibition associated with higher production of anthocyanins and phenolic compounds, and higher expression of genes in the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway. To gain insights into the mechanism of BBX21, we evaluated the molecular, morphological, metabolic, and photosynthetic behavior in adult <i>BBX21-</i>overexpressing Arabidopsis. We conclude that <i>BBX21</i> overexpression improved morphological and physiological attributes, and photosynthetic rates in nonoptimal, high-irradiance conditions, without associated impairment of water use efficiency. These characteristics of BBX21 may be useful for increasing production of potatoes, and potentially of other crops.</p>

FERTILIZATION-INDEPENDENT SEED-Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 Plays a Dual Role in Regulating Type I MADS-Box Genes in Early Endosperm Development
<p>Early endosperm development presents a unique system in which to uncover epigenetic regulatory mechanisms because the contributing maternal and paternal genomes possess differential epigenetic modifications. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the initiation of endosperm coenocytic growth upon fertilization and the transition to endosperm cellularization are regulated by the FERTILIZATION-INDEPENDENT SEED (FIS)-Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), a putative H3K27 methyltransferase. Here, we address the possible role of the FIS-PRC2 complex in regulating the type I MADS-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong> gene family, which has been shown previously to regulate early endosperm development. We show that a subclass of type I MADS-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong> genes (C2 genes) was expressed in distinct domains of the coenocytic endosperm in wild-type seeds. Furthermore, the C2 genes were mostly up-regulated biallelically during the extended coenocytic phase of endosperm development in the FIS-PRC2 mutant background. Using allele-specific expression analysis, we also identified a small subset of C2 genes subjected to FIS-PRC2-dependent maternal or FIS-PRC2-independent paternal imprinting. Our data support a dual role for the FIS-PRC2 complex in the regulation of C2 type I MADS-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong> genes, as evidenced by a generalized role in the repression of gene expression at both alleles associated with endosperm cellularization and a specialized role in silencing the maternal allele of imprinted genes.</p>

Loss of LOFSEP Transcription Factor Function Converts Spikelet to Leaf-Like Structures in Rice
<p><i>SEPALLATA</i> (<i>SEP</i>)-like genes, which encode a subfamily of MADS-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong> transcription factors, are essential for specifying floral organ and meristem identity in angiosperms. Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) has five <i>SEP</i>-like genes with partial redundancy and overlapping expression domains, yet their functions and evolutionary conservation are only partially known. Here, we describe the biological role of one of the <i>SEP</i> genes of rice, <i>OsMADS5</i>, in redundantly controlling spikelet morphogenesis. <i>OsMADS5</i> belongs to the conserved <i>LOFSEP</i> subgroup along with <i>OsMADS1</i> and <i>OsMADS34</i>. <i>OsMADS5</i> was expressed strongly across a broad range of reproductive stages and tissues. No obvious phenotype was observed in the <i>osmads5</i> single mutants when compared with the wild type, which was largely due to the functional redundancy among the three <i>LOFSEP</i> genes. Genetic and molecular analyses demonstrated that <i>OsMADS1</i>, <i>OsMADS5</i>, and <i>OsMADS34</i> together regulate floral meristem determinacy and specify the identities of spikelet organs by positively regulating the other MADS-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong> floral homeotic genes. Experiments conducted in yeast also suggested that OsMADS1, OsMADS5, and OsMADS34 form protein-protein interactions with other MADS-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong> floral homeotic members, which seems to be a typical, conserved feature of plant SEP proteins.</p>

A Role for the F-Box Protein HAWAIIAN SKIRT in Plant microRNA Function
<p>As regulators of gene expression in multicellular organisms, microRNAs (miRNAs) are crucial for growth and development. Although a plethora of factors involved in their biogenesis and action in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) has been described, these processes and their fine-tuning are not fully understood. Here, we used plants expressing an artificial miRNA target mimic (MIM) to screen for negative regulators of miR156. We identified a new mutant allele of the F-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong> gene <i>HAWAIIAN SKIRT</i> (<i>HWS</i>; At3G61590), <i>hws</i>-<i>5</i>, as a suppressor of the <i>MIM156</i>-induced developmental and molecular phenotypes. In <i>hws</i> plants, levels of some endogenous miRNAs are increased and their mRNA targets decreased. Plants constitutively expressing full-length HWS—but not a truncated version lacking the F-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong> domain—display morphological and molecular phenotypes resembling those of mutants defective in miRNA biogenesis and activity. In combination with such mutants, <i>hws</i> loses its delayed floral organ abscission (“skirt”) phenotype, suggesting epistasis. Also, the <i>hws</i> transcriptome profile partially resembles those of well-known miRNA mutants <i>hyl1</i>-<i>2</i>, <i>se</i>-<i>3</i>, and <i>ago1</i>-<i>27</i>, pointing to a role in a common pathway. We thus propose HWS as a novel, F-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong> dependent factor involved in miRNA function.</p>

A Dioxygenase Catalyzes Steroid 16α-Hydroxylation in Steroidal Glycoalkaloid Biosynthesis
<p>Steroidal glycoalkaloids (SGAs) are toxic specialized metabolites that are found in the Solanaceae. Potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>s the SGAs α-solanine and α-chaconine, while tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>s α-tomatine, all of which are biosynthesized from cholesterol. However, although two cytochrome P450 monooxygenases that catalyze the 22- and 26-hydroxylation of cholesterol have been identified, the 16-hydroxylase remains unknown. Feeding with deuterium-labeled cholesterol indicated that the 16α- and 16β-hydrogen atoms of cholesterol were eliminated to form α-solanine and α-chaconine in potato, while only the 16α-hydrogen atom was eliminated in α-tomatine biosynthesis, suggesting that a single oxidation at C-16 takes place during tomato SGA biosynthesis while a two-step oxidation occurs in potato. Here, we show that a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase, designated as 16DOX, is involved in SGA biosynthesis. We found that the transcript of potato <i>16DOX</i> (<i>St16DOX</i>) was expressed at high levels in the tuber sprouts, where large amounts of SGAs are accumulated. Biochemical analysis of the recombinant St16DOX protein revealed that St16DOX catalyzes the 16α-hydroxylation of hydroxycholesterols and that (22<i>S</i>)-22,26-dihydroxycholesterol was the best substrate among the nine compounds tested. <i>St16DOX</i>-silenced potato plants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ed significantly lower levels of SGAs, and a detailed metabolite analysis revealed that they accumulated the glycosides of (22<i>S</i>)-22,26-dihydroxycholesterol. Analysis of the tomato <i>16DOX</i> (<i>Sl16DOX</i>) gene gave essentially the same results. These findings clearly indicate that 16DOX is a steroid 16α-hydroxylase that functions in the SGA biosynthetic pathway. Furthermore, <i>St16DOX</i> silencing did not affect potato tuber yield, indicating that <i>16DOX</i> may be a suitable target for controlling toxic SGA levels in potato.</p>

Bumblebees are not deterred by ecologically relevant concentrations of nectar toxins
<p>Bees visit flowers to collect nectar and pollen that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong> nutrients and simultaneously facilitate plant sexual reproduction. Paradoxically, nectar produced to attract pollinators often <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>s deterrent or toxic plant compounds associated with herbivore defence. The functional significance of these nectar toxins is not fully understood, but they may have a negative impact on pollinator behaviour and health, and, ultimately, plant pollination. This study investigates whether a generalist bumblebee, <i>Bombus terrestris</i>, can detect naturally occurring concentrations of nectar toxins. Using paired-choice experiments, we identified deterrence thresholds for five compounds found in the nectar of bee-pollinated plants: quinine, caffeine, nicotine, amygdalin and grayanotoxin. The deterrence threshold was determined when bumblebees significantly preferred a sucrose solution over a sucrose solution <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing the compound. Bumblebees had the lowest deterrence threshold for the alkaloid quinine (0.01 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>); all other compounds had higher deterrence thresholds, above the natural concentration range in floral nectar. Our data, combined with previous work using honeybees, suggest that generalist bee species have poor acuity for the detection of nectar toxins. The fact that bees do not avoid nectar-relevant concentrations of these compounds likely indicates that it is difficult for them to learn to associate floral traits with the presence of toxins, thus maintaining this trait in plant populations.</p>

Laminins containing the β2 and γ3 chains regulate astrocyte migration and angiogenesis in the retina
<p>Pathologies of retinal blood vessels are among the major causes of blindness worldwide. A key cell type that regulates retinal vascular development is the astrocyte. Generated extrinsically to the retina, astrocytes migrate into the retina through the optic nerve head. Even though there is a strong correlation between astrocyte distribution and retinal vascular development, the factors that guide astrocytes into the retina remain unclear. In this study, we show that astrocytes migrate within a laminin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing basement membrane - the inner limiting membrane. Genetic deletion of the laminin β2 and γ3 chains affects astrocyte migration and spatial distribution. We show that laminins act as haptotactic factors <i>in vitro</i> in an isoform-specific manner, inducing astrocyte migration and promoting astrocyte differentiation. The addition of exogenous laminins to laminin-null retinal explants rescues astrocyte migration and spatial patterning. Furthermore, we show that the loss of laminins reduces β1 integrin expression in astrocytes. Culturing laminin-null retinal astrocytes on laminin substrates restores focal localization of β1 integrin. Finally, we show that laminins <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing β2 and γ3 chains regulate subsequent retinal blood vessel growth and maintain vascular integrity. These <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> studies demonstrate clearly that laminins <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing β2 and γ3 chains are indispensable for migration and spatial organization of astrocytes and that they play a crucial role during retinal angiogenesis <i>in vivo</i>.</p>

A SAP domain-containing protein shuttles between the nucleus and cell membranes and plays a role in adhesion and migration in <i>D. discoideum</i>
<p>The AmpA protein reduces cell adhesion, thereby influencing cell migration in <i>Dictyostelium</i>. To understand how <i>ampA</i> influences cell migration, second site suppressors of an AmpA overexpressing cell line were created by REMI mutagenesis. Mutant candidates were identified by their ability to suppress the large plaques that the AmpA overexpressing cells form on bacterial lawns as a result of their increased rate of migration. One suppressor gene, <i>sma</i>, encodes an uncharacterized protein, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>s a SAP DNA-binding domain and a PTEN-like domain. Using <i>sma</i> gene knockouts and Sma-mRFP expressing cell lines, a role for <i>sma</i> in influencing cell migration was uncovered. Knockouts of the <i>sma</i> gene in a wild-type background enhanced chemotaxis. An additional role for Sma in influencing cell–cell adhesion was also demonstrated. Sma protein transitions between cytosolic and nuclear localizations as a function of cell density. In growing cells migrating to folic acid it is localized to regions of actin polymerization and absent from the nucleus. A role for Sma in influencing <i>ampA</i> mRNA levels is also demonstrated. Sma additionally appears to be involved in <i>ampA</i> pathways regulating cell size, actin polymerization, and cell substrate adhesion.

Disproportionation of (Mg,Fe)SiO<sub>3</sub> perovskite in Earth’s deep lower mantle
<p>The mineralogical constitution of the Earth’s mantle dictates the geophysical and geochemical properties of this region.

On the basis of experiments in laser-heated diamond anvil cells, at pressures of 95 to 101 gigapascals and temperatures of 2200 to 2400 kelvin, we found that such perovskite is unstable; it loses its Fe and disproportionates to a nearly Fe-free MgSiO<sub>3</sub> perovskite phase and an Fe-rich phase with a hexagonal structure. This observation has implications for enigmatic seismic features beyond ~2000 kilometers depth and suggests that the lower mantle may <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong> previously unidentified major phases.</p>

Ethylene Response Factor ERF11 Activates <i>BT4</i> Transcription to Regulate Immunity to <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i>
<p><i>Pseudomonas syringae</i>, a major hemibiotrophic bacterial pathogen, causes many devastating plant diseases. However, the transcriptional regulation of plant defense responses to <i>P. syringae</i> remains largely unknown. Here, we found that gain-of-function of <i>BTB AND TAZ DOMAIN PROTEIN 4</i> (<i>BT4</i>) enhanced the resistance of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) to <i>Pst</i> DC3000 (<i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv. <i>tomato</i> DC3000). Disruption of <i>BT4</i> also weakened the salicylic acid (SA)-induced defense response to <i>Pst</i> DC3000 in <i>bt4</i> mutants. Further investigation indicated that, under <i>Pst</i> infection, transcription of <i>BT4</i> is modulated by components of both the SA and ethylene (ET) signaling pathways. Intriguingly, the specific binding elements of ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR (ERF) proteins, including dehydration responsive/C-repeat elements and the GCC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong>, were found in the putative promoter of <i>BT4</i>. Based on publicly available microarray data and transcriptional confirmation, we determined that <i>ERF11</i> is inducible by salicylic acid and <i>Pst</i> DC3000 and is modulated by the SA and ET signaling pathways. Consistent with the function of <i>BT4</i>, loss-of-function of <i>ERF11</i> weakened Arabidopsis resistance to <i>Pst</i> DC3000 and the SA-induced defense response. Biochemical and molecular assays revealed that ERF11 binds specifically to the GCC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong> of the <i>BT4</i> promoter to activate its transcription. Genetic studies further revealed that the <i>BT4</i>-regulated Arabidopsis defense response to <i>Pst</i> DC3000 functions directly downstream of ERF11. Our findings indicate that transcriptional activation of <i>BT4</i> by ERF11 is a key step in SA/ET-regulated plant resistance against <i>Pst</i> DC3000, enhancing our understanding of plant defense responses to hemibiotrophic bacterial pathogens.</p>

CYP79D73 Participates in Biosynthesis of Floral Scent Compound 2-Phenylethanol in <i>Plumeria rubra</i>
<p>Plumeria (<i>Plumeria rubra</i>), well known for its brightly colored and fragrant flowers, emits a number of floral volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Plumeria flowers emit a total of 43 VOCs including nine phenylpropanoids/benzenoids, such as 2-phenylethanol (2PE), benzaldehyde, 2-phenylacetaldehyde (PAld), (<i>E/Z</i>)<i>-</i>phenylacetaldoxime (PAOx), benzyl nitrile (BN), and 2-phenylnitroethane (PN). To identify genes and pathways involved in the production of the major compound 2PE, we analyzed the plumeria floral transcriptome and found a highly expressed, flower-specific gene encoding a cytochrome P450 family 79D protein (PrCYP79D73), which catalyzed the formation of (<i>E/Z</i>)-PAOx. Feeding experiments with deuterated phenylalanine or deuterated (<i>E/Z</i>)-PAOx showed that (<i>E/Z</i>)-PAOx is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of 2PE, as are two nitrogen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing volatiles, BN and PN, in plumeria flowers. Crude enzyme extracts from plumeria flowers converted <sc>l</sc>-phenylalanine to (<i>E/Z</i>)-PAOx, PAld, 2PE, BN, and PN. The biosynthesis of these compounds increased with addition of PrCYP79D73-enriched microsomes but was blocked by pretreatment with 4-phenylimidazole, an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 enzymes. Moreover, overexpression of <i>PrCYP79D73</i> in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> resulted in the emission of (<i>E/Z</i>)-PAOx as well as PAld, 2PE, BN, and PN, all of which were also found among plumeria floral VOCs. Taken together, our results demonstrate that PrCYP79D73 is a crucial player in the biosynthesis of the major floral VOC 2PE and other nitrogen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing volatiles.

Tri-Hydroxy-Triacylglycerol Is Efficiently Produced by Position-Specific Castor Acyltransferases
<p>Understanding the biochemistry of triacylglycerol (TAG) assembly is critical in tailoring seed oils to produce high-value products. Hydroxy-fatty acid (HFA) is one such valuable modified fatty acid, which can be produced at low levels in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed through transgenic expression of the castor (<i>Ricinus communis</i>) hydroxylase. The resulting plants have low seed oil content and poor seedling establishment, indicating that Arabidopsis lacks efficient metabolic networks for biosynthesis and catabolism of hydroxy-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing TAG. To improve utilization of such substrates, we expressed three castor acyltransferase enzymes that incorporate HFA at each stereochemical position during TAG synthesis. This produced abundant tri-HFA TAG and concentrated 44% of seed HFA moieties into this one TAG species. Ricinoleic acid was more abundant than any other fatty acid in these seeds, which had 3-fold more HFA by weight than that in seeds following simple hydroxylase expression, the highest yet measured in a nonnative plant. Efficient utilization of hydroxy-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing lipid substrates increased the rate of TAG synthesis 2-fold, leading to complete relief of the low-oil phenotype. Partition of HFA into specific TAG molecules increased the storage lipid available for mobilization during seedling development, resulting in a 1.9-fold increase in seedling establishment. Expression of a complete acyltransferase pathway to efficiently process HFA establishes a benchmark in the quest to successfully produce modified oils in plants.</p>

Heterohexamers Formed by CcmK3 and CcmK4 Increase the Complexity of Beta Carboxysome Shells

The car<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong>ysome shell consists of three structurally characterized protein types, each named after the oligomer they form: BMC-H (hexamer), BMC-P (pentamer), and BMC-T (trimer). These three protein types form cyclic homooligomers with pores at the center of symmetry that enable metabolite transport across the shell. Car<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong>ysome shells <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong> multiple BMC-H paralogs, each with distinctly conserved residues surrounding the pore, which are assumed to be associated with specific metabolites. We studied the regulation of β-car<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong>ysome shell composition by investigating the BMC-H genes <i>ccmK3</i> and <i>ccmK4</i> situated in a locus remote from other car<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong>ysome genes. We made single and double deletion mutants of <i>ccmK3</i> and <i>ccmK4</i> in <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> PCC7942 and show that, unlike CcmK3, CcmK4 is necessary for optimal growth. In contrast to other CcmK proteins, CcmK3 does not form homohexamers; instead CcmK3 forms heterohexamers with CcmK4 with a 1:2 stoichiometry. The CcmK3-CcmK4 heterohexamers form stacked dodecamers in a pH-dependent manner. Our results indicate that CcmK3-CcmK4 heterohexamers potentially expand the range of permeability properties of metabolite channels in car<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong>ysome shells. Moreover, the observed facultative formation of dodecamers in solution suggests that car<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong>ysome shell permeability may be dynamically attenuated by “capping” facet-embedded hexamers with a second hexamer. Because β-car<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong>ysomes are obligately expressed, heterohexamer formation and capping could provide a rapid and reversible means to alter metabolite flux across the shell in response to environmental/growth conditions.</p>

INDETERMINATE SPIKELET1 Recruits Histone Deacetylase and a Transcriptional Repression Complex to Regulate Rice Salt Tolerance
<p>Perception and transduction of salt stress signals are critical for plant survival, growth, and propagation. Thus, identification of components of the salt stress-signaling pathway is important for rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) molecular breeding of salt stress resistance. Here, we report the identification of an apetala2/ethylene response factor transcription factor INDETERMINATE SPIKELET1 (IDS1) and its roles in the regulation of rice salt tolerance. By genetic screening and phenotype analysis, we demonstrated that IDS1 conferred transcriptional repression activity and acted as a negative regulator of salt tolerance in rice. To identify potential downstream target genes regulated by IDS1, we conducted chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing and ChIP-quantitative PCR assays and found that IDS1 may directly associate with the GCC-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing motifs in the promoter regions of abiotic stress-responsive genes, including <i>LEA1</i> (<i>LATE EMBRYOGENESIS ABUNDANT PROTEIN1</i>) and <i>SOS1</i> (<i>SALT OVERLY SENSITIVE1</i>), which are key genes regulating rice salt tolerance. IDS1 physically interacted with the transcriptional corepressor topless-related 1 and the histone deacetylase HDA1, contributing to the repression of <i>LEA1</i> and <i>SOS1</i> expression. Analyses of histone H3 acetylation status and RNA polymerase II occupation on the promoters of <i>LEA1</i> and <i>SOS1</i> further defined the molecular foundation of the transcriptional repression activity of IDS1. Our findings illustrate an epigenetic mechanism by which IDS1 modulates salt stress signaling as well as salt tolerance in rice.</p>

<i>OsMADS6</i> Controls Flower Development by Activating Rice <i>FACTOR OF DNA METHYLATION LIKE1</i>
<p><i>OsMADS6</i>, an ancient <i>AGAMOUS-LIKE6</i> (<i>AGL6</i>)-like gene, has essential functions in specifying floral organ and meristem identity in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). However, how <i>AGL6</i> genes control flower development remains largely unknown. In this study, we report that OsMADS6 directly targets <i>FACTOR OF DNA METHYLATION LIKE 1</i> (<i>OsFDML1</i>), a rice homolog of the <i>SUPPRESSOR OF GENE SILENCING3</i>-like gene <i>FACTOR OF DNA METHYLATION 1</i> (<i>FDM1</i>) from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Arabidopsis <i>FDM1</i> is involved in RNA-directed DNA methylation and <i>OsFDML1</i> regulates flower development. The expression of <i>OsFDML1</i> overlaps with that of <i>OsMADS6</i> in the palea primordia and the ovule, and OsMADS6 directly promotes <i>OsFDML1</i> expression through binding to regions <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing putative CArG motifs within the <i>OsFDML1</i> promoter during rice spikelet development. Consistent with the phenotypes of <i>osmads6</i> mutants, the <i>osfdml1</i> mutants showed floral defects, including altered palea identity with lemma-like shape <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing no marginal region of palea, increased numbers of stigmas and fused carpels, and meristem indeterminacy. Moreover, transgenic plants overexpressing <i>OsFDML1</i> displayed floral defects, such as abnormal paleae. Phylogenetic analysis showed that <i>OsFDML1</i> homologs exist only in terrestrial plants. In addition, protein-protein interaction assays showed that OsFDML1 interacts with its close paralog OsFDML2, similar to the activity of OsFDML1 homologs in Arabidopsis. These results provide insight into how the ancient <i>AGL6</i> gene regulates floral development.</p>

Scopoletin 8-Hydroxylase-Mediated Fraxetin Production Is Crucial for Iron Mobilization
<p>Iron (Fe) is an essential mineral nutrient and an important factor for the composition of natural plant communities. Low Fe availability in aerated soils with neutral or alkaline pH has led to the evolution of elaborate mechanisms that extract Fe from the soil solution. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), Fe is acquired by an orchestrated strategy that comprises mobilization, chelation, and reduction of Fe<sup>3+</sup> prior to its uptake. Here, we show that At3g12900, previously annotated as scopoletin 8-hydroxylase (S8H), participates in Fe acquisition by mediating the biosynthesis of fraxetin (7,8-dihydroxy-6-methoxycoumarin), a coumarin derived from the scopoletin pathway. S8H is highly induced in roots of Fe-deficient plants both at the transcript and protein levels. Mutants defective in the expression of <i>S8H</i> showed increased sensitivity to growth on pH 7.0 media supplemented with an immobile source of Fe and reduced secretion of fraxetin. Transgenic lines overexpressing <i>S8H</i> exhibited an opposite phenotype. Homozygous <i>s8h</i> mutants grown on media with immobilized Fe accumulated significantly more scopolin, the storage form of scopoletin, supporting the designated function of S8H in scopoletin hydroxylation. Fraxetin exhibited Fe-reducing properties in vitro with higher rates being observed at neutral relative to acidic pH. Supplementing the media <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing immobile Fe with fraxetin partially rescued the <i>s8h</i> mutants. In natural Arabidopsis accessions differing in their performance on media <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing immobilized Fe, the amount of secreted fraxetin was highly correlated with growth and Fe and chlorophyll content, indicating that fraxetin secretion is a decisive factor for calcicole-calcifuge behavior (i.e. the ability/inability to thrive on alkaline soils) of plants.</p>

The OsFBK1 E3 Ligase Subunit Affects Anther and Root Secondary Cell Wall Thickenings by Mediating Turnover of a Cinnamoyl-CoA Reductase
<p>Regulated proteolysis by the ubiquitin-26S proteasome system challenges transcription and phosphorylation in magnitude and is one of the most important regulatory mechanisms in plants. This article describes the characterization of a rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) auxin-responsive Kelch-domain-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing F-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong> protein, OsFBK1, found to be a component of an SCF E3 ligase by interaction studies in yeast. Rice transgenics of <i>OsFBK1</i> displayed variations in anther and root secondary cell wall content; it could be corroborated by electron/confocal microscopy and lignification studies, with no apparent changes in auxin content/signaling pathway. The presence of U-shaped secondary wall thickenings (or lignin) in the anthers were remarkably less pronounced in plants overexpressing <i>OsFBK1</i> as compared to wild-type and knockdown transgenics. The roots of the transgenics also displayed differential accumulation of lignin. Yeast two-hybrid anther library screening identified an OsCCR that is a homolog of the well-studied Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) IRX4; OsFBK1-OsCCR interaction was confirmed by fluorescence and immunoprecipitation studies. Degradation of OsCCR mediated by SCF<sup>OsFBK1</sup> and the 26S proteasome pathway was validated by cell-free experiments in the absence of auxin, indicating that the phenotype observed is due to the direct interaction between OsFBK1 and OsCCR. Interestingly, the <i>OsCCR</i> knockdown transgenics also displayed a decrease in root and anther lignin depositions, suggesting that OsFBK1 plays a role in the development of rice anthers and roots by regulating the cellular levels of a key enzyme controlling lignification.</p>

The <i>RIN-MC</i> Fusion of MADS-Box Transcription Factors Has Transcriptional Activity and Modulates Expression of Many Ripening Genes
<p>Fruit development and ripening is regulated by genetic and environmental factors and is of critical importance for seed dispersal, reproduction, and fruit quality. Tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) <i>ripening inhibitor</i> (<i>rin</i>) mutant fruit have a classic ripening-inhibited phenotype, which is attributed to a genomic DNA deletion resulting in the fusion of two truncated transcription factors, <i>RIN</i> and <i>MC</i>. In wild-type fruit, RIN, a MADS-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong> transcription factor, is a key regulator of the ripening gene expression network, with hundreds of gene targets controlling changes in color, flavor, texture, and taste during tomato fruit ripening; <i>MC</i>, on the other hand, has low expression in fruit, and the potential functions of the <i>RIN-MC</i> fusion gene in ripening remain unclear. Here, overexpression of <i>RIN-MC</i> in transgenic wild-type cv Ailsa Craig tomato fruits impaired several ripening processes, and down-regulating <i>RIN-MC</i> expression in the <i>rin</i> mutant was found to stimulate the normal yellow mutant fruit to produce a weak red color, suggesting a distinct negative role for <i>RIN-MC</i> in tomato fruit ripening. By comparative transcriptome analysis of <i>rin</i> and <i>rin 35S</i>::<i>RIN-MC</i> RNA interference fruits, a total of 1,168 and 1,234 genes were identified as potential targets of RIN-MC activation and inhibition. Furthermore, the <i>RIN-MC</i> fusion gene was shown to be translated into a chimeric transcription factor that was localized to the nucleus and was capable of protein interactions with other MADS-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong> factors. These results indicated that tomato RIN-MC fusion plays a negative role in ripening and encodes a chimeric transcription factor that modulates the expression of many ripening genes, thereby contributing to the <i>rin</i> mutant phenotype.</p>

A Tonoplast Sugar Transporter Underlies a Sugar Accumulation QTL in Watermelon
<p>How sugar transporters regulate sugar accumulation in fruits is poorly understood and particularly so for species storing high-concentration Suc. Accumulation of soluble sugars in watermelon (<i>Citrullus lanatus</i>) fruit, a major quality trait, had been selected during domestication. Still, the molecular mechanisms controlling this quantitative trait are unknown. We resequenced 96 recombinant inbred lines, derived from crossing sweet and unsweet accessions, to narrow down the size of a previously described sugar content quantitative trait locus, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>s a putative <i>Tonoplast Sugar Transporter</i> gene (<i>ClTST2</i>). Molecular and biochemical analyses indicated that <i>ClTST2</i> encodes a vacuolar membrane protein, whose expression is associated with tonoplast uptake and accumulation of sugars in watermelon fruit flesh cells. We measured fruit sugar content and resequenced the genomic region surrounding <i>ClTST2</i> in 400 watermelon accessions and associated the most sugar-related significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to the <i>ClTST2</i> promoter. Large-scale population analyses strongly suggest increased expression of <i>ClTST2</i> as a major molecular event in watermelon domestication associated with a selection sweep around the <i>ClTST2</i> promoter. Further molecular analyses explored the binding of a sugar-induced transcription factor (<i>SUSIWM1</i>) to a sugar-responsive cis‐element within the <i>ClTST2</i> promoter, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>s the quantitative trait locus (QTL) causal SNP. The functional characterization of <i>ClTST2</i> and its expression regulation by <i>SUSIWM1</i> provide novel tools to increase sugar sink potency in watermelon and possibly in other vegetable and fruit crops.</p>

Distinct Functions of STARCH SYNTHASE 4 Domains in Starch Granule Formation
<p>The formation of normal starch granules in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaf chloroplasts requires STARCH SYNTHASE 4 (SS4). In plants lacking SS4, chloroplasts typically produce only one round granule rather than multiple lenticular granules. The mechanisms by which SS4 determines granule number and morphology are not understood. The N-terminal region of SS4 is unique among SS isoforms and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>s several long coiled-coil motifs, typically implicated in protein-protein interactions. The C-terminal region <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>s the catalytic glucosyltransferase domains, which are widely conserved in plant SS and bacterial glycogen synthase (GS) isoforms. We investigated the specific roles of the N- and C-terminal regions of SS4 by expressing truncated versions of SS4 and a fusion between the N-terminal region of SS4 and GS in the Arabidopsis <i>ss4</i> mutant. Expression of the N-terminal region of SS4 alone did not alter the <i>ss4</i> mutant phenotype. Expression of the C-terminal region of SS4 alone increased granule initiation but did not rescue their aberrant round morphology. Expression of a self-priming GS from <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i> also increased the number of round granules. Remarkably, fusion of the N-terminal region of SS4 to <i>A. tumefaciens</i> GS restored the development of wild-type-like lenticular starch granules. Interestingly, the N-terminal region of SS4 alone or when fused to GS conferred a patchy subchloroplastic localization similar to that of the full-length SS4 protein. Considered together, these data suggest that, while the glucosyltransferase activity of SS4 is important for granule initiation, the N-terminal part of SS4 serves to establish the correct granule morphology by properly localizing this activity.</p>

Arabidopsis Novel Glycine-Rich Plasma Membrane PSS1 Protein Enhances Disease Resistance in Transgenic Soybean Plants
<p>Nonhost resistance is defined as the immunity of a plant species to all nonadapted pathogen species. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) ecotype Columbia-0 is nonhost to the oomycete plant pathogen <i>Phytophthora sojae</i> and the fungal plant pathogen <i>Fusarium virguliforme</i> that are pathogenic to soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>). Previously, we reported generating the <i>pss1</i> mutation in the <i>pen1-1</i> genetic background as well as genetic mapping and characterization of the Arabidopsis nonhost resistance <i>Phytophthora sojae</i>-susceptible gene locus, <i>PSS1</i>. In this study, we identified six candidate <i>PSS1</i> genes by comparing single-nucleotide polymorphisms of (1) the bulked DNA sample of seven F<sub>2:3</sub> families homozygous for the <i>pss1</i> allele and (2) the <i>pen1-1</i> mutant with Columbia-0. Analyses of T-DNA insertion mutants for each of these candidate <i>PSS1</i> genes identified the <i>At3g59640</i> gene encoding a glycine-rich protein as the putative <i>PSS1</i> gene. Later, complementation analysis confirmed the identity of <i>At3g59640</i> as the <i>PSS1</i> gene. <i>PSS1</i> is induced following <i>P. sojae</i> infection as well as expressed in an organ-specific manner. Coexpression analysis of the available transcriptomic data followed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction suggested that <i>PSS1</i> is coregulated with <i>ATG8a</i> (<i>At4g21980</i>), a core gene in autophagy. PSS1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>s a predicted single membrane-spanning domain. Subcellular localization study indicated that it is an integral plasma membrane protein. Sequence analysis suggested that soybean is unlikely to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong> a PSS1-like defense function. Following the introduction of <i>PSS1</i> into the soybean cultivar Williams 82, the transgenic plants exhibited enhanced resistance to <i>F. virguliforme</i>, the pathogen that causes sudden death syndrome.</p>

Hydroxystilbenes Are Monomers in Palm Fruit Endocarp Lignins
<p>Lignin, the plant cell wall polymer that binds fibers together but makes processing difficult, is traditionally formed from three monomers, the so-called monolignols (<i>p</i>-coumaryl, coniferyl, and sinapyl alcohols). Recently, we discovered, in grass lignins, a phenolic monomer that falls outside the canonical lignin biosynthetic pathway, the flavone tricin. As we show here, palm fruit (macaéíéííéíúba [<i>Acrocomia aculeata</i>], carnauba [<i>Copernicia prunifera</i>], and coconut [<i>Cocos nucifera</i>]) endocarps <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong> lignin polymers derived in part from a previously unconsidered class of lignin monomers, the hydroxystilbenes, including the valuable compounds piceatannol and resveratrol. Piceatannol could be released from these lignins upon derivatization followed by reductive cleavage, a degradative method that cleaves β-ether bonds, indicating that at least a fraction is incorporated through labile ether bonds. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of products from the copolymerization of piceatannol and monolignols confirms the structures in the natural polymer and demonstrates that piceatannol acts as an authentic monomer participating in coupling and cross-coupling reactions during lignification. Therefore, palm fruit endocarps <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong> a new class of stilbenolignin polymers, further expanding the definition of lignin and implying that compounds such as piceatannol and resveratrol are potentially available in what is now essentially a waste product.</p>

Target RNA Secondary Structure Is a Major Determinant of miR159 Efficacy
<p>In plants, microRNA (miRNA)-target complementarity has long been considered the predominant factor determining the silencing outcome of the miRNA-target interaction, although the efficacy of such interactions have rarely been appraised in plants. Here, we perform in planta silencing efficacy assays on seven Arabidopsis <i>MYB</i> genes, all of which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong> conserved miR159-binding sites of analogous complementarity. These genes were found to be differentially silenced by miR159; <i>MYB81</i>, <i>MYB97</i>, <i>MYB101</i>, <i>MYB104</i>, and <i>DUO1</i> were all poorly silenced, whereas <i>MYB33</i> and <i>MYB65</i> were strongly silenced. Curiously, this is consistent with previous genetic analysis defining <i>MYB33</i> and <i>MYB65</i> as the major functional targets of miR159. Neither the free energy of miR159-target complementarity, nor miRNA binding site accessibility, as determined by flanking region AU content, could fully explain the discrepancy of miR159 silencing efficacy. Instead, we found that <i>MYB33</i> and <i>MYB65</i> were both predicted to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong> a distinctive RNA secondary structure abutting the miR159 binding site. The structure is composed of two stem-loops (SLs) that are predicted to form in <i>MYB33</i>/65 homologs of species as evolutionary distant as gymnosperms. Functional analysis found that the RNA structure in <i>MYB33</i> correlated with strong silencing efficacy; introducing mutations to disrupt either SL attenuated miR159 efficacy, while introducing complementary mutations to restore the SLs, but not the sequence, restored strong miR159-mediated silencing. Therefore, it appears that this RNA secondary structure demarcates <i>MYB33</i>/<i>65</i> as sensitive targets of miR159, which underpins the narrow functional specificity of Arabidopsis miR159.</p>

Functional Conservation and Divergence among Homoeologs of <i>TaSPL20</i> and <i>TaSPL21</i>, Two SBP-Box Genes Governing Yield-Related Traits in Hexaploid Wheat
<p>Maintaining high and stable yields has become an increasing challenge in wheat breeding due to climate change. Although Squamosa-promoter binding protein (SBP)-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong> genes have important roles in plant development, very little is known about the actual biological functions of wheat SBP-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong> family members. Here, we dissect the functional conservation, divergence, and exploitation of homoeologs of two paralogous <i>TaSPL</i> wheat loci during domestication and breeding. <i>TaSPL20</i> and <i>TaSPL21</i> were highly expressed in the lemma and palea. Ectopic expressions of <i>TaSPL20</i>/<i>21</i> in rice exhibited similar functions in terms of promoting panicle branching but had different functions during seed development. We characterized all six <i>TaSPL20</i>/<i>21</i> genes located across the three homoeologous (A, B, and D) genomes. According to the functional analysis of naturally occurring variants in 20 environments, four favorable haplotypes were identified. Together, they reduced plant height by up to 27.5%, and <i>TaSPL21-6D-Hap</i>II increased 1000-grain weight by 9.73%. Our study suggests that <i>TaSPL20</i> and <i>TaSPL21</i> homoeologs underwent diversification in function with each evolving its own distinctive characteristics. During domestication and breeding of wheat in China, favorable haplotypes of each set were selected and exploited to varying degrees due to their large effects on plant height and 1000-grain weight.</p>

A Rice <i>PECTATE LYASE-LIKE</i> Gene Is Required for Plant Growth and Leaf Senescence
<p>To better understand the molecular mechanisms behind plant growth and leaf senescence in monocot plants, we identified a mutant exhibiting dwarfism and an early-senescence leaf phenotype, termed <i>dwarf and early-senescence leaf1</i> (<i>del1</i>). Histological analysis showed that the abnormal growth was caused by a reduction in cell number. Further investigation revealed that the decline in cell number in <i>del1</i> was affected by the cell cycle. Physiological analysis, transmission electron microscopy, and TUNEL assays showed that leaf senescence was triggered by the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. The <i>DEL1</i> gene was cloned using a map-based approach. It was shown to encode a pectate lyase (PEL) precursor that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>s a PelC domain. <i>DEL1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>s all the conserved residues of PEL and has strong similarity with plant PelC. <i>DEL1</i> is expressed in all tissues but predominantly in elongating tissues. Functional analysis revealed that mutation of <i>DEL1</i> decreased the total PEL enzymatic activity, increased the degree of methylesterified homogalacturonan, and altered the cell wall composition and structure. In addition, transcriptome assay revealed that a set of cell wall function- and senescence-related gene expression was altered in <i>del1</i> plants. Our research indicates that <i>DEL1</i> is involved in both the maintenance of normal cell division and the induction of leaf senescence. These findings reveal a new molecular mechanism for plant growth and leaf senescence mediated by <i>PECTATE LYASE-LIKE</i> genes.</p>

Phylogeny-Based Systematization of Arabidopsis Proteins with Histone H1 Globular Domain
<p>H1 (or linker) histones are basic nuclear proteins that possess an evolutionarily conserved nucleosome-binding globular domain, GH1. They perform critical functions in determining the accessibility of chromatin DNA to trans-acting factors. In most metazoan species studied so far, linker histones are highly heterogenous, with numerous nonallelic variants cooccurring in the same cells. The phylogenetic relationships among these variants as well as their structural and functional properties have been relatively well established. This contrasts markedly with the rather limited knowledge concerning the phylogeny and structural and functional roles of an unusually diverse group of GH1-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing proteins in plants. The dearth of information and the lack of a coherent phylogeny-based nomenclature of these proteins can lead to misunderstandings regarding their identity and possible relationships, thereby hampering plant chromatin research. Based on published data and our in silico and high-throughput analyses, we propose a systematization and coherent nomenclature of GH1-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing proteins of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> [L.] Heynh) that will be useful for both the identification and structural and functional characterization of homologous proteins from other plant species.</p>

A Specialized Diacylglycerol Acyltransferase Contributes to the Extreme Medium-Chain Fatty Acid Content of <i>Cuphea</i> Seed Oil
<p>Seed oils of many <i>Cuphea</i> sp. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong> >90% of medium-chain fatty acids, such as decanoic acid (10:0). These seed oils, which are among the most compositionally variant in the plant kingdom, arise from specialized fatty acid biosynthetic enzymes and specialized acyltransferases. These include lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferases (LPAT) and diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGAT) that are required for successive acylation of medium-chain fatty acids in the <i>sn</i>-2 and <i>sn</i>-3 positions of seed triacylglycerols (TAGs). Here we report the identification of a cDNA for a DGAT1-type enzyme, designated CpuDGAT1, from the transcriptome of <i>C. avigera</i> var <i>pulcherrima</i> developing seeds. Microsomes of camelina (<i>Camelina sativa</i>) seeds engineered for CpuDGAT1 expression displayed DGAT activity with 10:0-CoA and the diacylglycerol didecanoyl, that was approximately 4-fold higher than that in camelina seed microsomes lacking CpuDGAT1. In addition, coexpression in camelina seeds of CpuDGAT1 with a <i>C. viscosissima</i> FatB thioesterase (CvFatB1) that generates 10:0 resulted in TAGs with nearly 15 mol % of 10:0. More strikingly, expression of CpuDGAT1 and CvFatB1 with the previously described CvLPAT2, a 10:0-CoA-specific <i>Cuphea</i> LPAT, increased 10:0 amounts to 25 mol % in camelina seed TAG. These TAGs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ed up to 40 mol % 10:0 in the <i>sn</i>-2 position, nearly double the amounts obtained from coexpression of CvFatB1 and CvLPAT2 alone. Although enriched in diacylglycerol, 10:0 was not detected in phosphatidylcholine in these seeds. These findings are consistent with channeling of 10:0 into TAG through the combined activities of specialized LPAT and DGAT activities and demonstrate the biotechnological use of these enzymes to generate 10:0-rich seed oils.</p>

Photosynthetic Trichomes Contain a Specific Rubisco with a Modified pH-Dependent Activity
<p>Ribulose-1,5-biphosphate car<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong>ylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) is the most abundant enzyme in plants and is responsible for CO<sub>2</sub> fixation during photosynthesis. This enzyme is assembled from eight large subunits (RbcL) encoded by a single chloroplast gene and eight small subunits (RbcS) encoded by a nuclear gene family. Rubisco is primarily found in the chloroplasts of mesophyll (C3 plants), bundle-sheath (C4 plants), and guard cells. In certain species, photosynthesis also takes place in the secretory cells of glandular trichomes, which are epidermal outgrowths (hairs) involved in the secretion of specialized metabolites. However, photosynthesis and, in particular, Rubisco have not been characterized in trichomes. Here, we show that tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) trichomes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong> a specific Rubisco small subunit, NtRbcS-T, which belongs to an uncharacterized phylogenetic cluster (T). This cluster <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>s RbcS from at least 33 species, including monocots, many of which are known to possess glandular trichomes. Cluster T is distinct from the cluster M, which includes the abundant, functionally characterized RbcS isoforms expressed in mesophyll or bundle-sheath cells. Expression of NtRbcS-T in <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> and purification of the full Rubisco complex showed that this isoform conferred higher <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> and <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> values as well as higher acidic pH-dependent activity than NtRbcS-M, an isoform expressed in the mesophyll. This observation was confirmed with trichome extracts. These data show that an ancient divergence allowed for the emergence of a so-far-uncharacterized RbcS cluster. We propose that secretory trichomes have a particular Rubisco uniquely adapted to secretory cells where CO<sub>2</sub> is released by the active specialized metabolism.</p>

Genome-Wide Prediction of Metabolic Enzymes, Pathways, and Gene Clusters in Plants
<p>Plant metabolism underpins many traits of ecological and agronomic importance. Plants produce numerous compounds to cope with their environments but the biosynthetic pathways for most of these compounds have not yet been elucidated. To engineer and improve metabolic traits, we need comprehensive and accurate knowledge of the organization and regulation of plant metabolism at the genome scale. Here, we present a computational pipeline to identify metabolic enzymes, pathways, and gene clusters from a sequenced genome. Using this pipeline, we generated metabolic pathway databases for 22 species and identified metabolic gene clusters from 18 species. This unified resource can be used to conduct a wide array of comparative studies of plant metabolism. Using the resource, we discovered a widespread occurrence of metabolic gene clusters in plants: 11,969 clusters from 18 species. The prevalence of metabolic gene clusters offers an intriguing possibility of an untapped source for uncovering new metabolite biosynthesis pathways. For example, more than 1,700 clusters <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong> enzymes that could generate a specialized metabolite scaffold (signature enzymes) and enzymes that modify the scaffold (tailoring enzymes). In four species with sufficient gene expression data, we identified 43 highly coexpressed clusters that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong> signature and tailoring enzymes, of which eight were characterized previously to be functional pathways. Finally, we identified patterns of genome organization that implicate local gene duplication and, to a lesser extent, single gene transposition as having played roles in the evolution of plant metabolic gene clusters.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
An Organelle RNA Recognition Motif Protein Is Required for Photosystem II Subunit <i>psbF</i> Transcript Editing
<p>Loss-of-function mutations in ORGANELLE RNA RECOGNITION MOTIF PROTEIN6 (ORRM6) result in the near absence of RNA editing of <i>psbF</i>-C77 and the reduction in <i>accD</i>-C794 editing in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The <i>orrm6</i> mutants have decreased levels of photosystem II (PSII) proteins, especially PsbF, lower PSII activity, pale green pigmentation, smaller leaf and plant sizes, and retarded growth. Stable expression of <i>ORRM6</i> rescues the <i>orrm6</i> editing defects and mutant phenotype. Unlike ORRM1, the other known ORRM plastid editing factor, ORRM6, does not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong> RNA editing interacting protein/multiple organellar RNA editing factor (RIP/MORF) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">box</span></strong>es, which are required for ORRM1 to interact with site-specific pentatricopeptide repeat protein editing factors. ORRM6 interacts with RIP1/MORF8, RIP2/MORF2, and RIP9/MORF9, known components of RNA editosomes. While some plastid RRM proteins are involved in other forms of RNA processing and translation, the primary function of ORRM6 is evidently to mediate <i>psbF</i>-C77 editing, like the essential site-specific pentatricopeptide repeat protein LOW PSII ACCUMULATION66. Stable expression in the <i>orrm6</i> mutants of a nucleus-encoded, plastid-targeted PsbF protein from a <i>psbF</i> gene carrying a T at nucleotide 77 significantly increases leaf and plant sizes, chlorophyll content, and PSII activity. These transformants demonstrate that plastid RNA editing can be bypassed through the expression of nucleus-encoded, edited forms of plastid genes.</p>

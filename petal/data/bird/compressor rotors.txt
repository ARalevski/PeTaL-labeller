High-resolution cryo-EM analysis of the yeast ATP synthase in a lipid membrane
<p>Mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase comprises a membrane embedded F<sub>o</sub> motor that rotates to drive ATP synthesis in the F<sub>1</sub> subunit. We used single-particle cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to obtain structures of the full complex in a lipid bilayer in the absence or presence of the inhibitor oligomycin at 3.6- and 3.8-angstrom resolution, respectively. To limit conformational heterogeneity, we locked the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotor</span></strong> in a single conformation by fusing the F6 subunit of the stator with the δ subunit of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotor</span></strong>. Assembly of the enzyme with the F6-δ fusion caused a twisting of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotor</span></strong> and a 9° rotation of the F<sub>o</sub> c<sub>10</sub>-ring in the direction of ATP synthesis, relative to the structure of isolated F<sub>o</sub>. Our cryo-EM structures show how F<sub>1</sub> and F<sub>o</sub> are coupled, give insight into the proton translocation pathway, and show how oligomycin blocks ATP synthesis.</p>

Taxon-restricted genes at the origin of a novel trait allowing access to a new environment
<p>Taxon-restricted genes make up a considerable proportion of genomes, yet their contribution to phenotypic evolution is poorly understood. We combined gene expression with functional and behavioral assays to study the origin and adaptive value of an evolutionary innovation exclusive to the water strider genus <i>Rhagovelia</i>: the propelling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fan</span></strong>. We discovered that two taxon-restricted genes, which we named <i>geisha</i> and <i>mother-of-geisha</i>, specifically control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fan</span></strong> development. <i>geisha</i> originated through a duplication event at the base of the <i>Rhagovelia</i> lineage, and both duplicates acquired a novel expression in a specific cell population prefiguring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fan</span></strong> development. These gene duplicates played a central role in <i>Rhagovelia</i>’s adaptation to a new physical environment, demonstrating that the evolution of taxon-restricted genes can contribute directly to evolutionary novelties that allow access to unexploited ecological niches.</p>

Locked synchronous rotor motion in a molecular motor
<p>Biological molecular motors translate their local directional motion into ordered movement of other parts of the system to empower controlled mechanical functions. The design of analogous geared systems that couple motion in a directional manner, which is pivotal for molecular machinery operating at the nanoscale, remains highly challenging. Here, we report a molecular rotary motor that translates light-driven unidirectional rotary motion to controlled movement of a connected biaryl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotor</span></strong>. Achieving coupled motion of the distinct parts of this multicomponent mechanical system required precise control of multiple kinetic barriers for isomerization and synchronous motion, resulting in sliding and rotation during a full rotary cycle, with the motor always facing the same face of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotor</span></strong>.</p>

A sleep-inducing gene, <i>nemuri</i>, links sleep and immune function in <i>Drosophila</i>
<p>Sleep remains a major mystery of biology. In particular, little is known about the mechanisms that account for the drive to sleep. In an unbiased screen of more than 12,000 <i>Drosophila</i> lines, we identified a single gene, <i>nemuri</i>, that induces sleep. The NEMURI protein is an antimicrobial peptide that can be secreted ectopically to drive prolonged sleep (with resistance to arousal) and to promote survival after infection. Loss of <i>nemuri</i> increased arousability during daily sleep and attenuated the acute increase in sleep induced by sleep deprivation or bacterial infection. Conditions that increase sleep drive induced expression of <i>nemuri</i> in a small number of fly brain neurons and targeted it to the sleep-promoting, dorsal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fan</span></strong>-shaped body. We propose that NEMURI is a bona fide sleep homeostasis factor that is particularly important under conditions of high sleep need; because these conditions include sickness, our findings provide a link between sleep and immune function.</p>

Structure, mechanism, and regulation of the chloroplast ATP synthase
<p>The chloroplast adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase uses the electrochemical proton gradient generated by photosynthesis to produce ATP, the energy currency of all cells. Protons conducted through the membrane-embedded F<sub>o</sub> motor drive ATP synthesis in the F<sub>1</sub> head by rotary catalysis. We determined the high-resolution structure of the complete cF<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> complex by cryo–electron microscopy, resolving side chains of all 26 protein subunits, the five nucleotides in the F<sub>1</sub> head, and the proton pathway to and from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotor</span></strong> ring. The flexible peripheral stalk redistributes differences in torsional energy across three unequal steps in the rotation cycle. Plant ATP synthase is autoinhibited by a β-hairpin redox switch in subunit γ that blocks rotation in the dark.</p>

Substantial convection and precipitation enhancements by ultrafine aerosol particles
<sec><title>Up with ultrafine aerosol particles</title><p>Ultrafine aerosol particles (smaller than 50 nanometers in diameter) have been thought to be too small to affect cloud formation. Fan <i>et al.</i> show that this is not the case. They studied the effect of urban pollution transported into the otherwise nearly pristine atmosphere of the Amazon. Condensational growth of water droplets around the tiny particles releases latent heat, thereby intensifying atmospheric convection. Thus, anthropogenic ultrafine aerosol particles may exert a more important influence on cloud formation processes than previously believed.</p><p><i>Science</i>, this issue p. www.archive.arm.gov/discovery/#v/results/s/fiop::amf2014goamazon, which is available to the community.

Atomic model for the dimeric F<sub>O</sub> region of mitochondrial ATP synthase
<p>Mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase produces the majority of ATP in eukaryotic cells, and its dimerization is necessary to create the inner membrane folds, or cristae, characteristic of mitochondria. Proton translocation through the membrane-embedded F<sub>O</sub> region turns the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotor</span></strong> that drives ATP synthesis in the soluble F<sub>1</sub> region. Although crystal structures of the F<sub>1</sub> region have illustrated how this rotation leads to ATP synthesis, understanding how proton translocation produces the rotation has been impeded by the lack of an experimental atomic model for the F<sub>O</sub> region. Using cryo–electron microscopy, we determined the structure of the dimeric F<sub>O</sub> complex from <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> at a resolution of 3.6 angstroms. The structure clarifies how the protons travel through the complex, how the complex dimerizes, and how the dimers bend the membrane to produce cristae.</p>

Nanoscale-length control of the flagellar driveshaft requires hitting the tethered outer membrane
<p>The bacterial flagellum exemplifies a system where even small deviations from the highly regulated flagellar assembly process can abolish motility and cause negative physiological outcomes. Consequently, bacteria have evolved elegant and robust regulatory mechanisms to ensure that flagellar morphogenesis follows a defined path, with each component self-assembling to predetermined dimensions. The flagellar rod acts as a driveshaft to transmit torque from the cytoplasmic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotor</span></strong> to the external filament. The rod self-assembles to a defined length of ~25 nanometers. Here, we provide evidence that rod length is limited by the width of the periplasmic space between the inner and outer membranes. The length of Braun's lipoprotein determines periplasmic width by tethering the outer membrane to the peptidoglycan layer.</p>

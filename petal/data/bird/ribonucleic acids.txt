CTDGFinder: A Novel Homology-Based Algorithm for Identifying Closely Spaced Clusters of Tandemly Duplicated Genes
<p>Closely spaced clusters of tandemly duplicated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s (CTDGs) contribute to the diversity of many phenotypes, including chemosensation, snake venom, and animal body plans. CTDGs have traditionally been identified subjectively as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic neighborhoods containing several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> duplicates in close proximity; however, CTDGs are often highly variable with respect to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> number, intergenic distance, and synteny. This lack of formal definition hampers the study of CTDG evolutionary dynamics and the discovery of novel CTDGs in the exponentially growing body of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic data. To address this gap, we developed a novel homology-based algorithm, CTDGFinder, which formalizes and automates the identification of CTDGs by examining the physical distribution of individual members of families of duplicated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s across chromosomes. Application of CTDGFinder accurately identified CTDGs for many well-known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters (e.g., Hox and beta-globin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters) in the human, mouse and 20 other mammalian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. Differences between previously annotated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters and our inferred CTDGs were due to the exclusion of nonhomologs that have historically been considered parts of specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters, the inclusion or absence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s between the CTDGs and their corresponding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters, and the splitting of certain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters into distinct CTDGs. Examination of human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s showing tissue-specific enhancement of their expression by CTDGFinder identified members of several well-known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters (e.g., cytochrome P450s and olfactory receptors) and revealed that they were unequally distributed across tissues. By formalizing and automating CTDG identification, CTDGFinder will facilitate understanding of CTDG evolutionary dynamics, their functional implications, and how they are associated with phenotypic diversity.</p>

Multi-Omics Driven Assembly and Annotation of the Sandalwood (<i>Santalum album</i>) Genome
<p>Indian sandalwood (<i>Santalum album</i>) is an important tropical evergreen tree known for its fragrant heartwood-derived essential oil and its valuable carving wood. Here, we applied an integrated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic, transcriptomic, and proteomic approach to assemble and annotate the Indian sandalwood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. Our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequencing resulted in the establishment of a draft map of the smallest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e for any woody tree species to date (221 Mb). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e annotation predicted 38,119 protein-coding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s and 27.42% repetitive DNA elements. In-depth proteome analysis revealed the identities of 72,325 unique peptides, which confirmed 10,076 of the predicted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. The addition of transcriptomic and proteo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic approaches resulted in the identification of 53 novel proteins and 34 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>-correction events that were missed by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic approaches. Proteo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic analysis also helped in reassigning 1,348 potential noncoding RNAs as bona fide protein-coding messenger RNAs. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> expression patterns at the RNA and protein levels indicated that peptide sequencing was useful in capturing proteins encoded by nuclear and organellar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es alike. Mass spectrometry-based proteomic evidence provided an unbiased approach toward the identification of proteins encoded by organellar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. Such proteins are often missed in transcriptome data sets due to the enrichment of only messenger RNAs that contain poly(A) tails. Overall, the use of integrated omic approaches enhanced the quality of the assembly and annotation of this nonmodel plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. The availability of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data will enhance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics-assisted breeding, germplasm characterization, and conservation of sandalwood trees.</p>

The Roles of Mutation, Selection, and Expression in Determining Relative Rates of Evolution in Mitochondrial versus Nuclear Genomes
<p>Eukaryotes rely on proteins encoded by the nuclear and mitochondrial (mt) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es, which interact within multisubunit complexes such as oxidative-phosphorylation enzymes. Although selection is thought to be less efficient on the asexual mt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e, in bilaterian animals the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions (<i>ω</i>) is lower in mt- compared with nuclear-encoded OXPHOS subunits, suggesting <i>stronger</i> effects of purifying selection in the mt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. Because high levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion constrain protein sequence evolution, one proposed resolution to this paradox is that mt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s are expressed more highly than nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. To test this hypothesis, we investigated expression and sequence evolution of mt and nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s from 84 diverse eukaryotes that vary in mt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> content and mutation rate. We found that the relationship between mt and nuclear <i>ω</i> values varied dramatically across eukaryotes. In contrast, transcript abundance is consistently higher for mt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s than nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, regardless of which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s happen to be in the mt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. Consequently, expression levels cannot be responsible for the differences in <i>ω</i>. Rather, 84% of the variance in the ratio of <i>ω</i> values between mt and nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s could be explained by differences in mutation rate between the two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. We relate these findings to the hypothesis that high rates of mt mutation select for compensatory changes in the nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. We also propose an explanation for why mt transcripts consistently outnumber their nuclear counterparts, with implications for mitonuclear protein imbalance and aging.</p>

Integrated Consensus Map of Cultivated Peanut and Wild Relatives Reveals Structures of the A and B Genomes of <i>Arachis</i> and Divergence of the Legume Genomes
<p>The complex, tetraploid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e structure of peanut (<i>Arachis hypogaea</i>) has obstructed advances in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tics and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics in the species. The aim of this study is to understand the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e structure of <i>Arachis</i> by developing a high-density integrated consensus map. Three recombinant inbred line populations derived from crosses between the A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e diploid species, <i>Arachis duranensis</i> and <i>Arachis stenosperma</i>; the B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e diploid species, <i>Arachis ipaënsis</i> and <i>Arachis magna</i>; and between the AB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e tetraploids, <i>A. hypogaea</i> and an artificial amphidiploid (<i>A. ipaënsis</i> × <i>A. duranensis</i>)<sup>4×</sup>, were used to construct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic linkage maps: 10 linkage groups (LGs) of 544 cM with 597 loci for the A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e; 10 LGs of 461 cM with 798 loci for the B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e; and 20 LGs of 1442 cM with 1469 loci for the AB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. The resultant maps plus 13 published maps were integrated into a consensus map covering 2651 cM with 3693 marker loci which was anchored to 20 consensus LGs corresponding to the A and B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. The comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequences of <i>Cajanus cajan</i>, <i>Glycine max</i>, <i>Lotus japonicus</i>, and <i>Medicago truncatula</i> revealed that the <i>Arachis</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e has segmented synteny relationship to the other legumes. The comparative maps in legumes, integrated tetraploid consensus maps, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-specific diploid maps will increase the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic understanding of <i>Arachis</i> and should facilitate molecular breeding.</p>

CHLOROPLAST RIBOSOME ASSOCIATED Supports Translation under Stress and Interacts with the Ribosomal 30S Subunit
<p>Chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>es, which originated from cyanobacteria, comprise a large subunit (50S) and a small subunit (30S) containing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>al RNAs (rRNAs) and various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>al proteins. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s for many chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>al proteins, as well as proteins with auxiliary roles in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>e bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>sis or functioning, reside in the nucleus. Here, we identified Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) CHLOROPLAST <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>E ASSOCIATED (CRASS), a member of the latter class of proteins, based on the tight coexpression of its mRNA with transcripts for nucleus-encoded chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>al proteins. CRASS was acquired during the evolution of embryophytes and is localized to the chloroplast stroma. Loss of CRASS results in minor defects in development, photosynthetic efficiency, and chloroplast translation activity under controlled growth conditions, but these phenotypes are greatly exacerbated under stress conditions induced by the translational inhibitors lincomycin and chloramphenicol or by cold treatment. The CRASS protein comigrates with chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>al particles and coimmunoprecipitates with the 16S rRNA and several chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>al proteins, particularly the plastid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>al proteins of the 30S subunit (PRPS1 and PRPS5). The association of CRASS with PRPS1 and PRPS5 is independent of rRNA and is not detectable in yeast two-hybrid experiments, implying that either CRASS interacts indirectly with PRPS1 and PRPS5 via another component of the small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>al subunit or that it recognizes structural features of the multiprotein/rRNA particle. CRASS plays a role in the bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>sis and/or stability of the chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>e that becomes critical under certain stressful conditions when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>al activity is compromised.</p>

Hierarchically Aligning 10 Legume Genomes Establishes a Family-Level Genomics Platform
<p>Mainly due to their economic importance, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es of 10 legumes, including soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>), wild peanut (<i>Arachis duranensis</i> and <i>Arachis ipaensis</i>), and barrel medic (<i>Medicago truncatula</i>), have been sequenced. However, a family-level comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics analysis has been unavailable. With grape (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) and selected legume <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es as outgroups, we managed to perform a hierarchical and event-related alignment of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es and deconvoluted layers of homologous regions produced by ancestral polyploidizations or speciations. Consequently, we illustrated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic fractionation characterized by widespread <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> losses after the polyploidizations. Notably, high similarity in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> retention between recently duplicated chromosomes in soybean supported the likely autopolyploidy nature of its tetraploid ancestor. Moreover, although most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> losses were nearly random, largely but not fully described by geometric distribution, we showed that polyploidization contributed divergently to the copy number variation of important <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families. Besides, we showed significantly divergent evolutionary levels among legumes and, by performing synonymous nucleotide substitutions at synonymous sites correction, redated major evolutionary events during their expansion. This effort laid a solid foundation for further <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics exploration in the legume research community and beyond. We describe only a tiny fraction of legume comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics analysis that we performed; more information was stored in the newly constructed Legume Comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics Research Platform (<ext-link>www.legumegrp.org</ext-link>).</p>

Evolutionary Dynamics of Abundant Stop Codon Readthrough
<p>Translational stop codon readthrough emerged as a major regulatory mechanism affecting hundreds of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in animal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es, based on recent comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>al profiling evidence, but its evolutionary properties remain unknown. Here, we leverage comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic evidence across 21 <i>Anopheles</i> mosquitoes to systematically annotate readthrough <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in the malaria vector <i>Anopheles gambiae</i>, and to provide the first study of abundant readthrough evolution, by comparison with 20 <i>Drosophila</i> species. Using improved comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics methods for detecting readthrough, we identify evolutionary signatures of conserved, functional readthrough of 353 stop codons in the malaria vector, <i>Anopheles gambiae</i>, and of 51 additional <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> stop codons, including several cases of double and triple readthrough and of readthrough of two adjacent stop codons. We find that most differences between the readthrough repertoires of the two species arose from readthrough gain or loss in existing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, rather than birth of new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> death; that readthrough-associated RNA structures are sometimes gained or lost while readthrough persists; that readthrough is more likely to be lost at TAA and TAG stop codons; and that readthrough is under continued purifying evolutionary selection in mosquito, based on population <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic evidence. We also determine readthrough-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> properties that predate readthrough, and identify differences in the characteristic properties of readthrough <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s between clades. We estimate more than 600 functional readthrough stop codons in mosquito and 900 in fruit fly, provide evidence of readthrough control of peroxisomal targeting, and refine the phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic extent of abundant readthrough as following divergence from centipede.</p>

Whole-Genome Sequencing of Tibetan Macaque (<i>Macaca thibetana</i>) Provides New Insight into the Macaque Evolutionary History
<p>Macaques are the most widely distributed nonhuman primates and used as animal models in biomedical research. The availability of full-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequences from them would be essential to both biomedical and primate evolutionary studies. Previous studies have reported whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequences from rhesus macaque (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>) and cynomolgus macaque (<i>M. fascicularis</i>, CE), both of which belong to the <i>fascicularis</i> group. Here, we present a 37-fold coverage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequence of the Tibetan macaque (<i>M. thibetana</i>; TM). TM is an endemic species to China belonging to the <i>sinica</i> group<i>.</i> On the basis of mapping to the rhesus macaque <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e, we identified approximately 11.9 million single-nucleotide variants), of which 3.9 million were TM specific, as assessed by comparison two Chinese rhesus macaques (CR) and two CE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. Some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s carried TM-specific homozygous nonsynonymous variants (TSHNVs), which were scored as deleterious in human by both PolyPhen-2 and SIFT (Sorting Tolerant From Intolerant) and were enriched in the eye disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. In total, 273 immune response and disease-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s carried at least one TSHNV. The heterozygosity rates of two CRs (0.002617 and 0.002612) and two CEs (0.003004 and 0.003179) were approximately three times higher than that of TM (0.000898). Polymerase chain reaction resequencing of 18 TM individuals showed that 29 TSHNVs exhibited high allele frequencies, thus confirming their low heterozygosity. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-wide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic divergence analysis demonstrated that TM was more closely related to CR than to CE. We further detected unusual low divergence regions between TM and CR. In addition, after applying statistical criteria to detect putative introgression regions (PIRs) in the TM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e, up to 239,620 kb PIRs (8.84% of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e) were identified. Given that TM and CR have overlapping geographical distributions, had the same refuge during the Middle Pleistocene, and show similar mating behaviors, it is highly likely that there was an ancient introgression event between them. Moreover, demographic inferences revealed that TM exhibited a similar demographic history as other macaques until 0.5 Ma, but then it maintained a lower effective population size until present time. Our study has provided new insight into the macaque evolutionary history, confirming hybridization events between macaque species groups based on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-wide data.</p>

Revisiting the sequencing of the first tree genome: <i>Populus trichocarpa</i>
<p>Ten years ago, it was announced that the Joint <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e Institute with funds provided by the Department of Energy, Office of Science, Biological and Environmental Research would sequence the black cottonwood (<i>Populus trichocarpa</i> Torr. & Gray) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. This landmark decision was the culmination of work by the forest science community to develop <i>Populus</i> as a model system. Since its public release in late 2006, the availability of the <i>Populus</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e has spawned research in plant biology, morphology, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tics and ecology. Here we address how the tree physiologist has used this resource. More specifically, we revisit our earlier contention that the rewards of sequencing the <i>Populus</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e would depend on how quickly scientists working with woody perennials could adopt molecular approaches to investigate the mechanistic underpinnings of basic physiological processes. Several examples illustrate the integration of functional and comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics into the forest sciences, especially in areas that target improved understanding of the developmental differences between woody perennials and herbaceous annuals (e.g., phase transitions). Sequencing the <i>Populus</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e and the availability of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic resources has also been instrumental in identifying candidate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that underlie physiological and morphological traits of interest. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-enabled research has advanced our understanding of how phenotype and genotype are related and provided insights into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic mechanisms whereby woody perennials adapt to environmental stress. In the future, we anticipate that low-cost, high-throughput sequencing will continue to facilitate research in tree physiology and enhance our understanding at scales of individual organisms and populations. A challenge remains, however, as to how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic resources, including the <i>Populus</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e, can be used to understand ecosystem function. Although examples are limited, progress in this area is encouraging and will undoubtedly improve as future research targets the many unique aspects of <i>Populus</i> as a keystone species in terrestrial ecosystems.</p>

Gcorn Plant: A Database for Retrieving Functional and Evolutionary Traits of Plant Genes
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> homology helps us understand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> function and speciation. The number of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s and species registered in public databanks is continuously increasing. It is useful to associate homologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s of various plants to better understand plant speciation. We designed the Gcorn plant database for the retrieval of information on homology and evolution of a plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> of interest. Amino acid sequences of 73 species (62 land plants and 11 green algae), containing 2,682,261 sequences, were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Reference Sequence database. Based on NCBI BLAST searches between these sequences, homologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s were grouped at various thresholds of homology indices devised by the authors. To show functional and evolutionary traits of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> of interest, a phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic tree, connecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s with high homology indices, and line charts of the numbers of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s with various homology indices, are depicted. In addition, such indices are projected on a network graph in which species studied are connected based on the ratios of homologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, and on a phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic tree for species based on NCBI Taxonomy. Gcorn plant provides information on homologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s at various virtual time points along with speciation in plants.</p>

Recursive Paleohexaploidization Shaped the Durian Genome
<p>The durian (<i>Durio zibethinus</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e has recently become available, and analysis of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e reveals two paleopolyploidization events previously inferred as shared with cotton (<i>Gossypium</i> spp.). Here, we reanalyzed the durian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e in comparison with other well-characterized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. We found that durian and cotton were actually affected by different polyploidization events: hexaploidization in durian ∼19–21 million years ago (mya) and decaploidization in cotton ∼13–14 mya. Previous interpretations of shared polyploidization events may have resulted from the elevated evolutionary rates in cotton <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s due to the decaploidization and insufficient consideration of the complexity of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. The decaploidization elevated evolutionary rates of cotton <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s by ∼64% compared to durian and explained a previous ∼4-fold over dating of the event. In contrast, the hexaploidization in durian did not prominently elevate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> evolutionary rates, likely due to its long <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>ration time. Moreover, divergent evolutionary rates probably explain 98.4% of reconstructed phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic trees of homologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s being incongruent with expected topology. The findings provide further insight into the roles played by polypoidization in the evolution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, and they suggest revisiting existing reconstructed phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic trees.</p>

In addition, the endogenous tRNA-processing system was used to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>rate multiple amiRNAs from tRNA-pre-amiRNA tandem repeats for multiplex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> silencing. An intronic amiRNA-producing fluorescent reporter was explored as a visual screening strategy for transgenic Arabidopsis and rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) plants with maximal whole-plant or cell type-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> silencing.

Plant Temperature Acclimation and Growth Rely on Cytosolic Ribosome Biogenesis Factor Homologs
<p>Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) REI1-LIKE (REIL) proteins, REIL1 and REIL2, are homologs of a yeast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>e bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>sis factor that participates in late cytoplasmic 60S <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>al subunit maturation. Here, we report that the inhibited growth of the <i>reil1-1 reil2-1</i> mutant at 10°C can be rescued by the expression of amino-terminal FLUORESCENT PROTEIN (FP)-REIL fusions driven by the <i>UBIQUITIN10</i> promoter, allowing the analysis of REIL function in planta. Arabidopsis REIL1 appears to be functionally conserved, based on the cytosolic localization of FP-REIL1 and the interaction of native REIL1 with the 60S subunit in wild-type plants. In contrast to its yeast homologs, REIL1 also was present in translating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>e fractions. Systems analysis revealed that wild-type Arabidopsis remodels the cytosolic translation machinery when grown at 10°C by accumulating cytosolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>e subunits and inducing the expression of cytosolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>al RNA, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>e bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>sis factors, and translation initiation or elongation factors. In the <i>reil1-1 reil2-1</i> mutant, all processes associated with inhibited growth were delayed, although the plants maintained cellular integrity or acquired freezing tolerance. REIL proteins also were implicated in plant-specific processes: nonacclimated <i>reil1-1 reil2-1</i> exhibited cold-acclimation responses, including activation of the DREB/CBF regulon. In addition, acclimated <i>reil1-1 reil2-1</i> plants failed to activate <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T</i> expression in mature leaves. Therefore, in the wild type, REIL function may contribute to temperature perception by suppressing premature cold responses during growth at nonstressful temperatures. In conclusion, we suggest that Arabidopsis REIL proteins influence cold-induced plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>e remodeling and enhance the accumulation of cytosolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>e subunits after cold shift either by de novo synthesis or by recycling them from the translating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>e fraction.</p>

Roles of miR319 and TCP Transcription Factors in Leaf Development
<p>Sophisticated regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and their target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, is required for leaf differentiation, growth, and senescence. The impact of miR319 and its target <i>TEOSINTE BRANCHED1</i>, <i>CYCLOIDEA</i>, and <i>PROLIFERATING CELL NUCLEAR ANTIGEN BINDING FACTOR</i> (<i>TCP</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s on leaf development has been extensively investigated, but the redundancies of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families often interfere with the evaluation of their function and regulation in the developmental context. Here, we present the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic evidence of the involvement of the <i>MIR319</i> and <i>TCP</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaf development. Single mutations in <i>MIR319A</i> and <i>MIR319B</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s moderately inhibited the formation of leaf serrations, whereas double mutations increased the extent of this inhibition and resulted in the formation of smooth leaves. Mutations in <i>MIR319</i> and gain-of-function mutations in the <i>TCP4</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> conferred resistance against miR319 and impaired the cotyledon boundary and leaf serration formation. These mutations functionally associated with <i>CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, which regulate the cotyledon boundary and leaf serration formation. In contrast, loss-of-function mutations in miR319-targeted and nontargeted <i>TCP</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s cooperatively induced the formation of serrated leaves in addition to changes in the levels of their downstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> transcript. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the <i>MIR319</i> and <i>TCP</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families underlie robust and multilayer control of leaf development. This study also provides a framework toward future researches on redundant miRNAs and transcription factors in Arabidopsis and crop plants.</p>

Genome-Wide Prediction of Metabolic Enzymes, Pathways, and Gene Clusters in Plants
<p>Plant metabolism underpins many traits of ecological and agronomic importance. Plants produce numerous compounds to cope with their environments but the biosynthetic pathways for most of these compounds have not yet been elucidated. To engineer and improve metabolic traits, we need comprehensive and accurate knowledge of the organization and regulation of plant metabolism at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e scale. Here, we present a computational pipeline to identify metabolic enzymes, pathways, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters from a sequenced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. Using this pipeline, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>rated metabolic pathway databases for 22 species and identified metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters from 18 species. This unified resource can be used to conduct a wide array of comparative studies of plant metabolism. Using the resource, we discovered a widespread occurrence of metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters in plants: 11,969 clusters from 18 species. The prevalence of metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters offers an intriguing possibility of an untapped source for uncovering new metabolite biosynthesis pathways. For example, more than 1,700 clusters contain enzymes that could <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>rate a specialized metabolite scaffold (signature enzymes) and enzymes that modify the scaffold (tailoring enzymes). In four species with sufficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion data, we identified 43 highly coexpressed clusters that contain signature and tailoring enzymes, of which eight were characterized previously to be functional pathways. Finally, we identified patterns of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e organization that implicate local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> duplication and, to a lesser extent, single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> transposition as having played roles in the evolution of plant metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters.</p>

Stability of Single-Parent Gene Expression Complementation in Maize Hybrids upon Water Deficit Stress
<p>Heterosis is the superior performance of F1 hybrids compared with their homozygous, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tically distinct parents. In this study, we monitored the transcriptomic divergence of the maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) inbred lines B73 and Mo17 and their reciprocal F1 hybrid progeny in primary roots under control and water deficit conditions simulated by polyethylene glycol treatment. Single-parent expression (SPE) of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s is an extreme instance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion complementation, in which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s are active in only one of two parents but are expressed in both reciprocal hybrids. In this study, 1,997 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s only expressed in B73 and 2,024 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s only expressed in Mo17 displayed SPE complementation under control and water deficit conditions. As a consequence, the number of active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in hybrids exceeded the number of active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in the parental inbred lines significantly independent of treatment. SPE patterns were substantially more stable to expression changes by water deficit treatment than other genotype-specific expression profiles. While, on average, 75% of all SPE patterns were not altered in response to polyethylene glycol treatment, only 17% of the remaining genotype-specific expression patterns were not changed by water deficit. Nonsyntenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that lack syntenic orthologs in other grass species, and thus evolved late in the grass lineage, were significantly overrepresented among SPE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. Hence, the significant overrepresentation of nonsyntenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s among SPE patterns and their stability under water limitation might suggest a function of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s during the early developmental manifestation of heterosis under fluctuating environmental conditions in hybrid progeny of the inbred lines B73 and Mo17.</p>

Atypical Protein Phosphatase 2A Gene Families Do Not Expand via Paleopolyploidization
<p>Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) presents unique opportunities for analyzing molecular mechanisms of functional divergence between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> family members. The canonical PP2A holoenzyme regulates multiple eukaryotic signaling pathways by dephosphorylating target proteins and contains a catalytic (C) subunit, a structural/scaffolding (A) subunit, and a regulatory (B) subunit. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s encoding PP2A subunits have expanded into multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families in both flowering plants and mammals, and the extent to which different isoform functions may overlap is not clearly understood. To gain insight into the diversification of PP2A subunits, we used phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic analyses to reconstruct the evolutionary histories of PP2A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s encoding PP2A subunits in mammals represent ancient lineages that expanded early in vertebrate evolution, while flowering plant PP2A subunit lineages evolved much more recently. Despite this temporal difference, our data indicate that the expansion of PP2A subunit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families in both flowering plants and animals was driven by whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e duplications followed by nonrandom <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> loss. Selection analysis suggests that the expansion of one B subunit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> family (B56/PPP2R5) was driven by functional diversification rather than by the maintenance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> dosage. We also observed reduced expansion rates in three distinct B subunit subclades. One of these subclades plays a highly conserved role in cell division, while the distribution of a second subclade suggests a specialized function in supporting beneficial microbial associations. Thus, while whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e duplications have driven the expansion and diversification of most PP2A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families, members of functionally specialized subclades quickly revert to singleton status after duplication events.</p>

The Evolution of Innate Immune Genes: Purifying and Balancing Selection on β-Defensins in Waterfowl
<p>In disease dynamics, high immune <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> diversity can confer a selective advantage to hosts in the face of a rapidly evolving and diverse pathogen fauna. This is supported empirically for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s involved in pathogen recognition and signalling. In contrast, effector <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s involved in pathogen clearance may be more constrained. β-Defensins are innate immune effector <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s; their main mode of action is via disruption of microbial membranes. Here, five β-defensin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s were characterized in mallards (<i>Anas platyrhynchos</i>) and other waterfowl; key reservoir species for many zoonotic diseases. All five <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s showed remarkably low diversity at the individual-, population-, and species-level. Furthermore, there was widespread sharing of identical alleles across species divides. Thus, specific β-defensin alleles were maintained not only spatially but also over long temporal scales, with many amino acid residues being fixed across all species investigated. Purifying selection to maintain individual, highly efficacious alleles was the primary evolutionary driver of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in waterfowl. However, we also found evidence for balancing selection acting on the most recently duplicated β-defensin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> (<i>AvBD3b</i>). For this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>, we found that amino acid replacements were more likely to be radical changes, suggesting that duplication of β-defensin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s allows exploration of wider functional space. Structural conservation to maintain function appears to be crucial for avian β-defensin effector molecules, resulting in low tolerance for new allelic variants. This contrasts with other types of innate immune <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, such as receptor and signalling molecules, where balancing selection to maintain allelic diversity has been shown to be a strong evolutionary force.</p>

Old but Not (So) Degenerated—Slow Evolution of Largely Homomorphic Sex Chromosomes in Ratites
<p>De<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>ration of the nonrecombining chromosome is a common feature of sex chromosome evolution, readily evident by the presence of a pair of largely heteromorphic chromosomes, like in eutherian mammals and birds. However, in ratites (order Palaeognathae, including, e.g., ostrich), the Z and W chromosomes are similar in size and largely undifferentiated, despite avian sex chromosome evolution was initiated > 130 Ma. To better understand what may limit sex chromosome evolution, we performed ostrich transcriptome sequencing and studied <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s from the nonrecombining region of the W chromosome. Fourteen gametologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> pairs present on the W chromosome and Z chromosome were identified, with synonymous sequence divergence of 0.027–0.177. The location of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s on the Z chromosome was consistent with a sequential increase in divergence, starting 110–157 and ending 24–30 Ma. On the basis of the occurrence of Z-linked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s hemizygous in females, we estimate that about one-third of the Z chromosome does not recombine with the W chromosome in female meiosis. Pairwise <i>d</i><sub>N</sub><i>/d</i><sub>S</sub> between gametologs decreased with age, suggesting strong evolutionary constraint in old gametologs. Lineage-specific <i>d</i><sub>N</sub><i>/d</i><sub>S</sub> was consistently higher in W-linked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, in accordance with the lower efficacy of selection expected in nonrecombining chromosomes. A higher ratio of GC > AT:AT > GC substitutions in W-linked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s supports a role for GC-biased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> conversion in differentially driving base composition on the two sex chromosomes. A male-to-female (M:F) expression ratio of close to one for recombining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s and close to two for Z-linked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s lacking a W copy show that dosage compensation is essentially absent. Some gametologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s have retained active expression of the W copy in females (giving a M:F ratio of 1 for the gametologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> pair), whereas for others W expression has become severely reduced resulting in a M:F ratio of close to 2. These observations resemble the patterns of sex chromosome evolution seen in other avian and mammalian lineages, suggesting similar underlying evolutionary processes, although the rate of sex chromosome differentiation has been atypically low. Lack of dosage compensation may be a factor hindering sex chromosome evolution in this lineage.</p>

Expansion of Secretin-Like G Protein-Coupled Receptors and Their Peptide Ligands via Local Duplications Before and After Two Rounds of Whole-Genome Duplication
<p>In humans, the secretin-like G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family comprises 15 members with 18 corresponding peptide ligand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. Although members have been identified in a large variety of vertebrate and nonvertebrate species, the origin and relationship of these proteins remain unresolved. To address this issue, we employed large-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e comparisons to identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e fragments with conserved synteny and matched these fragments to linkage groups in reconstructed early gnathostome ancestral chromosomes (<i>GAC</i>). This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e comparison revealed that most receptor and peptide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s were clustered in three <i>GAC</i> linkage groups and suggested that the ancestral forms of five peptide subfamilies (corticotropin-releasing hormone-like, calcitonin-like, parathyroid hormone-like, glucagon-like, and growth hormone-releasing hormone-like) and their cognate receptor families emerged through tandem local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> duplications before two rounds (2R) of whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e duplication. These subfamily <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s have, then, been amplified by 2R whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e duplication, followed by additional local duplications and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> loss prior to the divergence of land vertebrates and teleosts. This study delineates a possible evolutionary scenario for whole secretin-like peptide and receptor family members and may shed light on evolutionary mechanisms for expansion of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> family with a large number of paralogs.</p>

Genetics of Variable Disease Expression Conferred by Inverse Gene-For-Gene Interactions in the Wheat-<i>Parastagonospora nodorum</i> Pathosystem
<p>The wheat-<i>Parastagonospora nodorum</i> pathosystem involves the recognition of pathogen-secreted necrotrophic effectors (NEs) by corresponding wheat NE sensitivity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. This inverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>-for-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> recognition leads to necrotrophic effector-triggered susceptibility and ultimately septoria nodorum blotch disease. Here, we used multiple pathogen isolates to individually evaluate the effects of the host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>-NE interactions <i>Tan spot necrosis1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum ToxinA (<i>Tsn1</i>-SnToxA), <i>Stagonospora nodorum necrosis1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum Toxin1 (<i>Snn1</i>-SnTox1), and <i>Stagonospora nodorum necrosis3-B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e homeolog1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum Toxin3 (<i>Snn3-B1</i>-SnTox3), alone and in various combinations, to determine the relative importance of these interactions in causing disease. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic analysis of a recombinant inbred wheat population inoculated separately with three <i>P. nodorum</i> isolates, all of which produce all three NEs, indicated that the <i>Tsn1</i>-SnToxA and <i>Snn3-B1</i>-SnTox3 interactions contributed to disease caused by all four isolates, but their effects varied and ranged from epistatic to additive. The <i>Snn1</i>-SnTox1 interaction was associated with increased disease for one isolate, but for other isolates, there was evidence that this interaction inhibited the expression of other host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>-NE interactions. RNA sequencing analysis in planta showed that <i>SnTox1</i> was differentially expressed between these three isolates after infection. Further analysis of NE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>-knockout isolates showed that the effect of some interactions could be masked or inhibited by other compatible interactions, and the regulation of this occurs at the level of NE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> transcription. Collectively, these results show that the inverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>-for-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> interactions leading to necrotrophic effector-triggered susceptibility in the wheat-<i>P. nodorum</i> pathosystem vary in their effects depending on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic backgrounds of the pathogen and host, and interplay among the interactions is complex and intricately regulated.</p>

Healthy Roots and Leaves: Comparative Genome Structure of Horseradish and Watercress
<p>Horseradish (<i>Armoracia rusticana</i>) and watercress (<i>Nasturtium officinale</i>) are economically important cruciferous vegetable species with limited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic resources. We used comparative chromosome painting to identify the extent of chromosomal collinearity between horseradish and watercress, and to reconstruct the origin and evolution of the two tetraploid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es (2<i>n</i> = 4<i>x</i> = 32). Our results show that horseradish and watercress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es originated from a common ancestral (<i>n</i> = 8) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e, structurally resembling the Ancestral Crucifer Karyotype (<i>n</i> = 8), which, however, contained two unique translocation chromosomes (AK6/8 and AK8/6). Except for a 2.4-Mb unequal chromosome translocation in watercress, both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es are structurally identical. The structural similarity of the two parental sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es might suggest an autotetraploid origin of horseradish and watercress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. The sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e stasis, apart from the single-chromosome translocation, indicates that homeologous recombination played a limited role in postpolyploid evolution in both tetraploid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. The octoploid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e of one-rowed watercress (<i>N. microphyllum</i>, 2<i>n</i> = 8<i>x</i> = 64), structurally mirroring the tetraploid horseradish and watercress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es, originated via autopolyploidization from the immediate tetraploid predecessor of watercress or hybridization between this and another now-extinct tetraploid <i>Nasturtium</i> species. These comparative cyto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic maps in horseradish and watercress represent a first stepping stone for future whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequencing efforts and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic improvement of both crop species.</p>

Characterization of Imprinted Genes in Rice Reveals Conservation of Regulation and Imprinting with Other Plant Species
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic imprinting is an epi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic phenomenon by which certain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s display differential expression in a parent-of-origin-dependent manner. Hundreds of imprinted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s have been identified from several plant species. Here, we identified, with a high level of confidence, 208 imprinted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> candidates from rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). Imprinted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s of rice showed limited association with the transposable elements, which contrasts with findings from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>rally, imprinting in rice is conserved within a species, but intraspecific variation also was detected. The imprinted rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s do not show signatures of selection, which suggests that domestication has had a limited evolutionary consequence on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic imprinting. Although conservation of imprinting in plants is limited, we show that some loci are imprinted in several different species. Moreover, our results suggest that different types of epi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic regulation can be established either before or after fertilization. Imprinted 24-nucleotide small RNAs and their neighboring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s tend to express alleles from different parents. This association was not observed between 21-nucleotide small RNAs and their neighboring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. Together, our findings suggest that the regulation of imprinting can be diverse, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic imprinting has evolutionary and biological significance.</p>

Unique Physiological and Transcriptional Shifts under Combinations of Salinity, Drought, and Heat
<p>Climate-change-driven stresses such as extreme temperatures, water deficit, and ion imbalance are projected to exacerbate and jeopardize global food security. Under field conditions, these stresses usually occur simultaneously and cause damages that exceed single stresses. Here, we investigated the transcriptional patterns and morpho-physiological acclimations of <i>Brachypodium dystachion</i> to single salinity, drought, and heat stresses, as well as their double and triple stress combinations. Hierarchical clustering analysis of morpho-physiological acclimations showed that several traits exhibited a gradually aggravating effect as plants were exposed to combined stresses. On the other hand, other morphological traits were dominated by salinity, while some physiological traits were shaped by heat stress. Response patterns of differentially expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, under single and combined stresses (i.e. common stress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s), were maintained only among 37% of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, indicating a limited expression consistency among partially overlapping stresses. A comparison between common stress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that were uniquely expressed only under combined stresses (i.e. combination unique <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s) revealed a significant shift from increased intensity to antagonistic responses, respectively. The different transcriptional signatures imply an alteration in the mode of action under combined stresses and limited ability to predict plant responses as different stresses are combined. Coexpression analysis coupled with enrichment analysis revealed that each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> subset was enriched with different biological processes. Common stress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s were enriched with known stress response pathways, while combination unique-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s were enriched with unique processes and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s with unknown functions that hold the potential to improve stress tolerance and enhance cereal productivity under suboptimal field conditions.</p>

Validating Genome-Wide Association Candidates Controlling Quantitative Variation in Nodulation
<p>Genome-wide association (GWA) studies offer the opportunity to identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that contribute to naturally occurring variation in quantitative traits. However, GWA relies exclusively on statistical association, so functional validation is necessary to make strong claims about <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> function. We used a combination of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>-disruption platforms (Tnt1 retrotransposons, hairpin RNA-interference constructs, and CRISPR/Cas9 nucleases) together with randomized, well-replicated experiments to evaluate the function of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that an earlier GWA study in <i>Medicago truncatula</i> had identified as candidates contributing to variation in the symbiosis between legumes and rhizobia. We evaluated ten candidate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s found in six clusters of strongly associated single nucleotide polymorphisms, selected on the basis of their strength of statistical association, proximity to annotated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> models, and root or nodule expression. We found statistically significant effects on nodule production for three candidate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, each validated in two independent mutants. Annotated functions of these three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s suggest their contributions to quantitative variation in nodule production occur through processes not previously connected to nodulation, including phosphorous supply and salicylic acid-related defense response. These results demonstrate the utility of GWA combined with reverse muta<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>sis technologies to discover and validate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s contributing to naturally occurring variation in quantitative traits. The results highlight the potential for GWA to complement forward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tics in identifying the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic basis of ecologically and economically important traits.</p>

Histone Modifications Define Expression Bias of Homoeologous Genomes in Allotetraploid Cotton
<p>Histone modifications regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion in eukaryotes, but their roles in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion changes in interspecific hybrids or allotetraploids are poorly understood. Histone modifications can be mapped by immunostaining of metaphase chromosomes at the single cell level and/or by chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) for analyzing individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. Here, we comparatively analyzed immunostained metaphase chromosomes and ChIP-seq of individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, which revealed a chromatin basis for biased homoeologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion in polyploids. We examined H3K4me3 density and transcriptome maps in root-tip cells of allotetraploid cotton (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>). The overall H3K4me3 levels were relatively equal between A and D chromosomes, which were consistent with equal numbers of expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s between the two sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. However, intensities per chromosomal area were nearly twice as high in the D homeologs as in the A homeologs. Consistent with the cytological observation, ChIP-seq analysis showed that more D homeologs with biased H3K4me3 levels than A homeologs with biased modifications correlated with the greater number of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s with D-biased expression than that with A-biased expression in most homeologous chromosome pairs. Two chromosomes displayed different expression levels compared with other chromosomes, which correlate with known translocations and may affect the local chromatin structure and expression levels for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s involved. This example of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-wide histone modifications that determine expression bias of homeologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in allopolyploids provides a molecular basis for the evolution and domestication of polyploid species, including many important crops.</p>

Genetic Bases of Fungal White Rot Wood Decay Predicted by Phylogenomic Analysis of Correlated Gene-Phenotype Evolution
<p>Fungal decomposition of plant cell walls (PCW) is a complex process that has diverse industrial applications and huge impacts on the carbon cycle. White rot (WR) is a powerful mode of PCW decay in which lignin and carbohydrates are both degraded. Mechanistic studies of decay coupled with comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic analyses have provided clues to the enzymatic components of WR systems and their evolutionary origins, but the complete suite of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s necessary for WR remains undetermined. Here, we use phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic comparative methods, which we validate through simulations, to identify shifts in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> family diversification rates that are correlated with evolution of WR, using data from 62 fungal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. We detected 409 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families that appear to be evolutionarily correlated with WR. The identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families encode well-characterized decay enzymes, e.g., fungal class II peroxidases and cellobiohydrolases, and enzymes involved in import and detoxification pathways, as well as 73 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families that have no functional annotation. About 310 of the 409 identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families are present in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e of the model WR fungus <i>Phanerochaete chrysosporium</i> and 192 of these (62%) have been shown to be upregulated under ligninolytic culture conditions, which corroborates the phylogeny-based functional inferences. These results illuminate the complexity of WR and suggest that its evolution has involved a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>ral elaboration of the decay apparatus, including numerous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families with as-yet unknown exact functions.</p>

The Genotype–Phenotype Map of Yeast Complex Traits: Basic Parameters and the Role of Natural Selection
<p>Most phenotypic traits are controlled by many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, but a global picture of the genotype–phenotype map (GPM) is lacking. For example, in no species do we know <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>rally how many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s affect a trait and how large these effects are. It is also unclear to what extent GPMs are shaped by natural selection. Here we address these fundamental questions using the reverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic data of 220 morphological traits in 4,718 budding yeast strains, each of which lacks a nonessential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>. We show that 1) the proportion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s affecting a trait varies from <1% to >30%, averaging 6%, 2) most traits are impacted by many more small-effect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s than large-effect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, and 3) the mean effect of all nonessential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s on a trait decreases precipitously as the estimated importance of the trait to fitness increases. An analysis of 3,116 yeast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion traits in 754 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>-deletion strains reveals a similar pattern. These findings illustrate the power of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-wide reverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tics in genotype–phenotype mapping, uncover an enormous range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic complexity of phenotypic traits, and suggest that the GPM of cellular organisms has been shaped by natural selection for mutational robustness.</p>

Molecular Characterization and Evolution of a Gene Family Encoding Both Female- and Male-Specific Reproductive Proteins in <i>Drosophila</i>
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> duplication is an important mechanism for the evolution of new reproductive proteins. However, in most cases, each resulting paralog continues to function within the same sex. To investigate the possibility that seminal fluid proteins arise through duplicates of female reproductive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that become “co-opted” by males, we screened female reproductive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> for cases of duplication in which one of the resulting paralogs produces a protein in males that is transferred to females during mating. We identified a set of three tandemly duplicated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that encode secreted serine-type endopeptidase homologs, two of which are expressed primarily in the female reproductive tract (RT), whereas the third is expressed specifically in the male RT and encodes a seminal fluid protein. Evolutionary and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion analyses across <i>Drosophila</i> species suggest that this family arose from a single-copy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> that was female-specific; after duplication, one paralog evolved male-specific expression. Functional tests of knockdowns of each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> in <i>D. melanogaster</i> show that one female-expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> is essential for full fecundity, and both female-expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s contribute singly or in combination to a female’s propensity to remate. In contrast, knockdown of the male-expressed paralog had no significant effect on female fecundity or remating. These data are consistent with a model in which members of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> family exert effects on females by acting on a common, female-expressed target. After duplication and male co-option of one paralog, the evolution of the interacting proteins could have resulted in differential strengths or effects of each paralog.</p>

Evidence for Selection on Gene Expression in Cultivated Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>)
<p>Artificial selection has been used throughout plant domestication and breeding to develop crops that are adapted to diverse environments. Here, we investigate whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> regulatory changes have been widespread targets of lineage-specific selection in cultivated lines Minghui 63 and Zhenshan 97 of rice, <i>Oryza sativa</i>. A line experiencing positive selection for either an increase or a decrease in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s' transcript abundances is expected to have an overabundance of expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) alleles that increase or decrease those <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s' expression, respectively. Results indicate that several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that share <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> Ontology terms or are members of the same coexpression module have eQTL alleles from one parent that consistently increase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion relative to the second parent. A second line of evidence for lineage-specific selection is an overabundance of <i>cis–trans</i> pairs of eQTL alleles that affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion in the same direction (are reinforcing). Across all <i>cis–trans</i> pairs of eQTL, including pairs that both weakly and strongly affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion, there is no evidence for selection. However, the frequency of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s with reinforcing eQTL increases with eQTL strength. Therefore, there is evidence that eQTL with strong effects were positively selected during rice cultivation. Among 41 <i>cis–trans</i> pairs with strong <i>trans</i> eQTL, 31 have reinforcing eQTL. Several of the candidate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s under positive selection accurately predict phenotypic differences between Minghui 63 and Zhenshan 97. Overall, our results suggest that positive selection for regulatory alleles may be a key factor in plant improvement.</p>

Efficient Inference of Recombination Hot Regions in Bacterial Genomes
<p>In eukaryotes, detailed surveys of recombination rates have shown variation at multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic scales and the presence of “hotspots” of highly elevated recombination. In bacteria, studies of recombination rate variation are less developed, in part because there are few analysis methods that take into account the clonal context within which bacterial evolution occurs. Here, we focus in particular on identifying “hot regions” of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e where DNA is transferred frequently between isolates. We present a computationally efficient algorithm based on the recently developed “chromosome painting” algorithm, which characterizes patterns of haplotype sharing across a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. We compare the average <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e wide painting, which principally reflects clonal descent, with the painting for each site which additionally reflects the specific deviations at the site due to recombination. Using simulated data, we show that hot regions have consistently higher deviations from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e wide average than normal regions. We applied our approach to previously analyzed <i>Escherichia coli</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es and revealed that the new method is highly correlated with the number of recombination events affecting each site inferred by ClonalOrigin, a method that is only applicable to small numbers of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. Furthermore, we analyzed recombination hot regions in <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> by using 200 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. We identified three recombination hot regions, which are enriched for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s related to membrane proteins. Our approach and its implementation, which is downloadable from <ext-link>https://github.com/bioprojects/orderedPainting</ext-link>, will help to develop a new phase of population <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic studies of recombination in prokaryotes.</p>

Comparison of the complete genome sequences of four γ-hexachlorocyclohexane-degrading bacterial strains: insights into the evolution of bacteria able to degrade a recalcitrant man-made pesticide
<p>γ-Hexachlorocyclohexane (γ-HCH) is a recalcitrant man-made chlorinated pesticide. Here, the complete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequences of four γ-HCH-degrading sphingomonad strains, which are most unlikely to have been derived from one ancestral γ-HCH degrader, were compared. Together with several experimental data, we showed that (i) all the four strains carry almost identical <i>linA</i> to <i>linE</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s for the conversion of γ-HCH to maleylacetate (designated “specific” <i>lin</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s), (ii) considerably different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s are used for the metabolism of maleylacetate in one of the four strains, and (iii) the <i>linKLMN</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s for the putative ABC transporter necessary for γ-HCH utilization exhibit structural divergence, which reflects the phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic relationship of their hosts. Replicon organization and location of the <i>lin</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in the four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es are significantly different with one another, and that most of the specific <i>lin</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s are located on multiple sphingomonad-unique plasmids. Copies of IS<i>6100</i>, the most abundant insertion sequence in the four strains, are often located in close proximity to the specific <i>lin</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. Analysis of the footprints of target duplication upon IS<i>6100</i> transposition and the experimental detection of IS<i>6100</i> transposition strongly suggested that the IS<i>6100</i> transposition has caused dynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e rearrangements and the diversification of <i>lin</i>-flanking regions in the four strains.</p>

Correlation between genome reduction and bacterial growth
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e reduction by removing dispensable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic sequences in bacteria is commonly used in both fundamental and applied studies to determine the minimal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic requirements for a living system or to develop highly efficient bioreactors. Nevertheless, whether and how the accumulative loss of dispensable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic sequences disturbs bacterial growth remains unclear. To investigate the relationship between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e reduction and growth, a series of <i>Escherichia coli</i> strains carrying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es reduced in a stepwise manner were used. Intensive growth analyses revealed that the accumulation of multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic deletions caused decreases in the exponential growth rate and the saturated cell density in a deletion-length-dependent manner as well as gradual changes in the patterns of growth dynamics, regardless of the growth media. Accordingly, a perspective growth model linking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e evolution to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e engineering was proposed. This study provides the first demonstration of a quantitative connection between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic sequence and bacterial growth, indicating that growth rate is potentially associated with dispensable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic sequences.</p>

Lateral Gene Transfer from the Dead
<p>In phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic studies, the evolution of molecular sequences is assumed to have taken place along the phylogeny traced by the ancestors of extant species. In the presence of lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> transfer, however, this may not be the case, because the species lineage from which a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> was transferred may have gone extinct or not have been sampled. Because it is not feasible to specify or reconstruct the complete phylogeny of all species, we must describe the evolution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s outside the represented phylogeny by modeling the speciation dynamics that gave rise to the complete phylogeny. We demonstrate that if the number of sampled species is small compared with the total number of existing species, the overwhelming majority of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> transfers involve speciation to and evolution along extinct or unsampled lineages. We show that the evolution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s along extinct or unsampled lineages can to good approximation be treated as those of independently evolving lineages described by a few global parameters. Using this result, we derive an algorithm to calculate the probability of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> tree and recover the maximum-likelihood reconciliation given the phylogeny of the sampled species. Examining 473 near-universal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families from 36 cyanobacteria, we find that nearly a third of transfer events (28%) appear to have topological signatures of evolution along extinct species, but only approximately 6% of transfers trace their ancestry to before the common ancestor of the sampled cyanobacteria.

The AAA-ATPase MIDASIN 1 Functions in Ribosome Biogenesis and Is Essential for Embryo and Root Development
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>e bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>sis is an orchestrated process that relies on many assembly factors. The AAA-ATPase Midasin 1 (Mdn1) functions as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>e assembly factor in yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>), but the roles of MDN1 in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) are poorly understood. Here, we showed that the Arabidopsis null mutant of <i>MDN1</i> is embryo-lethal. Using the weak mutant <i>mdn1</i>-<i>1</i>, which maintains viability, we found that MDN1 is critical for the regular pattern of auxin maxima in the globular embryo and functions in root meristem maintenance. By detecting the subcellular distribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>e proteins, we noted that <i>mdn1</i>-<i>1</i> impairs nuclear export of the pre-60S <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>al particle. The processing of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>al precusor RNAs, including 35S, 27SB, and 20S, is also affected in this mutant. MDN1 physically interacts with PESCADILLO2 (PES2), an essential assembly factor of the 60S <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>e, and the observed mislocalization of PES2 in <i>mdn1</i>-<i>1</i> further implied that MDN1 plays an indispensable role in 60S <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>e bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>sis. Therefore, the observed hypersensitivity of <i>mdn1</i>-<i>1</i> to a eukaryotic translation inhibitor and high-sugar conditions might be associated with the defect in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>e bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>sis. Overall, this work establishes a role of Arabidopsis MDN1 in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ribosom</span></strong>e bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>sis, which agrees with its roles in embryo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>sis and root development.</p>

The Coiled-Coil NLR <i>Rph1</i>, Confers Leaf Rust Resistance in Barley Cultivar Sudan
<p>Unraveling and exploiting mechanisms of disease resistance in cereal crops is currently limited by their large repeat-rich <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es and the lack of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic recombination or cultivar (cv)-specific sequence information. We cloned the first leaf rust resistance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> <i>Rph1</i> (<i>Rph1</i>.<i>a</i>) from cultivated barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) using “MutChromSeq,” a recently developed molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics tool for the rapid cloning of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in plants. Marker-trait association in the CI 9214/Stirling doubled haploid population mapped <i>Rph1</i> to the short arm of chromosome 2H in a physical region of 1.3 megabases relative to the barley cv Morex reference assembly. A sodium azide mutant population in cv Sudan was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>rated and 10 mutants were confirmed by progeny-testing. Flow-sorted 2H chromosomes from Sudan (wild type) and six of the mutants were sequenced and compared to identify candidate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s for the <i>Rph1</i> locus. MutChromSeq identified a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> candidate encoding a coiled-coil nucleotide binding site Leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptor protein that was altered in three different mutants. Further Sanger sequencing confirmed all three mutations and identified an additional two independent mutations within the same candidate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>. Phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic analysis determined that <i>Rph1</i> clustered separately from all previously cloned NLRs from the Triticeae and displayed highest sequence similarity (89%) with a homolog of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) disease resistance protein 1 protein in <i>Triticum urartu</i>.

RNA Polymerase II Read-Through Promotes Expression of Neighboring Genes in SAL1-PAP-XRN Retrograde Signaling
<p>In plants, the molecular function(s) of the nucleus-localized 5′-3′ EXORIBONUCLEASES (XRNs) are unclear; however, their activity is reported to have a significant effect on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion and SAL1-mediated retrograde signaling. Using parallel analysis of RNA ends, we documented a dramatic increase in uncapped RNA substrates of the XRNs in both <i>sal1</i> and <i>xrn2xrn3</i> mutants. We found that a major consequence of reducing SAL1 or XRN activity was RNA Polymerase II 3′ read-through. This occurred at 72% of expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, demonstrating a major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-wide role for the XRN-torpedo model of transcription termination in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Read-through is speculated to have a negative effect on transcript abundance; however, we did not observe this. Rather, we identified a strong association between read-through and increased transcript abundance of tandemly orientated downstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, strongly correlated with the proximity (less than 1,000 bp) and expression of the upstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>. We observed read-through in the proximity of 903 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s up-regulated in the <i>sal1-8</i> retrograde signaling mutant; thus, this phenomenon may account directly for up to 23% of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s up-regulated in <i>sal1-8</i>. Using <i>APX2</i> and <i>AT5G43770</i> as exemplars, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tically uncoupled read-through loci from downstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s to validate the principle of read-through-mediated mRNA regulation, providing one mechanism by which an ostensibly posttranscriptional exoribonuclease that targets uncapped RNAs could modulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion.</p>

Out of Water: The Origin and Early Diversification of Plant <i>R</i>-Genes
<p>During plant-pathogen interactions, plants use intracellular proteins with nucleotide-binding site and Leu-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) domains to detect pathogens. NBS-LRR proteins represent a major class of plant disease resistance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s (<i>R</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s). Whereas <i>R</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s have been well characterized in angiosperms, little is known about their origin and early diversification. Here, we perform comprehensive evolutionary analyses of <i>R</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in plants and report the identification of <i>R</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in basal-branching streptophytes, including charophytes, liverworts, and mosses. Phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic analyses suggest that plant <i>R</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s originated in charophytes and R-proteins diversified into TIR-NBS-LRR proteins and non-TIR-NBS-LRR proteins in charophytes. Moreover, we show that plant R-proteins evolved in a modular fashion through frequent gain or loss of protein domains. Most of the <i>R</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in basal-branching streptophytes underwent adaptive evolution, indicating an ancient involvement of <i>R</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in plant-pathogen interactions. Our findings provide novel insights into the origin and evolution of <i>R</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s and the mechanisms underlying colonization of terrestrial environments by plants.</p>

FERTILIZATION-INDEPENDENT SEED-Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 Plays a Dual Role in Regulating Type I MADS-Box Genes in Early Endosperm Development
<p>Early endosperm development presents a unique system in which to uncover epi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic regulatory mechanisms because the contributing maternal and paternal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es possess differential epi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic modifications. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the initiation of endosperm coenocytic growth upon fertilization and the transition to endosperm cellularization are regulated by the FERTILIZATION-INDEPENDENT SEED (FIS)-Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), a putative H3K27 methyltransferase. Here, we address the possible role of the FIS-PRC2 complex in regulating the type I MADS-box <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> family, which has been shown previously to regulate early endosperm development. We show that a subclass of type I MADS-box <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s (C2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s) was expressed in distinct domains of the coenocytic endosperm in wild-type seeds. Furthermore, the C2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s were mostly up-regulated biallelically during the extended coenocytic phase of endosperm development in the FIS-PRC2 mutant background. Using allele-specific expression analysis, we also identified a small subset of C2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s subjected to FIS-PRC2-dependent maternal or FIS-PRC2-independent paternal imprinting. Our data support a dual role for the FIS-PRC2 complex in the regulation of C2 type I MADS-box <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, as evidenced by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>ralized role in the repression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion at both alleles associated with endosperm cellularization and a specialized role in silencing the maternal allele of imprinted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s.</p>

Global Analysis of Gene Expression in Response to Whole-Chromosome Aneuploidy in Hexaploid Wheat
<p>Aneuploidy, a condition of unbalanced chromosome content, represents a large-effect mutation that bears significant relevance to human health and microbe adaptation. As such, extensive studies of aneuploidy have been conducted in unicellular model organisms and cancer cells. Aneuploidy also frequently is associated with plant polyploidization, but its impact on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion and its relevance to polyploid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e evolution/functional innovation remain largely unknown. Here, we used a panel of diverse types of whole-chromosome aneuploidy of hexaploid wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>), all under the common <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic background of cv Chinese Spring, to systemically investigate the impact of aneuploidy on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-, sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-, and chromosome-wide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion. Compared with prior findings in haploid or diploid aneuploid systems, we unravel additional and novel features of alteration in global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion resulting from the two major impacts of aneuploidy, cis- and trans-regulation, as well as dosage compensation. We show that the expression-altered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s map evenly along each chromosome, with no evidence for coregulating aggregated expression domains. However, chromosomes and sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es in hexaploid wheat are unequal in their responses to aneuploidy with respect to the number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s being dysregulated. Strikingly, homeologous chromosomes do not differ from nonhomologous chromosomes in terms of aneuploidy-induced trans-acting effects, suggesting that the three constituent sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es of hexaploid wheat are largely uncoupled at the transcriptional level of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> regulation. Together, our findings shed new insights into the functional interplay between homeologous chromosomes and interactions between sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es in hexaploid wheat, which bear implications to further our understanding of allopolyploid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e evolution and efforts in breeding new allopolyploid crops.</p>

Monophyletic Origin and Evolution of the Largest Crucifer Genomes
<p>Clade E, or the <i>Hesperis</i> clade, is one of the major Brassicaceae (Crucifereae) clades, comprising some 48 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>ra and 351 species classified into seven tribes and is distributed predominantly across arid and montane regions of Asia. Several taxa have socioeconomic significance, being important ornamental but also weedy and invasive species. From the comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic perspective, the clade is noteworthy as it harbors species with the largest crucifer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es but low numbers of chromosomes (<i>n</i> = 5–7). By applying comparative cyto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic analysis and whole-chloroplast phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tics, we constructed, to our knowledge, the first partial and complete cyto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic maps for selected representatives of clade E tribes and investigated their relationships in a family-wide context. The <i>Hesperis</i> clade is a well-supported monophyletic lineage comprising seven tribes: Anchonieae, Buniadeae, Chorisporeae, Dontostemoneae, Euclidieae, Hesperideae, and Shehbazieae. The clade diverged from other Brassicaceae crown-group clades during the Oligocene, followed by subsequent Miocene tribal diversifications in central/southwestern Asia. The inferred ancestral karyotype of clade E (CEK; <i>n</i> = 7) originated from an older <i>n</i> = 8 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e, which also was the purported progenitor of tribe Arabideae (KAA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e). In most taxa of clade E, the seven linkage groups of CEK either remained conserved (Chorisporeae) or were reshuffled by chromosomal translocations (Euclidieae). In 50% of Anchonieae and Hesperideae species, the CEK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e has undergone descending dysploidy toward <i>n</i> = 6 (−5). These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic data elucidate early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e evolution in Brassicaceae and pave the way for future whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequencing and assembly efforts in this as yet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ically neglected group of crucifer plants.</p>

Six-Rowed Spike3 (VRS3) Is a Histone Demethylase That Controls Lateral Spikelet Development in Barley
<p>The complex nature of crop <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es has long prohibited the efficient isolation of agronomically relevant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. However, recent advances in next-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>ration sequencing technologies provide new ways to accelerate fine-mapping and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> isolation in crops. We used RNA sequencing of allelic <i>six-rowed spike3</i> (<i>vrs3</i>) mutants with altered spikelet development for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> identification and functional analysis in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>). Variant calling in two allelic <i>vrs3</i> mutants revealed that <i>VRS3</i> encodes a putative histone Lys demethylase with a conserved zinc finger and Jumonji C and N domain. Sanger sequencing of this candidate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> in independent allelic <i>vrs3</i> mutants revealed a series of mutations in conserved domains, thus confirming our candidate as the <i>VRS3</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> and suggesting that the row type in barley is determined epi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tically. Global transcriptional profiling in developing shoot apical meristems of <i>vrs3</i> suggested that VRS3 acts as a transcriptional activator of the row-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s <i>VRS1</i> (<i>Hv.HOMEOBOX1</i>) and <i>INTERMEDIUM-C</i> (<i>INT-C</i>; <i>Hv.TEOSINTE BRANCHED1</i>). Comparative transcriptome analysis of the row-type mutants <i>vrs3</i>, <i>vrs4</i> (<i>Hv.RAMOSA2</i>), and <i>int-c</i> confirmed that all three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s act as transcriptional activators of <i>VRS1</i> and quantitative variation in the expression levels of <i>VRS1</i> in these mutants correlated with differences in the number of developed lateral spikelets. The identification of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s and pathways affecting seed number in small grain cereals will enable to further unravel the transcriptional networks controlling this important yield component.</p>

The Plastid Genome of <i>Polytoma uvella</i> Is the Largest Known among Colorless Algae and Plants and Reflects Contrasting Evolutionary Paths to Nonphotosynthetic Lifestyles
<p>The loss of photosynthesis is frequently associated with parasitic or pathogenic lifestyles, but it also can occur in free-living, plastid-bearing lineages. A common consequence of becoming nonphotosynthetic is the reduction in size and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> content of the plastid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. In exceptional circumstances, it can even result in the complete loss of the plastid DNA (ptDNA) and its associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion system, as reported recently in several lineages, including the nonphotosynthetic green algal genus <i>Polytomella</i>. Closely related to <i>Polytomella</i> is the polyphyletic genus <i>Polytoma</i>, the members of which lost photosynthesis independently of <i>Polytomella</i>. Species from both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>ra are free-living organisms that contain nonphotosynthetic plastids, but unlike <i>Polytomella</i>, <i>Polytoma</i> members have retained a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e in their colorless plastid. Here, we present the plastid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e of <i>Polytoma uvella</i>: to our knowledge, the first report of ptDNA from a nonphotosynthetic chlamydomonadalean alga. The <i>P. uvella</i> ptDNA contains 25 protein-coding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, most of which are related to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion and none are connected to photosynthesis. However, despite its reduced coding capacity, the <i>P. uvella</i> ptDNA is inflated with short repeats and is tens of kilobases larger than the ptDNAs of its closest known photosynthetic relatives, <i>Chlamydomonas leiostraca</i> and <i>Chlamydomonas applanata</i>. In fact, at approximately 230 kb, the ptDNA of <i>P. uvella</i> represents the largest plastid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e currently reported from a nonphotosynthetic alga or plant. Overall, the <i>P. uvella</i> and <i>Polytomella</i> plastid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es reveal two very different evolutionary paths following the loss of photosynthesis: expansion and complete deletion, respectively. We hypothesize that recombination-based DNA-repair mechanisms are at least partially responsible for the different evolutionary outcomes observed in such closely related nonphotosynthetic algae.</p>

The Genomes of Two Bat Species with Long Constant Frequency Echolocation Calls
<p>Bats can perceive the world by using a wide range of sensory systems, and some of the systems have become highly specialized, such as auditory sensory perception. Among bat species, the Old World leaf-nosed bats and horseshoe bats (rhinolophoid bats) possess the most sophisticated echolocation systems. Here, we reported the whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequencing and <i>de novo</i> assembles of two rhinolophoid bats—the great leaf-nosed bat (<i>Hipposideros armiger</i>) and the Chinese rufous horseshoe bat (<i>Rhinolophus sinicus</i>). Comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic analyses revealed the adaptation of auditory sensory perception in the rhinolophoid bat lineages, probably resulting from the extreme selectivity used in the auditory processing by these bats. Pseudogenization of some vision-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in rhinolophoid bats was observed, suggesting that these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s have undergone relaxed natural selection. An extensive contraction of olfactory receptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> repertoires was observed in the lineage leading to the common ancestor of bats. Further extensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> contractions can be observed in the branch leading to the rhinolophoid bats. Such concordance suggested that molecular changes at one sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> might have direct consequences for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s controlling for other sensory modalities. To characterize the population <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic structure and patterns of evolution, we re-sequenced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e of 20 great leaf-nosed bats from four different geographical locations of China. The result showed similar sequence diversity values and little differentiation among populations. Moreover, evidence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic adaptations to high altitudes in the great leaf-nosed bats was observed. Taken together, our work provided a useful resource for future research on the evolution of bats.</p>

Genomic Basis of Adaptive Evolution: The Survival of Amur Ide (<i>Leuciscu</i>s <i>waleckii</i>) in an Extremely Alkaline Environment
<p>The Amur ide (<i>Leuciscus waleckii</i>) is a cyprinid fish that is widely distributed in Northeast Asia. The Lake Dali Nur population inhabits one of the most extreme aquatic environments on Earth, with an alkalinity up to 50 mmol/L (pH 9.6), thus providing an exceptional model with which to characterize the mechanisms of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic evolution underlying adaptation to extreme environments. Here, we developed the reference <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e assembly for <i>L. waleckii</i> from Lake Dali Nur. Intriguingly, we identified unusual expanded long terminal repeats (LTRs) with higher nucleotide substitution rates than in many other teleosts, suggesting their more recent insertion into the <i>L. waleckii</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. We also identified expansions in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s encoding egg coat proteins and natriuretic peptide receptors, possibly underlying the adaptation to extreme environmental stress. We further sequenced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es of 10 additional individuals from freshwater and 18 from Lake Dali Nur populations, and we detected a total of 7.6 million SNPs from both populations. In a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e scan and comparison of these two populations, we identified a set of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic regions under selective sweeps that harbor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s involved in ion homoeostasis, acid-base regulation, unfolded protein response, reactive oxygen species elimination, and urea excretion.

Comparative Genomics of the Pine Pathogens and Beetle Symbionts in the Genus <i>Grosmannia</i>
<p>Studies on beetle/tree fungal symbionts typically characterize the ecological and geographic distributions of the fungal populations. There is limited understanding of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-wide evolutionary processes that act within and between species as such fungi adapt to different environments, leading to physiological differences and reproductive isolation. Here, we assess <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic evidence for such evolutionary processes by extending our recent work on <i>Grosmannia clavigera</i>, which is vectored by the mountain pine beetle and jeffrey pine beetle. We report the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequences of an additional 11 <i>G. clavigera</i> (Gc) sensu lato strains from the two known sibling species, <i>Grosmannia</i> sp. (Gs) and Gc. The 12 fungal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es are structurally similar, showing large-scale synteny within and between species. We identified 103,430 single-nucleotide variations that separated the <i>Grosmannia</i> strains into divergent Gs and Gc clades, and further divided each of these clades into two subclades, one of which may represent an additional species. Comparing variable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s between these lineages, we identified truncated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s and potential pseudo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, as well as seven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that show evidence of positive selection. As these variable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s are involved in secondary metabolism and in detoxifying or utilizing host-tree defense chemicals (e.g., polyketide synthases, oxidoreductases, and mono-oxygenases), their variants may reflect adaptation to the specific chemistries of the host trees <i>Pinus contorta</i>, <i>P. ponderosa</i>, and <i>P. jeffreyi</i>. This work provides a comprehensive resource for developing informative markers for landscape population <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics of these ecologically and economically important fungi, and an approach that could be extended to other beetle–tree-associated fungi.</p>

Evolution of Ancient Functions in the Vertebrate Insulin-Like Growth Factor System Uncovered by Study of Duplicated Salmonid Fish Genomes
<p>Whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e duplication (WGD) was experienced twice by the vertebrate ancestor (2 rounds; 2R), again by the teleost fish ancestor (3R) and most recently in certain teleost lineages (4R). Consequently, vertebrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families are often expanded in 3R and 4R <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. Arguably, many types of “functional divergence” present across 2R <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families will exceed that between 3R/4R paralogs of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s comprising 2R families. Accordingly, 4R offers a form of replication of 2R. Examining whether this concept has implications for molecular evolutionary research, we studied insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding proteins (IGFBPs), whose six 2R family members carry IGF hormones and regulate interactions between IGFs and IGF1-receptors (IGF1Rs). Using phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic approaches, we resolved the complete IGFBP repertoire of 4R-derived salmonid fishes (19 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s; 13 more than human) and established evolutionary relationships/nomenclature with respect to WGDs. Traits central to IGFBP action were determined for all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, including atomic interactions in IGFBP–IGF1/IGF2 complexes regulating IGF–IGF1R binding. Using statistical methods, we demonstrate that attributes of these protein interfaces are overwhelming a product of 2R IGFBP family membership, explain 49–68% of variation in <i>IGFBP</i> mRNA concentration in several different tissues, and strongly predict the strength and direction of <i>IGFBP</i> transcriptional regulation under differing nutritional states. The results support a model where vertebrate IGFBP family members evolved divergent structural attributes to provide distinct competition for IGFs with IGF1Rs, predisposing different functions in the regulation of IGF signaling. Evolution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion then acted to ensure the appropriate physiological production of IGFBPs according to their structural specializations, leading to optimal IGF-signaling according to nutritional-status and the endocrine/local mode of action. This study demonstrates that relatively recent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> family expansion can facilitate inference of functional evolution within ancient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic systems.</p>

To facilitate studies of seaweed biology, we decoded the draft <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e of <i>C. okamuranus</i> S-strain. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e size of <i>C. okamuranus</i> was estimated as ∼140 Mbp, smaller than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es of two other brown algae, <i>Ectocarpus siliculosus</i> and <i>Saccharina japonica</i>. Sequencing with ∼100× coverage yielded an assembly of 541 scaffolds with N50 = 416 kbp. Together with transcriptomic data, we estimated that the <i>C. okamuranus</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e contains 13,640 protein-coding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, approximately 94% of which have been confirmed with corresponding mRNAs. Comparisons with the <i>E. siliculosus</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e identified a set of <i>C. okamuranus</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that encode enzymes involved in biosynthetic pathways for sulfated fucans and alginate biosynthesis. In addition, we identified <i>C. okamuranus</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s for enzymes involved in phlorotannin biosynthesis. The present decoding of the <i>Cladosiphon okamuranus</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e provides a platform for future studies of mozuku biology.</p>

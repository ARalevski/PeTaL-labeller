Right Ventricular Systolic Function in Organic Mitral Regurgitation
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>To assess the prevalence, determinants, and prognosis value of right ventricular (RV) ejection fraction (EF) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ment in organic mitral regurgitation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Two hundred eight patients (62±12 years, 138 males) with chronic organic mitral regurgitation referred to surgery underwent an echocardiography and biventricular radionuclide angiography with regional function assessment. Mean RV EF was 40.4±10.2%, ranging from 10% to 65%. RV EF was severely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ed (≤35%) in 63 patients (30%), and biventricular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ment (left ventricular EF<60% and RV EF≤35%) was found in 34 patients (16%). Pathophysiologic correlates of RV EF were left ventricular septal function (β=0.42, <i>P</i><0.0001), left ventricular end-diastolic diameter index (β=−0.22, <i>P</i>=0.002), and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (β=−0.14, <i>P</i>=0.047). Mitral effective regurgitant orifice size (n=84) influenced RV EF (β=−0.28, <i>P</i>=0.012). In 68 patients examined after surgery, RV EF increased strongly (27.5±4.3–37.9±7.3, <i>P</i><0.0001) in patients with depressed RV EF, whereas it did not change in others (<i>P</i>=0.91). RV EF ≤35% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ed 10-year cardiovascular survival (71.6±8.4% versus 89.8±3.7%, <i>P</i>=0.037). Biventricular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ment dramatically reduced 10-year cardiovascular survival (51.9±15.3% versus 90.3±3.2%, <i>P</i><0.0001; hazard ratio, 5.2; <i>P</i><0.0001) even after adjustment for known predictors (hazard ratio, 4.6; <i>P</i>=0.004). Biventricular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ment reduced also 10-year overall survival (34.8±13.0% versus 72.6±4.5%, <i>P</i>=0.003; hazard ratio, 2.5; <i>P</i>=0.005) even after adjustment for known predictors (<i>P</i>=0.048).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>In patients with organic mitral regurgitation referred to surgery, RV function <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ment is frequent (30%) and depends weakly on pulmonary artery systolic pressure but mainly on left ventricular remodeling and septal function. RV function is a predictor of postoperative cardiovascular survival, whereas biventricular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ment is a powerful predictor of both cardiovascular and overall survival.</p></sec>

PCSK9 Variants, Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol, and Neurocognitive Impairment
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Despite concerns about adverse neurocognitive events raised by prior trials, pharmacological PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9) inhibition was not associated with neurocognitive effects in a recent phase 3 randomized trial. PCSK9 loss-of-function (LOF) variants that result in lifelong exposure to lower levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol can provide information on the potential long-term effects of lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol on neurocognitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ment and decline.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We investigated the association between PCSK9 LOF variants and neurocognitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ment and decline among black REGARDS study (Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke) participants with (n=241) and without (n=10 454) C697X or Y142X LOF variants. Neurocognitive tests included the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease (CERAD) battery (Word List Learning, World List Delayed Recall, Semantic Animal Fluency) and Six-Item Screener (SIS) assessments, administered longitudinally during follow-up. Neurocognitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ment was defined as a score ≥1.5 SD below age, sex, and education-based stratum-specific means on 2 or 3 CERAD assessments or, separately, a score <5 on any SIS assessment at baseline or during follow-up.

Adjusted odds ratios for neurocognitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ment for participants with versus without PCSK9 LOF variants were 1.11 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58–2.13) using the CERAD battery and 0.89 (95% CI, 0.61–1.30) using the SIS assessment. Standardized average differences in individual neurocognitive assessment scores over the 5.6-year (range, 0.1–9.1) study period ranged between 0.07 (95% CI, −0.06 to 0.20) and −0.07 (95% CI, −0.18 to 0.05) among participants with versus without PCSK9 LOF variants. Patterns of neurocognitive decline were similar between participants with and without PCSK9 LOF variants (all <i>P</i>>0.10). Odds ratios for neurocognitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ment per 20 mg/dL low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decrements were 1.02 (95% CI, 0.96–1.08) and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.95–1.02) for the CERAD and SIS definitions of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ment, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These results suggest that lifelong exposure to low PCSK9 levels and cumulative exposure to lower levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol are not associated with neurocognitive effects in blacks.</p></sec>

Quantum correlations from a room-temperature optomechanical cavity
<p>The act of position measurement alters the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> of an object being measured. This quantum measurement backaction is typically much smaller than the thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> of a room-temperature object and thus difficult to observe. By shining laser light through a nanomechanical beam, we measure the beam’s thermally driven vibrations and perturb its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> with optical force fluctuations at a level dictated by the Heisenberg measurement-disturbance uncertainty relation. We demonstrate a cross-correlation technique to distinguish optically driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> from thermally driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong>, observing this quantum backaction signature up to room temperature. We use the scale of the quantum correlations, which is determined by fundamental constants, to gauge the size of thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong>, demonstrating a path toward absolute thermometry with quantum mechanically calibrated ticks.</p>

High-Sensitivity Cardiac Troponin and the Risk Stratification of Patients With Renal Impairment Presenting With Suspected Acute Coronary Syndrome
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>High-sensitivity cardiac troponin testing may improve the risk stratification and diagnosis of myocardial infarction, but concentrations can be challenging to interpret in patients with renal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ment, and the effectiveness of testing in this group is uncertain.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a prospective multicenter study of consecutive patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome, we evaluated the performance of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I in those with and without renal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ment (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>). The negative predictive value and sensitivity of troponin concentrations below the risk stratification threshold (5 ng/L) at presentation were reported for a primary outcome of index type 1 myocardial infarction, or type 1 myocardial infarction or cardiac death at 30 days. The positive predictive value and specificity at the 99th centile diagnostic threshold (16 ng/L in women, 34 ng/L in men) was determined for index type 1 myocardial infarction.

K63-linked polyubiquitin chains bind to DNA to facilitate DNA damage repair
<p>Polyubiquitylation is canonically viewed as a posttranslational modification that governs protein stability or protein-protein interactions, in which distinct polyubiquitin linkages ultimately determine the fate of modified protein(s). We explored whether polyubiquitin chains have any nonprotein-related function. Using in vitro pull-down assays with synthetic materials, we found that polyubiquitin chains with the Lys<sup>63</sup> (K63) linkage bound to DNA through a motif we called the “DNA-interacting patch” (DIP), which is composed of the adjacent residues Thr<sup>9</sup>, Lys<sup>11</sup>, and Glu<sup>34</sup>. Upon DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e, the binding of K63-linked polyubiquitin chains to DNA enhanced the recruitment of repair factors through their interaction with an Ile<sup>44</sup> patch in ubiquitin to facilitate DNA repair. Furthermore, experimental or cancer patient–derived mutations within the DIP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ed the DNA binding capacity of ubiquitin and subsequently attenuated K63-linked polyubiquitin chain accumulation at sites of DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e, thereby resulting in defective DNA repair and increased cellular sensitivity to DNA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>ing agents. Our results therefore highlight a critical physiological role for K63-linked polyubiquitin chains in binding to DNA to facilitate DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e repair.</p>

ATM directs DNA damage responses and proteostasis via genetically separable pathways
<p>The protein kinase ATM is a master regulator of the DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e response but also responds directly to oxidative stress. Loss of ATM causes ataxia telangiectasia, a neurodegenerative disorder with pleiotropic symptoms that include cerebellar dysfunction, cancer, diabetes, and premature aging. We genetically separated the activation of ATM by DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e from that by oxidative stress using separation-of-function mutations. We found that deficient activation of ATM by the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex and DNA double-strand breaks resulted in loss of cell viability, checkpoint activation, and DNA end resection in response to DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e. In contrast, loss of oxidative activation of ATM had minimal effects on DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e–related outcomes but blocked ATM-mediated initiation of checkpoint responses after oxidative stress and resulted in deficiencies in mitochondrial function and autophagy. In addition, expression of a variant ATM incapable of activation by oxidative stress resulted in widespread protein aggregation. These results indicate a direct relationship between the mechanism of ATM activation and its effects on cellular metabolism and DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e responses in human cells and implicate ATM in the control of protein homeostasis.</p>

Estimating economic damage from climate change in the United States
<p>Estimates of climate change <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e are central to the design of climate policies. Here, we develop a flexible architecture for computing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>es that integrates climate science, econometric analyses, and process models. We use this approach to construct spatially explicit, probabilistic, and empirically derived estimates of economic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e in the United States from climate change. The combined value of market and nonmarket <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e across analyzed sectors—agriculture, crime, coastal storms, energy, human mortality, and labor—increases quadratically in global mean temperature, costing roughly 1.2% of gross domestic product per +1°C on average. Importantly, risk is distributed unequally across locations, generating a large transfer of value northward and westward that increases economic inequality. By the late 21st century, the poorest third of counties are projected to experience <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>es between 2 and 20% of county income (90% chance) under business-as-usual emissions (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5).</p>

Locked synchronous rotor motion in a molecular motor
<p>Biological molecular motors translate their local directional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> into ordered movement of other parts of the system to empower controlled mechanical functions. The design of analogous geared systems that couple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> in a directional manner, which is pivotal for molecular machinery operating at the nanoscale, remains highly challenging. Here, we report a molecular rotary motor that translates light-driven unidirectional rotary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> to controlled movement of a connected biaryl rotor. Achieving coupled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> of the distinct parts of this multicomponent mechanical system required precise control of multiple kinetic barriers for isomerization and synchronous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong>, resulting in sliding and rotation during a full rotary cycle, with the motor always facing the same face of the rotor.</p>

Function of the Plant DNA Polymerase Epsilon in Replicative Stress Sensing, a Genetic Analysis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Faithful transmission of the genetic information is essential in all living organisms. DNA replication is therefore a critical step of cell proliferation, because of the potential occurrence of replication errors or DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e when progression of a replication fork is hampered causing replicative stress. Like other types of DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e, replicative stress activates the DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e response, a signaling cascade allowing cell cycle arrest and repair of lesions. The replicative DNA polymerase ε (Pol ε) was shown to activate the S-phase checkpoint in yeast in response to replicative stress, but whether this mechanism functions in multicellular eukaryotes remains unclear. Here, we explored the genetic interaction between Pol ε and the main elements of the DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e response in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We found that mutations affecting the polymerase domain of Pol ε trigger ATR-dependent signaling leading to SOG1 activation, WEE1-dependent cell cycle inhibition, and tolerance to replicative stress induced by hydroxyurea, but result in enhanced sensitivity to a wide range of DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>ing agents. Using knock-down lines, we also provide evidence for the direct role of Pol ε in replicative stress sensing. Together, our results demonstrate that the role of Pol ε in replicative stress sensing is conserved in plants, and provide, to our knowledge, the first genetic dissection of the downstream signaling events in a multicellular eukaryote.</p>

Recovery of otoacoustic emissions after high-level noise exposure in the American bullfrog
<p>The American bullfrog (<i>Rana catesbeiana</i>) has an amphibian papilla (AP) that senses airborne, low-frequency sound and generates distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) similar to other vertebrate species. Although ranid frogs are typically found in noisy environments, the effects of noise on the AP have not been studied. First, we determined the noise levels that diminished DPOAE at 2<i>f</i><sub>1</sub>–<i>f</i><sub>2</sub> using an <i>f</i><sub>2</sub> stimulus level at 80 dB SPL and that also produced morphological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e of the sensory epithelium. Second, we compared DPOAE (2<i>f</i><sub>1</sub>–<i>f</i><sub>2</sub>) responses with histopathologic changes occurring in bullfrogs after noise exposure. Consistent morphological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e, such as fragmented hair cells and missing bundles, as well as elimination of DPOAE responses were seen only after very high-level (>150 dB SPL) sound exposures. The morphological response of hair cells to noise differed along the mediolateral AP axis: medial hair cells were sensitive to noise and lateral hair cells were relatively insensitive to noise. Renewed or repaired hair cells were not observed until 9 days post-exposure. Following noise exposure, DPOAE responses disappeared within 24 h and then recovered to normal pre-exposure levels within 3–4 days. Our results suggest that DPOAEs in the bullfrog are sensitive to the initial period of hair cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e. After noise-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e, the bullfrog AP has functional recovery mechanisms that do not depend on substantial hair cell regeneration or repair. Thus, the bullfrog auditory system might serve as an interesting model for investigation of ways to prevent noise <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e.</p>

Role of insulin signaling impairment, adiponectin and dyslipidemia in peripheral and central neuropathy in mice
<p>One of the tissues or organs affected by diabetes is the nervous system, predominantly the peripheral system (peripheral polyneuropathy and/or painful peripheral neuropathy) but also the central system with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ed learning, memory and mental flexibility. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the pre-diabetic or diabetic condition caused by a high-fat diet (HFD) can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e both the peripheral and central nervous systems. Groups of C57BL6 and Swiss Webster mice were fed a diet containing 60% fat for 8 months and compared to control and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic groups that were fed a standard diet containing 10% fat. Aspects of peripheral nerve function (conduction velocity, thermal sensitivity) and central nervous system function (learning ability, memory) were measured at assorted times during the study. Both strains of mice on HFD developed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ed glucose tolerance, indicative of insulin resistance, but only the C57BL6 mice showed statistically significant hyperglycemia. STZ-diabetic C57BL6 mice developed learning deficits in the Barnes maze after 8 weeks of diabetes, whereas neither C57BL6 nor Swiss Webster mice fed a HFD showed signs of defects at that time point. By 6 months on HFD, Swiss Webster mice developed learning and memory deficits in the Barnes maze test, whereas their peripheral nervous system remained normal. In contrast, C57BL6 mice fed the HFD developed peripheral nerve dysfunction, as indicated by nerve conduction slowing and thermal hyperalgesia, but showed normal learning and memory functions. Our data indicate that STZ-induced diabetes or a HFD can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e both peripheral and central nervous systems, but learning deficits develop more rapidly in insulin-deficient than in insulin-resistant conditions and only in Swiss Webster mice. In addition to insulin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ment, dyslipidemia or adiponectinemia might determine the neuropathy phenotype.</p>

Integrated Noninvasive Physiological Assessment of Coronary Circulatory Function and Impact on Cardiovascular Mortality in Patients With Stable Coronary Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>It is suggested that the integration of maximal myocardial blood flow (MBF) and coronary flow reserve (CFR), termed coronary flow capacity, allows for comprehensive evaluation of patients with known or suspected stable coronary artery disease. Because management decisions are predicated on clinical risk, we sought to determine the independent and integrated value of maximal MBF and CFR for predicting cardiovascular death.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>MBF and CFR were quantified in 4029 consecutive patients (median age 66 years, 50.5% women) referred for rest/stress myocardial perfusion positron emission tomography scans from January 2006 to December 2013. The primary outcome was cardiovascular mortality. Maximal MBF <1.8 mL·g<sup>−1</sup>·min<sup>−1</sup> and CFR<2 were considered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ed. Four patient groups were identified based on the concordant or discordant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ment of maximal MBF or CFR.

In univariable analyses, patients with concordant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ment of CFR and maximal MBF had high cardiovascular mortality of 3.3% (95% CI, 2.9–3.7) per year.

Patients with preserved CFR but <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ed maximal MBF had low cardiovascular mortality of 0.9% (95% CI, 0.6–1.6) per year. Patients with concordantly preserved CFR and maximal MBF had the lowest cardiovascular mortality of 0.4% (95 CI, 0.3–0.6) per year.

Cell structural changes in the mesophyll of Norway spruce needles by elevated ozone and elevated temperature in open-field exposure during cold acclimation
<p>The effects of elevated ozone (1.4× ambient) and temperature (ambient +1.3 °C) alone and in combination were studied on the needle cell structure of soil-grown Norway spruce seedlings in the late growing season and winter. Temperature treatment continued over winter and lengthened the snow-free period. Elevated temperature caused microscopic changes related to photosynthesis (decreased chloroplast size and increased number), carbon storage (reduced starch and increased cytoplasmic lipids) and defence (decreased mitochondrial size and proportion per cytoplasm, increased peroxisomes and plastoglobuli, altered appearance of tannins). The results suggest increased oxidative stress by elevated temperature and altered allocation of limited carbon reserve to defence. The number of peroxisomes and plastoglobuli remained high in the outer cells of needles of ozone-exposed seedlings but decreased in the inner cells. This may indicate defence allocation to cells close to the stomata and surface, which are experiencing more oxidative stress. Ozone reduced winter hardiness based on seasonal changes in chloroplast shape and location in the cells. The effects of ozone became evident at the end of the growing season, indicating the effect of cumulative ozone dose or that the seedlings were vulnerable to ozone at the later phases of winter hardening. Elevated temperature increased cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e in early winter and visible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e in spring, and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e was enhanced by ozone. In conclusion, the study suggests that modest air temperature elevation increases stress at the cell structural level in spruce seedlings and is enhanced by low ozone elevation. Future climatic conditions where snow cover is formed later or is lacking but temperatures are low can increase the risk of severe seedling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e, and current and future predicted ozone concentrations increase this risk.</p>

Modeling chemotherapy-induced stress to identify rational combination therapies in the DNA damage response pathway
<p>Cells respond to DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e by activating complex signaling networks that decide cell fate, promoting not only DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e repair and survival but also cell death. We have developed a multiscale computational model that quantitatively links chemotherapy-induced DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e response signaling to cell fate. The computational model was trained and calibrated on extensive data from U2OS osteosarcoma cells, including the cell cycle distribution of the initial cell population, signaling data measured by Western blotting, and cell fate data in response to chemotherapy treatment measured by time-lapse microscopy. The resulting mechanistic model predicted the cellular responses to chemotherapy alone and in combination with targeted inhibitors of the DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e response pathway, which we confirmed experimentally. Computational models such as the one presented here can be used to understand the molecular basis that defines the complex interplay between cell survival and cell death and to rationally identify chemotherapy-potentiating drug combinations.</p>

Mitochondrial redox sensing by the kinase ATM maintains cellular antioxidant capacity
<p>Mitochondria are integral to cellular energy metabolism and ATP production and are involved in regulating many cellular processes. Mitochondria produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), which not only can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e cellular components but also participate in signal transduction. The kinase ATM, which is mutated in the neurodegenerative, autosomal recessive disease ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), is a key player in the nuclear DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e response. However, ATM also performs a redox-sensing function mediated through formation of ROS-dependent disulfide-linked dimers. We found that mitochondria-derived hydrogen peroxide promoted ATM dimerization. In HeLa cells, ATM dimers were localized to the nucleus and inhibited by the redox regulatory protein thioredoxin 1 (TRX1), suggesting the existence of a ROS-mediated, stress-signaling relay from mitochondria to the nucleus. ATM dimer formation did not affect its association with chromatin in the absence or presence of nuclear DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e, consistent with the separation of its redox and DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e signaling functions. Comparative analysis of U2OS cells expressing either wild-type ATM or the redox sensing–deficient C2991L mutant revealed that one function of ATM redox sensing is to promote glucose flux through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) by increasing the abundance and activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), thereby increasing cellular antioxidant capacity. The PPP produces the coenzyme NADPH needed for a robust antioxidant response, including the regeneration of TRX1, indicating the existence of a regulatory feedback loop involving ATM and TRX1. We propose that loss of the mitochondrial ROS-sensing function of ATM may cause cellular ROS accumulation and oxidative stress in A-T.</p>

Altered homeostasis and development of regulatory T cell subsets represent an IL-2R–dependent risk for diabetes in NOD mice
<p>The cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2) is critical for the functions of regulatory T cells (T<sub>regs</sub>). The contribution of polymorphisms in the gene encoding the IL-2 receptor α subunit (<i>IL2RA</i>), which are associated with type 1 diabetes, is difficult to determine because autoimmunity depends on variations in multiple genes, where the contribution of any one gene product is small. We investigated the mechanisms whereby a modest reduction in IL-2R signaling selectively in T lymphocytes influenced the development of diabetes in the NOD mouse model. The sensitivity of IL-2R signaling was reduced by about two- to threefold in T<sub>regs</sub> from mice that coexpressed wild-type IL-2Rβ and a mutant subunit (IL-2Rβ<sup>Y3</sup>) with reduced signaling (designated NOD-Y3). Male and female NOD-Y3 mice exhibited accelerated diabetes onset due to intrinsic effects on multiple activities in T<sub>regs</sub>. Bone marrow chimera and adoptive transfer experiments demonstrated that IL-2Rβ<sup>Y3</sup> T<sub>regs</sub> resulted in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ed homeostasis of lymphoid-residing central T<sub>regs</sub> and inefficient development of highly activated effector T<sub>regs</sub> and that they were less suppressive. Pancreatic IL-2Rβ<sup>Y3</sup> T<sub>regs</sub> showed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ed development into IL-10–secreting effector T<sub>regs</sub>. The pancreatic lymph nodes and pancreases of NOD-Y3 mice had increased numbers of antigen-experienced CD4<sup>+</sup> effector T cells, which was largely due to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ed T<sub>regs</sub>, because adoptively transferred pancreatic autoantigen–specific CD4<sup>+</sup> Foxp3<sup>−</sup> T cells from NOD-Y3 mice did not accelerate diabetes in NOD.SCID recipients. Our study indicates that the primary defect associated with chronic, mildly reduced IL-2R signaling is due to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ed T<sub>regs</sub> that cannot effectively produce and maintain highly functional tissue-seeking effector T<sub>reg</sub> subsets.</p>

Aberrant Rac1-cofilin signaling mediates defects in dendritic spines, synaptic function, and sensory perception in fragile X syndrome
<p>Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disabilities and a leading cause of autism. FXS is caused by a trinucleotide expansion in the gene <i>FMR1</i> on the X chromosome. The neuroanatomical hallmark of FXS is an overabundance of immature dendritic spines, a factor thought to underlie synaptic dysfunction and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ed cognition. We showed that aberrantly increased activity of the Rho GTPase Rac1 inhibited the actin-depolymerizing factor cofilin, a major determinant of dendritic spine structure, and caused disease-associated spine abnormalities in the somatosensory cortex of FXS model mice. Increased cofilin phosphorylation and actin polymerization coincided with abnormal dendritic spines and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ed synaptic maturation. Viral delivery of a constitutively active cofilin mutant (cofilinS3A) into the somatosensory cortex of <i>Fmr1</i>-deficient mice rescued the immature dendritic spine phenotype and increased spine density. Inhibition of the Rac1 effector PAK1 with a small-molecule inhibitor rescued cofilin signaling in FXS mice, indicating a causal relationship between PAK1 and cofilin signaling. PAK1 inhibition rescued synaptic signaling (specifically the synaptic ratio of NMDA/AMPA in layer V pyramidal neurons) and improved sensory processing in FXS mice. These findings suggest a causal relationship between increased Rac1-cofilin signaling, synaptic defects, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ed sensory processing in FXS and uncover a previously unappreciated role for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ed Rac1-cofilin signaling in the aberrant spine morphology and spine density associated with FXS.</p>

DNGR-1 in dendritic cells limits tissue damage by dampening neutrophil recruitment
<p>Host injury triggers feedback mechanisms that limit tissue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e. Conventional type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1s) express dendritic cell natural killer lectin group receptor-1 (DNGR-1), encoded by the gene <i>Clec9a</i>, which senses tissue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e and favors cross-presentation of dead-cell material to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Here we find that DNGR-1 additionally reduces host-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>ing inflammatory responses induced by sterile and infectious tissue injury in mice. DNGR-1 deficiency leads to exacerbated caerulein-induced necrotizing pancreatitis and increased pathology during systemic <i>Candida albicans</i> infection without affecting fungal burden. This effect is B and T cell–independent and attributable to increased neutrophilia in DNGR-1–deficient settings. Mechanistically, DNGR-1 engagement activates SHP-1 and inhibits MIP-2 (encoded by <i>Cxcl2</i>) production by cDC1s during <i>Candida</i> infection. This consequently restrains neutrophil recruitment and promotes disease tolerance. Thus, DNGR-1–mediated sensing of injury by cDC1s serves as a rheostat for the control of tissue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e, innate immunity, and immunopathology.</p>

Key-and-lock commodity self-healing copolymers
<p>Self-healing materials are notable for their ability to recover from physical or chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e. We report that commodity copolymers, such as poly(methyl methacrylate)/n-butyl acrylate [p(MMA/nBA)] and their derivatives, can self-heal upon mechanical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e. This behavior occurs in a narrow compositional range for copolymer topologies that are preferentially alternating with a random component (alternating/random) and is attributed to favorable interchain van der Waals forces forming key-and-lock interchain junctions. The use of van der Waals forces instead of supramolecular or covalent rebonding or encapsulated reactants eliminates chemical and physical alterations and enables multiple recovery upon mechanical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e without external intervention.

Triggered recruitment of ESCRT machinery promotes endolysosomal repair
<p>Endolysosomes can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>ed by diverse materials. Terminally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>ed compartments are degraded by lysophagy, but pathways that repair salvageable organelles are poorly understood. Here we found that the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery, known to mediate budding and fission on endolysosomes, also plays an essential role in their repair. ESCRTs were rapidly recruited to acutely injured endolysosomes through a pathway requiring calcium and ESCRT-activating factors that was independent of lysophagy. We used live-cell imaging to demonstrate that ESCRTs responded to small perforations in endolysosomal membranes and enabled compartments to recover from limited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e. Silica crystals that disrupted endolysosomes also triggered ESCRT recruitment.

Hawkmoths use nectar sugar to reduce oxidative damage from flight

SUPPRESSOR OF GAMMA RESPONSE1 Links DNA Damage Response to Organ Regeneration
<p>In Arabidopsis, DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e-induced programmed cell death is limited to the meristematic stem cell niche and its early descendants. The significance of this cell-type-specific programmed cell death is unclear.

In contrast to wild-type plants, <i>sog1</i> plants, which are defective in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e-induced programmed cell death, maintain the cell identities and stereotypical structure of the stem cell niche after irradiation, but these cells fail to undergo cell division, terminating root growth.

High basal metabolic rate does not elevate oxidative stress during reproduction in laboratory mice
<p>Increased oxidative stress (OS) has been suggested as a physiological cost of reproduction. However, previous studies reported ambiguous results, with some even showing a reduction of oxidative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e during reproduction. We tested whether the link between reproduction and OS is mediated by basal metabolic rate (BMR), which has been hypothesized to affect both the rate of radical oxygen species production and antioxidative capacity. We studied the effect of reproduction on OS in females of laboratory mice divergently selected for high (H-BMR) and low (L-BMR) BMR, previously shown to differ with respect to parental investment. Non-reproducing L-BMR females showed higher oxidative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e to lipids (quantified as the level of malondialdehyde in internal organ tissues) and DNA (quantified as the level of 8-oxodG in blood serum) than H-BMR females. Reproduction did not affect oxidative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e to lipids in either line; however, it reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e to DNA in L-BMR females. Reproduction increased catalase activity in liver (significantly stronger in L-BMR females) and decreased it in kidneys. We conclude that the effect of reproduction on OS depends on the initial variation in BMR and varies between studied internal organs and markers of OS.</p>

Differential effects of vitamins E and C and carotenoids on growth, resistance to oxidative stress, fledging success and plumage colouration in wild great tits
<p>Oxidative stress is the imbalance between the production of reactive species and antioxidants, which causes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e to lipids, proteins and DNA. Antioxidants, like vitamins and carotenoids, can limit oxidative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e and can therefore regulate the trade-off between growth, which is a period of high reactive species production, and self-maintenance. However, the role of carotenoids as antioxidants <i>in vivo</i> has been debated, and it has been suggested that carotenoid-based signals indicate the availability of non-pigmentary antioxidants (e.g. vitamins) that protect carotenoids from oxidation, known as the ‘protection hypothesis’. To evaluate the importance of vitamins versus carotenoids as antioxidants during growth and to test the protection hypothesis, we supplemented nestling great tits, <i>Parus major</i>, 3, 5 and 7 days after hatching with a single dose of carotenoids and/or vitamins in a 2×2 full-factorial design. We subsequently measured body condition, antioxidant capacity, oxidative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e, fledging success and plumage reflectance. Vitamins enhanced antioxidant capacity, but did not affect oxidative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e. Vitamin-treated nestlings had higher growth rates and higher probability of fledging. In contrast, carotenoids did not affect any of these traits. Furthermore, carotenoid-based colouration increased over the breeding season in nestlings that received vitamins only. This study shows that vitamins are limiting for growth rate and fledging success, and suggests that vitamins could regulate the trade-off between growth and self-maintenance in favour of the former. Moreover, our results are consistent with the idea that carotenoids are minor antioxidants in birds, but they do not support the protection hypothesis.</p>

Diversity, Disparity, and Evolutionary Rate Estimation for Unresolved Yule Trees
<p>The branching structure of biological evolution confers statistical dependencies on phenotypic trait values in related organisms. For this reason, comparative macroevolutionary studies usually begin with an inferred phylogeny that describes the evolutionary relationships of the organisms of interest. The probability of the observed trait data can be computed by assuming a model for trait evolution, such as Brownian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong>, over the branches of this fixed tree. However, the phylogenetic tree itself contributes statistical uncertainty to estimates of rates of phenotypic evolution, and many comparative evolutionary biologists regard the tree as a nuisance parameter. In this article, we present a framework for analytically integrating over unknown phylogenetic trees in comparative evolutionary studies by assuming that the tree arises from a continuous-time Markov branching model called the Yule process. To do this, we derive a closed-form expression for the distribution of phylogenetic diversity (PD), which is the sum of branch lengths connecting the species in a clade. We then present a generalization of PD which is equivalent to the expected trait disparity in a set of taxa whose evolutionary relationships are generated by a Yule process and whose traits evolve by Brownian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong>. We find expressions for the distribution of expected trait disparity under a Yule tree. Given one or more observations of trait disparity in a clade, we perform fast likelihood-based estimation of the Brownian variance for unresolved clades. Our method does not require simulation or a fixed phylogenetic tree. We conclude with a brief example illustrating Brownian rate estimation for 12 families in the mammalian order Carnivora, in which the phylogenetic tree for each family is unresolved.

Inflammation, necrosis, and the kinase RIP3 are key mediators of AAG-dependent alkylation-induced retinal degeneration
<p>DNA-alkylating agents are commonly used to kill cancer cells, but the base excision repair (BER) pathway they trigger can also produce toxic intermediates that cause tissue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e, such as retinal degeneration (RD). Apoptosis, a process of programmed cell death, is assumed to be the main mechanism of this alkylation-induced photoreceptor (PR) cell death in RD.

Male mice exposed to a methylating agent exhibited a reduced number of PR cell rows, active gliosis, and cytokine induction and macrophage infiltration in the retina. Dying PRs exhibited a necrotic morphology, increased 8-hydroxyguanosine abundance (an oxidative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e marker), and overexpression of the necroptosis-associated genes <i>Rip1</i> and <i>Rip3</i>. The activity of PARP1, which mediates BER, cell death, and inflammation, was increased in PR cells and associated with the release of proinflammatory chemokine HMGB1 from PR nuclei. Mice lacking the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 exhibited more severe RD, whereas deficiency of RIP3 (also known as RIPK3) conferred partial protection. Female mice were partially protected from alkylation-induced RD, showing reduced necroptosis and inflammation compared to males. PRs in mice lacking the BER-initiating DNA glycosylase AAG did not exhibit alkylation-induced necroptosis or inflammation. Our findings show that AAG-initiated BER at alkylated DNA bases induces sex-dependent RD primarily by triggering necroptosis and activating an inflammatory response that amplifies the original <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e and, furthermore, reveal new potential targets to prevent this side effect of chemotherapy.</p>

A posttranslational modification code for CFTR maturation is altered in cystic fibrosis
<p>The multistep process regulating the maturation of membrane proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the secretory pathway is disrupted in many protein misfolding disorders. Mutations in the ion channel CFTR that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong> its folding and subsequent localization to the plasma membrane cause cystic fibrosis (CF), an inherited and eventually lethal disease that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>s the function of multiple organs, mostly the lungs. Here, we found that proper maturation of CFTR is dependent on cross-talk between phosphorylation and methylation events in the regulatory insertion (RI) element of the protein. Manipulating these posttranslational modifications (PTMs) prevented the maturation of wild-type CFTR and instead induced its degradation by ER quality control systems. Deletion of Phe<sup>508</sup> (ΔF508), the most prevalent mutation in CF, and other mutations in CFTR that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong> its trafficking, such as N1303K, also led to quantitative and qualitative PTM changes that prevented the maturation of misfolded CFTR. Further analysis revealed that a wild-type CFTR–like PTM pattern and function was restored in ΔF508 CFTR when cells were cultured at 28°C but only in the presence of the kinase CK2α. Furthermore, the ability to replicate this PTM pattern predicted the efficacy of treatments in restoring ΔF508 CFTR activity. Accordingly, evaluation of patient information revealed that point mutations of several of the modification sites are associated with clinical CF. These findings identify a minimal quantitative and qualitative PTM code for CFTR maturation that distinguishes correctly folded from misfolded CFTR.</p>

Nuclear PTEN enhances the maturation of a microRNA regulon to limit MyD88-dependent susceptibility to sepsis
<p>Sepsis-induced organ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e is caused by systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), which results in substantial comorbidities. Therefore, it is of medical importance to identify molecular brakes that can be exploited to dampen inflammation and prevent the development of SIRS. We investigated the role of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) in suppressing SIRS, increasing microbial clearance, and preventing lung <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e. Septic patients and mice with sepsis exhibited increased <i>PTEN</i> expression in leukocytes. Myeloid-specific <i>Pten</i> deletion in an animal model of sepsis increased bacterial loads and cytokine production, which depended on enhanced myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) abundance and resulted in mortality. PTEN-mediated induction of the microRNAs (miRNAs) miR125b and miR203b reduced the abundance of MyD88. Loss- and gain-of-function assays demonstrated that PTEN induced miRNA production by associating with and facilitating the nuclear localization of Drosha-Dgcr8, part of the miRNA-processing complex. Reconstitution of PTEN-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts with a mutant form of PTEN that does not localize to the nucleus resulted in retention of Drosha-Dgcr8 in the cytoplasm and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ed production of mature miRNAs. Thus, we identified a regulatory pathway involving nuclear PTEN–mediated miRNA generation that limits the production of MyD88 and thereby limits sepsis-associated mortality.</p>

p53 dynamics in response to DNA damage vary across cell lines and are shaped by efficiency of DNA repair and activity of the kinase ATM
<p>Cellular systems show a wide range of signaling dynamics. Many of these dynamics are highly stereotyped, such as oscillations at a fixed frequency. However, most studies looking at the role of signaling dynamics focus on one or a few cell lines, leaving the diversity of dynamics across tissues or cell lines a largely unexplored question. We focused on the dynamics of the tumor suppressor protein p53, which regulates cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e. We established live-cell reporters for 12 cancer cell lines expressing wild-type p53 and quantified p53 dynamics in response to double-strand break–inducing DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e. In many of the tested cell lines, we found that p53 abundance oscillated in response to ionizing radiation or the DNA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>ing chemotherapeutic neocarzinostatin and that the periodicity of the oscillations was fixed. In other cell lines, p53 abundance dynamically changed in different ways, such as a single broad pulse or a continuous induction. By combining single-cell assays of p53 signaling dynamics, small-molecule screening in live cells, and mathematical modeling, we identified molecules that perturbed p53 dynamics and determined that cell-specific variation in the efficiency of DNA repair and the activity of the kinase ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) controlled the signaling landscape of p53 dynamics. Because the dynamics of wild-type p53 varied substantially between cell lines, our study highlights the limitation of using one line as a model system and emphasizes the importance of studying the dynamics of other signaling pathways across different cell lines and genetic backgrounds.</p>

We establish that speed information propagates over system-spanning scales through polarized crowds, whereas orientational fluctuations are locally suppressed.

A target to suppress inflammation
<p>Tissues that are stressed by injury or by invading pathogens elicit signals for the recruitment of inflammatory immune cells such as macrophages and neutrophils, which consequently release reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) as part of the innate immune response (<i>1</i>). This flood of RONS is important for directly attacking invading pathogens and for warding off infection of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>ed tissue. But the efficiency of RONS in inactivating invading cells and viruses creates an Achilles heel of the innate immune response, namely that RONS are also able to kill and mutate cells in healthy tissues. Although inflammatory responses are usually counterbalanced over time by an opposing anti-inflammatory response, achieving the optimal balance with minimal collateral tissue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e is difficult even in healthy individuals, and virtually impossible in individuals with certain disease conditions such as ulcerative colitis and rheumatoid arthritis (<i>2</i>). Therefore, the development of anti-inflammatory drugs, targeting inflammation from a variety of different angles, has flourished in recent decades. On page 834 of this issue, Visnes <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) present an entirely new approach to suppressing the inflammatory response. Counter-intuitively, this approach involves the inhibition of the 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 (OGG1) DNA repair enzyme that recognizes and initiates the base excision repair of 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG), one of the major types of DNA base <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e induced by RONS.</p>

Although remyelination occurs efficiently in young individuals, this restorative process proceeds less well with age (<i>2</i>). Inefficient remyelination results in axonal loss and progressive worsening of neurological symptoms.

Nuclear Prohibitin3 Maintains Genome Integrity and Cell Proliferation in the Root Meristem through Minichromosome Maintenance 2
<p>The nucleo-mitochondrial dual-localized proteins can act as gene expression regulators; however, few instances of these proteins have been described in plants. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) PROHIBITIN 3 (PHB3) is involved in stress responses and developmental processes, but it is unknown how these roles are achieved at the molecular level in the nucleus. In this study, we show that nucleo-mitochondrial PHB3 plays an essential role in regulating genome stability and cell proliferation. <i>PHB3</i> is up-regulated by DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e agents, and the stress-induced PHB3 proteins accumulate in the nucleus. Loss of function of <i>PHB3</i> results in DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e and defective maintenance of the root stem cell niche. Subsequently, the expression patterns and levels of the root stem cell regulators are altered and down-regulated, respectively. In addition, the <i>phb3</i> mutant shows aberrant cell division and altered expression of cell cycle–related genes, such as <i>CycB1</i> and <i>Cyclin dependent kinase 1</i>. Moreover, the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) genes, e.g. <i>MCM2</i>, <i>MCM3</i>, <i>MCM4</i>, <i>MCM5</i>, <i>MCM6</i>, and <i>MCM7</i>, are up-regulated in the <i>phb3</i> mutant. Reducing the <i>MCM2</i> expression level substantially recovers the DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e in the <i>phb3</i> mutant and partially rescues the altered cell proliferation and root deficiency of <i>phb3</i> seedlings. PHB3 acts as a transcriptional coregulator that represses <i>MCM2</i> expression by competitively binding to the promoter E2F–cis-acting elements with E2Fa so as to modulate primary root growth. Collectively, these findings indicate that nuclear-localized PHB3 acts as a transcriptional coregulator that suppresses <i>MCM2</i> expression to sustain genome integrity and cell proliferation for stem cell niche maintenance in Arabidopsis.</p>

Selective Elimination of Membrane-Damaged Chloroplasts via Microautophagy
<p>Plant chloroplasts constantly accumulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e caused by visible wavelengths of light during photosynthesis. Our previous study revealed that entire photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>ed chloroplasts are subjected to vacuolar digestion through an autophagy process termed chlorophagy; however, how this process is induced and executed remained poorly understood. In this study, we monitored intracellular induction of chlorophagy in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves and found that mesophyll cells <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>ed by high visible light displayed abnormal chloroplasts with a swollen shape and 2.5 times the volume of normal chloroplasts. In wild-type plants, the activation of chlorophagy decreased the number of swollen chloroplasts. In the autophagy-deficient <i>autophagy</i> mutants, the swollen chloroplasts persisted, and dysfunctional chloroplasts that had lost chlorophyll fluorescence accumulated in the cytoplasm. Chloroplast swelling and subsequent induction of chlorophagy were suppressed by the application of exogenous mannitol to increase the osmotic pressure outside chloroplasts or by overexpression of VESICLE INDUCING PROTEIN IN PLASTID1, which maintains chloroplast envelope integrity. Microscopic observations of autophagy-related membranes showed that swollen chloroplasts were partly surrounded by autophagosomal structures and were engulfed directly by the tonoplast, as in microautophagy. Our results indicate that an elevation in osmotic potential inside the chloroplast due to high visible light-derived envelope <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e results in chloroplast swelling and serves as an induction factor for chlorophagy, and this process mobilizes entire chloroplasts via tonoplast-mediated sequestering to avoid the cytosolic accumulation of dysfunctional chloroplasts.</p>

The Transcriptional Coactivator ADA2b Recruits a Structural Maintenance Protein to Double-Strand Breaks during DNA Repair in Plants
<p>DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e occurs in all cells and can hinder chromosome stability and cell viability. Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes5/6 (SMC5/6) is a protein complex that functions as an evolutionarily conserved chromosomal ATPase critical for repairing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). However, the mechanisms regulating this complex in plants are poorly understood. Here, we identified the transcriptional coactivator ALTERATION/DEFICIENCY IN ACTIVATION2B (ADA2b) as an interactor of SMC5 in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). ADA2b is a conserved component of the Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase complex, which functions in transcriptional regulation. Characterization of mutant and knockdown Arabidopsis lines showed that disruption of either <i>SMC5</i> or <i>ADA2b</i> resulted in enhanced DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e. Both SMC5 and ADA2b were associated with γ-H2AX, a marker of DSBs, and the recruitment of SMC5 onto DSBs was dependent on ADA2b. In addition, overexpression of <i>SMC5</i> in the <i>ada2b</i> mutant background stimulated cell death. Collectively, our results show that the interaction between ADA2b and SMC5 mediates DNA repair in plant cells, suggesting a functional association between these conserved proteins and further elucidating mechanisms of DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e repair in plants.</p>

Mitochondria Affect Photosynthetic Electron Transport and Photosensitivity in a Green Alga
<p>Photosynthetic organisms use sunlight as the primary source of energy to support their metabolism. In eukaryotes, reactions responsible of the conversion of light into chemical energy occur in specific organelles, the chloroplasts. In this study, we showed that mitochondria also have a seminal influence on cells’ energy metabolism and on photosynthetic reactions. This is illustrated by the observation that the strong photosensitivity of <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> cells depleted of the chloroplast protein PGRL1 was rescued by the introduction of a mitochondrial mutation affecting respiratory complex I. Functional analysis showed that such a reduced respiratory activity influenced chloroplast electron transport with consequent overreduction of plastoquinone and donor-side limitation of photosystem I (PSI). As a consequence, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e due to excess light affected more photosystem II (PSII) rather than PSI. Double mutant cells are able to grow under excess illumination, while single <i>pgrl1</i> are not, thanks to the presence of an efficient repair mechanism of PSII. These results also underline the seminal biological relevance of the regulation of electron transport reactions within the photosynthetic complexes. Photosynthetic organisms evolved a strategy to respond to excess light where <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e is targeting preferentially to a specific complex, PSII. Cells are able to endure extensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e targeting this complex thanks to an efficient repair mechanisms, while if PSI is affected, there are drastic consequences on growth.</p>

Flavodiiron Proteins Promote Fast and Transient O<sub>2</sub> Photoreduction in <i>Chlamydomonas</i><xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>During oxygenic photosynthesis, the reducing power generated by light energy conversion is mainly used to reduce carbon dioxide. In bacteria and archae, flavodiiron (Flv) proteins catalyze O<sub>2</sub> or NO reduction, thus protecting cells against oxidative or nitrosative stress. These proteins are found in cyanobacteria, mosses, and microalgae, but have been lost in angiosperms. Here, we used chlorophyll fluorescence and oxygen exchange measurement using [<sup>18</sup>O]-labeled O<sub>2</sub> and a membrane inlet mass spectrometer to characterize <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii flvB</i> insertion mutants devoid of both FlvB and FlvA proteins. We show that Flv proteins are involved in a photo-dependent electron flow to oxygen, which drives most of the photosynthetic electron flow during the induction of photosynthesis. As a consequence, the chlorophyll fluorescence patterns are strongly affected in <i>flvB</i> mutants during a light transient, showing a lower PSII operating yield and a slower nonphotochemical quenching induction. Photoautotrophic growth of <i>flvB</i> mutants was indistinguishable from the wild type under constant light, but severely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ed under fluctuating light due to PSI photo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e. Remarkably, net photosynthesis of <i>flv</i> mutants was higher than in the wild type during the initial hour of a fluctuating light regime, but this advantage vanished under long-term exposure, and turned into PSI photo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e, thus explaining the marked growth retardation observed in these conditions. We conclude that the <i>C. reinhardtii</i> Flv participates in a Mehler-like reduction of O<sub>2</sub>, which drives a large part of the photosynthetic electron flow during a light transient and is thus critical for growth under fluctuating light regimes.</p>

Anterior lateral line nerve encoding to tones and play-back vocalisations in free-swimming oyster toadfish, <i>Opsanus tau</i>
<p>In the underwater environment, sound propagates both as a pressure wave and as particle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong>, with particle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> dominating close to the source. At the receptor level, the fish ear and the neuromast hair cells act as displacement detectors, and both are potentially stimulated by the particle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> component of sound. The encoding of the anterior lateral line nerve to acoustic stimuli in freely behaving oyster toadfish, <i>Opsanus tau</i>, was examined. Nerve sensitivity and directional responses were determined using spike rate and vector strength analysis, a measure of phase-locking of spike times to the stimulus waveform. All units showed greatest sensitivity to 100 Hz stimulus. While sensitivity was independent of stimuli orientation, the neuron's ability to phase-lock was correlated with stimuli origin. Two different types of units were classified, type 1 (tonic), and type 2 (phasic). The type 1 fibres were further classified into two sub-types based on their frequency response (type 1–1 and type 1–2), which was hypothesised to be related to canal (type 1–1) and superficial (type 1–2) neuromast innervation. Lateral line units also exhibited sensitivity and phase locking to boatwhistle vocalisations, with greatest spike rates exhibited at the onset of the call. These results provide direct evidence that oyster toadfish can use their lateral line to detect behaviourally relevant acoustic stimuli, which could provide a sensory pathway to aid in sound source localisation.</p>

Inhibition of Endothelial Notch Signaling Impairs Fatty Acid Transport and Leads to Metabolic and Vascular Remodeling of the Adult Heart
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Nutrients are transported through endothelial cells before being metabolized in muscle cells. However, little is known about the regulation of endothelial transport processes. Notch signaling is a critical regulator of metabolism and angiogenesis during development. Here, we studied how genetic and pharmacological manipulation of endothelial Notch signaling in adult mice affects endothelial fatty acid transport, cardiac angiogenesis, and heart function.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Endothelial-specific Notch inhibition was achieved by conditional genetic inactivation of Rbp-jκ in adult mice to analyze fatty acid metabolism and heart function. Wild-type mice were treated with neutralizing antibodies against the Notch ligand Delta-like 4. Fatty acid transport was studied in cultured endothelial cells and transgenic mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Treatment of wild-type mice with Delta-like 4 neutralizing antibodies for 8 weeks <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ed fractional shortening and ejection fraction in the majority of mice. Inhibition of Notch signaling specifically in the endothelium of adult mice by genetic ablation of Rbp-jκ caused heart hypertrophy and failure. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ed heart function was preceded by alterations in fatty acid metabolism and an increase in cardiac blood vessel density. Endothelial Notch signaling controlled the expression of endothelial lipase, Angptl4, CD36, and Fabp4, which are all needed for fatty acid transport across the vessel wall. In endothelial-specific Rbp-jκ–mutant mice, lipase activity and transendothelial transport of long-chain fatty acids to muscle cells were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impair</span></strong>ed. In turn, lipids accumulated in the plasma and liver. The attenuated supply of cardiomyocytes with long-chain fatty acids was accompanied by higher glucose uptake, increased concentration of glycolysis intermediates, and mTOR-S6K signaling. Treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin or displacing glucose as cardiac substrate by feeding a ketogenic diet prolonged the survival of endothelial-specific Rbp-jκ–deficient mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This study identifies Notch signaling as a novel regulator of fatty acid transport across the endothelium and as an essential repressor of angiogenesis in the adult heart.

In addition, aldosterone increased the expression of NLRP3, active caspase-1, and mature interleukin-1β in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Hypertensive patients with hyperaldosteronism or normal levels of aldosterone exhibited increased activity of NLRP3 inflammasome, suggesting that the effect of hyperaldosteronism on the inflammasome may be mediated through high blood pressure.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Together, these data demonstrate that NLRP3 inflammasome, through activation of IL-1R, is critically involved in the deleterious vascular effects of aldosterone, placing NLRP3 as a potential target for therapeutic interventions in conditions with high aldosterone levels.</p></sec>

Effect of source/sink ratios on yield components, growth dynamics and structural characteristics of oil palm (<i>Elaeis guineensis</i>) bunches
<p>Source/sink ratios are known to be one of the main determinants of oil palm growth and development. A long-term experiment (9 years) was conducted in Indonesia on mature oil palms subjected to continuous bunch ablation and partial defoliation treatments to artificially modify source/sink ratios. During the experiment, all harvested bunches were dissected and phenological measurements were carried out to analyse the effect of source/sink ratios on yield components explaining variations in bunch number, the number of fruits per bunch and oil dry weight per fruit. An integrative variable (supply/demand ratio) describing the ratio between the assimilate supply from sources and the growing organ demand for carbohydrate was computed for each plant on a daily basis from observations of the number of developing organs and their sink strength, and of climate variables. Defoliation and bunch ablation affected the bunch number and the fruit number per bunch. Variations in bunch number per month were mainly due to variations in the fraction of aborted inflorescence and in the ratio between female and male inflorescences. Under fluctuating trophic conditions, variations in fruit number per bunch resulted both from changes in fruit-set and in the number of branches (rachillae) per inflorescence. For defoliated plants, the decrease in the number of developing reproductive sinks appeared to be sufficient to maintain fruit weight and oil concentration at the control level, without any major decrease in the concentration of non-structural carbohydrate reserves. Computation of the supply/demand ratio revealed that each yield component had a specific phase of sensitivity to supply/demand ratios during inflorescence development. Establishing quantitative relationships between supply/demand ratios, competition and yield components is the first step towards a functional model for oil palm.</p>

Calcium Deficiency Triggers Phloem Remobilization of Cadmium in a Hyperaccumulating Species
<p>Understanding cadmium (Cd) accumulation in plants is critical for the development of plant-based strategies for soil remediation and crop safety. <i>Sedum alfredii</i> is a nonbrassica plant species known to hyperaccumulate Cd. The characteristics of Cd uptake, distribution, and retranslocation affected by the Ca status were investigated at cellular levels in <i>S. alfredii</i>. Low Ca supply significantly increased Cd contents in shoots of <i>S. alfredii</i>, particularly in the young leaves. Micro x-ray fluorescence images confirmed that sequestration of Cd was greatly enhanced in the young leaves under Ca deficiency stress, with a significant amount of Cd localized in mesophyll cells, compared to the young leaves <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppli</span></strong>ed with high Ca levels. Cd influx into protoplasts isolated from young leaves was significantly inhibited by the addition of Ca channel inhibitors, but not by pre-exposure to Ca deficiency. In stems, the Cd signal in vascular systems under low Ca levels was 10-fold higher than in those treated with higher Ca levels. A detailed investigation of vascular bundles revealed that an extremely high Cd signal induced by low Ca supply occurred in the phloem tissues, but not in the xylem tissues. Transfer of Cd pretreated plants to nutrient solutions at different Ca levels confirmed that a much higher amount of Cd was reallocated to the new growth tissues under low Ca stress compared to plants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppli</span></strong>ed with sufficient Ca. These results suggest that Ca deficiency triggered a highly efficient phloem remobilization of Cd in <i>S. alfredii</i> and subsequently enhanced Cd accumulation in its young leaves.</p>

The role of education interventions in improving economic rationality
<p>Schooling rewards people with labor market returns and nonpecuniary benefits in other realms of life. However, there is no experimental evidence showing that education interventions improve individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">econom</span></strong>ic rationality. We examine this hypothesis by studying a randomized 1-year financial support program for education in Malawi that reduced absence and dropout rates and increased scores on a qualification exam of female secondary school students. We measure <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">econom</span></strong>ic rationality 4 years after the intervention by using lab-in-the-field experiments to create scores of consistency with utility maximization that are derived from revealed preference theory. We find that students assigned to the intervention had higher scores of rationality. The results remain robust after controlling for changes in cognitive and noncognitive skills. Our results suggest that education enhances the quality of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">econom</span></strong>ic decision-making.</p>

Dirac-source field-effect transistors as energy-efficient, high-performance electronic switches
<p>An efficient way to reduce the power <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">consumpt</span></strong>ion of electronic devices is to lower the supply voltage, but this voltage is restricted by the thermionic limit of subthreshold swing (SS), 60 millivolts per decade, in field-effect transistors (FETs). We show that a graphene Dirac source (DS) with a much narrower electron density distribution around the Fermi level than that of conventional FETs can lower SS. A DS-FET with a carbon nanotube channel provided an average SS of 40 millivolts per decade over four decades of current at room temperature and high device current <i>I</i><sub>60</sub> of up to 40 microamperes per micrometer at 60 millivolts per decade. When compared with state-of-the-art silicon 14-nanometer node FETs, a similar on-state current <i>I</i><sub>on</sub> is realized but at a much lower supply voltage of 0.5 volts (versus 0.7 volts for silicon) and a much steeper SS below 35 millivolts per decade in the off-state.</p>

Evidence That Isoprene Emission Is Not Limited by Cytosolic Metabolites. Exogenous Malate Does Not Invert the Reverse Sensitivity of Isoprene Emission to High [CO<sub>2</sub>]
<p>Isoprene is synthesized via the chloroplastic 2-<i>C</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-erythritol 4-phosphate/1-deoxy-<sc>d</sc>-xylulose 5-phosphate pathway (MEP/DOXP), and its synthesis is directly related to photosynthesis, except under high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, when the rate of photosynthesis increases but isoprene emission decreases. Suppression of MEP/DOXP pathway activity by high CO<sub>2</sub> has been explained either by limited supply of the cytosolic substrate precursor, phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate (PEP), into chloroplast as the result of enhanced activity of cytosolic PEP carboxylase or by limited supply of energetic and reductive equivalents. We tested the PEP-limitation hypotheses by feeding leaves with the PEP carboxylase competitive inhibitors malate and diethyl oxalacetate (DOA) in the strong isoprene emitter hybrid aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus tremuloides</i>). Malate feeding resulted in the inhibition of net assimilation, photosynthetic electron transport, and isoprene emission rates, but DOA feeding did not affect any of these processes except at very high application concentrations. Both malate and DOA did not alter the sensitivity of isoprene emission to high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. Malate inhibition of isoprene emission was associated with enhanced chloroplastic reductive status that suppressed light reactions of photosynthesis, ultimately leading to reduced isoprene substrate dimethylallyl diphosphate pool size. Additional experiments with altered oxygen concentrations in conditions of feedback-limited and non-feedback-limited photosynthesis further indicated that changes in isoprene emission rate in control and malate-inhibited leaves were associated with changes in the share of ATP and reductive equivalent supply for isoprene synthesis. The results of this study collectively indicate that malate importantly controls the chloroplast reductive status and, thereby, affects isoprene emission, but they do not support the hypothesis that cytosolic metabolite availability alters the response of isoprene emission to changes in atmospheric composition.</p>

The cost of muscle power production: muscle oxygen consumption per unit work increases at low temperatures in <i>Xenopus laevis</i>
<p>Metabolic energy (ATP) supply to muscle is essential to support activity and behaviour. It is expected, therefore, that there is strong selection to maximise muscle power output for a given rate of ATP use. However, the viscosity and stiffness of muscle increases with a decrease in temperature, which means that more ATP may be required to achieve a given work output. Here, we tested the hypothesis that ATP use increases at lower temperatures for a given power output in <i>Xenopus laevis.</i> To account for temperature variation at different time scales, we considered the interaction between acclimation for 4 weeks (to 15 or 25°C) and acute exposure to these temperatures. Cold-acclimated frogs had greater sprint speed at 15°C than warm-acclimated animals. However, acclimation temperature did not affect isolated gastrocnemius muscle biomechanics. Isolated muscle produced greater tetanus force, and faster isometric force generation and relaxation, and generated more work loop power at 25°C than at 15°C acute test temperature. Oxygen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">consumpt</span></strong>ion of isolated muscle at rest did not change with test temperature, but oxygen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">consumpt</span></strong>ion while muscle was performing work was significantly higher at 15°C than at 25°C, regardless of acclimation conditions. Muscle therefore consumed significantly more oxygen at 15°C for a given work output than at 25°C, and plastic responses did not modify this thermodynamic effect. The metabolic cost of muscle performance and activity therefore increased with a decrease in temperature. To maintain activity across a range of temperature, animals must increase ATP production or face an allocation trade-off at lower temperatures. Our data demonstrate the potential energetic benefits of warming up muscle before activity, which is seen in diverse groups of animals such as bees, which warm flight muscle before take-off, and humans performing warm ups before exercise.</p>

Reduction of blood oxygen levels enhances postprandial cardiac hypertrophy in Burmese python (<i>Python bivittatus</i>)
<p>Physiological cardiac hypertrophy is characterized by reversible enlargement of cardiomyocytes and changes in chamber architecture, which increase stroke volume and [Formula] via augmented convective oxygen transport. Cardiac hypertrophy is known to occur in response to repeated elevations of O<sub>2</sub> demand and/or reduced O<sub>2</sub> supply in several species of vertebrate ectotherms, including postprandial Burmese pythons (<i>Python bivittatus</i>). Recent data suggest postprandial cardiac hypertrophy in <i>P. bivittatus</i> is a facultative rather than obligatory response to digestion, though the triggers of this response are unknown. Here, we hypothesized that an O<sub>2</sub> supply–demand mismatch stimulates postprandial cardiac enlargement in Burmese pythons. To test this hypothesis, we rendered animals anemic prior to feeding, essentially halving blood oxygen content during the postprandial period. Fed anemic animals had heart rates 126% higher than those of fasted controls, which, coupled with a 71% increase in mean arterial pressure, suggests fed anemic animals were experiencing significantly elevated cardiac work. We found significant cardiac hypertrophy in fed anemic animals, which exhibited ventricles 39% larger than those of fasted controls and 28% larger than in fed controls. These findings support our hypothesis that those animals with a greater magnitude of O<sub>2</sub> supply–demand mismatch exhibit the largest hearts. The ‘low O<sub>2</sub> signal’ stimulating postprandial cardiac hypertrophy is likely mediated by elevated ventricular wall stress associated with postprandial hemodynamics.</p>

Combined effects of defoliation and water stress on pine growth and non-structural carbohydrates
<p>Climate change is expected to increase both pest insect damage and the occurrence of severe drought. There is therefore a need to better understand the combined effects of biotic and abiotic damage on tree growth in order to predict the multi-factorial effect of climate change on forest ecosystem productivity. Indeed, the effect of stress interactions on tree growth is an increasingly important topic that greatly lacks experiments and data, and it is unlikely that the impact of combined stresses can be extrapolated from the outcomes of studies that focused on a single stress. We developed an original manipulative study under real field conditions where we applied artificial defoliation and induced water stress on 10-year-old (∼10 m high) maritime pine trees (<i>Pinus pinaster</i> Ait.). Tree response to combined stresses was quantitatively assessed following tree secondary growth and carbohydrate pools. Such a design allowed us to address the crucial question of combined stresses on trees under stand conditions, sharing soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppli</span></strong>es with neighboring trees. Our initial hypotheses were that (i) moderate defoliation can limit the impact of water stress on tree growth through reduced transpiration demand by a tree canopy partly defoliated and that (ii) defoliation results in reduced non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) pools, affecting tree tolerance to drought. Our results showed additive effects of defoliation and water stress on tree growth and contradict our initial hypothesis. Indeed, under stand conditions, we found that partial defoliation does not limit the impact of water stress through reduced transpiration. Our study also highlighted that, even if NSC in all organs were affected by defoliation, tree response to water stress was not triggered. We found that stem NSC were maintained or increased during the entire growing season, supporting literature-based hypotheses such as an active maintenance of the hydraulic system or another limiting resource for tree growth under defoliation. We also observed a significant decrease in root carbohydrates, which suggests a shift in the root carbon balance under defoliation. The decrease in carbohydrate supply under defoliation may not counterbalance the carbon use for mineral and water uptakes or a translocation to other tissues.</p>

The use of a Schottky barrier for the source gave the transistor geometry-independent electrical characteristics and accommodated the large dimensional variation in inkjet-printed features.

What occurred in between—the city's failure to control infrastructure corrosion, the deterioration of fresh water entering Flint residences, citizen complaints, government denials, elevated lead levels in children, and public outcry—would become the basis for a crisis that rose to national attention in 2015. <i>What the Eyes Don't See </i>by Mona Hanna-Attisha and <i>The Poisoned City </i>by Anna Clark are the first two books to document in detail this horrible disaster.</p>

Assessment of methane emissions from the U.S. oil and gas supply chain
<p>Methane emissions from the U.S. oil and natural gas supply chain were estimated by using ground-based, facility-scale measurements and validated with aircraft observations in areas accounting for ~30% of U.S. gas production. When scaled up nationally, our facility-based estimate of 2015 supply chain emissions is 13 ± 2 teragrams per year, equivalent to 2.3% of gross U.S. gas production. This value is ~60% higher than the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency inventory estimate, likely because existing inventory methods miss emissions released during abnormal operating conditions. Methane emissions of this magnitude, per unit of natural gas consumed, produce radiative forcing over a 20-year time horizon comparable to the CO<sub>2</sub> from natural gas combustion. Substantial emission reductions are feasible through rapid detection of the root causes of high emissions and deployment of less failure-prone systems.</p>

Estimating the health benefits of environmental regulations

Benefits analysis, one side of benefit-cost analysis (BCA), can be relatively straightforward when sufficient data are available on dose-response relationships, changes in exposure expected from a proposed policy, and other key inputs. But despite progress, benefits analysis for health effects is needlessly constrained by analytic practices that are scientifically outdated and inconsistent with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">econom</span></strong>ic theory.

Branch-specific plasticity of a bifunctional dopamine circuit encodes protein hunger

Leaf Amino Acid Supply Affects Photosynthetic and Plant Nitrogen Use Efficiency under Nitrogen Stress
<p>The coordinated distribution of nitrogen to source leaves and sinks is essential for supporting leaf metabolism while also supplying sufficient nitrogen to seeds for development. This study aimed to understand how regulated amino acid allocation to leaves affects photosynthesis and overall plant nitrogen use efficiency in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and how soil nitrogen availability influences these processes. Arabidopsis plants with a knockout of <i>AAP2</i>, encoding an amino acid permease involved in xylem-to-phloem transfer of root-derived amino acids, were grown in low-, moderate-, and high-nitrogen environments. We analyzed nitrogen allocation to shoot tissues, photosynthesis, and photosynthetic and plant nitrogen use efficiency in these knockout plants. Our results demonstrate that, independent of nitrogen conditions, <i>aap2</i> plants allocate more nitrogen to leaves than wild-type plants. Increased leaf nitrogen supply positively affected chlorophyll and Rubisco levels, photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency, and carbon assimilation and transport to sinks. The <i>aap2</i> plants outperformed wild-type plants with respect to growth, seed yield and carbon storage pools, and nitrogen use efficiency in both high and deficient nitrogen environments. Overall, this study demonstrates that increasing nitrogen allocation to leaves represents an effective strategy for improving carbon fixation and photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency. The results indicate that an optimized coordination of nitrogen and carbon partitioning processes is critical for high oilseed production in Arabidopsis, including in plants exposed to limiting nitrogen conditions.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Root Bending Is Antagonistically Affected by Hypoxia and ERF-Mediated Transcription via Auxin Signaling
<p>When plants encounter soil water logging or flooding, roots are the first organs to be confronted with reduced gas diffusion resulting in limited oxygen supply. Since roots do not generate photosynthetic oxygen, they are rapidly faced with oxygen shortage rendering roots particularly prone to damage. While metabolic adaptations to low oxygen conditions, which ensure basic energy supply, have been well characterized, adaptation of root growth and development have received less attention. In this study, we show that hypoxic conditions cause the primary root to grow sidewise in a low oxygen environment, possibly to escape soil patches with reduced oxygen availability. This growth behavior is reversible in that gravitropic growth resumes when seedlings are returned to normoxic conditions. Hypoxic root bending is inhibited by the group VII ethylene response factor (ERFVII) RAP2.12, as <i>rap2.12-1</i> seedlings show exaggerated primary root bending. Furthermore, overexpression of the ERFVII member <i>HRE2</i> inhibits root bending, suggesting that primary root growth direction at hypoxic conditions is antagonistically regulated by hypoxia and hypoxia-activated ERFVIIs. Root bending is preceded by the establishment of an auxin gradient across the root tip as quantified with DII-VENUS and is synergistically enhanced by hypoxia and the auxin transport inhibitor naphthylphthalamic acid. The protein abundance of the auxin efflux carrier PIN2 is reduced at hypoxic conditions, a response that is suppressed by RAP2.12 overexpression, suggesting antagonistic control of auxin flux by hypoxia and ERFVII. Taken together, we show that hypoxia triggers an escape response of the primary root that is controlled by ERFVII activity and mediated by auxin signaling in the root tip.</p>

Root Cell-Specific Regulators of Phosphate-Dependent Growth
<p>Cellular specialization in abiotic stress responses is an important regulatory feature driving plant acclimation. Our in silico approach of iterative coexpression, interaction, and enrichment analyses predicted root cell-specific regulators of phosphate starvation response networks in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). This included three uncharacterized genes termed Phosphate starvation-induced gene interacting Root Cell Enriched (<i>PRCE1</i>, <i>PRCE2</i>, and <i>PRCE3</i>). Root cell-specific enrichment of 12 candidates was confirmed in promoter-GFP lines. T-DNA insertion lines of 11 genes showed changes in phosphate status and growth responses to phosphate availability compared with the wild type. Some mutants (<i>cbl1</i>, <i>cipk2</i>, <i>prce3</i>, and <i>wdd1</i>) displayed strong biomass gain irrespective of phosphate supply, while others (<i>cipk14</i>, <i>mfs1</i>, <i>prce1</i>, <i>prce2</i>, and <i>s6k2</i>) were able to sustain growth under low phosphate supply better than the wild type. Notably, root or shoot phosphate accumulation did not strictly correlate with organ growth. Mutant response patterns markedly differed from those of master regulators of phosphate homeostasis, <i>PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE1</i> (<i>PHR1</i>) and <i>PHOSPHATE2</i> (<i>PHO2</i>), demonstrating that negative growth responses in the latter can be overcome when cell-specific regulators are targeted. RNA sequencing analysis highlighted the transcriptomic plasticity in these mutants and revealed PHR1-dependent and -independent regulatory circuits with gene coexpression profiles that were highly correlated to the quantified physiological traits. The results demonstrate how in silico prediction of cell-specific, stress-responsive genes uncovers key regulators and how their manipulation can have positive impacts on plant growth under abiotic stress.</p>

LIL3, a Light-Harvesting Complex Protein, Links Terpenoid and Tetrapyrrole Biosynthesis in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>The LIL3 protein of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) belongs to the light-harvesting complex (LHC) protein family, which also includes the light-harvesting chlorophyll-binding proteins of photosystems I and II, the early-light-inducible proteins, PsbS involved in nonphotochemical quenching, and the one-helix proteins and their cyanobacterial homologs designated high-light-inducible proteins. Each member of this family is characterized by one or two LHC transmembrane domains (referred to as the LHC motif) to which potential functions such as chlorophyll binding, protein interaction, and integration of interacting partners into the plastid membranes have been attributed. Initially, LIL3 was shown to interact with geranylgeranyl reductase (CHLP), an enzyme of terpene biosynthesis that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppli</span></strong>es the hydrocarbon chain for chlorophyll and tocopherol. Here, we show another function of LIL3 for the stability of protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR). Multiple protein-protein interaction analyses suggest the direct physical interaction of LIL3 with POR but not with chlorophyll synthase. Consistently, LIL3-deficient plants exhibit substantial loss of POR as well as CHLP, which is not due to defective transcription of the POR and CHLP genes but to the posttranslational modification of their protein products. Interestingly, in vitro biochemical analyses provide novel evidence that LIL3 shows high binding affinity to protochlorophyllide, the substrate of POR. Taken together, this study suggests a critical role for LIL3 in the organization of later steps in chlorophyll biosynthesis. We suggest that LIL3 associates with POR and CHLP and thus contributes to the supply of the two metabolites, chlorophyllide and phytyl pyrophosphate, required for the final step in chlorophyll <i>a</i> synthesis.</p>

Metabolic Control of Tobacco Pollination by Sugars and Invertases
<p>Pollination in flowering plants is initiated by germination of pollen grains on stigmas followed by fast growth of pollen tubes representing highly energy-consuming processes. The symplastic isolation of pollen grains and tubes requires import of Suc available in the apoplast. We show that the functional coupling of Suc cleavage by invertases and uptake of the released hexoses by monosaccharide transporters are critical for pollination in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>). Transcript profiling, in situ hybridization, and immunolocalization of extracellular invertases and two monosaccharide transporters in vitro and in vivo support the functional coupling in supplying carbohydrates for pollen germination and tube growth evidenced by spatiotemporally coordinated expression. Detection of vacuolar invertases in maternal tissues by these approaches revealed metabolic cross talk between male and female tissues and supported the requirement for carbohydrate supply in transmitting tissue during pollination. Tissue-specific expression of an invertase inhibitor and addition of the chemical invertase inhibitor miglitol strongly reduced extracellular invertase activity and impaired pollen germination. Measurements of (competitive) uptake of labeled sugars identified two import pathways for exogenously available Suc into the germinating pollen operating in parallel: direct Suc uptake and via the hexoses after cleavage by extracellular invertase. Reduction of extracellular invertase activity in pollen decreases Suc uptake and severely compromises pollen germination. We further demonstrate that Glc as sole carbon source is sufficient for pollen germination, whereas Suc is supporting tube growth, revealing an important regulatory role of both the invertase substrate and products contributing to a potential metabolic and signaling-based multilayer regulation of pollination by carbohydrates.</p>

Validating Genome-Wide Association Candidates Controlling Quantitative Variation in Nodulation
<p>Genome-wide association (GWA) studies offer the opportunity to identify genes that contribute to naturally occurring variation in quantitative traits. However, GWA relies exclusively on statistical association, so functional validation is necessary to make strong claims about gene function. We used a combination of gene-disruption platforms (Tnt1 retrotransposons, hairpin RNA-interference constructs, and CRISPR/Cas9 nucleases) together with randomized, well-replicated experiments to evaluate the function of genes that an earlier GWA study in <i>Medicago truncatula</i> had identified as candidates contributing to variation in the symbiosis between legumes and rhizobia. We evaluated ten candidate genes found in six clusters of strongly associated single nucleotide polymorphisms, selected on the basis of their strength of statistical association, proximity to annotated gene models, and root or nodule expression. We found statistically significant effects on nodule production for three candidate genes, each validated in two independent mutants. Annotated functions of these three genes suggest their contributions to quantitative variation in nodule production occur through processes not previously connected to nodulation, including phosphorous supply and salicylic acid-related defense response. These results demonstrate the utility of GWA combined with reverse mutagenesis technologies to discover and validate genes contributing to naturally occurring variation in quantitative traits. The results highlight the potential for GWA to complement forward genetics in identifying the genetic basis of ecologically and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">econom</span></strong>ically important traits.</p>

The HvNramp5 Transporter Mediates Uptake of Cadmium and Manganese, But Not Iron
<p>The Natural Resistance Associated Macrophage Protein (Nramp) represents a transporter family for metal ions in all organisms. Here, we functionally characterized a member of Nramp family in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), HvNramp5. This member showed different expression patterns, transport substrate specificity, and cellular localization from its close homolog in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), OsNramp5, although HvNramp5 was also localized to the plasma membrane. <i>HvNramp5</i> was mainly expressed in the roots and its expression was not affected by Cd and deficiency of Zn, Cu, and Mn, but slightly up-regulated by Fe deficiency. Spatial expression analysis showed that the expression of <i>HvNramp5</i> was higher in the root tips than that in the basal root regions. Furthermore, analysis with laser microdissection revealed higher expression of <i>HvNramp5</i> in the outer root cell layers. HvNramp5 showed transport activity for both Mn<sup>2+</sup> and Cd<sup>2+</sup>, but not for Fe<sup>2+</sup> when expressed in yeast. Immunostaining with a HvNramp5 antibody showed that this protein was localized in the root epidermal cells without polarity. Knockdown of <i>HvNramp5</i> in barley resulted in a significant reduction in the seedling growth at low Mn supply, but this reduction was rescued at high Mn supply. The concentration of Mn and Cd, but not other metals including Cu, Zn, and Fe, was decreased in both the roots and shoots of knockdown lines compared with the wild-type barley. These results indicate that HvNramp5 is a transporter required for uptake of Mn and Cd, but not for Fe, and that barley has a distinct uptake system from rice.</p>

Experimental analysis of the liquid-feeding mechanism of the butterfly <i>Pieris rapae</i>
<p>The butterfly <i>Pieirs rapae</i> drinks liquid using a long proboscis. A high pressure gradient is induced in the proboscis when cibarial pump muscles contract. However, liquid feeding through the long proboscis poses a disadvantage of high flow resistance. Hence, butterflies may possess special features to compensate for this disadvantage and succeed in foraging. The main objective of this study is to analyze the liquid-feeding mechanism of butterflies. The systaltic motion of the cibarial pump organ was visualized using the synchrotron X-ray imaging technique. In addition, an ellipsoidal pump model was established based on synchrotron X-ray micro-computed tomography. To determine the relationship between the cyclic variation of the pump volume and the liquid-feeding flow, velocity fields of the intake flow at the tip of the proboscis were measured using micro-particle image velocimetry. Reynolds and Womersley numbers of liquid-feeding flow in the proboscis were ~1.40 and 0.129, respectively. The liquid-feeding flow could be characterized as a quasi-steady state laminar flow. Considering these results, we analyzed the dimensions of the feeding apparatus on the basis of minimum energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">consumpt</span></strong>ion during the liquid-feeding process. The relationship between the proboscis and the cibarial pump was determined when minimum energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">consumpt</span></strong>ion occurs. As a result, the volume of the cibarial pump is proportional to the cube of the radius of the proboscis. It seems that the liquid-feeding system of butterflies and other long-proboscid insects follow the cube relationship. The present results provide insights into the feeding strategies of liquid-feeding butterflies.</p>

Cost effectiveness of patellofemoral <i>versus</i> total knee arthroplasty in younger patients
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Patellofemoral arthroplasty (PFA) has experienced significant   improvements in implant survivorship with second generation designs.   This has renewed interest in PFA as an alternative to total knee   arthroplasty (TKA) for younger active patients with isolated patellofemoral   osteoarthritis (PF OA). We analysed the cost-effectiveness of PFA <i>versus</i> TKA   for the management of isolated PF OA in the United States-based   population.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We used a Markov transition state model to compare cost-effectiveness   between PFA and TKA.

The ICER associated with the additional   effectiveness of PFA was $3097. The model was mainly sensitive to utility   values, with PFA remaining cost-effective when its utility exceeded   that of TKA by at least 1.0%.

TreeTFDB: An Integrative Database of the Transcription Factors from Six Economically Important Tree Crops for Functional Predictions and Comparative and Functional Genomics
<p>Crop plants, whose productivity is affected by a wide range of growing and environmental conditions, are grown for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">econom</span></strong>ic purposes. Transcription factors (TFs) play central role in regulation of many biological processes, including plant development and responses to environmental stimuli, by activating or repressing spatiotemporal gene expression. Here, we describe the TreeTFDB (<ext-link>http://treetfdb.bmep.riken.jp/index.pl</ext-link>) that houses the TF repertoires of six <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">econom</span></strong>ically important tree crop species: <i>Jatropha curcas</i>, papaya, cassava, poplar, castor bean and grapevine. Among these, the TF repertoire of <i>J. curcas</i> has not been reported by any other TF databases. In addition to their basic information, such as sequence and domain features, domain alignments, gene ontology assignment and sequence comparison, information on available full-length cDNAs, identity and positions of all types of known <i>cis</i>-motifs found in the promoter regions, gene expression data are provided. With its newly designed and friendly interface and its unique features, TreeTFDB will enable research community to predict the functions and provide access to available genetic resources for performing comparative and functional genomics of the crop TFs, either individually or at whole family level, in a comprehensive and convenient manner.</p>

Physiology of Angina and Its Alleviation With Nitroglycerin
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The mechanisms governing exercise-induced angina and its alleviation by the most commonly used antianginal drug, nitroglycerin, are incompletely understood. The purpose of this study was to develop a method by which the effects of antianginal drugs could be evaluated invasively during physiological exercise to gain further understanding of the clinical impact of angina and nitroglycerin.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Forty patients (mean age, 65.2±7.6 years) with exertional angina and coronary artery disease underwent cardiac catheterization via radial access and performed incremental exercise using a supine cycle ergometer. As they developed limiting angina, sublingual nitroglycerin was administered to half the patients, and all patients continued to exercise for 2 minutes at the same workload. Throughout exercise, distal coronary pressure and flow velocity and central aortic pressure were recorded with sensor wires.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Patients continued to exercise after nitroglycerin administration with less ST-segment depression (<i>P</i>=0.003) and therefore myocardial ischemia. Significant reductions in afterload (aortic pressure, <i>P</i>=0.030) and myocardial oxygen demand were seen (tension-time index, <i>P</i>=0.024; rate-pressure product, <i>P</i>=0.046), as well as an increase in myocardial oxygen supply (Buckberg index, <i>P</i>=0.017). Exercise reduced peripheral arterial wave reflection (<i>P</i><0.05), which was not further augmented by the administration of nitroglycerin (<i>P</i>=0.648). The observed increases in coronary pressure gradient, stenosis resistance, and flow velocity did not reach statistical significance; however, the diastolic velocity–pressure gradient relation was consistent with a significant increase in relative stenosis severity (k coefficient, <i>P</i><0.0001), in keeping with exercise-induced vasoconstriction of stenosed epicardial segments and dilatation of normal segments, with trends toward reversal with nitroglycerin.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The catheterization laboratory protocol provides a model to study myocardial ischemia and the actions of novel and established antianginal drugs. Administration of nitroglycerin causes changes in the systemic and coronary circulation that combine to reduce myocardial oxygen demand and to increase supply, thereby attenuating exercise-induced ischemia. Designing antianginal therapies that exploit these mechanisms may provide new therapeutic strategies.</p></sec>

Heart rate as a predictor of metabolic rate in heterothermic bats
<p>While heart rate (<i>f</i><sub>H</sub>) has been used as an indicator of energy expenditure, quantitative data showing the relationship between these variables are only available for normothermic animals. To determine whether <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> also predicts oxygen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">consumpt</span></strong>ion ([Formula]) during torpor, we simultaneously measured [Formula], <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> and subcutaneous body temperature (<i>T</i><sub>sub</sub>) of a hibernator, Gould's long-eared bats (<i>Nyctophilus gouldi</i>, 9 g, <i>N</i>=18), at ambient temperatures (<i>T</i><sub>a</sub>) between 0 and 25°C. At rest, <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> of normothermic resting bats was negatively correlated with <i>T</i><sub>a</sub>, with maximum <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> of 803 beats min<sup>−1</sup> (<i>T</i><sub>a</sub>=5°C). During torpor, the relationship between <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> and <i>T</i><sub>a</sub> was curvilinear, and at low <i>T</i><sub>sub</sub> (~6°C), <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> fell to a minimum average of 8 beats min<sup>−1</sup>. The minimum average values for both [Formula] and <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> in torpor reported here were among the lowest recorded for bats. The relationship between <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> and [Formula] was significant for both resting (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>=0.64, <i>P</i><0.001) and torpid bats (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>=0.84, <i>P</i><0.001), with no overlap between the two states. These variables were also significantly correlated (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>=0.44, <i>P</i><0.001) for entire torpor bouts. Moreover, estimates of [Formula] from <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> did not differ significantly from measured values during the different physiological states. Our study is the first to investigate the accuracy of <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> as a predictor of [Formula] during torpor and indicates the reliability of this method as a potential measure of energy expenditure in the field. Nevertheless, <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> should only be used to predict [Formula] within the range of activities for which robust correlations have been established.</p>

Simultaneous high-resolution pH and spectrophotometric recordings of oxygen binding in blood microvolumes
<p>Oxygen equilibrium curves have been widely used to understand oxygen transport in numerous organisms. A major challenge has been to monitor oxygen binding characteristics and concomitant pH changes as they occur <i>in vivo</i>, in limited sample volumes. Here we report a technique allowing highly resolved and simultaneous monitoring of pH and blood pigment saturation in minute blood volumes. We equipped a gas diffusion chamber with a broad-range fibre-optic spectrophotometer and a micro-pH optode and recorded changes of pigment oxygenation along oxygen partial pressure (<i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) and pH gradients to test the setup. Oxygen binding parameters derived from measurements in only 15 μl of haemolymph from the cephalopod <i>Octopus vulgaris</i> showed low instrumental error (0.93%) and good agreement with published data. Broad-range spectra, each resolving 2048 data points, provided detailed insight into the complex absorbance characteristics of diverse blood types. After consideration of photobleaching and intrinsic fluorescence, pH optodes yielded accurate recordings and resolved a sigmoidal shift of 0.03 pH units in response to changing <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> from 0 to 21 kPa. Highly resolved continuous recordings along pH gradients conformed to stepwise measurements at low rates of pH changes. In this study we showed that a diffusion chamber upgraded with a broad-range spectrophotometer and an optical pH sensor accurately characterizes oxygen binding with minimal sample <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">consumpt</span></strong>ion and manipulation. We conclude that the modified diffusion chamber is highly suitable for experimental biologists who demand high flexibility, detailed insight into oxygen binding as well as experimental and biological accuracy combined in a single setup.</p>

We critically assessed the use of tritium-labeled polyethylene glycol ([<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000) for this purpose, a substance that is also a classic marker for extracellular fluid volume, glomerular filtration rate and drinking rate. Tests (8 h) on resting freshwater trout showed that when measuring [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance from the plasma in the efflux direction, correction for a large excretion via glomerular filtration was essential, necessitating urinary catheterization. When measuring [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance from the water in the influx direction, correction for a significant uptake by drinking was essential, necessitating terminal gut removal, whereas glomerular filtration losses were minimal. After correction for these alternate routes of loss and uptake, [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance rates by efflux from the plasma and by influx from the water were identical, showing that gill paracellular permeability is not rectified, and can be measured in either direction. The influx technique with terminal gut removal was used to assess gill paracellular permeability in trout without urinary catheters freely swimming at 1.2 body lengths s<sup>−1</sup> for 8 h. Branchial [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance rate (by influx from the water) increased significantly by ~80% in accord with a similar measured increase in O<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">consumpt</span></strong>ion rate. Thus in trout, gill paracellular permeability does increase during exercise, in accord with the traditional concept of the osmorespiratory compromise.</p>

Skeletal muscle fuel selection occurs at the mitochondrial level
<p>Mammals exponentially increase the rate of carbohydrate oxidation as exercise intensity rises, while birds combust lipid almost exclusively while flying at high percentages of aerobic capacity. The fuel oxidized by contracting muscle depends on many factors: whole-body fuel storage mass, mobilization, blood transport, cellular uptake, and substrate selection at the level of the mitochondrion. We examined the fuel preferences of mitochondria isolated from mammalian and avian locomotory muscles using two approaches. First, the influence of substrates on the kinetics of respiration (<i>K</i><sub>m,ADP</sub> and <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>) was evaluated. For all substrates and combinations, <i>K</i><sub>m,ADP</sub> was generally twofold higher in avian mitochondria. Second, fuel competition between pyruvate, glutamate and/or palmitoyl-<sc>l</sc>-carnitine at three levels of ATP free energy was determined using the principle of mass balance and the measured rates of O<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">consumpt</span></strong>ion and metabolite accumulation/utilization. Avian mitochondria strongly spared pyruvate from oxidation when another substrate was available and fatty acid was the dominant substrate, regardless of energy state. Mammalian mitochondria exhibited some preference for fatty acid over pyruvate at lower flux (higher energy state), but exhibited a much greater tendency to select pyruvate and glutamate when available. Studies in sonicated mitochondria revealed twofold higher electron transport chain electron conductance in avian mitochondria. We conclude that substantial fuel selection occurs at the level of the mitochondrial matrix and that avian flight muscle mitochondria are particularly biased toward the selection of fatty acid, possibly by facilitating high β-oxidation flux by maintaining a more oxidized matrix.</p>

Biomimetic shark skin: design, fabrication and hydrodynamic function
<p>Although the functional properties of shark skin have been of considerable interest to both biologists and engineers because of the complex hydrodynamic effects of surface roughness, no study to date has successfully fabricated a flexible biomimetic shark skin that allows detailed study of hydrodynamic function. We present the first study of the design, fabrication and hydrodynamic testing of a synthetic, flexible, shark skin membrane. A three-dimensional (3D) model of shark skin denticles was constructed using micro-CT imaging of the skin of the shortfin mako (<i>Isurus oxyrinchus</i>). Using 3D printing, thousands of rigid synthetic shark denticles were placed on flexible membranes in a controlled, linear-arrayed pattern. This flexible 3D printed shark skin model was then tested in water using a robotic flapping device that allowed us to either hold the models in a stationary position or move them dynamically at their self-propelled swimming speed. Compared with a smooth control model without denticles, the 3D printed shark skin showed increased swimming speed with reduced energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">consumpt</span></strong>ion under certain motion programs. For example, at a heave frequency of 1.5 Hz and an amplitude of ±1 cm, swimming speed increased by 6.6% and the energy cost-of-transport was reduced by 5.9%. In addition, a leading-edge vortex with greater vorticity than the smooth control was generated by the 3D printed shark skin, which may explain the increased swimming speeds. The ability to fabricate synthetic biomimetic shark skin opens up a wide array of possible manipulations of surface roughness parameters, and the ability to examine the hydrodynamic consequences of diverse skin denticle shapes present in different shark species.</p>

Production of all female progeny: evidence for the presence of the male sex determination factor on the Y chromosome
<p>The red flour beetle, <i>Tribolium castaneum</i>, follows an XX (female) and XY (male) sex determination system. Maternal supply of the protein Transformer (Tra) is required for XX insects to follow the female pathway. The nature and source of the signal that regulates male sex determination in XY beetles are not known. Parental RNAi-aided knockdown in expression of <i>tra</i> masculinizes genetic females (XX) that are fertile. The virgin females mated with these masculinized genetic females produced all female progeny. We present the genetic evidence to show that the factor responsible for male sex determination is present on the Y chromosome. These data also suggest that the Y chromosome in <i>T. castaneum</i> is not required for male fertility.</p>

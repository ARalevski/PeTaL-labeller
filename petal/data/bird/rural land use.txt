<i>ELIGULUM-A</i> Regulates Lateral Branch and Leaf Development in Barley
<p>The shoot apical and axillary meristems control shoot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, effectively influencing lateral branch and leaf formation. The barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) <i>uniculm2</i> (<i>cul2</i>) mutation blocks axillary meristem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, and mutant plants lack lateral branches (tillers) that normally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong> from the crown. A genetic screen for <i>cul2</i> suppressors recovered two recessive alleles of <i>ELIGULUM-A</i> (<i>ELI-A</i>) that partially rescued the <i>cul2</i> tillering phenotype. Mutations in <i>ELI-A</i> produce shorter plants with fewer tillers and disrupt the leaf blade-sheath boundary, producing liguleless leaves and reduced secondary cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in stems and leaves. <i>ELI-A</i> is predicted to encode an unannotated protein containing an RNaseH-like domain that is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants. <i>ELI-A</i> transcripts accumulate at the preligule boundary, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing ligule, leaf margins, cells destined to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong> secondary cell walls, and cells surrounding leaf vascular bundles. Recent studies have identified regulatory similarities between boundary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in leaves and lateral organs. Interestingly, we observed <i>ELI-A</i> transcripts at the preligule boundary, suggesting that <i>ELI-A</i> contributes to boundary formation between the blade and sheath. However, we did not observe <i>ELI-A</i> transcripts at the axillary meristem boundary in leaf axils, suggesting that <i>ELI-A</i> is not involved in boundary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment for axillary meristem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Our results show that <i>ELI-A</i> contributes to leaf and lateral branch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment by acting as a boundary gene during ligule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment but not during lateral branch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment.</p>

Highly variable chemical signatures over short spatial distances among Scots pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i>) populations
<p>Understanding within-species variability in terpenoid content and composition is highly relevant for predicting species adaptive potential to biotic stresses, but there is still limited information on terpene variations even for widespread species. We studied the foliage content and composition of terpenoids, foliage structure, and carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) contents in <i>Pinus sylvestris</i> L. in four Estonian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s ranging from dry forest to raised bog. In the bogs, samples were taken along the environmental gradient from drier margins towards wetter central parts. A chiral column was used to gain insight into the variation in terpene composition. We hypothesized that terpene contents increase and the composition becomes more diverse in more strongly N-limited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s (greater C/N ratio) and that terpene signatures cluster together in sub-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s with similar conditions (drier/wetter). Altogether 37 terpenes were quantified across the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s. Extremely large variability of terpene contents, 48–62% for monoterpenes and 61–89% for sesquiterpenes, was observed. According to the amounts of α-pinenes and (+)-3-carene, we distinguished two different ‘pine chemotypes’. Contrary to the hypothesis, terpene contents and variability were the greatest in the dry <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> with the lowest C/N ratio. However, individual terpenoids correlated differently with C or N in different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s, indicating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> effects on terpene composition. Moreover, correlations between the terpenoids and C or N depended on the pine chemotype. The sub-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s with different water regime were more strongly clustered together within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> than across the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s. The study demonstrates extensive variations in terpene contents and composition among the populations and over short spatial distances within the populations, suggesting a large among- and within-population adaptive capacity of <i>P. sylvestris</i>.</p>

<i>PINOID</i> Is Required for Formation of the Stigma and Style in Rice
<p>The stigma is the entry point for sexual reproduction in plants, but the mechanisms underlying stigma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment are largely unknown. Here, we disrupted putative auxin biosynthetic and signaling genes to evaluate their roles in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Disruption of the rice <i>PINOID</i> (<i>OsPID</i>) gene completely eliminated the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of stigmas, and overexpression of <i>OsPID</i> led to overproliferation of stigmas, suggesting that <i>OsPID</i> is a key determinant for stigma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Interestingly, <i>ospid</i> mutants did not display defects in flower initiation, nor did they <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong> any pin-like inflorescences, a characteristic phenotype observed in <i>pid</i> mutants in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). We constructed double mutants of <i>OsPID</i> and its closest homolog, <i>OsPIDb</i>, yet the double mutants still did not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong> any pin-like inflorescences, indicating that either <i>ospid</i> is compensated by additional homologous genes or <i>OsPID</i> has different functions in rice compared with <i>PID</i> in other organisms. We then knocked out one of the <i>NAKED PINS IN YUC MUTANTS</i> (<i>NPY</i>) genes, which cause the formation of pin-like inflorescences in Arabidopsis when compromised, in the <i>ospid</i> background. The <i>ospid osnpy2</i> double mutants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ed pin-like inflorescences, which were phenotypically similar to <i>pid</i> mutants in Arabidopsis and maize, demonstrating that the roles of <i>OsPID</i> in inflorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment are likely masked by redundant partners. This work identified a key determinant for stigma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in rice and revealed a complex picture of the <i>PID</i> gene in rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Furthermore, the stigma-less <i>ospid</i> mutants are potentially useful in producing hybrid rice.</p>

Transcription Factor OsTGA10 Is a Target of the MADS Protein OsMADS8 and Is Required for Tapetum Development
<p>This study aimed at elucidating regulatory components behind floral organ identity determination and tissue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. It remains unclear how organ identity proteins facilitate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of organ primordia into tissues with a determined identity, even though it has long been accepted that floral organ identity is genetically determined by interaction of identity genes according to the ABC model. Using the chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing technique, we identified <i>OsTGA10</i>, encoding a bZIP transcription factor, as a target of the MADS box protein OsMADS8, which is annotated as an E-class organ identity protein. We characterized the function of OsTGA10 using genetic and molecular analyses. <i>OsTGA10</i> was preferentially expressed during stamen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, and mutation of <i>OsTGA10</i> resulted in male sterility. OsTGA10 was required for tapetum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and functioned by interacting with known tapetum genes. In addition, in <i>ostga10</i> stamens, the hallmark cell wall thickening of the endothecium was defective. Our findings suggest that OsTGA10 plays a mediator role between organ identity determination and tapetum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in rice stamen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, between tapetum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and microspore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, and between various regulatory components required for tapetum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Furthermore, the defective endothecium in <i>ostga10</i> implies that cell wall thickening of endothecium is dependent on tapetum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment.</p>

Pausing of Chloroplast Ribosomes Is Induced by Multiple Features and Is Linked to the Assembly of Photosynthetic Complexes<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Many mRNAs contain pause <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s that briefly interrupt the progress of translation. Specific features that induce ribosome pausing have been described; however, their individual contributions to pause-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> formation, and the overall biological significance of ribosome pausing, remain largely unclear. We have taken advantage of the compact genome of chloroplasts to carry out a plastid genome-wide survey of pause <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s, as a basis for studying the impact of pausing on posttranslational processes. Based on ribosomal profiling of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) chloroplast mRNAs, we demonstrate that a combination of factors—mRNA secondary structure, internal Shine-Dalgarno sequences, and positively charged amino acids in the nascent peptide chain—explains 95% of the major pause <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s on plastid mRNAs, whereas codon usage has little impact. The distribution of the pause <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s is nonrandom and conforms to distinct patterns in the vicinity of sequences coding for transmembrane domains, which depend on their orientation within the membrane as well as being next to sequences coding for cofactor binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s. We found strong indications that the mechanisms causing ribosomal pausing and at least some of the ribosomes pause <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed between distantly related plant species. In addition, the positions of features that cause pausing are well <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed in photoautotrophic plants, but less so in their nonphotosynthetic, parasitic relatives, implying that the synthesis and assembly of photosynthetic multiprotein complexes requires localized ribosome pausing.</p>

Arabidopsis β-Amylase2 Is a K<sup>+</sup>-Requiring, Catalytic Tetramer with Sigmoidal Kinetics
<p>The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) genome contains nine β-amylase (<i>BAM</i>) genes, some of which play important roles in starch hydrolysis. However, little is known about BAM2, a plastid-localized enzyme reported to have extremely low catalytic activity. Using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation of intron positions, we determined that the nine Arabidopsis <i>BAM</i> genes fall into two distinct subfamilies. A similar pattern was found in each major lineage of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants, suggesting that these subfamilies diverged prior to the origin of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis indicated that <i>BAM2</i> is the ancestral member of one of these subfamilies. This finding, along with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation of amino acids in the active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> of BAM2, suggested that it might be catalytically active. We then identified KCl as necessary for BAM2 activity. Unlike BAM1, BAM3, and BAM5, three Arabidopsis BAMs that all exhibited hyperbolic kinetics, BAM2 exhibited sigmoidal kinetics with a Hill coefficient of over 3. Using multi-angle light scattering, we determined that BAM2 was a tetramer, whereas BAM5 was a monomer. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed residues from a diverse set of BAM2 orthologs were mapped onto a homology model of the protein, revealing a large, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed surface away from the active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> that we hypothesize is a secondary carbohydrate-binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>. Introduction of bulky methionine for glycine at two points on this surface reduced catalytic activity significantly without disrupting the tetrameric structure. Expression analysis indicated that BAM2 is more closely coexpressed with other starch degradation enzymes than any other BAM, suggesting that BAM2 may play an important role in starch degradation in plants.</p>

Giberellic Acid-Stimulated Transcript Proteins Evolved through Successive Conjugation of Novel Motifs and Their Subfunctionalization
<p><i>Gibberellic Acid Stimulated Transcript</i> (<i>GAST</i>)-like genes encode small polypeptides, some of which have been implicated in diverse biological processes regulating plant growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. However, the occurrence of GASTs among plants, their protein structures, and the mechanisms by which they evolved remain elusive. Here, using a customized workflow, we report genes encoding GAST proteins, identify novel motifs and evolutionary patterns contributing to the subfunctionalization of GAST domains, and explore functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation across diverse plant groups. We show that <i>GAST</i>-like sequences evolved initially in the vascular plant <i>Selaginella moellendorffii</i>, after the divergence from bryophytes, and later emerged in gymnosperms and angiosperms. GASTs in angiosperms are characterized by four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed novel motifs; however, relatively fewer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed motifs exist in pteridophytes and gymnosperms. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the GAST-Cysteine Rich1 motif evolved early in the <i>S. moellendorffii</i> GAST, which further acquired subfunctionalization through successive conjugation of other motifs and remained <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed across plants, as supported by their collinearity. Functional characterization of two orthologs from the dicot Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>; <i>Gibberellic Acid-Stimulated Arabidopsis 10</i>) and the monocot rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>; <i>Gibberellic Acid Stimulated Transcript-Related 9</i>) suggests hormonal regulation, novel roles in seed germination, and functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation among diverse plant groups. Computational modeling predicts that these <i>GAST</i> genes are regulated by several factors, including the phytohormones gibberellin and abscisic acid, through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed cis-motifs present in their promoters, and that they might act as signaling molecules in a complex feedback loop. Thus, our study identifies <i>GAST</i>s and their encoded proteins, uncovers their structure, novel motifs, and evolutionary pattern among plants, and suggests their functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation.</p>

Importin β4 Mediates Nuclear Import of GRF-Interacting Factors to Control Ovule Development in Arabidopsis
<p>Ovule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment is critical for seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and plant reproduction. Multiple transcription factors (TFs) have been reported to mediate ovule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. However, it is not clear which intracellular components regulate these TFs during ovule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. After their synthesis, TFs are transported into the nucleus a process regulated by karyopherins commonly known as importin alpha and β. Around half of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) importin β-coding genes have been functionally characterized but only two with specific cargos have been identified. We report here that Arabidopsis IMPORTIN β4 (IMB4) regulates ovule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment through nucleocytoplasmic transport of transcriptional coactivator growth regulating factors–interacting factors (GIFs). Mutations in <i>IMB4</i> impaired ovule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment by affecting integument growth. <i>imb4</i> mutants were also defective in embryo sac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, leading to partial female sterility. IMB4 directly interacts with GIFs and is critical for the nucleocytoplasmic transport of GIF1. Finally, functional loss of <i>GIF</i>s resulted in ovule defects similar to those in <i>imb4</i> mutants, whereas enhanced expression of <i>GIF1</i> partially restored the fertility of <i>imb4</i>. The results presented here uncover a novel genetic pathway regulating ovule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and reveal the upstream regulator of GIFs.</p>

Auxin Function in the Brown Alga <i>Dictyota dichotoma</i>
<p>Auxin controls body plan patterning in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants and has been proposed to play a similar role in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of brown algae (Phaeophyta) despite their distant evolutionary relationship with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants. The mechanism of auxin action in brown algae remains controversial because of contradicting conclusions derived from pharmacological studies on <i>Fucus</i>. In this study, we used <i>Dictyota</i> <i>dichotoma</i> as a model system to show that auxin plays a role during the apical-basal patterning of the embryo of brown algae. Indole-3-acetic acid was detectable in <i>D. dichotoma</i> germlings and mature tissue. Although two-celled <i>D. dichotoma</i> zygotes normally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong> a rhizoid from one pole and a thallus meristem from the other, addition of exogenous auxins to one-celled embryos affected polarization, and both poles of the spheroidal embryo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ed into rhizoids instead. The effect was strongest at lower pH and when variable extrinsic informational cues were applied. 2-[4-(diethylamino)-2-hydroxybenzoyl]benzoic acid, an inhibitor of the ABC-B/multidrug resistance/P-glycoprotein subfamily of transporters in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants, affected rhizoid formation by increasing rhizoid branching and inducing ectopic rhizoids. An in silico survey of auxin genes suggested that a diverse range of biosynthesis genes and transport genes, such as PIN-LIKES, and the ATP-binding cassette subfamily (ABC-B/multidrug resistance/P-glycoprotein) transporters from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants have homologs in <i>D. dichotoma</i> and <i>Ectocarpus siliculosus</i>. Together with reports on auxin function in basal lineages of green algae, these results suggest that auxin function predates the divergence between the green and brown lineage and the transition toward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants.</p>

Jasmonate Negatively Regulates Stomatal Development in Arabidopsis Cotyledons
<p>Stomata are ports that facilitate gas and water vapor exchange between plants and their environment. Stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment is strictly regulated by endogenous signals and environmental cues. Jasmonate is an important signal that modulates multiple physiological processes in plants, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying its interactions with other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>mental signaling pathways remain poorly understood. Here, we show that jasmonate negatively regulates stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) cotyledons. Cotyledons of the wild type and stomata-overproliferating mutants (such as <i>too many mouths-1</i> and <i>stomatal density and distribution1-1</i>) treated with methyl jasmonate exhibit a clear reduction in stomata number. By contrast, blocking endogenous jasmonate biosynthesis or perception enhanced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Moreover, three MYC transcription factors involved in jasmonate signaling, MYC2, MYC3, and MYC4, were found to redundantly modulate jasmonate-inhibited stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. A genetic analysis showed that these MYC proteins act upstream of the SPEECHLESS and FAMA transcription factors to mediate stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Furthermore, jasmonate repression of stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment is dependent on these three MYC transcription factors, as stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of the <i>myc2 myc3 myc4</i> triple mutant was insensitive to methyl jasmonate treatment. Collectively, our study demonstrates that jasmonate and MYC transcription factors negatively regulate stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in Arabidopsis cotyledons.</p>

Origins and Evolution of Stomatal Development
<p>The fossil record suggests stomata-like pores were present on the surfaces of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants over 400 million years ago. Whether stomata arose once or whether they arose independently across newly evolving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plant lineages has long been a matter of debate. In Arabidopsis, a genetic toolbox has been identified that tightly controls stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and patterning. This includes the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors <i>SPEECHLESS</i> (<i>SPCH</i>), <i>MUTE</i>, <i>FAMA</i>, and <i>ICE/SCREAMs</i> (<i>SCRMs</i>), which promote stomatal formation. These factors are regulated via a signaling cascade, which includes mobile <i>EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR</i> (<i>EPF</i>) peptides to enforce stomatal spacing. Mosses and hornworts, the most ancient extant lineages to possess stomata, possess orthologs of these Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) stomatal toolbox genes, and manipulation in the model bryophyte <i>Physcomitrella patens</i> has shown that the bHLH and EPF components are also required for moss stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and patterning. This supports an ancient and tightly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed genetic origin of stomata. Here, we review recent discoveries and, by interrogating newly available plant genomes, we advance the story of stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and patterning across <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plant evolution. Furthermore, we identify potential orthologs of the key toolbox genes in a hornwort, further supporting a single ancient genetic origin of stomata in the ancestor to all stomatous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants.</p>

A Rice Ca<sup>2+</sup> Binding Protein Is Required for Tapetum Function and Pollen Formation
<p>In flowering plants, successful male reproduction requires the sophisticated interaction between somatic anther wall layers and reproductive cells. Timely degradation of the innermost tissue of the anther wall layer, the tapetal layer, is critical for pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a well-known stimulus for plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, but whether it plays a role in affecting male reproduction remains elusive. Here we report a role of Defective in Exine Formation 1 (OsDEX1) in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), a Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding protein, in regulating rice tapetal cell degradation and pollen formation. In <i>osdex1</i> anthers, tapetal cell degeneration is delayed and degradation of the callose wall surrounding the microspores is compromised, leading to aborted pollen formation and complete male sterility. <i>OsDEX1</i> is expressed in tapetal cells and microspores during early anther <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Recombinant OsDEX1 is able to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> and regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in vitro, and <i>osdex1</i> exhibited disturbed Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in tapetal cells. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that OsDEX1 may have a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed function in binding Ca<sup>2+</sup> in flowering plants, and genetic complementation of pollen wall defects of an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>dex1</i> mutant confirmed its evolutionary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation in pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Collectively, these findings suggest that OsDEX1 plays a fundamental role in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of tapetal cells and pollen formation, possibly via modulating the Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis during pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment.</p>

FUBAR: A Fast, Unconstrained Bayesian AppRoximation for Inferring Selection
<p>Model-based analyses of natural selection often categorize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s into a relatively small number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> classes. Forcing each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> to belong to one of these classes places unrealistic constraints on the distribution of selection parameters, which can result in misleading inference due to model misspecification. We present an approximate hierarchical Bayesian method using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) routine that ensures robustness against model misspecification by averaging over a large number of predefined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> classes. This leaves the distribution of selection parameters essentially unconstrained, and also allows <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s experiencing positive and purifying selection to be identified orders of magnitude faster than by existing methods. We demonstrate that popular random effects likelihood methods can produce misleading results when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s assigned to the same <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> class experience different levels of positive or purifying selection—an unavoidable scenario when using a small number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> classes. Our Fast Unconstrained Bayesian AppRoximation (FUBAR) is unaffected by this problem, while achieving higher power than existing unconstrained (fixed effects likelihood) methods. The speed advantage of FUBAR allows us to analyze larger data sets than other methods: We illustrate this on a large influenza hemagglutinin data set (3,142 sequences). FUBAR is available as a batch file within the latest HyPhy distribution (<ext-link>http://www.hyphy.org</ext-link>), as well as on the Datamonkey web server (<ext-link>http://www.datamonkey.org/</ext-link>).</p>

Non-invasive long-term fluorescence live imaging of <i>Tribolium castaneum</i> embryos
<p>Insect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment has contributed significantly to our understanding of metazoan <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. However, most information has been obtained by analyzing a single species, the fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Embryonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of the red flour beetle <i>Tribolium castaneum</i> differs fundamentally from that of <i>Drosophila</i> in aspects such as short-germ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, embryonic leg <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, extensive extra-embryonic membrane formation and non-involuted head <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Although <i>Tribolium</i> has become the second most important insect model organism, previous live imaging attempts have addressed only specific questions and no long-term live imaging data of <i>Tribolium</i> embryogenesis have been available. By combining light sheet-based fluorescence microscopy with a novel mounting method, we achieved complete, continuous and non-invasive fluorescence live imaging of <i>Tribolium</i> embryogenesis at high spatiotemporal resolution. The embryos survived the 2-day or longer imaging process, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ed into adults and produced fertile progeny. Our data document all morphogenetic processes from the rearrangement of the uniform blastoderm to the onset of regular muscular movement in the same embryo and in four orientations, contributing significantly to the understanding of <i>Tribolium</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Furthermore, we created a comprehensive chronological table of <i>Tribolium</i> embryogenesis, integrating most previous work and providing a reference for future studies. Based on our observations, we provide evidence that serosa window closure and serosa opening, although deferred by more than 1 day, are linked. All our long-term imaging datasets are available as a resource for the community. <i>Tribolium</i> is only the second insect species, after <i>Drosophila</i>, for which non-invasive long-term fluorescence live imaging has been achieved.</p>

WT1 regulates the development of the posterior taste field
<p>Despite the importance of taste in determining nutrient intake, our understanding of the processes that control the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of the peripheral taste system is lacking. Several early regulators of taste <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment have been identified, including sonic hedgehog, bone morphogenetic protein 4 and multiple members of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. However, the regulation of these factors, including their induction, remains poorly understood. Here, we identify a crucial role for the Wilms' tumor 1 protein (WT1) in circumvallate (CV) papillae <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. WT1 is a transcription factor that is important in the normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of multiple tissues, including both the olfactory and visual systems. In mice, WT1 expression is detectable by E12.5, when the CV taste placode begins to form. In mice lacking WT1, the CV fails to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong> normally and markers of early taste <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment are dysregulated compared with wild type. We demonstrate that expression of the WT1 target genes <i>Lef1</i>, <i>Ptch1</i> and <i>Bmp4</i> is significantly reduced in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing tongue tissue derived from <i>Wt1</i> knockout mice and that, in normal tongue, WT1 is bound to the promoter regions of these genes. Moreover, siRNA knockdown of WT1 in cultured taste cells leads to a reduction in the expression of <i>Lef1</i> and <i>Ptch1</i>. Our data identify WT1 as a crucial transcription factor in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of the CV through the regulation of multiple signaling pathways that have established roles in the formation and patterning of taste placodes.</p>

Winter drought impairs xylem phenology, anatomy and growth in Mediterranean Scots pine forests
<p>Continental Mediterranean forests face drought but also cold spells and both climate extremes can impair the resilience capacity of these forests. Climate warming could amplify the negative effects of cold spells by inducing premature dehardening. Here we capitalize on a winter drought-induced dieback triggered by a cold spell which occurred in December 2001 affecting Scots pine forests in eastern Spain. We assessed post-dieback recovery by quantifying and comparing radial growth and xylem anatomy of non-declining (ND, crown cover >50%) and declining (D, crown cover ≤50%) trees in two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s (VP, Villarroya de los Pinares; TO, Torrijas). We also characterized xylogenesis in both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s and aboveground productivity in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> VP. Dieback caused legacy effects since needle loss, a 60% reduction in litter fall and radial-growth decline characterized D-trees 3 years after dieback symptoms started appearing in spring 2002. D-trees formed collapsed tracheids in the 2002-ring, particularly in the most affected VP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> where xylogenesis differences between ND and D trees were most noticeable. The lower growth rates of D-trees were caused by a shorter duration of their major xylogenesis phases. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> VP the radial-enlargement and wall-thickening of tracheids were significantly reduced in D-trees as compared to ND-trees because these xylogenesis phases tended to start earlier and end later in ND-trees. Gompertz models fitted to tracheid production predicted that maximum growth rates occurred 11–12 days earlier in ND than in D-trees. The formation of radially-enlarging tracheids was enhanced by longer days in both study <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s and also by wetter conditions in the driest TO <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>, but xylogenesis sensitivity to climate was reduced in D-trees. Winter-drought dieback impairs xylem anatomy and phenology, aboveground productivity, xylogenesis and growth in Mediterranean Scots pine populations. Affected stands show a costly post-dieback recovery challenging their resilience ability.</p>

Dual phosphorylation of Ric-8A enhances its ability to mediate G protein α subunit folding and to stimulate guanine nucleotide exchange
<p>Resistance to inhibitors of cholinesterase-8A (Ric-8A) and Ric-8B are essential biosynthetic chaperones for heterotrimeric G protein α subunits. We provide evidence for the direct regulation of Ric-8A cellular activity by dual phosphorylation. Using proteomics, Western blotting, and mutational analyses, we determined that Ric-8A was constitutively phosphorylated at five serines and threonines by the protein kinase CK2. Phosphorylation of Ser<sup>435</sup> and Thr<sup>440</sup> in rat Ric-8A (corresponding to Ser<sup>436</sup> and Thr<sup>441</sup> in human Ric-8A) was required for high-affinity binding to Gα subunits, efficient stimulation of Gα subunit guanine nucleotide exchange, and mediation of Gα subunit folding. The CK2 consensus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s that contain Ser<sup>435</sup> and Thr<sup>440</sup> are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed in Ric-8 homologs from worms to mammals. We found that the homologous residues in mouse Ric-8B, Ser<sup>468</sup> and Ser<sup>473</sup>, were also phosphorylated. Mutation of the genomic copy of <i>ric-8</i> in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> to encode alanine in the homologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s resulted in characteristic <i>ric-8</i> reduction-of-function phenotypes that are associated with defective G<sub>q</sub> and G<sub>s</sub> signaling, including reduced locomotion and defective egg laying. The <i>C. elegans ric-8</i> phosphorylation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> mutant phenotypes were partially rescued by chemical stimulation of G<sub>q</sub> signaling. These results indicate that dual phosphorylation represents a critical form of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed Ric-8 regulation and demonstrate that Ric-8 proteins are needed for effective Gα signaling. The position of the CK2-phosphorylated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s within a structural model of Ric-8A reveals that these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s contribute to a key acidic and negatively charged surface that may be important for its interactions with Gα subunits.</p>

Toward a chemical vaccine for malaria
<p>Despite considerable progress in combating malaria, it remains one of the world's most important infectious diseases, with 50% of the world population at risk of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing the disease and a mortality rate of ∼0.5 million annually (<i>1</i>). The lack of an effective vaccine and the relentless ability of the <i>Plasmodium</i> para<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> responsible for malaria to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong> drug resistance has contributed to the continuing disease burden (<i>2</i>–<i>4</i>). Artemisinin-combination therapies (ACTs) are the mainstay of current treatment regimens, but decreased effectiveness, particularly in Southeast Asia, threatens our ability to control this disease. A global effort to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong> new drugs for the treatment and prevention of malaria is under way but not guaranteed to succeed (<i>3</i>, <i>5</i>, <i>6</i>). These efforts include a systematic attempt to target all life-cycle stages of the para<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> to allow combination therapies to be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ed, which are also likely to reduce the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of resistance. High-throughput screens (HTSs) designed to identify small drug-like molecules that prevent growth of blood-stage para<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s (<i>7</i>, <i>8</i>) and target-based approaches have identified new compounds that are currently in preclinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and/or various stages of human clinical trials for treatment of malaria (<i>3</i>).

MAPINS, a Highly Efficient Detection Method That Identifies Insertional Mutations and Complex DNA Rearrangements
<p>Insertional mutagenesis, in which a piece of exogenous DNA is integrated randomly into the genomic DNA of the recipient cell, is a useful method to generate new mutants with phenotypes of interest. The unicellular green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> is an outstanding model for studying many biological processes. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ed a new computational algorithm, MAPINS (mapping insertions), to efficiently identify insertion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s created by the integration of an <i>APHVIII</i> (<i>aminoglycoside 3′-phosphotransferase VIII</i>) cassette that confers paromomycin resistance. Using whole-genome sequencing data, this method eliminates the need for genomic DNA manipulation and retains all the sequencing information provided by paired-end sequencing. We experimentally verified 38 insertion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s out of 41 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s (93%) identified by MAPINS from 20 paromomycin-resistant strains. Using meiotic analysis of 18 of these strains, we identified insertion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s that completely cosegregate with paromomycin resistance. In six of the seven strains with a mutant phenotype, we demonstrated complete cosegregation of the mutant phenotype and the verified insertion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>. In addition, we provide direct evidence of complex rearrangements of genomic DNA in five strains, three of which involve the <i>APHVIII</i> insertion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>. We suggest that strains obtained by insertional mutagenesis are more complicated than expected from previous analyses in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>. To map the locations of some complex insertions, we designed 49 molecular markers based on differences identified via whole-genome sequencing between wild-type strains CC-124 and CC-125. Overall, MAPINS provides a low-cost, efficient method to characterize insertional mutants in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>.</p>

Transcriptome Profiling of Wheat Inflorescence Development from Spikelet Initiation to Floral Patterning Identified Stage-Specific Regulatory Genes
<p>Early reproductive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in cereals is crucial for final grain number per spike and hence the yield potential of the crop. To date, however, no systematic analyses of gene expression profiles during this important process have been conducted for common wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>). Here, we studied the transcriptome profiles at four stages of early wheat reproductive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, from spikelet initiation to floral organ differentiation. <i>K</i>-means clustering and stage-specific transcript identification detected dynamically expressed homeologs of important transcription regulators in spikelet and floral meristems that may be involved in spikelet initiation, floret meristem specification, and floral organ patterning, as inferred from their homologs in model plants. Small RNA transcriptome sequencing discovered key microRNAs that were differentially expressed during wheat inflorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment alongside their target genes, suggesting that miRNA-mediated regulatory mechanisms for floral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment may be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed in cereals and Arabidopsis. Our analysis was further substantiated by the functional characterization of the <i>ARGONAUTE1d</i> (<i>AGO1d</i>) gene, which was initially expressed in stamen primordia and later in the tapetum during anther maturation. In agreement with its stage-specific expression pattern, the loss of function of the predominantly expressed B homeolog of <i>AGO1d</i> in a tetraploid durum wheat mutant resulted in smaller anthers with more infertile pollens than the wild type and a reduced grain number per spike. Together, our work provides a first glimpse of the gene regulatory networks in wheat inflorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment that may be pivotal for floral and grain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, highlighting potential targets for genetic manipulation to improve future wheat yields.</p>

<i>De novo</i> formation of nucleoli in developing mouse embryos originating from enucleolated zygotes
<p>The large, compact oocyte nucleoli, sometimes referred to as nucleolus precursor bodies (NPBs), are essential for embryonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in mammals; in their absence, the oocytes complete maturation and can be fertilized, but no nucleoli are formed in the zygote or embryo, leading to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>mental failure. It has been convincingly documented that zygotes inherit the oocyte nucleolar material and form NPBs again in pronuclei. It is commonly accepted that during early embryonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, the original compact zygote NPBs gradually transform into reticulated nucleoli of somatic cells. Here, we show that zygote NPBs are not required for embryonic and full-term <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in the mouse. When NPBs were removed from late-stage zygotes by micromanipulation, the enucleolated zygotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ed to the blastocyst stage and, after transfer to recipients, live pups were obtained. We also describe <i>de novo</i> formation of nucleoli in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing embryos. After removal of NPBs from zygotes, they formed new nucleoli after several divisions. These results indicate that the zygote NPBs are not used in embryonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and that the nucleoli in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing embryos originate from <i>de novo</i> synthesized materials.</p>

Classifying drivers of global forest loss

Timing and Order of the Molecular Events Marking the Onset of Berry Ripening in Grapevine
<p>Grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) is a model for the investigation of physiological and biochemical changes during the formation and ripening of nonclimacteric fleshy fruits. However, the order and complexity of the molecular events during fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment remain poorly understood. To identify the key molecular events controlling berry formation and ripening, we created a highly detailed transcriptomic and metabolomic map of berry <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, based on samples collected every week from fruit set to maturity in two grapevine genotypes for three consecutive years, resulting in 219 samples. Major transcriptomic changes were represented by coordinated waves of gene expression associated with early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, veraison (onset of ripening)/midripening, and late-ripening and were consistent across vintages. The two genotypes were clearly distinguished by metabolite profiles and transcriptional changes occurring primarily at the veraison/midripening phase. Coexpression analysis identified a core network of transcripts as well as variations in the within-module connections representing varietal differences. By focusing on transcriptome rearrangements close to veraison, we identified two rapid and successive shared transitions involving genes whose expression profiles precisely locate the timing of the molecular reprogramming of berry <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Functional analyses of two transcription factors, markers of the first transition, suggested that they participate in a hierarchical cascade of gene activation at the onset of ripening. This study defined the initial transcriptional events that mark and trigger the onset of ripening and the molecular network that characterizes the whole process of berry <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, providing a framework to model fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and maturation in grapevine.</p>

FLOURY SHRUNKEN ENDOSPERM1 Connects Phospholipid Metabolism and Amyloplast Development in Rice
<p>Starch synthesized and stored in amyloplasts serves as the major energy storage molecule in cereal endosperm. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying amyloplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and starch synthesis, we isolated a series of floury endosperm mutants in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). We identified the rice mutant <i>floury shrunken endosperm1</i> (<i>fse1</i>), which exhibited obvious defects in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of compound starch grains, decreased starch content, and altered starch physicochemical features. Map-based cloning showed that <i>FSE1</i> encodes a phospholipase-like protein homologous to phosphatidic acid-preferring phospholipase A<sub>1</sub>. <i>FSE1</i> was expressed ubiquitously with abundant levels observed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing seeds and roots. FSE1 was localized to both the cytosol and intracellular membranes. Lipid profiling indicated that total extra-plastidic lipids and phosphatidic acid were increased in <i>fse1</i> plants, suggesting that FSE1 may exhibit in vivo phospholipase A<sub>1</sub> activity on phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidyl-Ser, phosphatidylethanolamine, and, in particular, phosphatidic acid. Additionally, the total galactolipid content in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing <i>fse1</i> endosperm was significantly reduced, which may cause abnormal amyloplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment.

Transcriptomic Insights into Phenological Development and Cold Tolerance of Wheat Grown in the Field
<p>Cold acclimation and winter survival in cereal species is determined by complicated environmentally regulated gene expression. However, studies investigating these complex cold responses are mostly conducted in controlled environments that only consider the responses to single environmental variables. In this study, we have comprehensively profiled global transcriptional responses in crowns of field-grown spring and winter wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) genotypes and their near-isogenic lines with the <i>VRN-A1</i> alleles swapped. This in-depth analysis revealed multiple signaling, interactive pathways that influence cold tolerance and phenological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment to optimize plant growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in preparation for a wide range of over-winter stresses. Investigation of genetic differences at the <i>VRN-A1</i> locus revealed that a vernalization requirement maintained a higher level of cold response pathways while <i>VRN-A1</i> genetically promoted floral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Our results also demonstrated the influence of genetic background on the expression of cold and flowering pathways. The link between delayed shoot apex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and the induction of cold tolerance was reflected by the gradual up-regulation of abscisic acid-dependent and C-REPEAT-BINDING FACTOR pathways. This was accompanied by the down-regulation of key genes involved in meristem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment as the autumn progressed. The chromosome location of differentially expressed genes between the winter and spring wheat genetic backgrounds showed a striking pattern of biased gene expression on chromosomes 6A and 6D, indicating a transcriptional regulation at the genome level. This finding adds to the complexity of the genetic cascades and gene interactions that determine the evolutionary patterns of both phenological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and cold tolerance traits in wheat.</p>

Primitive Auxin Response without TIR1 and Aux/IAA in the Charophyte Alga <i>Klebsormidium nitens</i>
<p>The phytohormone auxin regulates many aspects of growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants, but the origin and evolution of auxin signaling and response mechanisms remain largely unknown. Indeed, it remains to be investigated whether auxin-related pathways diverged before the emergence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants. To address this knowledge deficit, we analyzed auxin responses in the charophyte alga <i>Klebsormidium nitens</i> NIES-2285, whose ancestor diverged from a green algal ancestor during the evolution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants. This strain is the same as <i>Klebsormidium flaccidum</i> NIES-2285, for which the draft genome was sequenced in 2014, and was taxonomically reclassified as <i>K. nitens</i>. This genome sequence revealed genes involved in auxin responses. Furthermore, the auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) was detected in cultures of <i>K. nitens</i>, but <i>K. nitens</i> lacks the central regulators of the canonical auxin-signaling pathway found in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants. Exogenous IAA inhibited cell division and cell elongation in <i>K. nitens</i>. Inhibitors of auxin biosynthesis and of polar auxin transport also inhibited cell division and elongation. Moreover, exogenous IAA rapidly induced expression of a LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES-DOMAIN transcription factor. These results suggest that <i>K. nitens</i> has acquired the part of the auxin system that regulates transcription and cell growth without the requirement for the central players that govern auxin signaling in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants.</p>

<i>Small kernel2</i> Encodes a Glutaminase in Vitamin B<sub>6</sub> Biosynthesis Essential for Maize Seed Development
<p>Vitamin B<sub>6</sub>, an essential cofactor for a range of biochemical reactions and a potent antioxidant, plays important roles in plant growth, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, and stress tolerance. Vitamin B<sub>6</sub> deficiency causes embryo lethality in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), but the specific role of vitamin B<sub>6</sub> biosynthesis in endosperm <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment has not been fully addressed, especially in monocot crops, where endosperm constitutes the major portion of the grain. Through molecular characterization of a <i>small kernel2</i> (<i>smk2</i>) mutant in maize, we reveal that vitamin B<sub>6</sub> has differential effects on embryogenesis and endosperm <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in maize. The B<sub>6</sub> vitamer pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) is drastically reduced in both the <i>smk2</i> embryo and the endosperm. However, whereas embryogenesis of the <i>smk2</i> mutant is arrested at the transition stage, endosperm formation is nearly normal. Cloning reveals that <i>Smk2</i> encodes the glutaminase subunit of the PLP synthase complex involved in vitamin B<sub>6</sub> biosynthesis de novo. <i>Smk2</i> partially complements the Arabidopsis vitamin B<sub>6</sub>-deficient mutant <i>pdx2.1</i> and <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> pyridoxine auxotrophic mutant MML21. <i>Smk2</i> is constitutively expressed in the maize plant, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing embryos. Analysis of B<sub>6</sub> vitamers indicates that the endosperm accumulates a large amount of pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate (PMP). These results indicate that vitamin B<sub>6</sub> is essential to embryogenesis but has a reduced role in endosperm <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in maize. The vitamin B<sub>6</sub> required for seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment is synthesized in the seed, and the endosperm accumulates PMP probably as a storage form of vitamin B<sub>6</sub>.</p>

MtLAX2, a Functional Homologue of the Arabidopsis Auxin Influx Transporter AUX1, Is Required for Nodule Organogenesis
<p>Most legume plants can form nodules, specialized lateral organs that form on roots, and house nitrogen-fixing bacteria collectively called rhizobia. The uptake of the phytohormone auxin into cells is known to be crucial for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of lateral roots. To test the role of auxin influx in nodulation we used the auxin influx inhibitors 1-naphthoxyacetic acid (1-NOA) and 2-NOA, which we found reduced nodulation of <i>Medicago truncatula.</i> This suggested the possible involvement of the AUX/LAX family of auxin influx transporters in nodulation. Gene expression studies identified <i>MtLAX2</i>, a paralogue of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>AUX1</i>, as being induced at early stages of nodule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. <i>MtLAX2</i> is expressed in nodule primordia, the vasculature of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing nodules, and at the apex of mature nodules. The <i>MtLAX2</i> promoter contains several auxin response elements, and treatment with indole-acetic acid strongly induces <i>MtLAX2</i> expression in roots. <i>mtlax2</i> mutants displayed root phenotypes similar to Arabidopsis <i>aux1</i> mutants, including altered root gravitropism, fewer lateral roots, shorter root hairs, and auxin resistance. In addition, the activity of the synthetic DR5-GUS auxin reporter was strongly reduced in <i>mtlax2</i> roots. Following inoculation with rhizobia, <i>mtlax2</i> roots <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ed fewer nodules, had decreased DR5-GUS activity associated with infection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s, and had decreased expression of the early auxin responsive gene <i>ARF16a</i>.

Shoot Removal Induces Chloroplast Development in Roots via Cytokinin Signaling
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of plant chloroplasts is regulated by various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>mental, environmental, and hormonal cues. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment is repressed in roots via auxin signaling. However, roots <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong> chloroplasts when they are detached from the shoot. In contrast to auxin, cytokinin positively affects chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in roots, but the role and signaling pathway of cytokinin in the root greening response remain unclear. To understand the regulatory pathways of chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in the plant stress response, we examined the mechanisms underlying the conditional greening of detached roots. In wild-type Arabidopsis roots, shoot removal activates type B ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR (ARR)-mediated cytokinin signaling and induces chlorophyll accumulation and photosynthetic remodeling. ARR1 and ARR12 are essential for up-regulating nucleus- and plastid-encoded genes associated with chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in detached roots. In this process, WOUND INDUCED DEDIFFERENTIATION1 and class B GATA transcription factors (B-GATAs) act upstream and downstream of ARRs, respectively. Overexpression of B-GATAs promotes root greening, as does shoot removal, dependent on a light signaling transcription factor, LONG HYPOCOTYL5. Auxin represses the root greening response independent of ARR signaling. <i>GNC-LIKE</i> (<i>GNL</i>), a B-GATA, is strongly up-regulated in detached roots via ARR1 and ARR12 but is repressed by auxin, so <i>GNL</i> may function at the point of convergence of cytokinin and auxin signaling in the root greening response.</p>

The Genetic Control of Reproductive Development under High Ambient Temperature<xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>Ambient temperature has a large impact on reproductive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and grain yield in temperate cereals. However, little is known about the genetic control of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment under different ambient temperatures. Here, we demonstrate that in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), high ambient temperatures accelerate or delay reproductive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment depending on the photoperiod response gene <i>PHOTOPERIOD1</i> (<i>Ppd-H1</i>) and its upstream regulator <i>EARLY FLOWERING3</i> (<i>HvELF3</i>). A natural mutation in <i>Ppd-H1</i> prevalent in spring barley delayed floral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and reduced the number of florets and seeds per spike, while the wild-type <i>Ppd-H1</i> or a mutant <i>Hvelf3</i> allele accelerated floral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and maintained the seed number under high ambient temperatures. High ambient temperature delayed the expression phase and reduced the amplitude of clock genes and repressed the floral integrator gene <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T1</i> independently of the genotype. <i>Ppd-H1</i>-dependent variation in flowering time under different ambient temperatures correlated with relative expression levels of the <i>BARLEY MADS</i>-box genes <i>VERNALIZATION1</i> (<i>HvVRN1</i>), <i>HvBM3</i>, and <i>HvBM8</i> in the leaf. Finally, we show that <i>Ppd-H1</i> interacts with regulatory variation at <i>HvVRN1. Ppd-H1</i> only accelerated floral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in the background of a spring <i>HvVRN1</i> allele with a deletion in the regulatory intron. The full-length winter <i>Hvvrn1</i> allele was strongly down-regulated, and flowering was delayed by high temperatures irrespective of <i>Ppd-H1</i>. Our findings demonstrate that the photoperiodic and vernalization pathways interact to control flowering time and floret fertility in response to ambient temperature in barley.</p>

Two SERK Receptor-Like Kinases Interact with EMS1 to Control Anther Cell Fate Determination
<p>Cell signaling pathways mediated by leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs) are essential for plant growth, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, and defense. The EMS1 (EXCESS MICROSPOROCYTES1) LRR-RLK and its small protein ligand TPD1 (TAPETUM DETERMINANT1) play a fundamental role in somatic and reproductive cell differentiation during early anther <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). However, it is unclear whether other cell surface molecules serve as coregulators of EMS1. Here, we show that SERK1 (SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE1) and SERK2 LRR-RLKs act redundantly as coregulatory and physical partners of EMS1. The <i>SERK1</i>/<i>2</i> genes function in the same genetic pathway as <i>EMS1</i> in anther <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation, Forster resonance energy transfer, and coimmunoprecipitation approaches revealed that SERK1 interacted biochemically with EMS1. Transphosphorylation of EMS1 by SERK1 enhances EMS1 kinase activity. Among 12 in vitro autophosphorylation and transphosphorylation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s identified by tandem mass spectrometry, seven of them were found to be critical for EMS1 autophosphorylation activity. Furthermore, complementation test results suggest that phosphorylation of EMS1 is required for its function in anther <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Collectively, these data provide genetic and biochemical evidence of the interaction and phosphorylation between SERK1/2 and EMS1 in anther <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment.</p>

Gibberellins Regulate Ovule Integument Development by Interfering with the Transcription Factor ATS
<p>Gibberellins (GAs) are plant hormones that regulate most plant life cycle aspects, including flowering and fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Here, we demonstrate the implication of GAs in ovule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. DELLA proteins, negative GA response regulators, act as positive factors for ovule integument <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in a mechanism that involves transcription factor ABERRANT TESTA SHAPE (ATS). The seeds of the <i>della global</i> mutant, a complete loss-of-function of DELLA, and the <i>ats-1</i> mutant are remarkably similar, with a round shape, a disorganized testa, and viviparism. These defects are the result of an alteration in integuments that fail to fully <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong> and are shorter than in wild-type plants. <i>ats-1</i> also shows some GA-related phenotypes, for example, higher germination rates and early flowering. In fact, <i>ats-1</i> has elevated GA levels due to the activation of GA biosynthesis genes, which indicates that ATS inhibits GA biosynthesis. Moreover, DELLAs and ATS proteins interact, which suggests the formation of a transcriptional complex that regulates the expression of genes involved in integument growth. Therefore, the repression of GA biosynthesis by ATS would result in the stabilization of DELLAs to ensure correct ATS-DELLA complex formation. The requirement of both activities to coordinate proper ovule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment strongly argues that the ATS-DELLA complex acts as a key molecular factor. This work provides the first evidence for a role of GAs in ovule and seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Efficient Inference of Recombination Hot Regions in Bacterial Genomes
<p>In eukaryotes, detailed surveys of recombination rates have shown variation at multiple genomic scales and the presence of “hotspots” of highly elevated recombination. In bacteria, studies of recombination rate variation are less <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ed, in part because there are few analysis methods that take into account the clonal context within which bacterial evolution occurs. Here, we focus in particular on identifying “hot regions” of the genome where DNA is transferred frequently between isolates. We present a computationally efficient algorithm based on the recently <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ed “chromosome painting” algorithm, which characterizes patterns of haplotype sharing across a genome. We compare the average genome wide painting, which principally reflects clonal descent, with the painting for each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> which additionally reflects the specific deviations at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> due to recombination. Using simulated data, we show that hot regions have consistently higher deviations from the genome wide average than normal regions. We applied our approach to previously analyzed <i>Escherichia coli</i> genomes and revealed that the new method is highly correlated with the number of recombination events affecting each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> inferred by ClonalOrigin, a method that is only applicable to small numbers of genomes. Furthermore, we analyzed recombination hot regions in <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> by using 200 genomes. We identified three recombination hot regions, which are enriched for genes related to membrane proteins. Our approach and its implementation, which is downloadable from <ext-link>https://github.com/bioprojects/orderedPainting</ext-link>, will help to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong> a new phase of population genomic studies of recombination in prokaryotes.</p>

Intertidal sea stars (<i>Pisaster ochraceus</i>) alter body shape in response to wave action
<p>Sea stars are some of the largest mobile animals able to live in the harsh flow environment of wave-exposed, rocky intertidal shores. In addition, some species, such as the northeastern Pacific <i>Pisaster ochraceus</i>, are ecologically significant predators in a broad range of environments, from sheltered lagoons to the most wave-exposed shorelines. How they function and survive under such an extreme range of wave exposures remains a puzzle. Here we examine the ability of <i>P. ochraceus</i> to alter body form in response to variation in flow conditions. We found that sea stars in wave-exposed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s had narrower arms and were lighter per unit arm length than those from sheltered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s. Body form was tightly correlated with maximum velocity of breaking waves across four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s and also varied over time. In addition, field transplant experiments showed that these differences in shape were due primarily to phenotypic plasticity. Sea stars transplanted from a sheltered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> to a more wave-exposed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> became lighter per unit arm length, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ed narrower arms, after 3 months. The tight correlation between water flow and morphology suggests that wave force must be a significant selective factor acting on body shape. On exposed shores, narrower arms probably reduce both lift and drag in breaking waves. On protected shores, fatter arms may provide more thermal inertia to resist overheating, or more body volume for gametes. Such plastic changes in body shape represent a unique method by which sea stars adapt to spatial, seasonal and possibly short-term variation in flow conditions.</p>

The mean follow-up was 10.3 years (3 to 25) for OFD, 9.2 years (3.0   to 26.3) for OFD-like and 11.6 years (0.25 to 33) for adamantinoma.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean age at diagnosis for OFD was 13.5 years (1 to 49), 10.5   years (6 to 28) for OFD-like and 34 years (14 to 86) for adamantinoma.   A total of 24 of the 42 patients with OFD (57%) have not required   any treatment and have been managed with observation.

Disease Models & Mechanisms
Osteoarticular tissue infection and development of skeletal pathology in murine brucellosis
<p>Brucellosis, a frequent bacterial zoonosis, can produce debilitating chronic disease with involvement of multiple organs in human patients. Whereas acute brucellosis is well studied using the murine animal model, long-term complications of host-pathogen interaction remain largely elusive. Human brucellosis frequently results in persistent, chronic osteoarticular system involvement, with complications such as arthritis, spondylitis and sacroiliitis. Here, we focused on identifying infectious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s in the mouse that parallel <i>Brucella melitensis</i> foci observed in patients. <i>In vivo</i> imaging showed rapid bacterial dispersal to multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s of the murine axial skeleton. In agreement with these findings, immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of bacteria in bones and limbs, and in the lower spine vertebrae of the axial skeleton where they were preferentially located in the bone marrow. Surprisingly, some animals <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ed arthritis in paws and spine after infection, but without obvious bacteria in these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s. The identification of <i>Brucella</i> in the bones of mice corroborates the findings in humans that these osteoarticular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s are important niches for the persistence of <i>Brucella</i> in the host, but the mechanisms that mediate pathological manifestations in these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s remain unclear. Future studies addressing the immune responses within osteoarticular tissue foci could elucidate important tissue injury mediators and <i>Brucella</i> survival strategies.</p>

The development of zebrafish tendon and ligament progenitors
<p>Despite the importance of tendons and ligaments for transmitting movement and providing stability to the musculoskeletal system, their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment is considerably less well understood than that of the tissues they serve to connect. Zebrafish have been widely used to address questions in muscle and skeletal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, yet few studies describe their tendon and ligament tissues. We have analyzed in zebrafish the expression of several genes known to be enriched in mammalian tendons and ligaments, including <i>scleraxis</i> (<i>scx</i>), <i>collagen 1a2</i> (<i>col1a2</i>) and <i>tenomodulin</i> (<i>tnmd</i>), or in the tendon-like myosepta of the zebrafish (<i>xirp2a</i>). Co-expression studies with muscle and cartilage markers demonstrate the presence of <i>scxa</i>, <i>col1a2</i> and <i>tnmd</i> at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing muscle and cartilage, and <i>xirp2a</i> at the myotendinous junctions. We determined that the zebrafish craniofacial tendon and ligament progenitors are neural crest derived, as in mammals. Cranial and fin tendon progenitors can be induced in the absence of differentiated muscle or cartilage, although neighboring muscle and cartilage are required for tendon cell maintenance and organization, respectively. By contrast, myoseptal <i>scxa</i> expression requires muscle for its initiation. Together, these data suggest a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed role for muscle in tendon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Based on the similarities in gene expression, morphology, collagen ultrastructural arrangement and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>mental regulation with that of mammalian tendons, we conclude that the zebrafish tendon populations are homologous to their force-transmitting counterparts in higher vertebrates. Within this context, the zebrafish model can be used to provide new avenues for studying tendon biology in a vertebrate genetic system.</p>

RSL Class II Transcription Factors Guide the Nuclear Localization of RHL1 to Regulate Root Hair Development
<p>Root hairs are important for absorption of nutrients and water from the rhizosphere. The Root Hair Defective-Six Like (RSL) Class II family of transcription factors is expressed preferentially in root hairs and has a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed role in root hair <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants. We functionally characterized the seven members of the RSL Class II subfamily in the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) genome. In root hairs, six of these genes were preferentially expressed and four were strongly expressed. Phenotypic analysis of each mutant revealed that <i>Os07g39940</i> plays a major role in root hair formation, based on observations of a short root hair phenotype in those mutants. Overexpression (OX) for each of four family members in rice resulted in an increase in the density and length of root hairs. These four members contain a transcription activation domain and are targeted to the nucleus. They interact with rice Root Hairless1 (OsRHL1), a key regulator of root hair <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. When heterologously expressed in epidermal cells of <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaves, OsRHL1 was predominantly localized to the cytoplasm. When coexpressed with each of the four RSL Class II members, however, OsRLH1 was translocated to the nucleus. Transcriptome analysis using <i>Os07g39940-</i>OX plants revealed that 86 genes, including Class III peroxidases, were highly up-regulated. Furthermore, reactive oxygen species levels in the root hairs were increased in <i>Os07g39940-</i>OX plants but were drastically reduced in the <i>os07g39940</i> and <i>rhl1</i> mutants. Our results demonstrate that RSL Class II members function as essential regulators of root hair <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in rice.</p>

Functional Analysis of Short Linear Motifs in the Plant Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor SIAMESE
<p>Endoreplication, a modified cell cycle in which DNA is replicated without subsequent cell division, plays an important but poorly understood role in plant growth and in plant responses to biotic and abiotic stress. The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>SIAMESE</i> (<i>SIM</i>) gene encodes the first identified member of the SIAMESE-RELATED (SMR) family of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. <i>SIM</i> controls endoreplication during trichome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, and <i>sim</i> mutant trichomes divide several times instead of endoreplicating their DNA. The SMR family is defined by several short linear amino acid sequence motifs of largely unknown function, and family members have little sequence similarity to any known protein functional domains. Here, we investigated the roles of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed motifs in <i>SIM</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>-directed Arabidopsis mutants using several functional assays. We identified a potential cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>, which bears no resemblance to other known CDK interaction motifs. We also identified a potential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> of phosphorylation and two redundant nuclear localization sequences. Surprisingly, the only motif with similarity to the other family of plant CDK inhibitors, the INHIBITOR/INTERACTOR OF CDC2 KINASE/KIP-RELATED PROTEIN proteins, is not required for <i>SIM</i> function in vivo. Because even highly divergent members of the <i>SMR</i> family are able to replace <i>SIM</i> function in Arabidopsis trichomes, it is likely that the results obtained here for <i>SIM</i> will apply to other members of this plant-specific family of CDK inhibitors.</p>

Development Defects of Hydroxy-Fatty Acid-Accumulating Seeds Are Reduced by Castor Acyltransferases
<p>Researchers have long endeavored to produce modified fatty acids in easily managed crop plants where they are not natively found. An important step toward this goal has been the biosynthesis of these valuable products in model oilseeds. The successful production of such fatty acids has revealed barriers to the broad application of this technology, including low seed oil and low proportion of the introduced fatty acid and reduced seed vigor. Here, we analyze the impact of producing hydroxy-fatty acids on seedling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. We show that germinating seeds of a hydroxy-fatty acid-accumulating Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) line produce chlorotic cotyledons and suffer reduced photosynthetic capacity. These seedlings retain hydroxy-fatty acids in polar lipids, including chloroplast lipids, and exhibit decreased fatty acid synthesis. Triacylglycerol mobilization in seedling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment also is reduced, especially for lipids that include hydroxy-fatty acid moieties. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>mental defects are ameliorated by increased flux of hydroxy-fatty acids into seed triacylglycerol created through the expression of either castor (<i>Ricinus communis</i>) acyltransferase enzyme ACYL-COA:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE2 or PHOSPHOLIPID:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1A. Such expression increases both the level of total stored triacylglycerol and the rate at which it is mobilized, fueling fatty acid synthesis and restoring photosynthetic capacity. Our results suggest that further improvements in seedling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment may require the specific mobilization of triacylglycerol-containing hydroxy-fatty acids. Understanding the defects in early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment caused by the accumulation of modified fatty acids and providing mechanisms to circumvent these defects are vital steps in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment of tailored oil crops.</p>

Pollen Aperture Factor INP1 Acts Late in Aperture Formation by Excluding Specific Membrane Domains from Exine Deposition
<p>Accurate placement of extracellular materials is a critical part of cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. To study how cells achieve this accuracy, we use formation of pollen apertures as a model. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), three regions on the pollen surface lack deposition of pollen wall exine and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong> into apertures. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing pollen, Arabidopsis <i>INAPERTURATE POLLEN1</i> (INP1) protein acts as a marker for the preaperture domains, assembling there into three punctate lines. To understand the mechanism of aperture formation, we studied the dynamics of INP1 expression and localization and its relationship with the membrane domains at which it assembles. We found that INP1 assembly occurs after meiotic cytokinesis at the interface between the plasma membrane and the overlying callose wall, and requires the normal callose wall formation. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s of INP1 localization coincide with positions of protruding membrane ridges in proximity to the callose wall. Our data suggest that INP1 is a late-acting factor involved in keeping specific membrane domains next to the callose wall to prevent formation of exine at these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s.</p>

Two SUMO Proteases SUMO PROTEASE RELATED TO FERTILITY1 and 2 Are Required for Fertility in Arabidopsis
<p>In plants, the posttranslational modification small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) is involved in regulating several important <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>mental and cellular processes, including flowering time control and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. Here, we report two proteases, SUMO PROTEASE RELATED TO FERTILITY1 (SPF1) and SPF2, that regulate male and female gamete and embryo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and remove SUMO from proteins in vitro and in vivo. <i>spf1</i> mutants exhibit abnormal floral structures and embryo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, while <i>spf2</i> mutants exhibit largely a wild-type phenotype. However, <i>spf1 spf2</i> double mutants exhibit severe abnormalities in microgametogenesis, megagametogenesis, and embryo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, suggesting that the two genes are functionally redundant. Mutation of <i>SPF1</i> and <i>SPF2</i> genes also results in misexpression of generative- and embryo-specific genes. In vitro, SPF1 and SPF2 process SUMO1 precursors into a mature form, and as expected in vivo, <i>spf1</i> and <i>spf2</i> mutants accumulate SUMO conjugates. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified EMBRYO SAC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>MENT ARREST9 (EDA9) as an SPF1-interacting protein. In vivo, we demonstrate that EDA9 is sumolyated and that, in <i>spf1</i> mutants, EDA9-SUMO conjugates increase in abundance, demonstrating that EDA9 is a substrate of SPF1. Together, our results demonstrate that SPF1 and SPF2 are two SUMO proteases important for plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>).</p>

DELLA-GAF1 Complex Is a Main Component in Gibberellin Feedback Regulation of GA20 Oxidase 2
<p>Gibberellins (GAs) are phytohormones that regulate many aspects of plant growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, including germination, elongation, flowering, and floral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Negative feedback regulation contributes to homeostasis of the GA level. DELLAs are negative regulators of GA signaling and are rapidly degraded in the presence of GAs. DELLAs regulate many target genes, including <i>AtGA20ox2</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), encoding the GA-biosynthetic enzyme GA 20-oxidase. As DELLAs do not have an apparent DNA-binding motif, transcription factors that act in association with DELLA are necessary for regulating the target genes. Previous studies have identified GAI-ASSOCIATED FACTOR1 (GAF1) as such a DELLA interactor, with which DELLAs act as coactivators, and <i>AtGA20ox2</i> was identified as a target gene of the DELLA-GAF1 complex. In this study, electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that four GAF1-binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s exist in the <i>AtGA20ox2</i> promoter. Using transgenic plants, we further evaluated the contribution of the DELLA-GAF1 complex to GA feedback regulation. Mutations in four GAF1-binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s abolished the negative feedback of <i>AtGA20ox2</i> in transgenic plants. Our results showed that GAF1-binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong>s are necessary for GA feedback regulation of <i>AtGA20ox2</i>, suggesting that the DELLA-GAF1 complex is a main component of the GA feedback regulation of <i>AtGA20ox2</i>.</p>

Arabidopsis <i>LORELEI</i>, a Maternally Expressed Imprinted Gene, Promotes Early Seed Development
<p>In flowering plants, the female gametophyte controls pollen tube reception immediately before fertilization and regulates seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment immediately after fertilization, although the controlling mechanisms remain poorly understood. Previously, we showed that <i>LORELEI</i> (<i>LRE</i>), which encodes a putative glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane protein, is critical for pollen tube reception by the female gametophyte before fertilization and the initiation of seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment after fertilization. Here, we show that <i>LRE</i> is expressed in the synergid, egg, and central cells of the female gametophyte and in the zygote and proliferating endosperm of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed. Interestingly, <i>LRE</i> expression in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing seeds was primarily from the matrigenic <i>LRE</i> allele, indicating that <i>LRE</i> expression is imprinted. However, <i>LRE</i> was biallelically expressed in 8-d-old seedlings, indicating that the patrigenic allele does not remain silenced throughout the sporophytic generation. Regulation of imprinted <i>LRE</i> expression is likely novel, as <i>LRE</i> was not expressed in pollen or pollen tubes of mutants defective for MET1, DDM1, RNA-dependent DNA methylation, or MSI-dependent histone methylation. Additionally, the patrigenic <i>LRE</i> allele inherited from these mutants was not expressed in seeds. Surprisingly, and contrary to the predictions of the parental conflict hypothesis, LRE promotes growth in seeds, as loss of the matrigenic but not the patrigenic <i>LRE</i> allele caused delayed initiation of seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Our results showed that <i>LRE</i> is a rare imprinted gene that functions immediately after double fertilization and supported the model that a passage through the female gametophyte establishes monoalleleic expression of <i>LRE</i> in seeds and controls early seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment.</p>

Six-Rowed Spike3 (VRS3) Is a Histone Demethylase That Controls Lateral Spikelet Development in Barley
<p>The complex nature of crop genomes has long prohibited the efficient isolation of agronomically relevant genes. However, recent advances in next-generation sequencing technologies provide new ways to accelerate fine-mapping and gene isolation in crops. We used RNA sequencing of allelic <i>six-rowed spike3</i> (<i>vrs3</i>) mutants with altered spikelet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment for gene identification and functional analysis in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>). Variant calling in two allelic <i>vrs3</i> mutants revealed that <i>VRS3</i> encodes a putative histone Lys demethylase with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed zinc finger and Jumonji C and N domain. Sanger sequencing of this candidate gene in independent allelic <i>vrs3</i> mutants revealed a series of mutations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed domains, thus confirming our candidate as the <i>VRS3</i> gene and suggesting that the row type in barley is determined epigenetically. Global transcriptional profiling in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing shoot apical meristems of <i>vrs3</i> suggested that VRS3 acts as a transcriptional activator of the row-type genes <i>VRS1</i> (<i>Hv.HOMEOBOX1</i>) and <i>INTERMEDIUM-C</i> (<i>INT-C</i>; <i>Hv.TEOSINTE BRANCHED1</i>). Comparative transcriptome analysis of the row-type mutants <i>vrs3</i>, <i>vrs4</i> (<i>Hv.RAMOSA2</i>), and <i>int-c</i> confirmed that all three genes act as transcriptional activators of <i>VRS1</i> and quantitative variation in the expression levels of <i>VRS1</i> in these mutants correlated with differences in the number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ed lateral spikelets. The identification of genes and pathways affecting seed number in small grain cereals will enable to further unravel the transcriptional networks controlling this important yield component.</p>

Diversification of Root Hair Development Genes in Vascular Plants
<p>The molecular genetic program for root hair <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment has been studied intensively in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). To understand the extent to which this program might operate in other plants, we conducted a large-scale comparative analysis of root hair <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment genes from diverse vascular plants, including eudicots, monocots, and a lycophyte. Combining phylogenetics and transcriptomics, we discovered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation of a core set of root hair genes across all vascular plants, which may derive from an ancient program for unidirectional cell growth coopted for root hair <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment during vascular plant evolution. Interestingly, we also discovered preferential diversification in the structure and expression of root hair <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment genes, relative to other root hair- and root-expressed genes, among these species. These differences enabled the definition of sets of genes and gene functions that were acquired or lost in specific lineages during vascular plant evolution. In particular, we found substantial divergence in the structure and expression of genes used for root hair patterning, suggesting that the Arabidopsis transcriptional regulatory mechanism is not shared by other species. To our knowledge, this study provides the first comprehensive view of gene expression in a single plant cell type across multiple species.</p>

Gametophyte Development Needs Mitochondrial Coproporphyrinogen III Oxidase Function
<p>Tetrapyrrole biosynthesis is one of the most essential metabolic pathways in almost all organisms. Coproporphyrinogen III oxidase (CPO) catalyzes the conversion of coproporphyrinogen III into protoporphyrinogen IX in this pathway. Here, we report that mutation in the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) CPO-coding gene <i>At5g63290</i> (<i>AtHEMN1</i>) adversely affects silique length, ovule number, and seed set. <i>Athemn1</i> mutant alleles were transmitted via both male and female gametes, but homozygous mutants were never recovered. Plants carrying <i>Athemn1</i> mutant alleles showed defects in gametophyte <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, including nonviable pollen and embryo sacs with unfused polar nuclei. Improper differentiation of the central cell led to defects in endosperm <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Consequently, embryo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment was arrested at the globular stage. The mutant phenotype was completely rescued by transgenic expression of <i>AtHEMN1</i>. Promoter and transcript analyses indicated that <i>AtHEMN1</i> is expressed mainly in floral tissues and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ing seeds. AtHEMN1-green fluorescent protein fusion protein was found targeted to mitochondria. Loss of <i>AtHEMN1</i> function increased coproporphyrinogen III level and reduced protoporphyrinogen IX level, suggesting the impairment of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis. Blockage of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis in the <i>AtHEMN1</i> mutant led to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation in anthers and embryo sacs, as evidenced by nitroblue tetrazolium staining. Our results suggest that the accumulated ROS disrupts mitochondrial function by altering their membrane polarity in floral tissues. This study highlights the role of mitochondrial ROS homeostasis in gametophyte and seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and sheds new light on tetrapyrrole/heme biosynthesis in plant mitochondria.</p>

IRREGULAR POLLEN EXINE1 Is a Novel Factor in Anther Cuticle and Pollen Exine Formation
<p>Anther cuticle and pollen exine are protective barriers for pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and fertilization. Despite that several regulators have been identified for anther cuticle and pollen exine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), few genes have been characterized in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) and the underlying regulatory mechanism remains elusive. Here, we report a novel male-sterile mutant in maize, <i>irregular pollen exine1</i> (<i>ipe1</i>), which exhibited a glossy outer anther surface, abnormal Ubisch bodies, and defective pollen exine. Using map-based cloning, the <i>IPE1</i> gene was isolated as a putative glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum. Transcripts of <i>IPE1</i> were preferentially accumulated in the tapetum during the tetrad and early uninucleate microspore stage. A biochemical assay indicated that <i>ipe1</i> anthers had altered constituents of wax and a significant reduction of cutin monomers and fatty acids. RNA sequencing data revealed that genes implicated in wax and flavonoid metabolism, fatty acid synthesis, and elongation were differentially expressed in <i>ipe1</i> mutant anthers. In addition, the analysis of transfer DNA insertional lines of the orthologous gene in Arabidopsis suggested that IPE1 and their orthologs have a partially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed function in male organ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. Our results showed that IPE1 participates in the putative oxidative pathway of C16/C18 ω-hydroxy fatty acids and controls anther cuticle and pollen exine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment together with MALE STERILITY26 and MALE STERILITY45 in maize.</p>

Secretory COPII Protein SEC31B Is Required for Pollen Wall Development
<p>The pollen wall protects pollen grains from abiotic and biotic stresses. During pollen wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment, tapetal cells play a vital role by secreting proteins, signals, and pollen wall material to ensure microspore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment. But the regulatory mechanism underlying the secretory pathway of the tapetum is largely unknown. Here, we characterize the essential role of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) COPII protein SECRETORY31B (SEC31B) in pollen wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment and the secretory activity of tapetal cells. The sporophyte-controlled <i>atsec31b</i> mutant exhibits severe pollen and seed abortion. Transmission electron microscopy observation indicates that pollen exine formation in the <i>atsec31b</i> mutant is disrupted significantly. AtSEC31B is a functional COPII protein revealed by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">site</span></strong> localization, interaction with AtSEC13A, and retarded ER-Golgi protein trafficking in the <i>atsec31b</i> mutant. A genetic tapetum-specific rescue assay indicates that AtSEC31B functions primarily in the tapetum. Moreover, deletion of AtSEC31B interrupted the formation of the ER-derived tapetosome and altered the location of the ATP-BINDING CASSETTE TRANSPORTER9 protein in the tapetum. Therefore, this work demonstrates that AtSEC31B plays a vital role in pollen wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">develop</span></strong>ment by regulating the secretory pathway of the tapetal cells.</p>

Partitioning of vessel resistivity in three liana species
<p>Vessels with simple perforation plates, found in the majority of angiosperms, are considered the evolutionarily most advanced conduits, least impeding the xylem sap flow. Nevertheless, when measured, their hydraulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ivity (<i>R</i>, i.e., inverse value of hydraulic conductivity) is significantly higher than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ivity predicted using Hagen–Poiseuille equation (<i>R</i><sub>HP</sub>). In our study we aimed (i) to quantify two basic components of the total vessel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ivity – vessel lumen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ivity and end wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ivity, and (ii) to analyze how the variable inner diameter of the vessel along its longitudinal axis affects <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ivity. We measured flow rates through progressively shortened stems of hop (<i>Humulus lupulus</i> L.), grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i> L.), and clematis (<i>Clematis vitalba</i> L.) and used elastomer injection for identification of open vessels and for measurement of changing vessel inner diameters along its axis. The relative contribution of end wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ivity to total vessel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ivity was 0.46 for hop, 0.55 for grapevine, and 0.30 for clematis. Vessel lumen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ivity calculated from our measurements was substantially higher than theoretical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ivity – about 43% for hop, 58% for grapevine, and 52% for clematis. We identified variation in the vessel inner diameter as an important source of vessel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ivity. The coefficient of variation of vessel inner diameter was a good predictor for the increase of the ratio of integral <i>R</i><sub>HP</sub> to <i>R</i><sub>HP</sub> calculated from the mean value of inner vessel diameter. We discuss the fact that we dealt with the longest vessels in a given stem sample, which may lead to the overestimation of vessel lumen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ivity, which consequently precludes decision whether the variable vessel inner diameter explains fully the difference between vessel lumen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ivity and <i>R</i><sub>HP</sub> we observed.</p>

OsSYP121 Accumulates at Fungal Penetration Sites and Mediates Host Resistance to Rice Blast
<p><i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> is a fungal pathogen that causes rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) blast. SNAREs (soluble <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive factor attachment protein receptors) are key components in vesicle trafficking in eukaryotic cells and are known to contribute to fungal pathogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. Syntaxin of Plants121 (SYP121), a Qa-SNARE, has been reported to function in nonhost <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). However, the functions of SYP121 in host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to rice blast are largely unknown. Here, we report that the rice SYP121 protein, OsSYP121, accumulates at fungal penetration sites and mediates host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to rice blast. OsSYP121 is plasma membrane localized and its expression was obviously induced by the rice blast in both the blast-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant rice landrace Heikezijing and the blast-susceptible landrace Suyunuo (Su). Overexpression of <i>OsSYP121</i> in Su resulted in enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to blast. Knockdown of <i>OsSYP121</i> expression in Su resulted in a more susceptible phenotype. However, knockdown of <i>OsSYP121</i> expression in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant landrace Heikezijing resulted in susceptibility to the blast fungus. The <i>P<sub>OsSYP121</sub></i>::GFP-OsSYP121 accumulated at rice blast penetration sites in transgenic rice, as observed by confocal microscopy. Yeast two-hybrid results showed that OsSYP121 can interact with OsSNAP32 (Synaptosome-associated protein of 32 kD) and Vesicle-associated membrane protein714/724. The interaction between OsSYP121 and OsSNAP32 may contribute to host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to rice blast. Our study reveals that OsSYP121 plays an important role in rice blast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance as it is a key component in vesicle trafficking.</p>

Systematic Mutagenesis of Serine Hydroxymethyltransferase Reveals an Essential Role in Nematode Resistance
<p><i>Rhg4</i> is a major genetic locus that contributes to soybean cyst nematode (SCN) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in the Peking-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance of soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>), which also requires the <i>rhg1</i> gene. By map-based cloning and functional genomic approaches, we previously showed that the <i>Rhg4</i> gene encodes a predicted cytosolic serine hydroxymethyltransferase (GmSHMT08); however, the novel gain of function of <i>GmSHMT08</i> in SCN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance remains to be characterized. Using a forward genetic screen, we identified an allelic series of <i>GmSHMT08</i> mutants that shed new light on the mechanistic aspects of <i>GmSHMT08</i>-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. The new mutants provide compelling genetic evidence that Peking-type <i>rhg1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in cv Forrest is fully dependent on the <i>GmSHMT08</i> gene and demonstrates that this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance is mechanistically different from the PI 88788-type of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance that only requires <i>rhg1</i>. We also demonstrated that <i>rhg1-a</i> from cv Forrest, although required, does not exert selection pressure on the nematode to shift from HG type 7, which further validates the bigenic nature of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. Mapping of the identified mutations onto the SHMT structural model uncovered key residues for structural stability, ligand binding, enzyme activity, and protein interactions, suggesting that GmSHMT08 has additional functions aside from its main enzymatic role in SCN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. Lastly, we demonstrate the functionality of the <i>GmSHMT08</i> SCN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance gene in a transgenic soybean plant.</p>

Reversion of antibiotic resistance in <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> by spiroisoxazoline SMARt-420
<p>Antibiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance is one of the biggest threats to human health globally. Alarmingly, multidrug-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant and extensively drug-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> have now spread worldwide. Some key antituberculosis antibiotics are prodrugs, for which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance mechanisms are mainly driven by mutations in the bacterial enzymatic pathway required for their bioactivation. We have developed drug-like molecules that activate a cryptic alternative bioactivation pathway of ethionamide in <i>M. tuberculosis</i>, circumventing the classic activation pathway in which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance mutations have now been observed. The first-of-its-kind molecule, named SMARt-420 (Small Molecule Aborting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance), not only fully reverses ethionamide-acquired <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance and clears ethionamide-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant infection in mice, it also increases the basal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity of bacteria to ethionamide.</p>

The Wheat <i>Lr67</i> Gene from the Sugar Transport Protein 13 Family Confers Multipathogen Resistance in Barley
<p>Fungal pathogens are a major constraint to global crop production; hence, plant genes encoding pathogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance are important tools for combating disease. A few <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance genes identified to date provide partial, durable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to multiple pathogens and the wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) Lr67 hexose transporter variant (Lr67res) fits into this category. Two amino acids differ between the wild-type and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant alleles – G144R and V387L. Exome sequence data from 267 barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) landraces and wild accessions was screened and neither of the Lr67res mutations was detected. The barley ortholog of Lr67, HvSTP13, was functionally characterized in yeast as a high affinity hexose transporter. The G144R mutation was introduced into HvSTP13 and abolished Glc uptake, whereas the V387L mutation reduced Glc uptake by ∼ 50%. Glc transport by HvSTP13 heterologously expressed in yeast was reduced when coexpressed with <i>Lr67res</i>. Stable transgenic <i>Lr67res</i> barley lines exhibited seedling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to the barley-specific pathogens <i>Puccinia hordei</i> and <i>Blumeria graminis</i> f. sp. <i>hordei</i>, which cause leaf rust and powdery mildew, respectively. Barley plants expressing <i>Lr67res</i> exhibited early senescence and higher pathogenesis-related (<i>PR</i>) gene expression. Unlike previous observations implicating flavonoids in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance of transgenic sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>) expressing <i>Lr34res</i>, another wheat multipathogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance gene, barley flavonoids are unlikely to have a role in Lr67res-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. Similar to observations made in yeast, Lr67res reduced Glc uptake <i>in planta</i>. These results confirm that the pathway by which <i>Lr67res</i> confers <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to fungal pathogens is conserved between wheat and barley.</p>

Sequence Exchange between Homologous NB-LRR Genes Converts Virus Resistance into Nematode Resistance, and Vice Versa
<p>Plants have evolved a limited repertoire of NB-LRR disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance (<i>R</i>) genes to protect themselves against myriad pathogens. This limitation is thought to be counterbalanced by the rapid evolution of NB-LRR proteins, as only a few sequence changes have been shown to be sufficient to alter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance specificities toward novel strains of a pathogen. However, little is known about the flexibility of NB-LRR <i>R</i> genes to switch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance specificities between phylogenetically unrelated pathogens. To investigate this, we created domain swaps between the close homologs <i>Gpa2</i> and <i>Rx1</i>, which confer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>) to the cyst nematode <i>Globodera pallida</i> and <i>Potato virus X</i>, respectively. The genetic fusion of the CC-NB-ARC of Gpa2 with the LRR of Rx1 (Gpa2<sub>CN</sub>/Rx1<sub>L</sub>) results in autoactivity, but lowering the protein levels restored its specific activation response, including extreme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to <i>Potato virus X</i> in potato shoots. The reciprocal chimera (Rx1<sub>CN</sub>/Gpa2<sub>L</sub>) shows a loss-of-function phenotype, but exchange of the first three LRRs of Gpa2 by the corresponding region of Rx1 was sufficient to regain a wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance response to <i>G. pallida</i> in the roots. These data demonstrate that exchanging the recognition moiety in the LRR is sufficient to convert extreme virus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in the leaves into mild nematode <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in the roots, and vice versa. In addition, we show that the CC-NB-ARC can operate independently of the recognition specificities defined by the LRR domain, either aboveground or belowground. These data show the versatility of NB-LRR genes to generate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to unrelated pathogens with completely different lifestyles and routes of invasion.</p>

Epigenetic regulation of antagonistic receptors confers rice blast resistance with yield balance
<p>Crop breeding aims to balance disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance with yield; however, single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance (R) genes can lead to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance breakdown, and R gene pyramiding may affect growth fitness. Here we report that the rice <i>Pigm</i> locus contains a cluster of genes encoding nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptors that confer durable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to the fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> without yield penalty. Among these NLR receptors, PigmR confers broad-spectrum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance, whereas PigmS competitively attenuates PigmR homodimerization to suppress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. <i>PigmS</i> expression, and thus <i>PigmR</i>-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance, are subjected to tight epigenetic regulation. <i>PigmS</i> increases seed production to counteract the yield cost induced by <i>PigmR</i>. Therefore, our study reveals a mechanism balancing high disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance and yield through epigenetic regulation of paired antagonistic NLR receptors, providing a tool to develop elite crop varieties.</p>

A Cytosolic Triosephosphate Isomerase Is a Key Component in XA3/XA26-Mediated Resistance
<p>Bacterial blight caused by <i>Xanthomonas oryzae</i> pv <i>oryzae</i> (<i>Xoo</i>) causes severe damage to rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) production worldwide. The major disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance gene, <i>Xa3/Xa26</i>, confers broad-spectrum and durable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to <i>Xoo</i> at both seedling and adult stages. However, the molecular mechanism of the <i>Xa3/Xa26</i>-initiated defense pathway against <i>Xoo</i> is still largely unknown. Here, we show that a triosephosphate isomerase (TPI), OsTPI1.1, is a key component in XA3/XA26-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to <i>Xoo</i>. OsTPI1.1 is a glycolytic enzyme that catalyzes the reversible interconversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. Transcriptional suppression of <i>OsTPI1.1</i> in plants harboring <i>Xa3/Xa26</i> largely impaired the XA3/XA26-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to <i>Xoo</i>, and constitutive overexpression of <i>OsTPI1.1</i> in susceptible rice plants without <i>Xa3/Xa26</i> only slightly decreased the susceptibility to <i>Xoo</i>. Therefore, both XA3/XA26 and OsTPI1.1 are required in XA3/XA26-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. We show that OsTPI1.1 participates in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance through its enzymatic activity, which was enhanced significantly by its binding with XA3/XA26. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), especially hydrogen peroxide, accumulated in the OsTPI1.1-overexpressing plants, and suppression of <i>OsTPI1.1</i> decreased ROS accumulation. The changes in ROS are associated with the reduction of NADP<sup>+</sup> to NADPH, which may act as a redox cofactor to scavenge ROS, leading to reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to <i>Xoo</i>. These results suggest that OsTPI1.1 modulates ROS production as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance mechanism against <i>Xoo</i>.</p>

Abscisic Acid Induces Resistance against <i>Bamboo Mosaic Virus</i> through <i>Argonaute</i> <i>2</i> and <i>3</i>
<p>Plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to pathogens is tuned by defense-related hormones. Of these, abscisic acid (ABA) is well documented to moderate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance against fungi and bacteria. However, ABA’s contribution to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance against viruses is pleiotropic. ABA affects callose deposition at plasmodesmata (therefore hindering the viral cell-to-cell movement), but here, we show that when callose synthase is down-regulated, ABA still induces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance against infection with <i>Bamboo mosaic virus</i> (BaMV). By examining the potential connections between the ABA and RNA-silencing pathways in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), we showed that ABA regulates the expression of almost the whole ARGONAUTE (AGO) gene family, of which some are required for plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance against BaMV. Our data show that BaMV infection and ABA treatment regulate the same set of AGOs, with positive effects on <i>AGO1</i>, <i>AGO2</i>, and <i>AGO3</i>, no effect on <i>AGO7</i>, and negative effects on <i>AGO4</i> and <i>AGO10</i>. The BaMV-mediated regulation of <i>AGO1</i>, <i>AGO2</i>, and <i>AGO3</i> is ABA dependent, because the accumulation of these <i>AGOs</i> in BaMV-infected ABA mutants did not reach the levels observed in infected wild-type plants. In addition, the <i>AGO1</i>-<i>miR168a</i> complex is dispensable for BaMV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance, while <i>AGO2</i> and <i>AGO3</i> were important for ABA-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. While most <i>ago</i> mutants showed increased susceptibility to BaMV infection (except <i>ago10</i>), <i>ago1-27</i> showed reduced BaMV titers, which was attributed to the up-regulated levels of <i>AGO2</i>, <i>AGO3</i>, and <i>AGO4</i>. We have established that ABA regulates the expression of several members of the AGO family, and this regulation partially contributes to ABA-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance against BaMV. These findings reveal another role for ABA in plants.</p>

Antibiotic tolerance facilitates the evolution of resistance
<p>Controlled experimental evolution during antibiotic treatment can help to explain the processes leading to antibiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in bacteria. Recently, intermittent antibiotic exposures have been shown to lead rapidly to the evolution of tolerance—that is, the ability to survive under treatment without developing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. However, whether tolerance delays or promotes the eventual emergence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance is unclear. Here we used in vitro evolution experiments to explore this question. We found that in all cases, tolerance preceded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. A mathematical population-genetics model showed how tolerance boosts the chances for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance mutations to spread in the population. Thus, tolerance mutations pave the way for the rapid subsequent evolution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. Preventing the evolution of tolerance may offer a new strategy for delaying the emergence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance.</p>

12-Oxo-Phytodienoic Acid Acts as a Regulator of Maize Defense against Corn Leaf Aphid
<p>The corn leaf aphid (CLA; <i>Rhopalosiphum maidis</i>) is a phloem sap-sucking insect that attacks many cereal crops, including maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). We previously showed that the maize inbred line Mp708, which was developed by classical plant breeding, provides enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to CLA. Here, using electrophysiological monitoring of aphid feeding behavior, we demonstrate that Mp708 provides phloem-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to CLA. Furthermore, feeding by CLA on Mp708 plants enhanced callose deposition, a potential defense mechanism utilized by plants to limit aphid feeding and subsequent colonization. In maize, benzoxazinoids (BX) or BX-derived metabolites contribute to enhanced callose deposition by providing heightened <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to CLA. However, BX and BX-derived metabolites were not significantly altered in CLA-infested Mp708 plants, indicating BX-independent defense against CLA. Evidence presented here suggests that the constitutively higher levels of 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA) in Mp708 plants contributed to enhanced callose accumulation and heightened CLA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. OPDA enhanced the expression of ethylene biosynthesis and receptor genes, and the synergistic interactions of OPDA and CLA feeding significantly induced the expression of the transcripts encoding Maize insect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance1-Cysteine Protease, a key defensive protein against insect pests, in Mp708 plants. Furthermore, exogenous application of OPDA on maize jasmonic acid-deficient plants caused enhanced callose accumulation and heightened <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to CLA, suggesting that the OPDA-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to CLA is independent of the jasmonic acid pathway. We further demonstrate that the signaling function of OPDA, rather than a direct toxic effect, contributes to enhanced CLA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in Mp708.</p>

Developmental phosphoproteomics identifies the kinase CK2 as a driver of Hedgehog signaling and a therapeutic target in medulloblastoma
<p>A major limitation of targeted cancer therapy is the rapid emergence of drug <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance, which often arises through mutations at or downstream of the drug target or through intrinsic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance of subpopulations of tumor cells. Medulloblastoma (MB), the most common pediatric brain tumor, is no exception, and MBs that are driven by sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling are particularly aggressive and drug-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant. To find new drug targets and therapeutics for MB that may be less susceptible to common <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance mechanisms, we used a developmental phosphoproteomics approach in murine granule neuron precursors (GNPs), the developmental cell of origin of MB. The protein kinase CK2 emerged as a driver of hundreds of phosphorylation events during the proliferative, MB-like stage of GNP growth, including the phosphorylation of three of the eight proteins commonly amplified in MB. CK2 was critical to the stabilization and activity of the transcription factor GLI2, a late downstream effector in SHH signaling. CK2 inhibitors decreased the viability of primary SHH-type MB patient cells in culture and blocked the growth of murine MB tumors that were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant to currently available Hh inhibitors, thereby extending the survival of tumor-bearing mice. Because of structural interactions, one CK2 inhibitor (CX-4945) inhibited both wild-type and mutant CK2, indicating that this drug may avoid at least one common mode of acquired <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. These findings suggest that CK2 inhibitors may be effective for treating patients with MB and show how phosphoproteomics may be used to gain insight into developmental biology and pathology.</p>

URI is required to maintain intestinal architecture during ionizing radiation
<p>Ionizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion (IR) can cause gastrointestinal syndrome (GIS), a lethal disorder, by means of unknown mechanisms. We show that high-dose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">irradi</span></strong>ation increases unconventional prefoldin RPB5 interactor (URI) levels in mouse intestinal crypt, but organ regeneration correlates with URI reductions. URI overexpression in intestine protects mice from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion-induced GIS, whereas halving URI expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>izes mice to IR. URI specifically inhibits β-catenin in stem cell–like label-retaining (LR) cells, which are essential for organ regeneration after IR. URI reduction activates β-catenin–induced c-MYC expression, causing proliferation of and DNA damage to LR cells, rendering them <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong></span></strong>ive. Therefore, URI labels LR cells which promote tissue regeneration in response to high-dose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">irradi</span></strong>ation, and c-MYC inhibitors could be countermeasures for humans at risk of developing GIS.</p>

Sensitivity to “sunk costs” in mice, rats, and humans
<p>Sunk costs are irrecoverable investments that should not influence decisions, because decisions should be made on the basis of expected future consequences. Both human and nonhuman animals can show <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity to sunk costs, but reports from across species are inconsistent. In a temporal context, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity to sunk costs arises when an individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>s ending an activity, even if it seems unproductive, because of the time already invested. In two parallel foraging tasks that we designed, we found that mice, rats, and humans show similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivities to sunk costs in their decision-making. Unexpectedly, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity to time invested accrued only after an initial decision had been made. These findings suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity to temporal sunk costs lies in a vulnerability distinct from deliberation processes and that this distinction is present across species.</p>

Mapping the malaria parasite druggable genome by using in vitro evolution and chemogenomics
<p>Chemogenetic characterization through in vitro evolution combined with whole-genome analysis can identify antimalarial drug targets and drug-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance genes. We performed a genome analysis of 262 <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> parasites <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant to 37 diverse compounds. We found 159 gene amplifications and 148 nonsynonymous changes in 83 genes associated with drug-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance acquisition, where gene amplifications contributed to one-third of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance acquisition events. Beyond confirming previously identified multidrug-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance mechanisms, we discovered hitherto unrecognized drug target–inhibitor pairs, including thymidylate synthase and a benzoquinazolinone, farnesyltransferase and a pyrimidinedione, and a dipeptidylpeptidase and an arylurea. This exploration of the <i>P. falciparum</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ome and druggable genome will likely guide drug discovery and structural biology efforts, while also advancing our understanding of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance mechanisms available to the malaria parasite.</p>

The DNA-sensing AIM2 inflammasome controls radiation-induced cell death and tissue injury
<p>Acute exposure to ionizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion induces massive cell death and severe damage to tissues containing actively proliferating cells, including bone marrow and the gastrointestinal tract. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this pathology remain controversial. Here, we show that mice deficient in the double-stranded DNA sensor AIM2 are protected from both subtotal body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">irradi</span></strong>ation–induced gastrointestinal syndrome and total body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">irradi</span></strong>ation–induced hematopoietic failure. AIM2 mediates the caspase-1–dependent death of intestinal epithelial cells and bone marrow cells in response to double-strand DNA breaks caused by ionizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion and chemotherapeutic agents. Mechanistically, we found that AIM2 senses <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion-induced DNA damage in the nucleus to mediate inflammasome activation and cell death. Our results suggest that AIM2 may be a new therapeutic target for ionizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion exposure.</p>

Baseline hearing abilities and variability in wild beluga whales (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>)
<p>While hearing is the primary sensory modality for odontocetes, there are few data addressing variation within a natural population. This work describes the hearing ranges (4–150 kHz) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivities of seven apparently healthy, wild beluga whales (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>) during a population health assessment project that captured and released belugas in Bristol Bay, Alaska. The baseline hearing abilities and subsequent variations were addressed. Hearing was measured using auditory evoked potentials (AEPs). All audiograms showed a typical cetacean U-shape; substantial variation (>30 dB) was found between most and least <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive thresholds. All animals heard well, up to at least 128 kHz. Two heard up to 150 kHz. Lowest auditory thresholds (35–45 dB) were identified in the range 45–80 kHz. Greatest differences in hearing abilities occurred at both the high end of the auditory range and at frequencies of maximum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity. In general, wild beluga hearing was quite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive. Hearing abilities were similar to those of belugas measured in zoological settings, reinforcing the comparative importance of both settings. The relative degree of variability across the wild belugas suggests that audiograms from multiple individuals are needed to properly describe the maximum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity and population variance for odontocetes. Hearing measures were easily incorporated into field-based settings. This detailed examination of hearing abilities in wild Bristol Bay belugas provides a basis for a better understanding of the potential impact of anthropogenic noise on a noise-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive species. Such information may help design noise-limiting mitigation measures that could be applied to areas heavily influenced and inhabited by endangered belugas.</p>

Direct Comparison of 4 Very Early Rule-Out Strategies for Acute Myocardial Infarction Using High-Sensitivity Cardiac Troponin I
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Four strategies for very early rule-out of acute myocardial infarction using high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) have been identified. It remains unclear which strategy is most attractive for clinical application.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We prospectively enrolled unselected patients presenting to the emergency department with symptoms suggestive of acute myocardial infarction. The final diagnosis was adjudicated by 2 independent cardiologists. Hs-cTnI levels were measured at presentation and after 1 hour in a blinded fashion. We directly compared all 4 hs-cTnI–based rule-out strategies: limit of detection (LOD, hs-cTnI<2 ng/L), single cutoff (hs-cTnI<5 ng/L), 1-hour algorithm (hs-cTnI<5 ng/L and 1-hour change<2 ng/L), and the 0/1-hour algorithm recommended in the European Society of Cardiology guideline combining LOD and 1-hour algorithm.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 2828 enrolled patients, acute myocardial infarction was the final diagnosis in 451 (16%) patients. The LOD approach ruled out 453 patients (16%) with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity of 100% (95% confidence interval [CI], 99.2%–100%), the single cutoff 1516 patients (54%) with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity of 97.1% (95% CI, 95.1%–98.3%), the 1-hour algorithm 1459 patients (52%) with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity of 98.4% (95% CI, 96.8%–99.2%), and the 0/1-hour algorithm 1463 patients (52%) with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity of 98.4% (95% CI, 96.8%–99.2%).

Recovery performance in xylem hydraulic conductivity is correlated with cavitation resistance for temperate deciduous tree species
<p>Woody species hydraulically vulnerable to xylem cavitation may experience daily xylem embolism. How such species cope with the possibility of accumulated embolism is unclear. In this study, we examined seven temperate woody species to assess the hypothesis that low cavitation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance (high vulnerability to cavitation) is compensated by high recovery performance via vessel refilling. We also evaluated leaf functional and xylem structural traits. The xylem recovery index (XRI), defined as the ratio of xylem hydraulic conductivity in plants rewatered after soil drought to that in plants under moist conditions, varied among species. The xylem water potential causing 50% loss of hydraulic conductivity (Ψ<sub>50</sub>) varied among the species studied, whereas only a slight difference was detected with respect to midday xylem water potential (Ψ<sub>min</sub>), indicating smaller hydraulic safety margins (Ψ<sub>min</sub> − Ψ<sub>50</sub>) for species more vulnerable to cavitation. Cavitation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance (|Ψ<sub>50</sub>|) was negatively correlated with XRI across species, with cavitation-vulnerable species showing a higher performance in xylem recovery. Wood density was positively correlated with cavitation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance and was negatively correlated with XRI. These novel results reveal that coordination exists between cavitation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance and xylem recovery performance, in association with wood functional traits such as denser wood for cavitation-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant xylem and less-dense but water-storable wood for refillable xylem. These findings provide insights into long-term maintenance of water transport in tree species growing under variable environmental conditions.</p>

Skp2-dependent reactivation of AKT drives resistance to PI3K inhibitors
<p>The PI3K-AKT kinase signaling pathway is frequently deregulated in human cancers, particularly breast cancer, where amplification and somatic mutations of <i>PIK3CA</i> occur with high frequency in patients. Numerous small-molecule inhibitors targeting both PI3K and AKT are under clinical evaluation, but dose-limiting toxicities and the emergence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance limit therapeutic efficacy. Various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance mechanisms to PI3K inhibitors have been identified, including de novo mutations, feedback activation of AKT, or cross-talk pathways. We found a previously unknown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance mechanism to PI3K pathway inhibition that results in AKT rebound activation. In a subset of triple-negative breast cancer cell lines, treatment with a PI3K inhibitor or depletion of <i>PIK3CA</i> expression ultimately promoted AKT reactivation in a manner dependent on the E3 ubiquitin ligase Skp2, the kinases IGF-1R (insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor) and PDK-1 (phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1), and the cell growth and metabolism-regulating complex mTORC2 (mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2), but was independent of PI3K activity or PIP<sub>3</sub> production. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to PI3K inhibitors correlated with the increased abundance of Skp2, ubiquitylation of AKT, cell proliferation in culture, and xenograft tumor growth in mice. These findings reveal a ubiquitin signaling feedback mechanism by which PI3K inhibitor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance may emerge in aggressive breast cancer cells.</p>

Radiation inhibits salivary gland function by promoting STIM1 cleavage by caspase-3 and loss of SOCE through a TRPM2-dependent pathway
<p>Store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (SOCE) is critical for salivary gland fluid secretion. We report that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion treatment caused persistent salivary gland dysfunction by activating a TRPM2-dependent mitochondrial pathway, leading to caspase-3–mediated cleavage of stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) and loss of SOCE. After <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">irradi</span></strong>ation, acinar cells from the submandibular glands of <i>TRPM2</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup>, but not those from <i>TRPM2</i><sup><i>−/−</i></sup> mice, displayed an increase in the concentrations of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> and reactive oxygen species, a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, and activation of caspase-3, which was associated with a sustained decrease in STIM1 abundance and attenuation of SOCE. In a salivary gland cell line, silencing the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter or caspase-3 or treatment with inhibitors of TRPM2 or caspase-3 prevented <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">irradi</span></strong>ation-induced loss of STIM1 and SOCE. Expression of exogenous STIM1 in the salivary glands of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">irradi</span></strong>ated mice increased SOCE and fluid secretion.

The receptor tyrosine kinase AXL mediates nuclear translocation of the epidermal growth factor receptor
<p>The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a therapeutic target in patients with various cancers. Unfortunately, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to EGFR-targeted therapeutics is common. Previous studies identified two mechanisms of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to the EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab. Nuclear translocation of EGFR bypasses the inhibitory effects of cetuximab, and the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL mediates cetuximab <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance by maintaining EGFR activation and downstream signaling. Thus, we hypothesized that AXL mediated the nuclear translocation of EGFR in the setting of cetuximab <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. Cetuximab-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant clones of non–small cell lung cancer in culture and patient-derived xenografts in mice had increased abundance of AXL and nuclear EGFR (nEGFR). Cellular fractionation analysis, super-resolution microscopy, and electron microscopy revealed that genetic loss of AXL reduced the accumulation of nEGFR. SRC family kinases (SFKs) and HER family ligands promote the nuclear translocation of EGFR. We found that AXL knockdown reduced the expression of the genes encoding the SFK family members YES and LYN and the ligand neuregulin-1 (NRG1). AXL knockdown also decreased the interaction between EGFR and the related receptor HER3 and accumulation of HER3 in the nucleus. Overexpression of LYN and NRG1 in cells depleted of AXL resulted in accumulation of nEGFR, rescuing the deficit induced by lack of AXL. Collectively, these data uncover a previously unrecognized role for AXL in regulating the nuclear translocation of EGFR and suggest that AXL-mediated SFK and <i>NRG1</i> expression promote this process.</p>

miR-183 cluster scales mechanical pain sensitivity by regulating basal and neuropathic pain genes
<p>Nociception is protective and prevents tissue damage but can also facilitate chronic pain. Whether a general principle governs these two types of pain is unknown. Here, we show that both basal mechanical and neuropathic pain are controlled by the microRNA-183 (miR-183) cluster in mice. This single cluster controls more than 80% of neuropathic pain–regulated genes and scales basal mechanical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity and mechanical allodynia by regulating auxiliary voltage-gated calcium channel subunits α2δ-1 and α2δ-2. Basal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity is controlled in nociceptors, and allodynia involves TrkB<sup>+</sup> light-touch mechanoreceptors. These light-touch–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive neurons, which normally do not elicit pain, produce pain during neuropathy that is reversed by gabapentin. Thus, a single microRNA cluster continuously scales acute noxious mechanical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity in nociceptive neurons and suppresses neuropathic pain transduction in a specific, light-touch–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive neuronal type recruited during mechanical allodynia.</p>

The B-Box-Containing MicroProtein miP1a/BBX31 Regulates Photomorphogenesis and UV-B Protection
<p>The bZIP transcription factor ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) represents a major hub in the light-signaling cascade both under visible and UV-B light. The mode of transcriptional regulation of <i>HY5</i>, especially under UV-B light, is not well characterized. B-BOX (BBX) transcription factors regulate <i>HY5</i> transcription and also posttranscriptionally modulate HY5 to control photomorphogenesis under white light. Here, we identify BBX31 as a key signaling intermediate in visible and UV-B light signal transduction in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). <i>BBX31</i> expression is induced by UV-B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion in a fluence-dependent manner. HY5 directly binds to the promoter of <i>BBX31</i> and regulates its transcript levels. Loss- and gain-of-function mutants of <i>BBX31</i> indicate that it acts as a negative regulator of photomorphogenesis under white light but is a positive regulator of UV-B signaling. Genetic interaction studies suggest that <i>BBX31</i> regulates photomorphogenesis independent of <i>HY5</i>. We found no evidence for a direct BBX31-HY5 interaction, and they primarily regulate different sets of genes in white light. Under high doses of UV-B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion, BBX31 promotes the accumulation of UV-protective flavonoids and phenolic compounds. It enhances tolerance to UV-B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion by regulating genes involved in photoprotection and DNA repair in a HY5-dependent manner. Under UV-B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion, overexpression of <i>BBX31</i> enhances <i>HY5</i> transcriptional levels in a UV RESISTANCE LOCUS8-dependent manner, suggesting that BBX31 might regulate <i>HY5</i> transcription.</p>

Digital Imaging Combined with Genome-Wide Association Mapping Links Loci to Plant-Pathogen Interaction Traits
<p>Plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to generalist pathogens with broad host ranges, such as <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> (<i>Botrytis</i>), is typically quantitative and highly polygenic. Recent studies have begun to elucidate the molecular genetic basis of plant-pathogen interactions using commonly measured traits, including lesion size and/or pathogen biomass. However, with the advent of digital imaging and high-throughput phenomics, there are a large number of additional traits available to study quantitative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. In this study, we used high-throughput digital imaging analysis to investigate previously poorly characterized visual traits of plant-pathogen interactions related to disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance using the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>)/<i>Botrytis</i> pathosystem. From a large collection of visual lesion trait measurements, we focused on color, shape, and size to test how these aspects of the Arabidopsis/<i>Botrytis</i> interaction are genetically related. Through genome-wide association mapping in Arabidopsis, we show that lesion color and shape are genetically separable traits associated with plant disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. Moreover, by employing defined mutants in 23 candidate genes identified from the genome-wide association mapping, we demonstrate links between loci and each of the different plant-pathogen interaction traits. These results expand our understanding of the functional mechanisms driving plant disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance.</p>

Short-Term Exposure to Nitrogen Dioxide Provides Basal Pathogen Resistance
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) forms in plants under stress conditions, but little is known about its physiological functions. Here, we explored the physiological functions of NO<sub>2</sub> in plant cells using short-term fumigation of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) for 1 h with 10 µL L<sup>−1</sup> NO<sub>2.</sub> Although leaf symptoms were absent, the expression of genes related to pathogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance was induced. Fumigated plants developed basal disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance, or pattern-triggered immunity, against the necrotrophic fungus <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> and the hemibiotrophic bacterium <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i>. Functional salicylic acid and jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathways were both required for the full expression of NO<sub>2</sub>-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance against <i>B. cinerea</i>. An early peak of salicylic acid accumulation immediately after NO<sub>2</sub> exposure was followed by a transient accumulation of oxophytodienoic acid. The simultaneous NO<sub>2</sub>-induced expression of genes involved in jasmonate biosynthesis and jasmonate catabolism resulted in the complete suppression of JA and JA-isoleucine (JA-Ile) accumulation, which was accompanied by a rise in the levels of their catabolic intermediates 12-OH-JA, 12-OH-JA-Ile, and 12-COOH-JA-Ile. NO<sub>2</sub>-treated plants emitted the volatile monoterpene α-pinene and the sesquiterpene longifolene (syn. junipene), which could function in signaling or direct defense against pathogens. NO<sub>2</sub>-triggered <i>B. cinerea</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance was dependent on enhanced early callose deposition and <i>CYTOCHROME P450 79B2</i> (<i>CYP79B2</i>), <i>CYP79B3</i>, and <i>PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT3</i> gene functions but independent of camalexin, <i>CYP81F2</i>, and 4-OH-indol-3-ylmethylglucosinolate derivatives. In sum, exogenous NO<sub>2</sub> triggers basal pathogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance, pointing to a possible role for endogenous NO<sub>2</sub> in defense signaling. Additionally, this study revealed the involvement of jasmonate catabolism and volatiles in pathogen immunity.</p>

Gene Duplication and Aneuploidy Trigger Rapid Evolution of Herbicide Resistance in Common Waterhemp<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>An increase in gene copy number is often associated with changes in the number and structure of chromosomes, as has been widely observed in yeast and eukaryotic tumors, yet little is known about stress-induced chromosomal changes in plants. Previously, we reported that the <i>EPSPS</i> (5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase) gene, the molecular target of glyphosate, was amplified at the native locus and on an extra chromosome in glyphosate-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant <i>Amaranthus tuberculatus</i>. Here, we report that the extra chromosome is a ring chromosome termed extra circular chromosome carrying amplified <i>EPSPS</i> (ECCAE). The ECCAE is heterochromatic, harbors four major <i>EPSPS</i> amplified foci, and is sexually transmitted to 35% of the progeny. Two highly glyphosate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant (HGR) <i>A. tuberculatus</i> plants with a chromosome constitution of 2n = 32+1 ECCAE displayed soma cell heterogeneity. Some cells had secondary ECCAEs, which displayed size polymorphisms and produced novel chromosomal variants with multiple gene amplification foci. We hypothesize that the ECCAE in the soma cells of HGR <i>A. tuberculatus</i> plants underwent breakage-fusion-bridge cycles to generate the observed soma cell heterogeneity, including de novo <i>EPSPS</i> gene integration into chromosomes. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant soma cells with stable <i>EPSPS</i> amplification events as de novo insertions into chromosomes may survive glyphosate selection pressure during the sporophytic phase and are plausibly transmitted to germ cells leading to durable glyphosate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in <i>A. tuberculatus</i>. This is the first report of early events in aneuploidy-triggered de novo chromosome integration by an as yet unknown mechanism, which may drive rapid adaptive evolution of herbicide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in common waterhemp.</p>

Heat Shock Factor HsfA1a Is Essential for <i>R</i> Gene-Mediated Nematode Resistance and Triggers H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> Production<sup>1</sup>
<p>Plants generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the apoplast in response to pathogen attack, especially following <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance (<i>R</i>) gene-mediated pathogen recognition; however, the mechanisms activating ROS generation remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that RKN (<i>Meloidogyne incognita</i>) infection rapidly induces ROS accumulation in the roots of tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) plants that contain the <i>R</i> gene <i>Mi-1.2</i> but rarely induces ROS accumulation in the susceptible or <i>Mi-1.2</i>-silenced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant genotypes. RNK also induces the hyper<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive response, a form of programmed cell death, in <i>Mi-1.2</i> plants. RKN induces the expression of numerous class-A heat shock factor (HsfA) genes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant tomato plants. Silencing <i>HsfA1a</i> compromises <i>Mi-1.2</i>-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance, apoplastic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation, and the transcription of <i>whitefly induced 1</i> (<i>Wfi1</i>), which encodes a respiratory burst oxidase homolog. HsfA1a regulates <i>Wfi1</i> transcription by binding to the <i>Wfi1</i> promoter, and silencing of <i>Wfi1</i> compromises <i>Mi-1.2</i>-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. HsfA1a and Wfi1 are involved in Mi-1.2-triggered Hsp90 accumulation and basal defense in susceptible tomato. Thus, HsfA–1aWfi1-dependent ROS signaling functions as a crucial regulator of plant defense responses.</p>

Physical Mapping of Amplified Copies of the 5-Enolpyruvylshikimate-3-Phosphate Synthase Gene in Glyphosate-Resistant <i>Amaranthus tuberculatus</i><xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Recent and rapid evolution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to glyphosate, the most widely used herbicides, in several weed species, including common waterhemp (<i>Amaranthus tuberculatus</i>), poses a serious threat to sustained crop production. We report that glyphosate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in <i>A</i>. <i>tuberculatus</i> was due to amplification of the 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-P synthase (<i>EPSPS</i>) gene, which encodes the molecular target of glyphosate. There was a positive correlation between <i>EPSPS</i> gene copies and its transcript expression. We analyzed the distribution of <i>EPSPS</i> copies in the genome of <i>A</i>. <i>tuberculatus</i> using fluorescence in situ hybridization on mitotic metaphase chromosomes and interphase nuclei. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis mapped the <i>EPSPS</i> gene to pericentromeric regions of two homologous chromosomes in glyphosate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive <i>A</i>. <i>tuberculatus</i>. In glyphosate-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant plants, a cluster of <i>EPSPS</i> genes on the pericentromeric region on one pair of homologous chromosomes was detected. Intriguingly, two highly glyphosate-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant plants harbored an additional chromosome with several <i>EPSPS</i> copies besides the native chromosome pair with <i>EPSPS</i> copies. These results suggest that the initial event of <i>EPSPS</i> gene duplication may have occurred because of unequal recombination mediated by repetitive DNA. Subsequently, gene amplification may have resulted via several other mechanisms, such as chromosomal rearrangements, deletion/insertion, transposon-mediated dispersion, or possibly by interspecific hybridization. This report illustrates the physical mapping of amplified <i>EPSPS</i> copies in <i>A</i>. <i>tuberculatus</i>.</p>

Diurnal Solar Energy Conversion and Photoprotection in Rice Canopies
<p>Genetic improvement of photosynthetic performance of cereal crops and increasing the efficiency with which solar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion is converted into biomass has recently become a major focus for crop physiologists and breeders. The pulse amplitude modulated chlorophyll fluorescence technique (PAM) allows quantitative leaf level monitoring of the utilization of energy for photochemical light conversion and photoprotection in natural environments, potentially over the entire crop lifecycle. Here, the diurnal relationship between electron transport rate (ETR) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">irradi</span></strong>ance was measured in five cultivars of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) in canopy conditions with PAM fluorescence under natural solar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion. This relationship differed substantially from that observed for conventional short term light response curves measured under controlled actinic light with the same leaves. This difference was characterized by a reduced curvature factor when curve fitting was used to model this diurnal response. The engagement of photoprotective processes in chloroplast electron transport in leaves under canopy solar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion was shown to be a major contributor to this difference. Genotypic variation in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">irradi</span></strong>ance at which energy flux into photoprotective dissipation became greater than ETR was observed. Cultivars capable of higher ETR at midrange light intensities were shown to produce greater leaf area over time, estimated by noninvasive imaging.</p>

Homologues of the RPW8 Resistance Protein Are Localized to the Extrahaustorial Membrane that Is Likely Synthesized De Novo
<p>Upon penetration of the host cell wall, the powdery mildew fungus develops a feeding structure named the haustorium in the invaded host cell. Concomitant with haustorial biogenesis, the extrahaustorial membrane (EHM) is formed to separate the haustorium from the host cell cytoplasm. The Arabidopsis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance protein RPW8.2 is specifically targeted to the EHM where it activates haustorium-targeted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance against powdery mildew. RPW8.2 belongs to a small family with six members in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Whether Homologs of RPW8 (HR) 1 to HR4 are also localized to the EHM and contribute to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance has not been determined. Here, we report that overexpression of <i>HR1</i>, <i>HR2</i>, or <i>HR3</i> led to enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to powdery mildew, while genetic depletion of <i>HR2</i> or <i>HR3</i> resulted in enhanced susceptibility, indicating that these <i>RPW8</i> homologs contribute to basal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. Interestingly, we found that N-terminally YFP-tagged HR1 to HR3 are also EHM-localized. This suggests that EHM-targeting is an ancestral feature of the RPW8 family. Indeed, two RPW8 homologs from <i>Brassica oleracea</i> tested also exhibit EHM-localization. Domain swapping analysis between HR3 and RPW8.2 suggests that sequence diversification in the N-terminal 146 amino acids of RPW8.2 probably functionally distinguishes it from other family members. Moreover, we found that N-terminally YFP-tagged HR3 is also localized to the plasma membrane and the fungal penetration site (the papilla) in addition to the EHM. Using this unique feature of YFP-HR3, we obtained preliminary evidence to suggest that the EHM is unlikely derived from invagination of the plasma membrane, rather it may be mainly synthesized de novo.</p>

Two Chloroplast Proteins Suppress Drought Resistance by Affecting ROS Production in Guard Cells
<p>Chloroplast as the site for photosynthesis is an essential organelle in plants, but little is known about its role in stomatal regulation and drought <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. In this study, we show that two chloroplastic proteins essential for thylakoid formation negatively regulate drought <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). By screening a mutant pool with T-DNA insertions in nuclear genes encoding chloroplastic proteins, we identified an <i>HCF106</i> knockdown mutant exhibiting increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to drought stress. The <i>hcf106</i> mutant displayed elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in guard cells, improved stomatal closure, and reduced water loss under drought conditions. The HCF106 protein was found to physically interact with THF1, a previously identified chloroplastic protein crucial for thylakoid formation. The <i>thf1</i> mutant phenotypically resembled the <i>hcf106</i> mutant and displayed more ROS accumulation in guard cells, increased stomatal closure, reduced water loss, and drought <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant phenotypes compared to the wild type. The <i>hcf106thf1</i> double mutant behaved similarly as the <i>thf1</i> single mutant. These results suggest that HCF106 and THF1 form a complex to modulate chloroplast function and that the complex is important for ROS production in guard cells and stomatal control in response to environmental stresses. Our results also suggest that modulating chloroplastic proteins could be a way for improving drought <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in crops.</p>

SENSITIVE TO FREEZING2 Aides in Resilience to Salt and Drought in Freezing-Sensitive Tomato
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>IVE TO FREEZING2 (SFR2) is crucial for protecting chloroplast membranes following freezing in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). It has been shown that SFR2 homologs are present in all land plants, including freezing-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive species, raising the question of SFR2 function beyond freezing tolerance. Similar to freezing, salt and drought can cause dehydration. Thus, it is hypothesized that in freezing-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive plants SFR2 may play roles in their resilience to salt or drought. To test this hypothesis, <i>SlSFR2</i> RNAi lines were generated in the cold/freezing-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive species tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i> [M82 <i>cv</i>]). Hyper<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity to salt and drought of <i>SlSFR2</i>-RNAi lines was observed. Higher tolerance of wild-type tomatoes was correlated with the production of trigalactosyldiacylglycerol, a product of SFR2 activity. Tomato SFR2 in vitro activity is Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and its optimal pH is 7.5, similar to that of Arabidopsis SFR2, but the specific activity of tomato SFR2 in vitro is almost double that of Arabidopsis SFR2. When salt and drought stress were applied to Arabidopsis, no conditions could be identified at which SFR2 was induced prior to irreversibly impacting plant growth, suggesting that SFR2 protects Arabidopsis primarily against freezing. Discovery of tomato SFR2 function in drought and salt resilience provides further insights into general membrane lipid remodeling-based stress tolerance mechanisms and together with protection against freezing in freezing-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant plants such as Arabidopsis, it adds lipid remodeling as a possible target for the engineering of abiotic stress-resilient crops.</p>

Bone-like crack resistance in hierarchical metastable nanolaminate steels

A Critical Role of Sodium Flux via the Plasma Membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> Exchanger SOS1 in the Salt Tolerance of Rice
<p>Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) stands among the world's most important crop species. Rice is salt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive, and the undue accumulation of sodium ions (Na<sup>+</sup>) in shoots has the strongest negative correlation with rice productivity under long-term salinity. The plasma membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger protein Salt Overly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive 1 (SOS1) is the sole Na<sup>+</sup> efflux transporter that has been genetically characterized to date. Here, the importance of SOS1-facilitated Na<sup>+</sup> flux in the salt tolerance of rice was analyzed in a reverse-genetics approach. A <i>sos1</i> loss-of-function mutant displayed exceptional salt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity that was correlated with excessive Na<sup>+</sup> intake and impaired Na<sup>+</sup> loading into the xylem, thus indicating that SOS1 controls net root Na<sup>+</sup> uptake and long-distance Na<sup>+</sup> transport to shoots. The acute Na<sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity of <i>sos1</i> plants at low NaCl concentrations allowed analysis of the transcriptional response to sodicity stress without effects of the osmotic stress intrinsic to high-salinity treatments. In contrast with that in the wild type, <i>sos1</i> mutant roots displayed preferential down-regulation of stress-related genes in response to salt treatment, despite the greater intensity of stress experienced by the mutant. These results suggest there is impaired stress detection or an inability to mount a comprehensive response to salinity in <i>sos1</i>. In summary, the plasma membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger SOS1 plays a major role in the salt tolerance of rice by controlling Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis and possibly contributing to the sensing of sodicity stress.</p>

The Structural Integrity of Lignin Is Crucial for Resistance against <i>Striga hermonthica</i> Parasitism in Rice

In eastern and central Africa, <i>Striga</i> spp. infest as much as 40 million hectares of smallholder farmland causing total crop failure during severe infestation. As the molecular mechanisms underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance are yet to be elucidated, we undertook a comparative metabolome study using the <i>Striga</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) cultivar ‘Nipponbare’ and the susceptible cultivar ‘Koshihikari’. We found that a number of metabolites accumulated preferentially in the <i>Striga</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant cultivar upon <i>Striga hermonthica</i> infection. Most apparent was increased deposition of lignin, a phenylpropanoid polymer mainly composed of <i>p</i>-hydroxyphenyl (H), guaiacyl (G), and syringyl (S) aromatic units, around the site of interaction in Nipponbare. The increased deposition of lignin was accompanied by induction of the expression of corresponding enzyme-encoding genes in the phenylpropanoid pathway. In addition, perturbing normal lignin composition by knocking down or overexpressing the genes that regulate lignin composition, i.e. <i>p</i>-COUMARATE 3-HYDROXYLASE or FERULATE 5-HYDROXYLASE, enhanced susceptibility of Nipponbare to <i>S</i>. <i>hermonthica</i> infection.

The Coiled-Coil NLR <i>Rph1</i>, Confers Leaf Rust Resistance in Barley Cultivar Sudan
<p>Unraveling and exploiting mechanisms of disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in cereal crops is currently limited by their large repeat-rich genomes and the lack of genetic recombination or cultivar (cv)-specific sequence information. We cloned the first leaf rust <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance gene <i>Rph1</i> (<i>Rph1</i>.<i>a</i>) from cultivated barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) using “MutChromSeq,” a recently developed molecular genomics tool for the rapid cloning of genes in plants. Marker-trait association in the CI 9214/Stirling doubled haploid population mapped <i>Rph1</i> to the short arm of chromosome 2H in a physical region of 1.3 megabases relative to the barley cv Morex reference assembly. A sodium azide mutant population in cv Sudan was generated and 10 mutants were confirmed by progeny-testing. Flow-sorted 2H chromosomes from Sudan (wild type) and six of the mutants were sequenced and compared to identify candidate genes for the <i>Rph1</i> locus. MutChromSeq identified a single gene candidate encoding a coiled-coil nucleotide binding site Leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptor protein that was altered in three different mutants. Further Sanger sequencing confirmed all three mutations and identified an additional two independent mutations within the same candidate gene. Phylogenetic analysis determined that <i>Rph1</i> clustered separately from all previously cloned NLRs from the Triticeae and displayed highest sequence similarity (89%) with a homolog of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance protein 1 protein in <i>Triticum urartu</i>.

The Causes of Leaf Hydraulic Vulnerability and Its Influence on Gas Exchange in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>The influence of the dynamics of leaf hydraulic conductance (<i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub>) diurnally and during dehydration on stomatal conductance and photosynthesis remains unclear. Using the model species Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> ecotype Columbia-0), we applied a multitiered approach including physiological measurements, high-resolution x-ray microcomputed tomography, and modeling at a range of scales to characterize (1) <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> decline during dehydration; (2) its basis in the hydraulic conductances of leaf xylem and outside-xylem pathways (<i>K</i><sub>ox</sub>); (3) the dependence of its dynamics on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">irradi</span></strong>ance; (4) its impact on diurnal patterns of stomatal conductance and photosynthetic rate; and (5) its influence on gas exchange and survival under simulated drought regimes. Arabidopsis leaves showed strong vulnerability to dehydration diurnally in both gas exchange and hydraulic conductance, despite lack of xylem embolism or conduit collapse above the turgor loss point, indicating a pronounced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity of <i>K</i><sub>ox</sub> to dehydration. <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> increased under higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">irradi</span></strong>ance in well-hydrated leaves across the full range of water potential, but no shift in <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> vulnerability was observed. Modeling indicated that responses to dehydration and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">irradi</span></strong>ance are likely attributable to changes in membrane permeability and that a dynamic <i>K</i><sub>ox</sub> would contribute strongly to stomatal closure, improving performance, survival, and efficient water use during drought. These findings for Columbia-0 provide a baseline for assessing variation across genotypes in hydraulic traits and their influence on gas exchange during dehydration.</p>

Distinct Roles of Non-Overlapping Surface Regions of the Coiled-Coil Domain in the Potato Immune Receptor Rx1
<p>The intracellular immune receptor Rx1 of potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>), which confers effector-triggered immunity to <i>Potato virus X</i>, consists of a central nucleotide-binding domain (NB-ARC) flanked by a carboxyl-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain and an amino-terminal coiled-coil (CC) domain. Rx1 activity is strictly regulated by interdomain interactions between the NB-ARC and LRR, but the contribution of the CC domain in regulating Rx1 activity or immune signaling is not fully understood. Therefore, we used a structure-informed approach to investigate the role of the CC domain in Rx1 functionality. Targeted mutagenesis of CC surface residues revealed separate regions required for the intramolecular and intermolecular interaction of the CC with the NB-ARC-LRR and the cofactor Ran GTPase-activating protein2 (RanGAP2), respectively. None of the mutant Rx1 proteins was constitutively active, indicating that the CC does not contribute to the autoinhibition of Rx1 activity. Instead, the CC domain acted as a modulator of downstream responses involved in effector-triggered immunity. Systematic disruption of the hydrophobic interface between the four helices of the CC enabled the uncoupling of cell death and disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance responses. Moreover, a strong dominant negative effect on Rx1-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance and cell death was observed upon coexpression of the CC alone with full-length Rx1 protein, which depended on the RanGAP2-binding surface of the CC. Surprisingly, coexpression of the N-terminal half of the CC enhanced Rx1-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance, which further indicated that the CC functions as a scaffold for downstream components involved in the modulation of disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance or cell death signaling.</p>

<i>NLR</i> Mutations Suppressing Immune Hybrid Incompatibility and Their Effects on Disease Resistance
<p>Genetic divergence between populations can lead to reproductive isolation. Hybrid incompatibilities (HI) represent intermediate points along a continuum toward speciation. In plants, genetic variation in disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance (<i>R</i>) genes underlies several cases of HI. The progeny of a cross between Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) accessions Landsberg <i>erecta</i> (L<i>er</i>, Poland) and Kashmir2 (Kas2, central Asia) exhibits immune-related HI. This incompatibility is due to a genetic interaction between a cluster of eight <i>TNL (TOLL/INTERLEUKIN1 RECEPTOR-NUCLEOTIDE BINDING-LEU RICH REPEAT</i>) <i>RPP1</i> (<i>RECOGNITION OF PERONOSPORA PARASITICA1)</i>-<i>like</i> genes (<i>R1</i>–<i>R8</i>) from L<i>er</i> and central Asian alleles of a <i>Strubbelig</i>-family receptor-like kinase (<i>SRF3</i>) from Kas2. In characterizing mutants altered in L<i>er</i>/Kas2 HI, we mapped multiple mutations to the <i>RPP1</i>-like L<i>er</i> locus. Analysis of these <i>suppressor of Ler/Kas2 incompatibility</i> (<i>sulki</i>) mutants reveals complex, additive and epistatic interactions underlying <i>RPP1</i>-<i>like</i> L<i>er</i> locus activity. The effects of these mutations were measured on basal defense, global gene expression, primary metabolism, and disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to a local <i>Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis</i> isolate (<i>Hpa</i> Gw) collected from Gorzéáéáów (Gw), where the Landsberg accession originated. Gene expression sectors and metabolic hallmarks identified for HI are both dependent and independent of <i>RPP1</i>-<i>like</i> L<i>er</i> members. We establish that mutations suppressing immune-related L<i>er</i>/Kas2 HI do not compromise <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to <i>Hpa</i> Gw. QTL mapping analysis of <i>Hpa</i> Gw <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance point to <i>RPP7</i> as the causal locus. This work provides insight into the complex genetic architecture of the <i>RPP1</i>-<i>like</i> L<i>er</i> locus and immune-related HI in Arabidopsis and into the contributions of <i>RPP1</i>-<i>like</i> genes to HI and defense.</p>

Auxin Contributes to the Intraorgan Regulation of Gene Expression in Response to Shade
<p>Plants sense and respond to light via multiple photoreceptors including phytochrome. The decreased ratio of red to far-red light that occurs under a canopy triggers shade-avoidance responses, which allow plants to compete with neighboring plants. The leaf acts as a photoperceptive organ in this response. In this study, we investigated how the shade stimulus is spatially processed within the cotyledon. We performed transcriptome analysis on microtissue samples collected from vascular and nonvascular regions of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) cotyledons. In addition, we mechanically isolated and analyzed the vascular tissue. More genes were up-regulated by the shade stimulus in vascular tissues than in mesophyll and epidermal tissues. The genes up-regulated in the vasculature were functionally divergent and included many auxin-responsive genes, suggesting that various physiological/developmental processes might be controlled by shade stimulus in the vasculature. We then investigated the spatial regulation of these genes in the vascular tissues. A small vascular region within a cotyledon was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">irradi</span></strong>ated with far-red light, and the response was compared with that when the whole seedling was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">irradi</span></strong>ated with far-red light. Most of the auxin-responsive genes were not fully induced by the local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">irradi</span></strong>ation, suggesting that perception of the shade stimulus requires that a wider area be exposed to far-red light or that a certain position in the mesophyll and epidermis of the cotyledon be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">irradi</span></strong>ated. This result was consistent with a previous report that auxin synthesis genes are up-regulated in the periphery of the cotyledon. Hence, auxin acts as an important intraorgan signaling factor that controls the vascular shade response within the cotyledon.</p>

Knockdown of Rice MicroRNA166 Confers Drought Resistance by Causing Leaf Rolling and Altering Stem Xylem Development
<p>MicroRNAs are 19- to 22-nucleotide small noncoding RNAs that have been implicated in abiotic stress responses. In this study, we found that knockdown of microRNA166, using the Short Tandem Target Mimic (STTM) system, resulted in morphological changes that confer drought <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). From a large-scale screen for miRNA knockdown lines in rice, we identified miR166 knockdown lines (STTM166); these plants exhibit a rolled-leaf phenotype, which is normally displayed by rice plants under drought stress. The leaves of STTM166 rice plants had smaller bulliform cells and abnormal sclerenchymatous cells, likely causing the rolled-leaf phenotype. The STTM166 plants had reduced stomatal conductance and showed decreased transpiration rates. The STTM166 lines also exhibited altered stem xylem and decreased hydraulic conductivity, likely due to the reduced diameter of the xylem vessels. Molecular analyses identified rice <i>HOMEODOMAIN CONTAINING PROTEIN4</i> (<i>OsHB4</i>), a member of HD-Zip III gene family, as a major target of miR166; moreover, rice plants overexpressing a miR166-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant form of <i>OsHB4</i> resembled the STTM166 plants, including leaf rolling and higher drought <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. The genes downstream of miR166-<i>OsHB4</i> consisted of polysaccharide synthesis-related genes that may contribute to cell wall formation and vascular development. Our results suggest that drought <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in rice can be increased by manipulating miRNAs, which leads to developmental changes, such as leaf rolling and reduced diameter of the xylem, that mimic plants’ natural responses to water-deficit stress.</p>

BcXYG1, a Secreted Xyloglucanase from <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>, Triggers Both Cell Death and Plant Immune Responses
<p>In search of <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> cell death-inducing proteins, we found a xyloglucanase (BcXYG1) that induced strong necrosis and a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance response in dicot plants. Expression of the <i>BcXYG1</i> gene was strongly induced during the first 12 h post inoculation, and analysis of disease dynamics using PathTrack showed that a <i>B. cinerea</i> strain overexpressing <i>BcXYG1</i> produced early local necrosis, supporting a role of BcXYG1 as an early cell death-inducing factor. The xyloglucanase activity of BcXYG1 was not necessary for the induction of necrosis and plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance, as a mutant of BcXYG1 lacking the xyloglucanase enzymatic activity retained both functions. Residues in two exposed loops on the surface of BcXYG1 were found to be necessary for the induction of cell death but not to induce plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. Further analyses showed that BcXYG1 is apoplastic and possibly interacts with the proteins of the plant cell membrane and also that the BcXYG1 cell death-promoting signal is mediated by the leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases BAK1 and SOBIR1. Our findings support the role of cell death-inducing proteins in establishing the infection of necrotrophic pathogens and highlight the recognition of fungal apoplastic proteins by the plant immune system as an important mechanism of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance against this class of pathogens.</p>

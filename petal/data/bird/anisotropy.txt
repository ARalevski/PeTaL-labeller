Protein crystallization promotes type 2 immunity and is reversible by antibody treatment
<p>Although spontaneous protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization is a rare event in vivo, Charcot-Leyden <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s (CLCs) consisting of galectin-10 (Gal10) protein are frequently observed in eosinophilic diseases, such as asthma. We found that CLCs derived from patients showed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> packing and Gal10 structure identical to those of Gal10 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s grown in vitro. When administered to the airways, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>line Gal10 stimulated innate and adaptive immunity and acted as a type 2 adjuvant. By contrast, a soluble Gal10 mutein was inert. Antibodies <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ed against key epitopes of the CLC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization interface dissolved preexisting CLCs in patient-derived mucus within hours and reversed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>-driven inflammation, goblet-cell metaplasia, immunoglobulin E (IgE) synthesis, and bronchial hyperreactivity (BHR) in a humanized mouse model of asthma. Thus, protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s may promote hallmark features of asthma and are targetable by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>-dissolving antibodies.</p>

Interhospital Transfer Before Thrombectomy Is Associated With Delayed Treatment and Worse Outcome in the STRATIS Registry (Systematic Evaluation of Patients Treated With Neurothrombectomy Devices for Acute Ischemic Stroke)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Endovascular treatment with mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is beneficial for patients with acute stroke suffering a large-vessel occlusion, although treatment efficacy is highly time-dependent. We hypothesized that interhospital transfer to endovascular-capable centers would result in treatment delays and worse clinical outcomes compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong> presentation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>STRATIS (Systematic Evaluation of Patients Treated With Neurothrombectomy Devices for Acute Ischemic Stroke) was a prospective, multicenter, observational, single-arm study of real-world MT for acute stroke because of anterior-circulation large-vessel occlusion performed at 55 sites over 2 years, including 1000 patients with severe stroke and treated within 8 hours. Patients underwent MT with or without intravenous tissue plasminogen activator and were admitted to endovascular-capable centers via either interhospital transfer or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong> presentation. The primary clinical outcome was functional independence (modified Rankin Score 0–2) at 90 days. We assessed (1) real-world time metrics of stroke care delivery, (2) outcome differences between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong> and transfer patients undergoing MT, and (3) the potential impact of local hospital bypass.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 984 patients were analyzed. Median onset-to-revascularization time was 202.0 minutes for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong> versus 311.5 minutes for transfer patients (<i>P</i><0.001). Clinical outcomes were better in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong> group, with 60.0% (299/498) achieving functional independence compared with 52.2% (213/408) in the transfer group (odds ratio, 1.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.06–1.79; <i>P</i>=0.02). Likewise, excellent outcome (modified Rankin Score 0–1) was achieved in 47.4% (236/498) of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong> patients versus 38.0% (155/408) of transfer patients (odds ratio, 1.47; 95% confidence interval, 1.13–1.92; <i>P</i>=0.005). Mortality did not differ between the 2 groups (15.1% for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>, 13.7% for transfer; <i>P</i>=0.55). Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator did not impact outcomes. Hypothetical bypass modeling for all transferred patients suggested that intravenous tissue plasminogen activator would be delayed by 12 minutes, but MT would be performed 91 minutes sooner if patients were routed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ly to endovascular-capable centers. If bypass is limited to a 20-mile radius from onset, then intravenous tissue plasminogen activator would be delayed by 7 minutes and MT performed 94 minutes earlier.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In this large, real-world study, interhospital transfer was associated with significant treatment delays and lower chance of good outcome. Strategies to facilitate more rapid identification of large-vessel occlusion and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong> routing to endovascular-capable centers for patients with severe stroke may improve outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Colossal grain growth yields single-crystal metal foils by contact-free annealing
<p>Single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> metals have distinctive properties owing to the absence of grain boundaries and strong anisotropy. Commercial single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> metals are usually synthesized by bulk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> growth or by deposition of thin films onto substrates, and they are expensive and small. We prepared extremely large single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> metal foils by “contact-free annealing” from commercial poly<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>line foils. The colossal grain growth (up to 32 square centimeters) is achieved by minimizing contact stresses, resulting in a preferred in-plane and out-of-plane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> orientation, and is driven by surface energy minimization during the rotation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> lattice followed by “consumption” of neighboring grains. Industrial-scale production of single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> metal foils is possible as a result of this discovery.</p>

Single-crystal x-ray diffraction structures of covalent organic frameworks
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization problem is an outstanding challenge in the chemistry of porous covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Their structural characterization has been limited to modeling and solutions based on powder x-ray or electron diffraction data. Single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s of COFs amenable to x-ray diffraction characterization have not been reported. Here, we developed a general procedure to grow large single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s of three-dimensional imine-based COFs (COF-300, hydrated form of COF-300, COF-303, LZU-79, and LZU-111). The high quality of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s allowed collection of single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> x-ray diffraction data of up to 0.83-angstrom resolution, leading to unambiguous solution and precise an<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotropi</span></strong>c refinement. Characteristics such as degree of interpenetration, arrangement of water guests, the reversed imine connectivity, linker disorder, and uncommon topology were deciphered with atomic precision—aspects impossible to determine without single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s.</p>

Electronic crystal growth
<p>Interacting atoms or molecules condense into liquid, and, when cooled further, they form a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>. The time evolution of the atomic or molecular ordering has been widely studied as a nonequilibrium emergence of order from a supercooled liquid or a glass. Interacting electrons in a variety of correlated electron systems also form <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s, but observing the time evolution of electronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization has been experimentally challenging. Here, working with an organic conductor exhibiting a supercooled charge liquid or charge glass as a metastable state, we observed electronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> growth through resistivity and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements. The temperature profile of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> growth is similar to those observed in classical systems and reveals two distinct regimes for the mechanism of electronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization.</p>

3D charge and 2D phonon transports leading to high out-of-plane <i>ZT</i> in n-type SnSe crystals
<p>Thermoelectric technology enables the harvest of waste heat and its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong> conversion into electricity. The conversion efficiency is determined by the materials figure of merit <i>ZT</i>. Here we show a maximum <i>ZT</i> of ~2.8 ± 0.5 at 773 kelvin in n-type tin selenide (SnSe) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s out of plane. The thermal conductivity in layered SnSe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s is the lowest in the out-of-plane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ion [two-dimensional (2D) phonon transport]. We doped SnSe with bromine to make n-type SnSe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s with the overlapping interlayer charge density (3D charge transport). A continuous phase transition increases the symmetry and diverges two converged conduction bands. These two factors improve carrier mobility, while preserving a large Seebeck coefficient. Our findings can be applied in 2D layered materials and provide a new strategy to enhance out-of-plane electrical transport properties without degrading thermal properties.</p>

Reducing the stochasticity of crystal nucleation to enable subnanosecond memory writing
<p>Operation speed is a key challenge in phase-change random-access memory (PCRAM) technology, especially for achieving subnanosecond high-speed cache memory. Commercialized PCRAM products are limited by the tens of nanoseconds writing speed, originating from the stochastic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> nucleation during the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization of amorphous germanium antimony telluride<i> </i>(Ge<sub>2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>5</sub>). Here, we demonstrate an alloying strategy to speed up the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization kinetics. The scandium antimony telluride (Sc<sub>0.2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>) compound that we designed allows a writing speed of only 700 picoseconds without preprogramming in a large conventional PCRAM device. This ultrafast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization stems from the reduced stochasticity of nucleation through geometrically matched and robust scandium telluride (ScTe) chemical bonds that stabilize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> precursors in the amorphous state. Controlling nucleation through alloy design paves the way for the development of cache-type PCRAM technology to boost the working efficiency of computing systems.</p>

Vectorial representation of spatial goals in the hippocampus of bats
<p>To navigate, animals need to represent not only their own position and orientation, but also the location of their goal. Neural representations of an animal’s own position and orientation have been extensively studied. However, it is unknown how navigational goals are encoded in the brain. We recorded from hippocampal CA1 neurons of bats flying in complex trajectories toward a spatial goal. We discovered a subpopulation of neurons with angular tuning to the goal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ion. Many of these neurons were tuned to an occluded goal, suggesting that goal-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ion representation is memory-based. We also found cells that encoded the distance to the goal, often in conjunction with goal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ion. The goal-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ion and goal-distance signals make up a vectorial representation of spatial goals, suggesting a previously unrecognized neuronal mechanism for goal-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ed navigation.</p>

Crystal-clear treatment for allergic disease
<p>Charcot-Leyden <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s (CLCs) are protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s produced by human eosinophils, immune cells typically associated with allergy and parasitic worm (helminth) infection. These responses involve the “type 2” arm of the immune system, and CLCs are a hallmark of the more severe pathologies that can occur during type 2 inflammation, such as allergic asthma. Although described over 160 years ago, the biological relevance of CLCs to type 2 immunity has remained unknown. On page 751 of this issue, Persson <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) confirm anecdotal evidence that CLCs are a key feature of severe asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. They demonstrate that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s, but not the soluble proteins, are powerful promoters of allergic inflammation and can be targeted with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>-dissolving antibodies to reverse disease symptoms.</p>

Giant piezoelectricity of Sm-doped Pb(Mg<sub>1/3</sub>Nb<sub>2/3</sub>)O<sub>3</sub>-PbTiO<sub>3</sub> single crystals
<p>High-performance piezoelectrics benefit transducers and sensors in a variety of electromechanical applications. The materials with the highest piezoelectric charge coefficients (<i>d</i><sub>33</sub>) are relaxor-PbTiO<sub>3</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s, which were discovered two decades ago. We successfully grew Sm-doped Pb(Mg<sub>1/3</sub>Nb<sub>2/3</sub>)O<sub>3</sub>-PbTiO<sub>3</sub> (Sm-PMN-PT) single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s with even higher <i>d</i><sub>33</sub> values ranging from 3400 to 4100 picocoulombs per newton, with variation below 20% over the as-grown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> boule, exhibiting good property uniformity. We characterized the Sm-PMN-PT on the atomic scale with scanning transmission electron microscopy and made first-principles calculations to determine that the giant piezoelectric properties arise from the enhanced local structural heterogeneity introduced by Sm<sup>3+</sup> dopants. Rare-earth doping is thus identified as a general strategy for introducing local structural heterogeneity in order to enhance the piezoelectricity of relaxor ferroelectric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s.</p>

Fluorine-programmed nanozipping to tailored nanographenes on rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> surfaces
<p>The rational synthesis of nanographenes and carbon nanoribbons <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ly on nonmetallic surfaces has been an elusive goal for a long time. We report that activation of the carbon (C)–fluorine (F) bond is a reliable and versatile tool enabling intramolecular aryl-aryl coupling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ly on metal oxide surfaces. A challenging multistep transformation enabled by C–F bond activation led to a dominolike coupling that yielded tailored nanographenes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ly on the rutile titania surface. Because of efficient regioselective zipping, we obtained the target nanographenes from flexible precursors. Fluorine positions in the precursor structure unambiguously dictated the running of the “zipping program,” resulting in the rolling up of oligophenylene chains. The high efficiency of the hydrogen fluoride zipping makes our approach attractive for the rational synthesis of nanographenes and nanoribbons <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ly on insulating and semiconducting surfaces.</p>

SLAM-seq defines direct gene-regulatory functions of the BRD4-MYC axis
<p>Defining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong> targets of transcription factors and regulatory pathways is key to understanding their roles in physiology and disease. We combined SLAM-seq [thiol(SH)–linked alkylation for the metabolic sequencing of RNA], a method for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong> quantification of newly synthesized messenger RNAs (mRNAs), with pharmacological and chemical-genetic perturbation in order to define regulatory functions of two transcriptional hubs in cancer, BRD4 and MYC, and to interrogate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong> responses to BET bromodomain inhibitors (BETis). We found that BRD4 acts as general coactivator of RNA polymerase II–dependent transcription, which is broadly repressed upon high-dose BETi treatment. At doses triggering selective effects in leukemia, BETis deregulate a small set of hypersensitive targets including MYC. In contrast to BRD4, MYC primarily acts as a selective transcriptional activator controlling metabolic processes such as ribosome biogenesis and de novo purine synthesis. Our study establishes a simple and scalable strategy to identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong> transcriptional targets of any gene or pathway.</p>

Extraordinary plasticity of an inorganic semiconductor in darkness
<p>Inorganic semiconductors generally tend to fail in a brittle manner. Here, we report that extraordinary “plasticity” can take place in an inorganic semiconductor if the deformation is carried out “in complete darkness.” Room-temperature deformation tests of zinc sulfide (ZnS) were performed under varying light conditions. ZnS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s immediately fractured when they deformed under light irradiation. In contrast, it was found that ZnS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s can be plastically deformed up to a deformation strain of ε<sub>t</sub> = 45% in complete darkness. In addition, the optical bandgap of the deformed ZnS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s was distinctly decreased after deformation. These results suggest that dislocations in ZnS become mobile in complete darkness and that multiplied dislocations can affect the optical bandgap over the whole <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>. Inorganic semiconductors are not necessarily intrinsically brittle.</p>

Light amplification by seeded Kerr instability

Such amplified pulses are ideal to study strong-field processes in solids and highly excited states in gases.</p>

Developmental Programming of Thermonastic Leaf Movement
<p>Plants exhibit diverse polar behaviors in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ional and non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ional environmental signals, termed tropic and nastic movements, respectively. The ways in which plants incorporate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ional information into tropic behaviors is well understood, but it is less well understood how non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ional stimuli, such as ambient temperatures, specify the polarity of nastic behaviors. Here, we demonstrate that a developmentally programmed polarity of auxin flow underlies thermo-induced leaf hyponasty in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). In warm environments, PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR4 (PIF4) stimulates auxin production in the leaf. This results in the accumulation of auxin in leaf petioles, where PIF4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ly activates a gene encoding the PINOID (PID) protein kinase. PID is involved in polarization of the auxin transporter PIN-FORMED3 to the outer membranes of petiole cells. Notably, the leaf polarity-determining ASYMMETRIC LEAVES1 (AS1) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>s the induction of <i>PID</i> to occur predominantly in the abaxial petiole region. These observations indicate that the integration of PIF4-mediated auxin biosynthesis and polar transport, and the AS1-mediated developmental shaping of polar auxin flow, coordinate leaf thermonasty, which facilitates leaf cooling in warm environments. We believe that leaf thermonasty is a suitable model system for studying the developmental programming of environmental adaptation in plants.</p>

Excess Diffuse Light Absorption in Upper Mesophyll Limits CO<sub>2</sub> Drawdown and Depresses Photosynthesis
<p>In agricultural and natural systems, diffuse light can enhance plant primary productivity due to deeper penetration into and greater irradiance of the entire canopy. However, for individual sun-grown leaves from three species, photosynthesis is actually less efficient under diffuse compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong> light. Despite its potential impact on canopy-level productivity, the mechanism for this leaf-level diffuse light photosynthetic depression effect is unknown. Here, we investigate if the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spatial distribut</span></strong>ion of light absorption relative to electron transport capacity in sun- and shade-grown sunflower (<i>Helianthus annuus</i>) leaves underlies its previously observed diffuse light photosynthetic depression. Using a new one-dimensional porous medium finite element gas-exchange model parameterized with light absorption profiles, we found that weaker penetration of diffuse versus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong> light into the mesophyll of sun-grown sunflower leaves led to a more heterogenous saturation of electron transport capacity and lowered its CO<sub>2</sub> concentration drawdown capacity in the intercellular airspace and chloroplast stroma. This decoupling of light availability from photosynthetic capacity under diffuse light is sufficient to generate an 11% decline in photosynthesis in sun-grown but not shade-grown leaves, primarily because thin shade-grown leaves similarly distribute diffuse and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong> light throughout the mesophyll. Finally, we illustrate how diffuse light photosynthetic depression could overcome enhancement in canopies with low light extinction coefficients and/or leaf area, pointing toward a novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ion for future research.</p>

Direct Determination of the Mutation Rate in the Bumblebee Reveals Evidence for Weak Recombination-Associated Mutation and an Approximate Rate Constancy in Insects
<p>Accurate knowledge of the mutation rate provides a base line for inferring expected rates of evolution, for testing evolutionary hypotheses and for estimation of key parameters. Advances in sequencing technology now permit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong> estimates of the mutation rate from sequencing of close relatives. Within insects there have been three prior such estimates, two in nonsocial insects (<i>Drosophila</i>: 2.8 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> per bp per haploid genome per generation; <i>Heliconius</i>: 2.9 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>) and one in a social species, the honeybee (3.4 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>). Might the honeybee’s rate be ∼20% higher because it has an exceptionally high recombination rate and recombination may be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ly or in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ly mutagenic? To address this possibility, we provide a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong> estimate of the mutation rate in the bumblebee (<i>Bombus terrestris</i>), this being a close relative of the honeybee but with a much lower recombination rate. We confirm that the crossover rate of the bumblebee is indeed much lower than honeybees (8.7 cM/Mb vs. 37 cM/Mb). Importantly, we find no significant difference in the mutation rates: we estimate for bumblebees a rate of 3.6 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> per haploid genome per generation (95% confidence intervals 2.38 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> and 5.37 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>) which is just 5% higher than the estimate that of honeybees. Both genomes have approximately one new mutation per haploid genome per generation. While we find evidence for a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong> coupling between recombination and mutation (also seen in honeybees), the effect is so weak as to leave almost no footprint on any between-species differences. The similarity in mutation rates suggests an approximate constancy of the mutation rate in insects.</p>

Moving without a purpose: an experimental study of swarm guidance in the Western honey bee, <i>Apis mellifera</i>
<p>During reproductive swarming, honey bee scouts perform two very important functions. Firstly, they find new nesting locations and return to the swarm cluster to communicate their discoveries. Secondly, once the swarm is ready to depart, informed scout bees act as guides, leading the swarm to its final destination. We have previously hypothesised that the two processes, selecting a new nest site and swarm guidance, are tightly linked in honey bees. When swarms can be <i>laissez faire</i> about where they nest, reaching <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ional consensus prior to lift off seems unnecessary. If, in contrast, it is essential that the swarm reaches a precise location, either <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ional consensus must be near unanimous prior to swarm departure or only a select subgroup of the scouts guide the swarm. Here, we tested experimentally whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ional consensus is necessary for the successful guidance of swarms of the Western honey bee <i>Apis mellifera</i> by forcing swarms into the air prior to the completion of the decision-making process. Our results show that swarms were unable to guide themselves prior to the swarm reaching the pre-flight buzzing phase of the decision-making process, even when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ional consensus was high. We therefore suggest that not all scouts involved in the decision-making process attempt to guide the swarm.</p>

Mortality and Cerebrovascular Events After Heart Rhythm Disorder Management Procedures
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Recognition of rates and causes of hard, patient-centered outcomes of death and cerebrovascular events (CVEs) after heart rhythm disorder management (HRDM) procedures is an essential step for the development of quality improvement programs in electrophysiology laboratories. Our primary aim was to assess and characterize death and CVEs (stroke or transient ischemic attack) after HRDM procedures over a 17-year period.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed a retrospective cohort study of all patients undergoing HRDM procedures between January 2000 and November 2016 at the Mayo Clinic. Patients from all 3 tertiary academic centers (Rochester, Phoenix, and Jacksonville) were included in the study. All in-hospital deaths and CVEs after HRDM procedures were identified and were further characterized as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ly or in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ly related to the HRDM procedure. Subgroup analysis of death and CVE rates was performed for ablation, device implantation, electrophysiology study, lead extraction, and defibrillation threshold testing procedures.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 48 913 patients (age, 65.7±6.6 years; 64% male) who underwent a total of 62 065 HRDM procedures were included in the study. The overall mortality and CVE rates in the cohort were 0.36% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31–0.42) and 0.12% (95% CI, 0.09–0.16), respectively. Patients undergoing lead extraction had the highest overall mortality rate at 1.9% (95% CI, 1.34–2.61) and CVE rate at 0.62% (95% CI, 0.32–1.07). Among patients undergoing HRDM procedures, 48% of deaths <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ly related to the HDRM procedure were among patients undergoing device implantation procedures. Overall, cardiac tamponade was the most frequent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong> cause of death (40%), and infection was the most common in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong> cause of death (29%). The overall 30-day mortality rate was 0.76%, with the highest being in lead extraction procedures (3.08%), followed by device implantation procedures (0.94%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Half of the deaths <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ly related to an HRDM procedure were among the patients undergoing device implantation procedures, with cardiac tamponade being the most common cause of death.

Chemoattractant concentration–dependent tuning of ERK signaling dynamics in migrating neutrophils
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ed migration (chemotaxis) of neutrophils toward the bacterial peptide <i>N</i>-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (<i>f</i>MLP) is a crucial process in immune defense against invading bacteria. While navigating through a gradient of increasing concentrations of <i>f</i>MLP, neutrophils and neutrophil-like HL-60 cells switch from exhibiting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ional migration at low <i>f</i>MLP concentrations to exhibiting circuitous migration at high <i>f</i>MLP concentrations. The extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) pathway is implicated in balancing this <i>f</i>MLP concentration–dependent switch in migration modes. We investigated the role and regulation of ERK signaling through single-cell analysis of neutrophil migration in response to different <i>f</i>MLP concentrations over time. We found that ERK exhibited gradated, rather than all-or-none, responses to <i>f</i>MLP concentration. Maximal ERK activation occurred in response to about 100 nM <i>f</i>MLP, and ERK inactivation was promoted by p38. Furthermore, we found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ional migration of neutrophils reached a maximal extent at about 100 nM <i>f</i>MLP and that ERK, but not p38, was required for neutrophil migration. Thus, our data suggest that, in chemotactic neutrophils responding to <i>f</i>MLP, ERK displays gradated activation and p38-dependent inhibition and that these ERK dynamics promote neutrophil migration.</p>

The apo-structure of the leucine sensor Sestrin2 is still elusive
<p>Sestrin2 is a GATOR2-interacting protein that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ly binds leucine and is required for the inhibition of mTORC1 under leucine deprivation, indicating that it is a leucine sensor for the mTORC1 pathway. We recently reported the structure of Sestrin2 in complex with leucine [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID, 5DJ4] and demonstrated that mutations in the leucine-binding pocket that alter the affinity of Sestrin2 for leucine result in a corresponding change in the leucine sensitivity of mTORC1 in cells. A lower resolution structure of human Sestrin2 (PDB ID, 5CUF), which was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lized in the absence of exogenous leucine, showed Sestrin2 to be in a nearly identical conformation as the leucine-bound structure. On the basis of this observation, it has been argued that leucine binding does not affect the conformation of Sestrin2 and that Sestrin2 may not be a sensor for leucine. We show that simple analysis of the reported “apo”-Sestrin2 structure reveals the clear presence of prominent, unmodeled electron density in the leucine-binding pocket that exactly accommodates the leucine observed in the higher resolution structure. Refining the reported apo-structure with leucine eliminated the large <i>F</i><sub>obs</sub>-<i>F</i><sub>calc</sub> difference density at this position and improved the working and free R factors of the model. Consistent with this result, our own structure of Sestrin2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lized in the absence of exogenous leucine also contained electron density that is best explained by leucine. Thus, the structure of apo-Sestrin2 remains elusive.</p>

Identifying protein kinase–specific effectors of the osmostress response in yeast
<p>The budding yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> reacts to increased external osmolarity by modifying many cellular processes. Adaptive signaling relies primarily on the high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway, which is closely related to the mammalian p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in core architecture. To identify target proteins of the MAPK Hog1, we designed a mass spectrometry–based high-throughput experiment to measure the impact of Hog1 activation or inhibition on the <i>S</i>. <i>cerevisiae</i> phosphoproteome. In addition, we analyzed how deletion of <i>RCK2</i>, which encodes a known effector protein kinase target of Hog1, modulated osmotic stress–induced phosphorylation. Our results not only provide an overview of the diversity of cellular functions that are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ly and in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ly affected by the activity of the HOG pathway but also enabled an assessment of the Hog1-independent events that occur under osmotic stress conditions. We extended the number of putative Hog1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong> targets by analyzing the modulation of motifs consisting of serine or threonine followed by a proline (S/T-P motif) and subsequently validated these with an in vivo interaction assay. Rck2 appears to act as a central hub for many Hog1-mediated secondary phosphorylation events. This study clarifies many of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong> and in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong> effects of HOG signaling and its stress-adaptive functions.</p>

Spin coating epitaxial films
<p>Spin-coated films, such as photoresists for lithography or perovskite films for solar cells, are either amorphous or poly<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>line. We show that epitaxial films of inorganic materials such as cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr<sub>3</sub>), lead(II) iodide (PbI<sub>2</sub>), zinc oxide (ZnO), and sodium chloride (NaCl) can be deposited onto a variety of single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> and single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>–like substrates by simply spin coating either solutions of the material or precursors to the material. The out-of-plane and in-plane orientations of the spin-coated films are determined by the substrate. The thin stagnant layer of supersaturated solution produced during spin coating promotes heterogeneous nucleation of the material onto the single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> substrate over homogeneous nucleation in the bulk solution, and ordered anion adlayers may lower the activation energy for nucleation on the surface. The method can be used to produce functional materials such as inorganic semiconductors or to deposit water-soluble materials such as NaCl that can serve as growth templates.</p>

Molecular to organismal chirality is induced by the conserved myosin 1D
<p>The emergence of asymmetry from an initially symmetrical state is a universal transition in nature. Living organisms show asymmetries at the molecular, cellular, tissular, and organismal level. However, whether and how multilevel asymmetries are related remains unclear. In this study, we show that <i>Drosophila</i> myosin 1D (Myo1D) and myosin 1C (Myo1C) are sufficient to generate de novo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ional twisting of cells, single organs, or the whole body in opposite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ions. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ionality lies in the myosins’ motor domain and is swappable between Myo1D and Myo1C. In addition, Myo1D drives gliding of actin filaments in circular, counterclockwise paths in vitro. Altogether, our results reveal the molecular motor Myo1D as a chiral determinant that is sufficient to break symmetry at all biological scales through chiral interaction with the actin cytoskeleton.</p>

Templated nanofiber synthesis via chemical vapor polymerization into liquid crystalline films
<p>Extrusion, electrospinning, and microdrawing are widely used to create fibrous polymer mats, but these approaches offer limited access to oriented arrays of nanometer-scale fibers with controlled size, shape, and lateral organization. We show that chemical vapor polymerization can be performed on surfaces coated with thin films of liquid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s to synthesize organized assemblies of end-attached polymer nanofibers. The process uses low concentrations of radical monomers formed initially in the vapor phase and then diffused into the liquid-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> template. This minimizes monomer-induced changes to the liquid-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> phase and enables access to nanofiber arrays with complex yet precisely defined structures and compositions. The nanofiber arrays permit tailoring of a wide range of functional properties, including adhesion that depends on nanofiber chirality.</p>

This complicated porous structure consists of only one type of fully aromatic multijoint molecule carrying three identical dipyridylphenyl wedges. Despite its high symmetry, this molecule accomplishes difficult tasks by using two of its three wedges for roof-floor formation and using its other wedge for wall formation. Although a C–H···N bond is extremely labile, the porous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> maintains its porosity until thermal breakdown of the C–H···N bonds at 202°C occurs, affording a nonporous polymorph.

Experimental observation of high thermal conductivity in boron arsenide
<p>Improving the thermal management of small-scale devices requires developing materials with high thermal conductivities. The semiconductor boron arsenide (BAs) is an attractive target because of ab initio calculation indicating that single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s have an ultrahigh thermal conductivity. We synthesized BAs single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s without detectable defects and measured a room-temperature thermal conductivity of 1300 watts per meter-kelvin. Our spectroscopy study, in conjunction with atomistic theory, reveals that the distinctive band structure of BAs allows for very long phonon mean free paths and strong high-order anharmonicity through the four-phonon process. The single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> BAs has better thermal conductivity than other metals and semiconductors. Our study establishes BAs as a benchmark material for thermal management applications and exemplifies the power of combining experiments and ab initio theory in new materials discovery.</p>

Two-channel model for ultralow thermal conductivity of crystalline Tl<sub>3</sub>VSe<sub>4</sub>

However, the theoretical limits of lattice thermal conductivity (κ) are unclear. In typical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s a phonon picture is valid, whereas lowest κ values occur in highly disordered materials where this picture fails and heat is supposedly carried by random walk among uncorrelated oscillators. Here we identify a simple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>, Tl<sub>3</sub>VSe<sub>4</sub>, with a calculated phonon κ [0.16 Watts per meter-Kelvin (W/m-K)] one-half that of our measured κ (0.30 W/m-K) at 300 K, approaching disorder κ values, although Raman spectra, specific heat, and temperature dependence of κ reveal typical phonon characteristics. Adding a transport component based on uncorrelated oscillators explains the measured κ and suggests that a two-channel model is necessary for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s with ultralow κ.</p>

Imaging of nonlocal hot-electron energy dissipation via shot noise

A liquid-liquid transition in supercooled aqueous solution related to the HDA-LDA transition
<p>Simulations and theory suggest that the thermodynamic anomalies of water may be related to a phase transition between two supercooled liquid states, but so far this phase transition has not been observed experimentally because of preemptive ice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization.

Instead, this solution underwent a sharp, reversible phase transition between two homogeneous liquid states. The hydrogen-bond structures of these two states are similar to those established for high- and low-density amorphous (HDA and LDA) water. Such structural similarity supports theories that predict a similar sharp transition in pure water under pressure if ice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization could be suppressed.</p>

Escaping the traps of your own hunters
<p>During the first days of an infection, protection is almost entirely provided by innate immunity, a large part of which consists of one type of immune cell—the neutrophil. Neutrophils form the largest group of immune cells in the body [humans produce ∼10<sup>11</sup> neutrophils daily (<i>1</i>)], and they carry out a number of defense mechanisms, including pathogen ingestion (phagocytosis) and the production of toxic chemicals that kill intruders <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ly. They can also cause severe hyperinflammatory diseases, such as lethal influenza-associated lung destruction (<i>2</i>, <i>3</i>). In 2004, another neutrophil defense system was discovered. In a final act of protection, dying neutrophils mix their nuclear DNA with toxic components from their cytosolic granules and release it explosively to form a neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) in the surrounding environment. This process is called NETosis (<i>4</i>). In addition to carrying genetic information, DNA is a very long (each nucleus contains ∼2 m of DNA) and sticky polyanionic molecule. Hence, DNA binds to surfaces such as bacterial cell walls by means of charge interactions (<i>5</i>). Through this immobilization on NETs, pathogens are brought into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong> contact with cytotoxic molecules on the NET-DNA complex. However, free extracellular DNA is also a potent trigger of severe side effects in the body, for example, by forming immune complexes with anti nuclear antibodies (antibodies that can bind to DNA) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (<i>6</i>) or by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ly clogging blood vessels and establishing vessel-blocking thrombi (<i>7</i>). Consequently, finding mechanisms that mediate the degradation of NETs has been a matter of intense research. On page 1202 of this issue, Jiménez-Alcéázar <i>et al.</i> (<i>8</i>) describe two deoxyribonucleases (DNases) [DNase1 and DNase1-like 3 (DNase1L3)], which cleave DNA and together degrade freshly formed NETs. By doing so, they inhibit otherwise lethal immunopathologies such as thrombus-mediated organ failure.</p>

Crystallization and vitrification of electrons in a glass-forming charge liquid
<p>Charge ordering (CO) is a phenomenon in which electrons in solids <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lize into a periodic pattern of charge-rich and charge-poor sites owing to strong electron correlations.

Vinculin forms a directionally asymmetric catch bond with F-actin
<p>Vinculin is an actin-binding protein thought to reinforce cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions. However, how mechanical load affects the vinculin–F-actin bond is unclear. Using a single-molecule optical trap assay, we found that vinculin forms a force-dependent catch bond with F-actin through its tail domain, but with lifetimes that depend strongly on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ion of the applied force. Force toward the pointed (–) end of the actin filament resulted in a bond that was maximally stable at 8 piconewtons, with a mean lifetime (12 seconds) 10 times as long as the mean lifetime when force was applied toward the barbed (+) end. A computational model of lamellipodial actin dynamics suggests that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ionality of the vinculin–F-actin bond could establish long-range order in the actin cytoskeleton.

The expression of <i>OsFDML1</i> overlaps with that of <i>OsMADS6</i> in the palea primordia and the ovule, and OsMADS6 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ly promotes <i>OsFDML1</i> expression through binding to regions containing putative CArG motifs within the <i>OsFDML1</i> promoter during rice spikelet development. Consistent with the phenotypes of <i>osmads6</i> mutants, the <i>osfdml1</i> mutants showed floral defects, including altered palea identity with lemma-like shape containing no marginal region of palea, increased numbers of stigmas and fused carpels, and meristem indeterminacy. Moreover, transgenic plants overexpressing <i>OsFDML1</i> displayed floral defects, such as abnormal paleae. Phylogenetic analysis showed that <i>OsFDML1</i> homologs exist only in terrestrial plants. In addition, protein-protein interaction assays showed that OsFDML1 interacts with its close paralog OsFDML2, similar to the activity of OsFDML1 homologs in Arabidopsis. These results provide insight into how the ancient <i>AGL6</i> gene regulates floral development.</p>

The Citrus Transcription Factor CsMADS6 Modulates Carotenoid Metabolism by Directly Regulating Carotenogenic Genes
<p>Although remarkable progress has been made toward understanding carotenoid biosynthesis, the mechanisms that regulate the transcription of carotenogenic genes remain poorly understood. Lycopene β-cyclases (LCYb) are critical enzymes located at the branch point of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway. Here, we used the promoter sequence of <i>LCYb1</i> as bait in a yeast one-hybrid screen for promoter-binding proteins from sweet orange (<i>Citrus sinensis</i>). This screen identified a MADS transcription factor, CsMADS6, that was coordinately expressed with fruit development and coloration. Acting as a nucleus-localized transcriptional activator, CsMADS6 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ly bound the promoter of <i>LCYb1</i> and activated its expression. Overexpression of <i>CsMADS6</i> in citrus calli increased carotenoid contents and induced the expression of <i>LCYb1</i> and other carotenogenic genes, including <i>phytoene synthase</i> (<i>PSY</i>), <i>phytoene desaturase</i> (<i>PDS</i>), and <i>carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase1</i> (<i>CCD1</i>). CsMADS6 up-regulated the expression of <i>PSY</i>, <i>PDS</i>, and <i>CCD1</i> by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ly binding to their promoters, which suggested the multitargeted regulation of carotenoid metabolism by CsMADS6. In addition, the ectopic expression of <i>CsMADS6</i> in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) affected carotenoid contents and the expression of carotenogenic genes. The sepals of <i>CsMADS6</i>-overexpressing tomato lines exhibited dramatic changes in carotenoid profiles, accompanied by changes in plastid ultrastructure. Global transcriptome analysis of transgenic sepals revealed that CsMADS6 regulates a series of pathways that promote increases in flux through the carotenoid pathway. Overall, these findings establish that CsMADS6 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ly regulates <i>LCYb1</i> and other carotenogenic genes to coordinately and positively modulate carotenoid metabolism in plants, which may provide strategies to improve the nutritional quality of crops.</p>

Biochemical and Structural Analysis of Substrate Specificity of a Phenylalanine Ammonia-Lyase
<p>Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) is the first enzyme of the general phenylpropanoid pathway catalyzing the nonoxidative elimination of ammonia from <sc>l</sc>-phenylalanine to give <i>trans</i>-cinnamate. In monocots, PAL also displays tyrosine ammonia lyase (TAL) activity, leading to the formation of <i>p</i>-coumaric acid. The catalytic mechanism and substrate specificity of a major PAL from sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>; SbPAL1), a strategic plant for bioenergy production, were deduced from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> structur</span></strong>es, molecular docking, site-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ed mutagenesis, and kinetic and thermodynamic analyses. This first <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> structur</span></strong>e of a monocotyledonous PAL displayed a unique conformation in its flexible inner loop of the 4-methylidene-imidazole-5-one (MIO) domain compared with that of dicotyledonous plants. The side chain of histidine-123 in the MIO domain dictated the distance between the catalytic MIO prosthetic group created from <sup>189</sup>Ala-Ser-Gly<sup>191</sup> residues and the bound <sc>l</sc>-phenylalanine and <sc>l</sc>-tyrosine, conferring the deamination reaction through either the Friedel-Crafts or E<sub>2</sub> reaction mechanism. Several recombinant mutant SbPAL1 enzymes were generated via structure-guided mutagenesis, one of which, H123F-SbPAL1, has 6.2 times greater PAL activity without significant TAL activity. Additional PAL isozymes of sorghum were characterized and categorized into three groups. Taken together, this approach identified critical residues and explained substrate preferences among PAL isozymes in sorghum and other monocots, which can serve as the basis for the engineering of plants with enhanced biomass conversion properties, disease resistance, or nutritional quality.</p>

The RopGEF2-ROP7/ROP2 Pathway Activated by phyB Suppresses Red Light-Induced Stomatal Opening<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Circadian rhythm of stomatal aperture is mainly regulated by light/darkness. Blue and red light induce stomatal opening through different mechanisms that are mediated by special receptors. ROP2, a member of Rho GTPase family in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis</i> <i>thaliana</i>), has been found to negatively regulate light-induced stomatal opening. However, the upstream guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) RopGEFs have not been revealed, and it is unclear which photoreceptor is required for the action of RopGEFs-ROPs. Here, we showed that RopGEF2 acted as a negative regulator in phytochrome B (phyB)-mediated red light-induced stomatal opening. Meanwhile, ROP7, another member of ROP family, acting redundantly with ROP2, was regulated by RopGEF2 in this process. RopGEF2 interacted with ROP7 and ROP2 and enhanced their intrinsic nucleotide exchange rates. Furthermore, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong> interactions between phyB and RopGEF2 were detected in vitro and in plants, and phyB enhanced the GEF activity of RopGEF2 toward both ROP7 and ROP2 under light. In addition, RopGEF4 functioned redundantly with RopGEF2 in red light-induced stomatal opening by activating both ROP7 and ROP2, and <i>RopGEF2</i>/<i>RopGEF4</i> acted genetically downstream of <i>phyB</i>; however, the GEF activity of RopGEF4 was not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ly enhanced by phyB. These results revealed that red light-activated phyB enhances the GEF activities of RopGEF2 and RopGEF4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ly or in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ly, and then activate both ROP7 and ROP2 in guard cells. The negative mechanism triggered by phyB prevents the excessive stomatal opening under red light.</p>

Structural and Biochemical Characterization of Cinnamoyl-CoA Reductases
<p>Cinnamoyl-coenzyme A reductase (CCR) catalyzes the reduction of hydroxycinnamoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) esters using NADPH to produce hydroxycinnamyl aldehyde precursors in lignin synthesis. The catalytic mechanism and substrate specificity of cinnamoyl-CoA reductases from sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>), a strategic plant for bioenergy production, were deduced from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> structur</span></strong>es, site-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ed mutagenesis, and kinetic and thermodynamic analyses. Although SbCCR1 displayed higher affinity for caffeoyl-CoA or <i>p</i>-coumaroyl-CoA than for feruloyl-CoA, the enzyme showed significantly higher activity for the latter substrate. Through molecular docking and comparisons between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> structur</span></strong>es of the <i>Vitis vinifera</i> dihydroflavonol reductase and SbCCR1, residues threonine-154 and tyrosine-310 were pinpointed as being involved in binding CoA-conjugated phenylpropanoids. Threonine-154 of SbCCR1 and other CCRs likely confers strong substrate specificity for feruloyl-CoA over other cinnamoyl-CoA thioesters, and the T154Y mutation in SbCCR1 led to broader substrate specificity and faster turnover. Through data mining using our structural and biochemical information, four additional putative <i>CCR</i> genes were discovered from sorghum genomic data. One of these, SbCCR2, displayed greater activity toward <i>p</i>-coumaroyl-CoA than did SbCCR1, which could imply a role in the synthesis of defense-related lignin. Taken together, these findings provide knowledge about critical residues and substrate preference among CCRs and provide, to our knowledge, the first three-dimensional structure information for a CCR from a monocot species.</p>

Gametophytic Pollen Tube Guidance: Attractant Peptides, Gametic Controls, and Receptors
<p>Pollen tube guidance in flowering plants is a unique and critical process for successful sexual reproduction. The pollen tube that grows from pollen, which is the male gametophyte, precisely navigates to the embryo sac, which is the female gametophyte, within the pistil. Recent advances have clarified the molecular framework of gametophytic pollen tube guidance. Multiple species-specific attractant peptides are secreted from synergid cells, the proper development and function of which are regulated by female gametes. Multiple receptor-like kinases on the pollen tube tip are involved in sensing species-specific attractant peptides. In this Update article, recent progress in our understanding of the mechanism of gametophytic pollen tube guidance is reviewed, including attraction by synergid cells, control of pollen tube guidance by female gametes, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ional growth of the pollen tube by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ional cue sensing.

Measuring gill paracellular permeability with polyethylene glycol-4000 in freely swimming trout: proof of principle
<p>The influence of swimming activity on gill paracellular permeability has not been measured previously in fishes. We critically assessed the use of tritium-labeled polyethylene glycol ([<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000) for this purpose, a substance that is also a classic marker for extracellular fluid volume, glomerular filtration rate and drinking rate. Tests (8 h) on resting freshwater trout showed that when measuring [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance from the plasma in the efflux <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ion, correction for a large excretion via glomerular filtration was essential, necessitating urinary catheterization. When measuring [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance from the water in the influx <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ion, correction for a significant uptake by drinking was essential, necessitating terminal gut removal, whereas glomerular filtration losses were minimal. After correction for these alternate routes of loss and uptake, [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance rates by efflux from the plasma and by influx from the water were identical, showing that gill paracellular permeability is not rectified, and can be measured in either <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ion. The influx technique with terminal gut removal was used to assess gill paracellular permeability in trout without urinary catheters freely swimming at 1.2 body lengths s<sup>−1</sup> for 8 h. Branchial [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance rate (by influx from the water) increased significantly by ~80% in accord with a similar measured increase in O<sub>2</sub> consumption rate. Thus in trout, gill paracellular permeability does increase during exercise, in accord with the traditional concept of the osmorespiratory compromise.</p>

Fibroblast-Specific Genetic Manipulation of p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase In Vivo Reveals Its Central Regulatory Role in Fibrosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In the heart, acute injury induces a fibrotic healing response that generates collagen-rich scarring that is at first protective but if inappropriately sustained can worsen heart disease. The fibrotic process is initiated by cytokines, neuroendocrine effectors, and mechanical strain that promote resident fibroblast differentiation into contractile and extracellular matrix–producing myofibroblasts. The mitogen-activated protein kinase p38α (<i>Mapk14</i> gene) is known to influence the cardiac injury response, but its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong> role in orchestrating programmed fibroblast differentiation and fibrosis in vivo is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A conditional <i>Mapk14</i> allele was used to delete the p38α encoding gene specifically in cardiac fibroblasts or myofibroblasts with 2 different tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase–expressing gene–targeted mouse lines. Mice were subjected to ischemic injury or chronic neurohumoral stimulation and monitored for survival, cardiac function, and fibrotic remodeling. Antithetically, mice with fibroblast-specific transgenic overexpression of activated mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 6, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong> inducer of p38, were generated to investigate whether this pathway can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ly drive myofibroblast formation and the cardiac fibrotic response.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In mice, loss of <i>Mapk14</i> blocked cardiac fibroblast differentiation into myofibroblasts and ensuing fibrosis in response to ischemic injury or chronic neurohumoral stimulation. A similar inhibition of myofibroblast formation and healing was also observed in a dermal wounding model with deletion of <i>Mapk14</i>. Transgenic mice with fibroblast-specific activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 6–p38 developed interstitial and perivascular fibrosis in the heart, lung, and kidney as a result of enhanced myofibroblast numbers. Mechanistic experiments show that p38 transduces cytokine and mechanical signals into myofibroblast differentiation through the transcription factor serum response factor and the signaling effector calcineurin.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These findings suggest that signals from diverse modes of injury converge on p38α mitogen-activated protein kinase within the fibroblast to program the fibrotic response and myofibroblast formation in vivo, suggesting a novel therapeutic approach with p38 inhibitors for future clinical application.</p></sec>

Control of Adventitious Root Architecture in Rice by Darkness, Light, and Gravity
<p>Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) is a semiaquatic plant that is well adapted to partial flooding. Rice stems develop adventitious root (AR) primordia at each node that slowly mature but emerge only when the plant gets flooded, leading to the formation of a whole new secondary root system upon flooding. AR growth is induced by ethylene that accumulates in submerged plant tissues due to its lowered diffusion rate in water. Here, we report that the architecture of the secondary root system in flooded rice plants is controlled not only by altered gas diffusion but also by gravity and light. While ethylene promotes the emergence and growth of ARs, gravity and light determine their gravitropic setpoint angle (i.e. the deviation of growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ion relative to vertical). ARs grow upward at about 120° in the dark and downward at 54° in the light. The upward growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ion is conserved in <i>indica</i> and <i>japonica</i> rice varieties, suggestive of a conserved trait in rice. Experiments with a klinostat and with inverted stem orientation revealed that gravity promotes upward growth by about 10°. Red, far-red, and blue light lead to negative phototropism in a dose-dependent manner, with blue light being most effective, indicating that phytochrome and blue light signaling control AR system architecture. The <i>cpt1</i> (<i>coleoptile phototropism1</i>) mutant, which lacks one of the phototropin-interacting CPT proteins, shows reduced sensitivity to blue light. Hence, the gravitropic setpoint angle of rice ARs is controlled by genetic and environmental factors that likely balance the need for oxygen supply (upward growth) with avoidance of root desiccation (downward growth).</p>

Extracellular ATP Acts on Jasmonate Signaling to Reinforce Plant Defense
<p>Damaged cells send various signals to stimulate defense responses. Recent identification and genetic studies of the plant purinoceptor, P2K1 (also known as DORN1), have demonstrated that extracellular ATP is a signal involved in plant stress responses, including wounding, perhaps to evoke plant defense. However, it remains largely unknown how extracellular ATP induces plant defense responses. Here, we demonstrate that extracellular ATP induces plant defense mediated through activation of the intracellular signaling of jasmonate (JA), a well-characterized defense hormone. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves, ATP pretreatment induced resistance against the necrotrophic fungus, <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>. The induced resistance was enhanced in the P2K1 receptor overexpression line, but reduced in the receptor mutant, <i>dorn1</i>-<i>3</i>. Mining the transcriptome data revealed that ATP induces a set of JA-induced genes. In addition, the P2K1-associated coexpression network contains defense-related genes, including those encoding jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins, which play key roles as repressors of JA signaling. We examined whether extracellular ATP impacts the stability of JAZ1 in Arabidopsis. The results showed that the JAZ1 stability decreased in response to ATP addition in a proteasome-dependent manner. This reduction required intracellular signaling via second messengers—cytosolic calcium, reactive oxygen species, and nitric oxide. Interestingly, the ATP-induced JAZ1 degradation was attenuated in the JA receptor mutant, <i>coi1</i>, but not in the JA biosynthesis mutant, <i>aos</i>, or upon addition of JA biosynthesis inhibitors. Immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that ATP increases the interaction between COI1 and JAZ1, suggesting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong> cross talk between extracellular ATP and JA in intracellular signaling events. Taken together, these results suggest that extracellular ATP signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ly impacts the JA signaling pathway to maximize plant defense responses.</p>

Microtubule Array Patterns Have a Common Underlying Architecture in Hypocotyl Cells
<p>Microtubules at the plant cell cortex influence cell shape by patterning the deposition of cell wall materials. The elongated cells of the hypocotyl create a variety of microtubule array patterns with differing degrees of polymer coalignment and orientation to the cell’s growth axis. To gain insight into the mechanisms driving array organization, we investigated the underlying microtubule array architecture in light-grown epidermal cells with explicit reference to array pattern. We discovered that all nontransverse patterns share a common underlying array architecture, having a core unimodal peak of coaligned microtubules in a split bipolarized arrangement. The growing microtubule plus ends extend toward the cell’s apex and base with a region of antiparallel microtubule overlap at the cell’s midzone. This core coalignment continuously shifts between ±30° from the cell’s longitudinal growth axis, forming a continuum of longitudinal and oblique arrays. Transverse arrays exhibit the same unimodal core coalignment but form local domains of microtubules polymerizing in the same <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ion rather than a split bipolarized architecture. Quantitative imaging experiments and analysis of <i>katanin</i> mutants showed that the longitudinal arrays are created from microtubules originating on the outer periclinal cell face, pointing to a cell-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ed, rather than self-organizing, mechanism for specifying the major array pattern classes in the hypocotyl cell.</p>

Unsatisfactory outcomes following unicompartmental knee arthroplasty in patients with partial thickness cartilage loss
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>While medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is indicated   for patients with full-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness cartilage loss, it is occasionally   used to treat those with partial-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness loss. The aim of this   study was to investigate the five-year outcomes in a consecutive   series of UKAs used in patients with partial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness cartilage   loss in the medial compartment of the knee.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 2002 and 2014, 94 consecutive UKAs were undertaken in   90 patients with partial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness cartilage loss and followed up   independently for a mean of six years (1 to 13). These patients   had partial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness cartilage loss either on both femur and tibia   (13 knees), or on either the femur or the tibia, with full <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness   loss on the other surface of the joint (18 and 63 knees respectively).   Using propensity score analysis, these patients were matched 1:2 based   on age, gender and pre-operative Oxford Knee Score (OKS) with knees   with full <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness loss on both the femur and tibia.

A subgroup of 36 knees   in 36 patients with partial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness cartilage loss, who had pre-operative   MRI scans, was assessed to identify whether there were any factors   identified on MRI that predicted the outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Knees with partial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness cartilage loss had significantly   worse functional outcomes at one, two and five years post-operatively   compared with those with full <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness loss. A quarter of knees   with partial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness loss had a fair or poor result and a fifth   failed to achieve a clinically significant improvement in OKS from   a baseline of four points or more; double that seen in knees with   full <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness loss. Whilst there was no difference in implant survival between   the groups, the rate of re-operation in knees with partial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness   loss was three times higher.

Genetic Architecture and Molecular Networks Underlying Leaf Thickness in Desert-Adapted Tomato <i>Solanum pennellii</i>
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>er leaves allow plants to grow in water-limited conditions. However, our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of this highly functional leaf shape trait is poor. We used a custom-built confocal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>ometer to directly measure leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness in a set of introgression lines (ILs) derived from the desert tomato <i>Solanum pennellii</i> and identified quantitative trait loci. We report evidence of a complex genetic architecture of this trait and roles for both genetic and environmental factors. Several ILs with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong> leaves have dramatically elongated palisade mesophyll cells and, in some cases, increased leaf ploidy. We characterized the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong> IL2-5 and IL4-3 in detail and found increased mesophyll cell size and leaf ploidy levels, suggesting that endoreduplication underpins leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness in tomato. Next, we queried the transcriptomes and inferred dynamic Bayesian networks of gene expression across early leaf ontogeny in these lines to compare the molecular networks that pattern leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness. We show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong> ILs share <i>S. pennellii</i>-like expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>es for putative regulators of cell shape and meristem determinacy as well as a general signature of cell cycle-related gene expression. However, our network data suggest that leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness in these two lines is patterned at least partially by distinct mechanisms. Consistent with this hypothesis, double homozygote lines combining introgression segments from these two ILs show additive phenotypes, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong> leaves, higher ploidy levels, and larger palisade mesophyll cells. Collectively, these data establish a framework of genetic, anatomical, and molecular mechanisms that pattern leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness in desert-adapted tomato.</p>

Root diameter variations explained by anatomy and phylogeny of 50 tropical and temperate tree species
<p>Root diameter, a critical indicator of root physiological function, varies greatly among tree species, but the underlying mechanism of this high variability is unclear. Here, we sampled 50 tree species across tropical and temperate zones in China, and measured root morphological and anatomical traits along the first five branch orders in each species. Our objectives were (i) to reveal the relationships between root diameter, cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness and stele diameter among tree species in tropical and temperate forests, and (ii) to investigate the relationship of both root morphological and anatomical traits with divergence time during species radiation. The results showed that root diameter was strongly affected by cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness but less by stele diameter in both tropical and temperate species. Changes in cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness explained over 90% of variation in root diameter for the first order, and ∼74–87% for the second and third orders. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>er roots displayed greater cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness and more cortical cell layers than thinner roots. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that root diameter, cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness and number of cortical cell layers significantly correlated with divergence time at the family level, showing similar variation trends in geological time. The results also suggested that trees tend to decrease their root cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness rather than stele diameter during species radiation. The close linkage of variations in root morphology and anatomy to phylogeny as demonstrated by the data from the 50 tree species should provide some insights into the mechanism of root diameter variability among tree species.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Root Tip Shape Governs Root Elongation Rate under Increased Soil Strength
<p>Increased soil strength due to soil compaction or soil drying is a major limitation to root growth and crop productivity. Roots need to exert higher penetration force, resulting in increased penetration stress when elongating in soils of greater strength. This study aimed to quantify how the genotypic diversity of root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong> geometry and root diameter influences root elongation under different levels of soil strength and to determine the extent to which roots adjust to increased soil strength. Fourteen wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) varieties were grown in soil columns packed to three bulk densities representing low, moderate, and high soil strength. Under moderate and high soil strength, smaller root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong> radius-to-length ratio was correlated with higher genotypic root elongation rate, whereas root diameter was not related to genotypic root elongation. Based on cavity expansion theory, it was found that smaller root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong> radius-to-length ratio reduced penetration stress, thus enabling higher root elongation rates in soils with greater strength. Furthermore, it was observed that roots could only partially adjust to increased soil strength. Root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ening was bounded by a maximum diameter, and root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong>s did not become more acute in response to increased soil strength. The obtained results demonstrated that root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong> geometry is a pivotal trait governing root penetration stress and root elongation rate in soils of greater strength. Hence, root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong> shape needs to be taken into account when selecting for crop varieties that may tolerate high soil strength.</p>

ANN1 and ANN2 Function in Post-Phloem Sugar Transport in Root Tips to Affect Primary Root Growth
<p>Annexins are a multigene family of calcium-dependent membrane-binding proteins that play important roles in plant cell signaling. Annexins are multifunctional proteins, and their function in plants is not comprehensively understood. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) annexins ANN1 and ANN2 are 64% identical in their primary structure, and both are highly expressed in seedlings. Here, we showed that <i>ann-mutant</i> seedlings grown in the absence of sugar show decreased primary root growth and altered columella cells in root caps; however, these mutant defects are rescued by Suc, Glc, or Fru. In seedlings grown without sugar, significant up-regulation of photosynthetic gene expression and chlorophyll accumulation was found in <i>ann-mutant</i> cotyledons compared to that in wild type, which indicates potential sugar starvation in the roots of <i>ann-mutant</i> seedlings. Unexpectedly, the overall sugar content of <i>ann-mutant</i> primary roots was significantly higher than that of wild-type roots when grown without sugar. To examine the diffusion of sugar along the entire root to the root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong>, we examined the unloading pattern of carboxyfluorescein dye and found that post-phloem sugar transport was impaired in <i>ann-mutant</i> root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong>s compared to that in wild type. Increased levels of ROS and callose were detected in the root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong>s of <i>ann-mutant</i> seedlings grown without Suc, the latter of which would restrict plasmodesmal sugar transport to root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong>s. Our results indicate that ANN1 and ANN2 play an important role in post-phloem sugar transport to the root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong>, which in turn indirectly influences photosynthetic rates in cotyledons. This study expands our understanding of the function of annexins in plants.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
F-Actin Mediated Focusing of Vesicles at the Cell Tip Is Essential for Polarized Growth
<p>F-actin has been shown to be essential for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong> growth in an array of plant models, including <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. One hypothesis is that diffusion can transport secretory vesicles, while actin plays a regulatory role during secretion. Alternatively, it is possible that actin-based transport is necessary to overcome vesicle transport limitations to sustain secretion. Therefore, a quantitative analysis of diffusion, secretion kinetics, and cell geometry is necessary to clarify the role of actin in polarized growth. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis, we first show that secretory vesicles move toward and accumulate at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong> in an actin-dependent manner. We then depolymerized F-actin to decouple vesicle diffusion from actin-mediated transport and measured the diffusion coefficient and concentration of vesicles. Using these values, we constructed a theoretical diffusion-based model for growth, demonstrating that with fast-enough vesicle fusion kinetics, diffusion could support normal cell growth rates. We further refined our model to explore how experimentally extrapolated vesicle fusion kinetics and the size of the secretion zone limit diffusion-based growth. This model predicts that diffusion-mediated growth is dependent on the size of the region of exocytosis at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong> and that diffusion-based growth would be significantly slower than normal cell growth. To further explore the size of the secretion zone, we used a cell wall degradation enzyme cocktail and determined that the secretion zone is smaller than 6 μm in diameter at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong>. Taken together, our results highlight the requirement for active transport in polarized growth and provide important insight into vesicle secretion during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong> growth.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
The Microtubule-Associated Protein MAP18 Affects ROP2 GTPase Activity during Root Hair Growth
<p>Establishment and maintenance of the polar site are important for root hair <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong> growth. We previously reported that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN18 (MAP18) functions in controlling the direction of pollen tube growth and root hair elongation. Additionally, the Rop GTPase ROP2 was reported as a positive regulator of both root hair initiation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong> growth in Arabidopsis. Both loss of function of <i>ROP2</i> and knockdown of <i>MAP18</i> lead to a decrease in root hair length, whereas overexpression of either <i>MAP18</i> or <i>ROP2</i> causes mul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong>le <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong>s or a branching hair phenotype. However, it is unclear whether MAP18 and ROP2 coordinately regulate root hair growth. In this study, we demonstrate that MAP18 and ROP2 interact genetically and functionally. MAP18 interacts physically with ROP2 in vitro and in vivo and preferentially binds to the inactive form of the ROP2 protein. MAP18 promotes ROP2 activity during root hair <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong> growth. Further investigation revealed that MAP18 competes with RhoGTPase GDP DISSOCIATION INHIBITOR1/SUPERCEN<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong>EDE1 for binding to ROP2, in turn affecting the localization of active ROP2 in the plasma membrane of the root hair <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong>. These results reveal a novel function of MAP18 in the regulation of ROP2 activation during root hair growth.</p>

Limited acclimation in leaf anatomy to experimental drought in tropical rainforest trees
<p>Dry periods are predicted to become more frequent and severe in the future in some parts of the tropics, including Amazonia, potentially causing reduced productivity, higher tree mortality and increased emissions of stored carbon. Using a long-term (12 year) through-fall exclusion (TFE) experiment in the tropics, we test the hypothesis that trees produce leaves adapted to cope with higher levels of water stress, by examining the following leaf characteristics: area, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness, leaf mass per area, vein density, stomatal density, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness of palisade mesophyll, spongy mesophyll and both of the epidermal layers, internal cavity volume and the average cell sizes of the palisade and spongy mesophyll. We also test whether differences in leaf anatomy are consistent with observed differential drought-induced mortality responses among taxa, and look for relationships between leaf anatomy, and leaf water relations and gas exchange parameters. Our data show that trees do not produce leaves that are more xeromorphic in response to 12 years of soil moisture deficit. However, the drought treatment did result in increases in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness of the adaxial epidermis (TFE: 20.5 ± 1.5 µm, control: 16.7 ± 1.0 µm) and the internal cavity volume (TFE: 2.43 ± 0.50 mm<sup>3</sup> cm<sup>−2</sup>, control: 1.77 ± 0.30 mm<sup>3 </sup>cm<sup>−2</sup>). No consistent differences were detected between drought-resistant and drought-sensitive taxa, although interactions occurred between drought-sensitivity status and drought treatment for the palisade mesophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness (<i>P</i> = 0.034) and the cavity volume of the leaves (<i>P</i> = 0.025). The limited response to water deficit probably reflects a tight co-ordination between leaf morphology, water relations and photosynthetic properties. This suggests that there is little plasticity in these aspects of plant anatomy in these taxa, and that phenotypic plasticity in leaf traits may not facilitate the acclimation of Amazonian trees to the predicted future reductions in dry season water availability.</p>

Regulating the femtosecond excited-state lifetime of a single molecule
<p>The key to controlling reactions of molecules induced with the current of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong> is the ultrashort intermediate excited ionic state. The initial condition of the excited state is set by the energy and position of the injected current; thereafter, its dynamics determines the reaction outcome. We show that a STM can directly and controllably influence the excited-state dynamics. For the STM-induced desorption of toluene molecules from the Si(111)-7x7 surface, as the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong> approaches the molecule, the probability of manipulation drops by two orders of magnitude. A two-channel quenching of the excited state is proposed, consisting of an invariant surface channel and a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong> height–dependent channel. We conclude that picometer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong> proximity regulates the lifetime of the excited state from 10 femtoseconds to less than 0.1 femtoseconds.</p>

We integrated these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>es with whole-animal chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data to deconvolve the cell type–specific effects of transcription factors. The data generated by sci-RNA-seq constitute a powerful resource for nematode biology and foreshadow similar atlases for other organisms.</p>

Auxin Efflux Carrier ZmPGP1 Mediates Root Growth Inhibition under Aluminum Stress
<p>Auxin has been shown to enhance root growth inhibition under aluminum (Al) stress in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). However, in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), auxin may play a negative role in the Al-induced inhibition of root growth. In this study, we identified mutants deficient in the maize auxin efflux carrier P-glycoprotein (ZmPGP1) after ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis and used them to elucidate the contribution of ZmPGP1 to Al-induced root growth inhibition. Root growth in the <i>zmpgp1</i> mutant, which forms shortened roots and is hyposensitive to auxin, was less inhibited by Al stress than that in the inbred line B73. In the <i>zmpgp1</i> mutants, the root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong>s displayed higher auxin accumulation and enhanced auxin signaling under Al stress, which was also consistent with the increased expression of auxin-responsive genes. Based on the behavior of the auxin-responsive marker transgene, <i>DR5rev:RFP</i>, we concluded that Al stress reduced the level of auxin in the root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong>, which contrasts with the tendency of Al stress-induced Arabidopsis plants to accumulate more auxin in their root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong>s. In addition, Al stress induced the expression of <i>ZmPGP1</i>. Therefore, in maize, Al stress is associated with reduced auxin accumulation in root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong>s, a process that is regulated by ZmPGP1 and thus causes inhibition of root growth. This study provides further evidence about the role of auxin and auxin polar transport in Al-induced root growth regulation in maize.</p>

Rice Morphology Determinant-Mediated Actin Filament Organization Contributes to Pollen Tube Growth
<p>For successful fertilization in angiosperms, rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong> growth in pollen tubes delivers the male gamete into the ovules. The actin-binding protein-mediated organization of the actin cytoskeleton within the pollen tube plays a crucial role in this polarized process. However, the mechanism underlying the polarity of the actin filament (F-actin) array and behaviors in pollen tube growth remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that an actin-organizing protein, Rice Morphology Determinant (RMD), a type II formin from rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), controls pollen tube growth by modulating the polarity and distribution of the F-actin array. The rice <i>rmd</i> mutant exhibits abnormal pollen tube growth and a decreased germination rate of the pollen grain in vitro and in vivo. The <i>rmd</i> pollen tubes display a disorganized F-actin pattern with disrupted apical actin density and shank longitudinal cable direction/arrangement, indicating the novel role of RMD in F-actin polarity during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong> growth. Consistent with this role, RMD localizes at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong> of the rice pollen tube, which is essential for pollen tube growth and polarity as well as F-actin organization. Furthermore, the direction and characteristics of the RMD-guided F-actin array positively regulate the deposition of cell wall components and the pattern and velocity of cytoplasmic streaming during rice pollen tube growth. Collectively, our results suggest that RMD is essential for the spatial regulation of pollen tube growth via modulating F-actin organization and array orientation in rice. This work provides insights into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong>-focused cell growth and polarity.</p>

EXO70C2 Is a Key Regulatory Factor for Optimal Tip Growth of Pollen
<p>The exocyst, a eukaryotic tethering complex, coregulates targeted exocytosis as an effector of small GTPases in polarized cell growth. In land plants, several exocyst subunits are encoded by double or triple paralogs, culminating in tens of EXO70 paralogs. Out of 23 <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> EXO70 isoforms, we analyzed seven isoforms expressed in pollen. Genetic and microscopic analyses of single mutants in <i>EXO70A2</i>, <i>EXO70C1</i>, <i>EXO70C2</i>, <i>EXO70F1</i>, <i>EXO70H3</i>, <i>EXO70H5</i>, and <i>EXO70H6</i> genes revealed that only a loss-of-function <i>EXO70C2</i> allele resulted in a significant male-specific transmission defect (segregation 40%:51%:9%) due to aberrant pollen tube growth. Mutant pollen tubes grown in vitro exhibited an enhanced growth rate and a decreased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong> cell wall, causing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong> bursts. However, <i>exo70C2</i> pollen tubes could frequently recover and restart their speedy elongation, resulting in a repetitive stop-and-go growth dynamics. A pollen-specific depletion of the closest paralog, <i>EXO70C1</i>, using artificial microRNA in the <i>exo70C2</i> mutant background, resulted in a complete pollen-specific transmission defect, suggesting redundant functions of EXO70C1 and EXO70C2. Both EXO70C1 and EXO70C2, GFP tagged and expressed under the control of their native promoters, localized in the cytoplasm of pollen grains, pollen tubes, and also root trichoblast cells. The expression of EXO70C2-GFP complemented the aberrant growth of <i>exo70C2</i> pollen tubes. The absent EXO70C2 interactions with core exocyst subunits in the yeast two-hybrid assay, cytoplasmic localization, and genetic effect suggest an unconventional EXO70 function possibly as a regulator of exocytosis outside the exocyst complex. In conclusion, EXO70C2 is a novel factor contributing to the regulation of optimal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong> growth of Arabidopsis pollen tubes.</p>

Cold acclimation alters the connective tissue content of the zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) heart
<p>Thermal acclimation can alter cardiac function and morphology in a number of fish species, but little is known about the regulation of these changes. The purpose of the present study was to determine how cold acclimation affects zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) cardiac morphology, collagen composition and connective tissue regulation. Heart volume, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness of the compact myocardium, collagen content and collagen fiber composition were compared between control (27°C) and cold-acclimated (20°C) zebrafish using serially sectioned hearts stained with Picrosirius Red. Collagen content and fiber composition of the pericardial membrane were also examined. Cold acclimation did not affect the volume of the contracted heart; however, there was a significant decrease in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness of the compact myocardium. There was also a decrease in the collagen content of the compact myocardium and in the amount of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong> collagen fibers throughout the heart. Cold-acclimated zebrafish also increased expression of the gene transcript for matrix metalloproteinase 2, matrix metalloproteinase 9, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 and collagen Type I α1. We propose that the reduction in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness of the compact myocardium as well as the change in collagen content may help to maintain the compliance of the ventricle as temperatures decrease. Together, these results clearly demonstrate that the zebrafish heart undergoes significant remodeling in response to cold acclimation.</p>

In lung specimens from autopsy (control, HF-PH, and 7 PVOD) or surgery (10 PVOD), quantitative histomorphometry was performed in all analyzable arteries (n=4949), veins (n=7630), and small indeterminate vessels (IV; n=2168) to define percent medial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness (arteries) and percent intimal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness (%IT) (arteries, veins, and IV) relative to external diameter.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The average arterial percent medial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness (control, 6.9; HF-PH, 11.0; PVOD, 15.0), arterial %IT (control, 4.9; HF-PH, 14.9; PVOD, 31.1), venous %IT (control, 14.0; HF-PH, 24.9; PVOD, 43.9), and IV %IT (control, 10.6; HF-PH, 25.8; PVOD, 50.0) in HF-PH were higher than controls (<i>P</i><0.0001 for all) but lower than PVOD (<i>P</i>≤0.005 for all). PASP (mm Hg) was lower in HF-PH (median, 59 [interquartile range, 50–70]) than in PVOD (median, 91 [interquartile range, 82–103]). PASP correlated with arterial percent medial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness (<i>r</i>=0.41) and arterial %IT (<i>r</i>=0.35) but more strongly with venous %IT (<i>r</i>=0.49) and IV %IT (<i>r</i>=0.55) (<i>P</i><0.0001 for all). Associations between PASP and venous or IV %IT remained significant after adjusting for arterial percent medial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness and %IT and did not vary by HF type. In patients with right heart catheterization (30 HF-PH, 14 PVOD), similar associations between the transpulmonary gradient and pulmonary vascular remodeling existed, with numerically stronger associations for venous and IV %IT. Although the PASP was slightly higher in patients with HF-PH with right ventricular dysfunction, pulmonary vascular remodeling was not more severe. Pulmonary vascular remodeling severity was associated with reductions in the diffusing capacity of the lungs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In HF, PH is associated with global pulmonary vascular remodeling, but the severity of PH correlates most strongly with venous and small IV intimal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ening, similar to the pattern observed in PVOD. These findings expand our understanding of the pathobiology of PH in HF.</p></sec>

Left Ventricular Structure and Function in Transthyretin-Related Versus Light-Chain Cardiac Amyloidosis
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Immunoglobulin amyloid light-chain (AL)-related cardiac amyloidosis (CA) has a worse prognosis than either wild-type (ATTRwt) or mutant (ATTRm) transthyretin (TTR) CA. Detailed echocardiographic studies have been performed in AL amyloidosis but not in TTR amyloidosis and might give insight into this difference. We assessed cardiac structure and function and outcome in a large population of patients with CA and compared findings in TTR and AL-related disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We analyzed 172 patients with CA (AL amyloidosis, n=80; ATTRm, n=36; ATTRwt, n=56) by standard echocardiography and 2-dimensional speckle-tracking imaging-derived left ventricular (LV) longitudinal (LS), radial, and circumferential strains. Despite a preserved LV ejection fraction (55±12%), LS was severely impaired in CA. Standard measures of LV function and speckle-tracking imaging worsened as wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness increased, whereas apical LS was preserved regardless of the pathogenesis of CA and the degree of wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ening. Compared with ATTRm and AL amyloidosis, ATTRwt was characterized by greater LV wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness and lower ejection fraction. LS was more depressed in both ATTRwt and AL amyloidosis (−11±3% and −12±4%, respectively, <i>P</i>=0.54) than in ATTRm (−15±4%, <i>P</i><0.01 versus AL amyloidosis and ATTRwt). TTR-related causes were favorable predictors of survival, whereas LS and advanced New York Heart Association class were negative predictors.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>In patients with CA, worsening LV function correlated with increasing wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness regardless of pathogenesis. Patients with ATTRwt had a statistically greater wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness but lesser mortality than those with AL amyloidosis, despite very similar degrees of LS impairment. This paradox suggests an additional mechanism for LV dysfunction in AL amyloidosis, such as previously demonstrated light-chain toxicity.</p></sec>

Joint profiling of chromatin accessibility and gene expression in thousands of single cells
<p>Although we can increasingly measure transcription, chromatin, methylation, and other aspects of molecular biology at single-cell resolution, most assays survey only one aspect of cellular biology. Here we describe sci-CAR, a combinatorial indexing–based coassay that jointly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>es chromatin accessibility and mRNA (CAR) in each of thousands of single cells. As a proof of concept, we apply sci-CAR to 4825 cells, including a time series of dexamethasone treatment, as well as to 11,296 cells from the adult mouse kidney. With the resulting data, we compare the pseudotemporal dynamics of chromatin accessibility and gene expression, reconstruct the chromatin accessibility <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>es of cell types defined by RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>es, and link cis-regulatory sites to their target genes on the basis of the covariance of chromatin accessibility and transcription across large numbers of single cells.</p>

Self-assembly of lattices with high structural complexity from a geometrically simple molecule
<p>Here we report an anomalous porous molecular crystal built of C–H···N-bonded double-layered roof-floor components and wall components of a segregatively interdigitated architecture. This complicated porous structure consists of only one type of fully aromatic multijoint molecule carrying three identical dipyridylphenyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wedg</span></strong>es. Despite its high symmetry, this molecule accomplishes difficult tasks by using two of its three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wedg</span></strong>es for roof-floor formation and using its other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wedg</span></strong>e for wall formation. Although a C–H···N bond is extremely labile, the porous crystal maintains its porosity until thermal breakdown of the C–H···N bonds at 202°C occurs, affording a nonporous polymorph. Though this nonporous crystal survives even at 325°C, it can retrieve the parent porosity under acetonitrile vapor. These findings show how one can translate simplicity into ultrahigh complexity.</p>

3D printed polyamide membranes for desalination
<p>Polyamide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness and roughness have been identified as critical properties that affect thin-film composite membrane performance for reverse osmosis. Conventional formation methodologies lack the ability to control these properties independently with high resolution or precision. An additive approach is presented that uses electrospraying to deposit monomers directly onto a substrate, where they react to form polyamide. The small droplet size coupled with low monomer concentrations result in polyamide films that are smoother and thinner than conventional polyamides, while the additive nature of the approach allows for control of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness and roughness. Polyamide films are formed with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness that is controllable down to 4-nanometer increments and a roughness as low as 2 nanometers while still exhibiting good permselectivity relative to a commercial benchmarking membrane.</p>

Electrofluorochromism at the single-molecule level
<p>The interplay between the oxidation state and the optical properties of molecules is important for applications in displays, sensors, and molecular-based memories. The fundamental mechanisms occurring at the level of a single molecule have been difficult to probe. We used a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to characterize and control the fluorescence of a single zinc-phthalocyanine radical cation adsorbed on a sodium chloride–covered gold (111) sample. The neutral and oxidized states of the molecule were identified on the basis of their fluorescence spectra, which revealed very different emission energies and vibronic fingerprints. The emission of the charged molecule was controlled by tuning the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness of the insulator and the plasmons localized at the apex of the STM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong>. In addition, subnanometric variations of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong> position were used to investigate the charging and electroluminescence mechanisms.</p>

A unified continental thickness from seismology and diamonds suggests a melt-defined plate
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>, rigid continents move over the weaker underlying mantle, although geophysical and geochemical constraints on the exact <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness and defining mechanism of the continental plates are widely discrepant. Xenoliths suggest a chemical continental lithosphere ~175 kilometers <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>, whereas seismic tomography supports a much <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>er root (>250 kilometers) and a gradual lithosphere-asthenosphere transition, consistent with a thermal definition. We modeled <i>SS</i> precursor waveforms from continental interiors and found a 7 to 9% velocity drop at depths of 130 to 190 kilometers. The discontinuity depth is well correlated with the origin depths of diamond-bearing xenoliths and corresponds to the transition from coarse to deformed xenoliths. At this depth, the xenolith-derived geotherm also intersects the carbonate-silicate solidus, suggesting that partial melt defines the plate boundaries beneath the continental interior.</p>

Decoupling genetics, lineages, and microenvironment in IDH-mutant gliomas by single-cell RNA-seq
<p>Tumor subclasses differ according to the genotypes and phenotypes of malignant cells as well as the composition of the tumor microenvironment (TME). We dissected these influences in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)–mutant gliomas by combining 14,226 single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>es from 16 patient samples with bulk RNA-seq <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>es from 165 patient samples. Differences in bulk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>es between IDH-mutant astrocytoma and oligodendroglioma can be primarily explained by distinct TME and signature genetic events, whereas both tumor types share similar developmental hierarchies and lineages of glial differentiation. As tumor grade increases, we find enhanced proliferation of malignant cells, larger pools of undifferentiated glioma cells, and an increase in macrophage over microglia expression programs in TME. Our work provides a unifying model for IDH-mutant gliomas and a general framework for dissecting the differences among human tumor subclasses.</p>

A Multilevel Study of Melon Fruit Reticulation Provides Insight into Skin Ligno-Suberization Hallmarks
<p>The skin of fleshy fruit is typically covered by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong> cuticle. Some fruit species develop different forms of layers directly above their skin. Reticulation, for example, is a specialized suberin-based coating that ornaments some commercially important melon (<i>Cucumis melo</i>) fruit and is an important quality trait. Despite its importance, the structural, molecular, and biochemical features associated with reticulation are not fully understood. Here, we performed a multilevel investigation of structural attributes, chemical composition, and gene expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>es on a set of reticulated and smooth skin melons. High-resolution microscopy, surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>ing, and histochemical staining assays show that reticulation comprises cells with heavily suberized walls accumulating large amounts of typical suberin monomers, as well as lignified cells localized underneath the specialized suberized cell layer. Reticulated skin was characterized by induced expression of biosynthetic genes acting in the core phenylpropanoid, suberin, lignin, and lignan pathways. Transcripts of genes associated with lipid polymer assembly, cell wall organization, and loosening were highly enriched in reticulated skin tissue. These signatures were exclusive to reticulated structures and absent in both the smooth surfaces observed in between reticulated regions and in the skin of smooth fruit. Our data provide important insights into the molecular and metabolic bases of reticulation and its tight association with skin ligno-suberization during melon fruit development. Moreover, these insights are likely to contribute to melon breeding programs aimed at improving postharvest qualities associated with fleshy fruit surface layers.</p>

Initial Bud Outgrowth Occurs Independent of Auxin Flow from Out of Buds
<p>Apical dominance is the process whereby the shoot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong> inhibits the growth of axillary buds along the stem. It has been proposed that the shoot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong>, which is the predominant source of the plant hormone auxin, prevents bud outgrowth by suppressing auxin canalization and export from axillary buds into the main stem. In this theory, auxin flow out of axillary buds is a prerequisite for bud outgrowth, and buds are triggered to grow by an enhanced proportional flow of auxin from the buds. A major challenge of directly testing this model is in being able to create a bud- or stem-specific change in auxin transport. Here we evaluate the relationship between specific changes in auxin efflux from axillary buds and bud outgrowth after shoot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong> removal (decapitation) in the pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>). The auxin transport inhibitor 1-<i>N</i>-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) and to a lesser extent, the auxin perception inhibitor <i>p</i>-chlorophenoxyisobutyric acid (PCIB), effectively blocked auxin efflux from axillary buds of intact and decapitated plants without affecting auxin flow in the main stem. Gene expression analyses indicate that NPA and PCIB regulate auxin-inducible, and biosynthesis and transport genes, in axillary buds within 3 h after application. These inhibitors had no effect on initial bud outgrowth after decapitation or cytokinin (benzyladenine; BA) treatment. Inhibitory effects of PCIB and NPA on axillary bud outgrowth only became apparent from 48 h after treatment. These findings demonstrate that the initiation of decapitation- and cytokinin-induced axillary bud outgrowth is independent of auxin canalization and export from the bud.</p>

Trehalose 6-Phosphate Regulates Photosynthesis and Assimilate Partitioning in Reproductive Tissue<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Transgenic maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) that expresses rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) <i>TREHALOSE PHOSPHATE PHOSPHATASE1</i> (<i>TPP1</i>) from the rice <i>MADS6</i> promoter, which is active over the flowering period, produces higher yields than wild type. This yield increase occurs with or without drought conditions during flowering. To understand the mechanistic basis of the increased yield, we characterized gene expression and metabolite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>es in leaves and developing female reproductive tissue, comprising florets, node, pith, and shank, over the flowering period with and without drought. The <i>MADS6</i> promoter was most active in the vasculature, particularly phloem companion cells in florets and pith, consistent with the largest decreases in trehalose 6-phosphate (T6P) levels (2- to 3-fold) being found in pith and florets. Low T6P led to decreased gene expression for primary metabolism and increased gene expression for secondary metabolism, particularly lipid-related pathways. Despite similar changes in gene expression, the pith and floret displayed opposing assimilate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>es: sugars, sugar phosphates, amino acids, and lipids increased in florets, but decreased in pith. Possibly explaining this assimilate distribution, seven <i>SWEET</i> genes were found to be up-regulated in the transgenic plants. SnRK1 activity and the expression of the gene for the SnRK1 beta subunit, expression of SnRK1 marker genes, and endogenous trehalose pathway genes were also altered. Furthermore, leaves of the transgenic maize maintained a higher photosynthetic rate for a longer period compared to wild type. In conclusion, we found that decreasing T6P in reproductive tissues down-regulates primary metabolism and up-regulates secondary metabolism, resulting in different metabolite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>es in component tissues. Our data implicate T6P/ SnRK1 as a major regulator of whole-plant resource allocation for crop yield improvement.</p>

Light Sheet Microscopy Imaging of Light Absorption and Photosynthesis Distribution in Plant Tissue
<p>In vivo variable chlorophyll fluorescence measurements of photosystem II (PSII) quantum yields in optically dense systems are complicated by steep tissue light gradients due to scattering and absorption. Consequently, externally measured effective PSII quantum yields may be composed of signals derived from cells differentially exposed to actinic light, where cells located deeper inside tissues receive lower irradiance than cells closer to the surface and can display distinct photophysiological status. We demonstrate how measured distributions of PSII quantum yields in plant tissue change under natural tissue light gradients as compared with conventionally measured quantum yields with even exposure to actinic light. This was achieved by applying actinic irradiance perpendicular to one side of thallus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross sect</span></strong>ions of the aquatic macrophyte <i>Fucus vesiculosus</i> with laser light sheets of defined spectral composition, while imaging variable chlorophyll fluorescence from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross sect</span></strong>ions with a microscope-mounted pulse amplitude-modulated imaging system. We show that quantum yields are highly affected by light gradients and that traditional surface-based variable chlorophyll fluorescence measurements result in substantial underestimations and/or overestimations, depending on incident actinic irradiance. We present a method for using chlorophyll fluorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>es in combination with integrating sphere measurements of reflectance and transmittance to calculate depth-resolved photon absorption <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>es, which can be used to correct apparent PSII electron transport rates to photons absorbed by PSII. Absorption <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>es of the investigated aquatic macrophyte were different in shape from what is typically observed in terrestrial leaves, and based on this finding, we discuss strategies for optimizing photon absorption via modulation of the structural organization of phytoelements according to in situ light environments.</p>

Mitochondrial ABC Transporter ATM3 Is Essential for Cytosolic Iron-Sulfur Cluster Assembly
<p>The mitochondrial ATP-binding cassette transporter ATM3 has been studied in Arabidopsis. Its function, however, is poorly understood in other model plant species. This study reports that the ATM3 is required for cytosolic iron-sulfur cluster assembly and is essential for meristem maintenance in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). The loss of function of <i>OsATM3</i> is lethal in rice at the four-leaf stage. In the <i>osatm3</i> T-DNA insertion mutant, the fourth leaf fails to develop and the lateral roots are short. Cytosolic iron-sulfur protein activities were significantly reduced in both <i>osatm3</i> and RNA interference transgenic lines. The expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>es of many iron metabolism genes were altered in the <i>osatm3</i> and RNA interference lines. Glutathione metabolism was impaired and reactive oxygen species, particularly superoxide, accumulated in <i>osatm3</i>. Promoter-β-glucuronidase staining of the transgenic line indicated that <i>OsATM3</i> is highly expressed in lateral root primordia, root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong> meristem zones, and shoot apical meristem regions. The average cell size was significantly greater in <i>osatm3</i> than in the wild type. Massive cell death occurred in the <i>osatm3</i> root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong> meristem zone. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed transcriptional reprogramming of the genes in the <i>osatm3</i> and RNAi lines involved in DNA repair and cell cycle arrest. Our results suggest that the mitochondrial ATM3 is essential for iron homeostasis in rice.</p>

Deep-diving sea lions exhibit extreme bradycardia in long-duration dives
<p>Heart rate and peripheral blood flow distribution are the primary determinants of the rate and pattern of oxygen store utilisation and ultimately breath-hold duration in marine endotherms. Despite this, little is known about how otariids (sea lions and fur seals) regulate heart rate (<i>f</i><sub>H</sub>) while diving. We investigated dive <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> in five adult female California sea lions (<i>Zalophus californianus</i>) during foraging trips by instrumenting them with digital electrocardiogram (ECG) loggers and time depth recorders. In all dives, dive <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> (number of beats/duration; 50±9 beats min<sup>−1</sup>) decreased compared with surface rates (113±5 beats min<sup>−1</sup>), with all dives exhibiting an instantaneous <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> below resting (<54 beats min<sup>−1</sup>) at some point during the dive. Both dive <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> and minimum instantaneous <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> significantly decreased with increasing dive duration. Typical instantaneous <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>es of deep dives (>100 m) consisted of: (1) an initial rapid decline in <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> resulting in the lowest instantaneous <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> of the dive at the end of descent, often below 10 beats min<sup>−1</sup> in dives longer than 6 min in duration; (2) a slight increase in <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> to ~10–40 beats min<sup>−1</sup> during the bottom portion of the dive; and (3) a gradual increase in <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> during ascent with a rapid increase prior to surfacing. Thus, <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> regulation in deep-diving sea lions is not simply a progressive bradycardia. Extreme bradycardia and the presumed associated reductions in pulmonary and peripheral blood flow during late descent of deep dives should (a) contribute to preservation of the lung oxygen store, (b) increase dependence of muscle on the myoglobin-bound oxygen store, (c) conserve the blood oxygen store and (d) help limit the absorption of nitrogen at depth. This <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>e during deep dives of sea lions may be characteristic of deep-diving marine endotherms that dive on inspiration as similar <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>es have been recently documented in the emperor penguin, another deep diver that dives on inspiration.</p>

Biomechanics of substrate boring by fig wasps
<p>Female insects of diverse orders bore into substrates to deposit their eggs. Such insects must overcome several biomechanical challenges to successfully oviposit, which include the selection of suitable substrates through which the ovipositor can penetrate without itself fracturing. In many cases, the insect may also need to steer and manipulate the ovipositor within the substrate to deliver eggs at desired locations before rapidly retracting her ovipositor to avoid predation. In the case of female parasitoid ichneumonid wasps, this process is repeated mul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong>le times during her lifetime, thus testing the ability of the ovipositioning apparatus to endure fracture and fatigue. What specific adaptations does the ovipositioning apparatus of a female ichneumonoid wasp possess to withstand these challenges? We addressed this question using a model system composed of parasitoid and pollinator fig wasps. First, we show that parasitoid ovipositor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong>s have teeth-like structures, preferentially enriched with zinc, unlike the smooth morphology of pollinator ovipositors. We describe sensillae present on the parasitoid ovipositor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong> that are likely to aid in the detection of chemical species and mechanical deformations and sample microenvironments within the substrate. Second, using atomic force microscopy, we show that parasitoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong> regions have a higher modulus compared with regions proximal to the abdomen in parasitoid and pollinator ovipositors. Finally, we use videography to film wasps during substrate boring and analyse buckling of the ovipositor to estimate the forces required for substrate boring. Together, these results allow us to describe the biomechanical principles underlying substrate boring in parasitoid ichneumonid wasps. Such studies may be useful for the biomimetic design of surgical tools and in the use of novel mechanisms to bore through hard substrates.</p>

MicroRNA-Based Therapy of GATA2-Deficient Vascular Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The transcription factor GATA2 orchestrates the expression of many endothelial-specific genes, illustrating its crucial importance for endothelial cell function. The capacity of this transcription factor in orchestrating endothelial-important microRNAs (miRNAs/miR) is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Endothelial GATA2 was functionally analyzed in human endothelial cells in vitro. Endogenous short interfering RNA–mediated knockdown and lentiviral-based overexpression were applied to decipher the capacity of GATA2 in regulating cell viability and capillary formation. Next, the GATA2-dependent miR transcriptome was identified by using a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>ing approach on the basis of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Transcriptional control of miR promoters was assessed via chromatin immunoprecipitation, luciferase promoter assays, and bisulfite sequencing analysis of sites in proximity. Selected miRs were modulated in combination with GATA2 to identify signaling pathways at the angiogenic cytokine level via proteome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>er and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Downstream miR targets were identified via bioinformatic target prediction and luciferase reporter gene assays. In vitro findings were translated to a mouse model of carotid injury in an endothelial <i>GATA2</i> knockout background. Nanoparticle-mediated delivery of proangiogenic miR-126 was tested in the reendothelialization model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>GATA2 gain- and loss-of-function experiments in human umbilical vein endothelial cells identified a key role of GATA2 as master regulator of mul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong>le endothelial functions via miRNA-dependent mechanisms. Global miRNAnome-screening identified several GATA2-regulated miRNAs including miR-126 and miR-221. Specifically, proangiogenic miR-126 was regulated by GATA2 transcriptionally and targeted antiangiogenic SPRED1 and FOXO3a contributing to GATA2-mediated formation of normal vascular structures, whereas GATA2 deficiency led to vascular abnormalities. In contrast to GATA2 deficiency, supplementation with miR-126 normalized vascular function and expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>es of cytokines contributing to proangiogenic paracrine effects. GATA2 silencing resulted in endothelial DNA hypomethylation leading to induced expression of antiangiogenic miR-221 by GATA2-dependent demethylation of a putative CpG island in the miR-221 promoter. Mechanistically, a reverted GATA2 phenotype by endogenous suppression of miR-221 was mediated through direct proangiogenic miR-221 target genes ICAM1 and ETS1. In a mouse model of carotid injury, GATA2 was reduced, and systemic supplementation of miR-126–coupled nanoparticles enhanced miR-126 availability in the carotid artery and improved reendothelialization of injured carotid arteries in vivo.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>GATA2-mediated regulation of miR-126 and miR-221 has an important impact on endothelial biology.

One hundred thirty-five lipid species from 8 different lipid classes were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>ed by shotgun lipidomics with the use of a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer. Levels of individual species of cholesterol esters (CEs), lysophosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs), sphingomyelins, and triacylglycerols (TAGs) were associated with cardiovascular disease over a 10-year observation period (2000–2010, 90 incident events).

Plasticity in the Neurotransmitter Repertoire
<p>In the earliest days of neuroscience, it was thought that a neuron made and released only a single chemical, known as a neurotransmitter, to send a signal across a synapse to an adjacent neuron (<i>1</i>). At the same time, it was deeply mysterious why so many signaling molecules were used in nervous systems. Subsequently, it became clear that many, if not most, neurons (including those in mammals) make and release two or more neurotransmitters including small-molecules and neuropeptides (<i>2</i>–<i>4</i>). As the list of these potential cotransmitters and their receptors has increased, we are faced with understanding the functional relevance of this embarrassment of riches for neural circuits and behavior. Neurotransmitters and neuromodulators (substances often released with small-molecule neurotransmitters) can elicit a variety of different actions on their neuron targets, including directly opening ion channels or acting through signal transduction pathways to alter neuronal excitability or synaptic transmission. Thus, characterizing the mixture of cotransmitters released by a neuron is important for understanding how neuronal circuits operate. The mechanisms that change the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>e of neurotransmitter release provide opportunities for plastic changes in circuit function, and consequently in organism behavior. On page 449 of this issue, Dulcis <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) report changes in the neurotransmitter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>e of neurons that underlie photoperiod-triggered changes in animal behavior. The findings argue that neurotransmitter switching is a new mechanism for neuroplasticity (<i>6</i>) in adult nervous systems.</p>

A Transcription Factor, OsMADS57, Regulates Long-Distance Nitrate Transport and Root Elongation
<p>Root nitrate uptake adjusts to the plant’s nitrogen demand for growth. Here, we report that OsMADS57, a MADS-box transcription factor, modulates nitrate translocation from rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) roots to shoots under low-nitrate conditions. <i>OsMADS57</i> is abundantly expressed in xylem parenchyma cells of root stele and is induced by nitrate. Compared with wild-type rice plants supplied with 0.2 mM nitrate, <i>osmads57</i> mutants had 31% less xylem loading of nitrate, while overexpression lines had 2-fold higher levels. Shoot-root <sup>15</sup>N content ratios were 40% lower in the mutants and 76% higher in the overexpression lines. Rapid NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> root influx experiments showed that mutation of <i>OsMADS57</i> did not affect root nitrate uptake. Reverse transcription quantitative PCR analysis of <i>OsNRT2</i> nitrate transporter genes showed that after 5 min in 0.2 mM nitrate, only <i>OsNRT2.3a</i> (a vascular-specific high-affinity nitrate transporter) had reduced (by two-thirds) expression levels. At 60 min of nitrate treatment, lower expression levels were also observed for three additional <i>NRT2</i> genes (<i>OsNRT2.1/2.2/2.4</i>). Conversely, in the overexpression lines, four <i>NRT2</i> genes had much higher expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>es at all time points tested. As previously reported, <i>OsNRT2.3a</i> functions in nitrate translocation, indicating the possible interaction between <i>OsMADS57</i> and <i>OsNRT2.3a</i>. Yeast one-hybrid and transient expression assays demonstrated that OsMADS57 binds to the CArG motif (CATTTTATAG) within the <i>OsNRT2.3a</i> promoter. Moreover, seminal root elongation was inhibited in <i>osmads57</i> mutants, which may be associated with higher auxin levels in and auxin polar transport to root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong>s of mutant plants. Taken together, these results suggest that OsMADS57 has a role in regulating nitrate translocation from root to shoot via OsNRT2.3a.</p>

Timing and Order of the Molecular Events Marking the Onset of Berry Ripening in Grapevine
<p>Grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) is a model for the investigation of physiological and biochemical changes during the formation and ripening of nonclimacteric fleshy fruits. However, the order and complexity of the molecular events during fruit development remain poorly understood. To identify the key molecular events controlling berry formation and ripening, we created a highly detailed transcriptomic and metabolomic map of berry development, based on samples collected every week from fruit set to maturity in two grapevine genotypes for three consecutive years, resulting in 219 samples. Major transcriptomic changes were represented by coordinated waves of gene expression associated with early development, veraison (onset of ripening)/midripening, and late-ripening and were consistent across vintages. The two genotypes were clearly distinguished by metabolite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>es and transcriptional changes occurring primarily at the veraison/midripening phase. Coexpression analysis identified a core network of transcripts as well as variations in the within-module connections representing varietal differences. By focusing on transcriptome rearrangements close to veraison, we identified two rapid and successive shared transitions involving genes whose expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>es precisely locate the timing of the molecular reprogramming of berry development. Functional analyses of two transcription factors, markers of the first transition, suggested that they participate in a hierarchical cascade of gene activation at the onset of ripening. This study defined the initial transcriptional events that mark and trigger the onset of ripening and the molecular network that characterizes the whole process of berry development, providing a framework to model fruit development and maturation in grapevine.</p>

Diffusion of CO<sub>2</sub> across the Mesophyll-Bundle Sheath Cell Interface in a C<sub>4</sub> Plant with Genetically Reduced PEP Carboxylase Activity
<p>Phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), localized to the cytosol of the mesophyll cell, catalyzes the first carboxylation step of the C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic pathway. Here, we used RNA interference to target the cytosolic photosynthetic PEPC isoform in <i>Setaria viridis</i> and isolated independent transformants with very low PEPC activities. These plants required high ambient CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations for growth, consistent with the essential role of PEPC in C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. The combination of estimating direct CO<sub>2</sub> fixation by the bundle sheath using gas-exchange measurements and modeling C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis with low PEPC activity allowed the calculation of bundle sheath conductance to CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion (<i>g<sub>bs</sub></i>) in the progeny of these plants. Measurements made at a range of temperatures suggested no or negligible effect of temperature on <i>g<sub>bs</sub></i> depending on the technique used to calculate <i>g<sub>bs</sub></i>. Anatomical measurements revealed that plants with reduced PEPC activity had reduced cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness and increased plasmodesmata (PD) density at the mesophyll-bundle sheath (M-BS) cell interface, whereas we observed little difference in these parameters at the mesophyll-mesophyll cell interface. The increased PD density at the M-BS interface was largely driven by an increase in the number of PD pit fields (cluster of PDs) rather than an increase in PD per pit field or the size of pit fields. The correlation of <i>g<sub>bs</sub></i> with bundle sheath surface area per leaf area and PD area per M-BS area showed that these parameters and cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness are important determinants of <i>g<sub>bs</sub></i>. It is intriguing to speculate that PD development is responsive to changes in C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic flux.</p>

A New Phenotyping Pipeline Reveals Three Types of Lateral Roots and a Random Branching Pattern in Two Cereals
<p>Recent progress in root phenotyping has focused mainly on increasing throughput for genetic studies, while identifying root developmental patterns has been comparatively underexplored. We introduce a new phenotyping pipeline for producing high-quality spatiotemporal root system development data and identifying developmental patterns within these data. The SmartRoot image-analysis system and temporal and spatial statistical models were applied to two cereals, pearl millet (<i>Pennisetum glaucum</i>) and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). Semi-Markov switching linear models were used to cluster lateral roots based on their growth rate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>es. These models revealed three types of lateral roots with similar characteristics in both species. The first type corresponds to fast and accelerating roots, the second to rapidly arrested roots, and the third to an intermediate type where roots cease elongation after a few days. These types of lateral roots were retrieved in different proportions in a maize mutant affected in auxin signaling, while the first most vigorous type was absent in maize plants exposed to severe shading. Moreover, the classification of growth rate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>es was mirrored by a ranking of anatomical traits in pearl millet. Potential dependencies in the succession of lateral root types along the primary root were then analyzed using variable-order Markov chains. The lateral root type was not influenced by the shootward neighbor root type or by the distance from this root. This random branching pattern of primary roots was remarkably conserved, despite the high variability of root systems in both species. Our phenotyping pipeline opens the door to exploring the genetic variability of lateral root developmental patterns.</p>

The Deubiquitinase OTU5 Regulates Root Responses to Phosphate Starvation
<p>Phosphorus, taken up by plants as inorganic phosphate (Pi), is an essential but often growth-limiting mineral nutrient for plants. As part of an orchestrated response to improve its acquisition, insufficient Pi supply triggers alterations in root architecture and epidermal cell morphogenesis. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants defective in the expression of the <i>OVARIAN TUMOR DOMAIN-CONTAINING DEUBIQUITINATING ENZYME5</i> (<i>OTU5</i>) exhibited a constitutive Pi deficiency root phenotype, comprising the formation of long and dense root hairs and attenuated primary root growth. Quantitative protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>ing of <i>otu5</i> and wild-type roots using the isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification methodology revealed genotype- and Pi-dependent alterations in protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>es. In <i>otu5</i> plants, Pi starvation caused a short-root-hair phenotype and decreased abundance of a suite of Pi-responsive root hair-related proteins. Mutant plants also showed the accumulation of proteins involved in chromatin remodeling and altered distribution of reactive oxygen species along the root, which may be causative for the alterations in root hair morphogenesis. The root hair phenotype of <i>otu5</i> was synergistic to that of <i>actin-related protein6</i> (<i>arp6</i>), harboring a mutation in the SWR1 chromatin-remodeling complex. Genetic analysis of <i>otu5/arp6</i> double mutants suggests independent but functionally related roles of the two proteins in chromatin organization. The root hair phenotype of <i>otu5</i> is not caused by a general up-regulation of the Pi starvation response, indicating that OTU5 acts downstream of or interacts with Pi signaling. It is concluded that OTU5 is involved in the interpretation of environmental information, probably by altering chromatin organization and maintaining redox homeostasis.</p>

Nuclear Transcriptomes at High Resolution Using Retooled INTACT
<p>Isolated nuclei provide access to early steps in gene regulation involving chromatin as well as transcript production and processing. Here, we describe transfer of the isolation of nuclei from tagged specific cell types (INTACT) to the monocot rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.). The purification of biotinylated nuclei was redesigned by replacing the outer nuclear-envelope-targeting domain of the nuclear tagging fusion (NTF) protein with an outer nuclear-envelope-anchored domain. This modified NTF was combined with codon-optimized <i>Escherichia coli BirA</i> in a single T-DNA construct. We also developed inexpensive methods for INTACT, T-DNA insertion mapping, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>ing of the complete nuclear transcriptome, including a ribosomal RNA degradation procedure that minimizes pre-ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) transcripts. A high-resolution comparison of nuclear and steady-state poly(A)<sup>+</sup> transcript populations of seedling root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong>s confirmed the capture of pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) and exposed distinctions in diversity and abundance of the nuclear and total transcriptomes.

Light and Plastid Signals Regulate Different Sets of Genes in the Albino Mutant Pap7-1
<p>Plants possessing dysfunctional plastids due to defects in pigment biosynthesis or translation are known to repress photosynthesis-associated nuclear genes via retrograde signals from the disturbed organelles toward the nucleus. These signals are thought to be essential for proper biogenesis and function of the plastid. Mutants lacking plastid-encoded RNA polymerase-associated proteins (PAPs) display a genetic arrest in eoplast-chloroplast transition leading to an albino phenotype in the light. Retrograde signaling in these mutants, therefore, could be expected to be similar as under conditions inducing plastid dysfunction. To answer this question, we performed plastome- and genomewide array analyses in the <i>pap7</i>-<i>1</i> mutant of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). In parallel, we determined the potential overlap with light-regulated expression networks. To this end, we performed a comparative expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>ing approach using light- and dark-grown wild-type plants as relative control for the expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>es obtained from light-grown <i>pap7</i>-<i>1</i> mutants. Our data indicate a specific impact of retrograde signals on metabolism-related genes in <i>pap7</i>-<i>1</i> mutants reflecting the starvation situation of the albino seedlings. In contrast, light regulation of PhANGs and other nuclear gene groups appears to be fully functional in this mutant, indicating that a block in chloroplast biogenesis per se does not repress expression of them as suggested by earlier studies. Only genes for light harvesting complex proteins displayed a significant repression indicating an exclusive retrograde impact on this gene family. Our results indicate that chloroplasts and arrested plastids each emit specific signals that control different target gene modules both in positive and negative manner.</p>

Root Bending Is Antagonistically Affected by Hypoxia and ERF-Mediated Transcription via Auxin Signaling
<p>When plants encounter soil water logging or flooding, roots are the first organs to be confronted with reduced gas diffusion resulting in limited oxygen supply. Since roots do not generate photosynthetic oxygen, they are rapidly faced with oxygen shortage rendering roots particularly prone to damage. While metabolic adaptations to low oxygen conditions, which ensure basic energy supply, have been well characterized, adaptation of root growth and development have received less attention. In this study, we show that hypoxic conditions cause the primary root to grow sidewise in a low oxygen environment, possibly to escape soil patches with reduced oxygen availability. This growth behavior is reversible in that gravitropic growth resumes when seedlings are returned to normoxic conditions. Hypoxic root bending is inhibited by the group VII ethylene response factor (ERFVII) RAP2.12, as <i>rap2.12-1</i> seedlings show exaggerated primary root bending. Furthermore, overexpression of the ERFVII member <i>HRE2</i> inhibits root bending, suggesting that primary root growth direction at hypoxic conditions is antagonistically regulated by hypoxia and hypoxia-activated ERFVIIs. Root bending is preceded by the establishment of an auxin gradient across the root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong> as quantified with DII-VENUS and is synergistically enhanced by hypoxia and the auxin transport inhibitor naphthylphthalamic acid. The protein abundance of the auxin efflux carrier PIN2 is reduced at hypoxic conditions, a response that is suppressed by RAP2.12 overexpression, suggesting antagonistic control of auxin flux by hypoxia and ERFVII. Taken together, we show that hypoxia triggers an escape response of the primary root that is controlled by ERFVII activity and mediated by auxin signaling in the root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong>.</p>

Spatial Mapping and Profiling of Metabolite Distributions during Germination

Crude dissection of the seed followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of polar metabolites also revealed that many compounds were highly sequestered among the various seed tissue types. To further localize compounds, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging was utilized to visualize compounds in fine detail in their native environments over the course of germination. Most notably, the fatty acyl chain-dependent differential localization of phospholipids and triacylglycerols was observed within the embryo and radicle, showing correlation with the heterogeneous distribution of fatty acids. Other interesting observations include unusual localization of ceramides on the endosperm/scutellum boundary and subcellular localization of ferulate in the aleurone.</p>

The Auxin Biosynthetic <i>TRYPTOPHAN AMINOTRANSFERASE RELATED TaTAR2.1-3A</i> Increases Grain Yield of Wheat
<p>Controlling the major auxin biosynthetic pathway to manipulate auxin content could be a target for genetic engineering of crops with desired traits, but little progress had been made because low or high auxin contents often cause developmental inhibition. Here, we performed a genome-wide analysis of bread wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) to identify the Tryptophan Aminotransferase of Arabidopsis1/Tryptophan Aminotransferase-Related (TAA1/TAR) genes that function in the tryptophan-dependent pathway of auxin biosynthesis. Sequence mining together with gene cloning identified 15 <i>TaTAR</i> genes, among which 12 and three genes were phylogenetically close to Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) AtTAR2 and AtTAR3, respectively. <i>TaTAR2.1</i> had the most abundant transcripts in the <i>TaTAR2</i> genes and was expressed mainly in roots and up-regulated by low nitrogen (N) availability. Knockdown of <i>TaTAR2.1</i> caused vegetative and reproductive deficiencies and impaired lateral root (LR) growth under both high- and low-N conditions. Overexpressing <i>TaTAR2.1-3A</i> in wheat enhanced LR branching, plant height, spike number, grain yield, and aerial N accumulation under different N supply levels. In addition, overexpressing <i>TaTAR2.1-3A</i> in Arabidopsis elevated auxin accumulation in the primary root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong>, LR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong>, LR primordia, and cotyledon and hypocotyl and increased primary root length, visible LR number, and shoot fresh weight under high- and low-N conditions.

Dynamic Cytology and Transcriptional Regulation of Rice Lamina Joint Development
<p>Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) leaf angle is determined by lamina joint and is an important agricultural trait determining leaf erectness and, hence, the photosynthesis efficiency and grain yield. Genetic studies reveal a complex regulatory network of lamina joint development; however, the morphological changes, cytological transitions, and underlying transcriptional programming remain to be elucidated. A systemic morphological and cytological study reveals a dynamic developmental process and suggests a common but distinct regulation of the lamina joint. Successive and sequential cell division and expansion, cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ening, and programmed cell death at the adaxial or abaxial sides form the cytological basis of the lamina joint, and the increased leaf angle results from the asymmetric cell proliferation and elongation. Analysis of the gene expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>es at four distinct developmental stages ranging from initiation to senescence showed that genes related to cell division and growth, hormone synthesis and signaling, transcription (transcription factors), and protein phosphorylation (protein kinases) exhibit distinct spatiotemporal patterns during lamina joint development. Phytohormones play crucial roles by promoting cell differentiation and growth at early stages or regulating the maturation and senescence at later stages, which is consistent with the quantitative analysis of hormones at different stages. Further comparison with the gene expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>e of <i>leaf inclination1</i>, a mutant with decreased auxin and increased leaf angle, indicates the coordinated effects of hormones in regulating lamina joint. These results reveal a dynamic cytology of rice lamina joint that is fine-regulated by mul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong>le factors, providing informative clues for illustrating the regulatory mechanisms of leaf angle and plant architecture.</p>

Transcriptome Profiling of Wheat Inflorescence Development from Spikelet Initiation to Floral Patterning Identified Stage-Specific Regulatory Genes
<p>Early reproductive development in cereals is crucial for final grain number per spike and hence the yield potential of the crop. To date, however, no systematic analyses of gene expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>es during this important process have been conducted for common wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>). Here, we studied the transcriptome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>es at four stages of early wheat reproductive development, from spikelet initiation to floral organ differentiation. <i>K</i>-means clustering and stage-specific transcript identification detected dynamically expressed homeologs of important transcription regulators in spikelet and floral meristems that may be involved in spikelet initiation, floret meristem specification, and floral organ patterning, as inferred from their homologs in model plants. Small RNA transcriptome sequencing discovered key microRNAs that were differentially expressed during wheat inflorescence development alongside their target genes, suggesting that miRNA-mediated regulatory mechanisms for floral development may be conserved in cereals and Arabidopsis. Our analysis was further substantiated by the functional characterization of the <i>ARGONAUTE1d</i> (<i>AGO1d</i>) gene, which was initially expressed in stamen primordia and later in the tapetum during anther maturation. In agreement with its stage-specific expression pattern, the loss of function of the predominantly expressed B homeolog of <i>AGO1d</i> in a tetraploid durum wheat mutant resulted in smaller anthers with more infertile pollens than the wild type and a reduced grain number per spike. Together, our work provides a first glimpse of the gene regulatory networks in wheat inflorescence development that may be pivotal for floral and grain development, highlighting potential targets for genetic manipulation to improve future wheat yields.</p>

Pea Border Cell Maturation and Release Involve Complex Cell Wall Structural Dynamics
<p>The adhesion of plant cells is vital for support and protection of the plant body and is maintained by a variety of molecular associations between cell wall components. In some specialized cases, though, plant cells are programmed to detach, and root cap-derived border cells are examples of this. Border cells (in some species known as border-like cells) provide an expendable barrier between roots and the environment. Their maturation and release is an important but poorly characterized cell separation event. To gain a deeper insight into the complex cellular dynamics underlying this process, we undertook a systematic, detailed analysis of pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong> cell walls. Our study included immunocarbohydrate microarray <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>ing, monosaccharide composition determination, Fourier-transformed infrared microspectroscopy, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR of cell wall biosynthetic genes, analysis of hydrolytic activities, transmission electron microscopy, and immunolocalization of cell wall components. Using this integrated glycobiology approach, we identified mul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong>le novel modes of cell wall structural and compositional rearrangement during root cap growth and the release of border cells. Our findings provide a new level of detail about border cell maturation and enable us to develop a model of the separation process. We propose that loss of adhesion by the dissolution of homogalacturonan in the middle lamellae is augmented by an active biophysical process of cell curvature driven by the polarized distribution of xyloglucan and extensin epitopes.</p>

Analysis of Exocyst Subunit EXO70 Family Reveals Distinct Membrane Polar Domains in Tobacco Pollen Tubes
<p>The vesicle-tethering complex exocyst is one of the crucial cell polarity regulators. The EXO70 subunit is required for the targeting of the complex and is represented by many isoforms in angiosperm plant cells. This diversity could be partly responsible for the establishment and maintenance of membrane domains with different composition. To address this hypothesis, we employed the growing pollen tube, a well-established cell polarity model system, and performed large-scale expression, localization, and functional analysis of tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) EXO70 isoforms. Various isoforms localized to different regions of the pollen tube plasma membrane, apical vesicle-rich inverted cone region, nucleus, and cytoplasm. The overexpression of major pollen-expressed EXO70 isoforms resulted in growth arrest and characteristic phenotypic deviations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong> swelling and apical invaginations. NtEXO70A1a and NtEXO70B1 occupied two distinct and mutually exclusive plasma membrane domains. Both isoforms partly colocalized with the exocyst subunit NtSEC3a at the plasma membrane, possibly forming different exocyst complex subpopulations. NtEXO70A1a localized to the small area previously characterized as the site of exocytosis in the tobacco pollen tube, while NtEXO70B1 surprisingly colocalized with the zone of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Both NtEXO70A1a and NtEXO70B1 colocalized to different degrees with markers for the anionic signaling phospholipids phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and phosphatidic acid. In contrast, members of the EXO70 C class, which are specifically expressed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong>-growing cells, exhibited exocytosis-related functional effects in pollen tubes despite the absence of apparent plasma membrane localization. Taken together, our data support the existence of mul<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong>le membrane-trafficking domains regulated by different EXO70-containing exocyst complexes within a single cell.</p>

Apparent Overinvestment in Leaf Venation Relaxes Leaf Morphological Constraints on Photosynthesis in Arid Habitats
<p>Leaf veins supply the mesophyll with water that evaporates when stomata are open to allow CO<sub>2</sub> uptake for photosynthesis. Theoretical analyses suggest that water is optimally distributed in the mesophyll when the lateral distance between veins (<i>d</i><sub>x</sub>) is equal to the distance from these veins to the epidermis (<i>d</i><sub>y</sub>), expressed as <i>d</i><sub>x</sub>:<i>d</i><sub>y</sub> ≈ 1. Although this theory is supported by observations of many derived angiosperms, we hypothesize that plants in arid environments may reduce <i>d</i><sub>x</sub>:<i>d</i><sub>y</sub> below unity owing to climate-specific functional adaptations of increased leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness and increased vein density. To test our hypothesis, we assembled leaf hydraulic, morphological, and photosynthetic traits of 68 species from the <i>Eucalyptus</i> and <i>Corymbia</i> genera (termed eucalypts) along an aridity gradient in southwestern Australia. We inferred the potential gas-exchange advantage of reducing <i>d</i><sub>x</sub> beyond <i>d</i><sub>y</sub> using a model that links leaf morphology and hydraulics to photosynthesis. Our observations reveal that eucalypts in arid environments have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong> amphistomatous leaves with high vein densities, resulting in <i>d</i><sub>x</sub>:<i>d</i><sub>y</sub> ratios that range from 1.6 to 0.15 along the aridity gradient. Our model suggests that, as leaves become <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>er, the effect of reducing <i>d</i><sub>x</sub> beyond <i>d</i><sub>y</sub> is to offset the reduction in leaf gas exchange that would result from maintaining <i>d</i><sub>x</sub>:<i>d</i><sub>y</sub> at unity. This apparent overinvestment in leaf venation may be explained from the selective pressure of aridity, under which traits associated with long leaf life span, high hydraulic and thermal capacitances, and high potential rates of leaf water transport confer a competitive advantage.</p>

An Oxalyl-CoA Synthetase Is Involved in Oxalate Degradation and Aluminum Tolerance
<p>Acyl Activating Enzyme3 (AAE3) was identified to be involved in the catabolism of oxalate, which is critical for seed development and defense against fungal pathogens. However, the role of AAE3 protein in abiotic stress responses is unknown. Here, we investigated the role of rice bean (<i>Vigna umbellata</i>) VuAAE3 in Al tolerance. Recombinant VuAAE3 protein has specific activity against oxalate, with <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> = 121 ± 8.2 µ<sc>m</sc> and <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> of 7.7 ± 0.88 µmol min<sup>−1</sup> mg<sup>−1</sup> protein, indicating it functions as an oxalyl-CoA synthetase. VuAAE3-GFP localization suggested that this enzyme is a soluble protein with no specific subcellular localization. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and <i>VuAAE3</i> promoter-GUS reporter analysis showed that the expression induction of <i>VuAAE3</i> is mainly confined to rice bean root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong>s. Accumulation of oxalate was induced rapidly by Al stress in rice bean root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tip</span></strong>s, and exogenous application of oxalate resulted in the inhibition of root elongation and <i>VuAAE3</i> expression induction, suggesting that oxalate accumulation is involved in Al-induced root growth inhibition. Furthermore, overexpression of VuAAE3 in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) resulted in the increase of Al tolerance, which was associated with the decrease of oxalate accumulation. In addition, <i>NtMATE</i> and <i>NtALS3</i> expression showed no difference between transgenic lines and wild-type plants. Taken together, our results suggest that VuAAE3-dependent turnover of oxalate plays a critical role in Al tolerance mechanisms.</p>

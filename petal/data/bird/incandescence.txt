Spectacular Oscillations in Plant Isoprene Emission under Transient Conditions Explain the Enigmatic CO<sub>2</sub> Response<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plant isoprene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ions respond to light and temperature similarly to photosynthesis, but CO<sub>2</sub> dependencies of isoprene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion and photosynthesis are profoundly different, with photosynthesis increasing and isoprene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion decreasing with increasing CO<sub>2</sub> concentration due to reasons not yet understood. We studied isoprene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion, net assimilation rate, and chlorophyll fluorescence under different CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the strong isoprene emitter hybrid aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus tremuloides</i>), and used rapid changes in ambient CO<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>2</sub> concentrations or light level to induce oscillations. As isoprene-emitting species support very high steady-state chloroplastic pool sizes of the primary isoprene substrate, dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMADP), which can mask the effects of oscillatory dynamics on isoprene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion, the size of the DMADP pool was experimentally reduced by either partial inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis pathway by fosmidomycin-feeding or by changes in ambient gas concentrations leading to DMADP pool depletion in intact leaves. In feedback-limited conditions observed at low O<sub>2</sub> and/or high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration under which the rate of photosynthesis is governed by the limited rate of ATP and NADPH formation due to low chloroplastic phosphate levels, oscillations in photosynthesis and isoprene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion were repeatedly induced by rapid environmental modifications in both partly fosmidomycin-inhibited leaves and in intact leaves with in vivo reduced DMADP pools. The oscillations in net assimilation rate and isoprene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion in feedback-inhibited leaves were in the same phase, and relative changes in the pools of photosynthetic metabolites and DMADP estimated by in vivo kinetic methods were directly proportional through all oscillations induced by different environmental perturbations. We conclude that the oscillations in isoprene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion provide direct experimental evidence demonstrating that the response of isoprene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion to changes in ambient gas concentrations is controlled by the chloroplastic reductant supply.</p>

Impact of summer drought on isoprenoid emissions and carbon sink of three Scots pine provenances
<p>Scots pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i> L.) provenances cover broad ecological amplitudes. In a greenhouse study, we investigated the impact of drought stress and rewetting on gas exchange for three provenances (Italy: Emilia Romagna; Spain: Alto Ebro; Germany: East-German lowlands) of 2-year old Scots pine seedlings. CO<sub>2</sub>, water vapour and isoprenoid exchange of stressed and control trees were quantified with a four-chamber dynamic-enclosure system in the controlled environment of a climate chamber. The three provenances showed distinct isoprenoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion patterns and were classified into a non-Δ<sup>3</sup>-carene, with either high α-/β-pinene or β-myrcene fraction, and a Δ<sup>3</sup>-carene dominated type. Isoprenoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion rates, net-photosynthesis and transpiration were reduced during summer drought stress and significantly recovered after rewetting. A seasonal increase of isoprenoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion rates towards autumn was observed for all control groups. Compared with the German provenance, the Spanish and Italian provenances revealed higher isoprenoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion rates and more plastic responses to drought stress and seasonal development, which points to a local adaptation to climate. As a result of drought, net carbon uptake and transpiration of trees was reduced, but recovered after rewetting. We conclude from our study that Scots pine isoprenoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion is more variable than expected and sensitive to drought periods, likely impacting regional air chemistry. Thus, a provenance-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion assessment accounting for reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion during prolonged (summer) drought is recommend for setting up biogenic volatile organic compound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion inventories used in air quality models.</p>

Evidence That Isoprene Emission Is Not Limited by Cytosolic Metabolites. Exogenous Malate Does Not Invert the Reverse Sensitivity of Isoprene Emission to High [CO<sub>2</sub>]
<p>Isoprene is synthesized via the chloroplastic 2-<i>C</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-erythritol 4-phosphate/1-deoxy-<sc>d</sc>-xylulose 5-phosphate pathway (MEP/DOXP), and its synthesis is directly related to photosynthesis, except under high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, when the rate of photosynthesis increases but isoprene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion decreases. Suppression of MEP/DOXP pathway activity by high CO<sub>2</sub> has been explained either by limited supply of the cytosolic substrate precursor, phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate (PEP), into chloroplast as the result of enhanced activity of cytosolic PEP carboxylase or by limited supply of energetic and reductive equivalents. We tested the PEP-limitation hypotheses by feeding leaves with the PEP carboxylase competitive inhibitors malate and diethyl oxalacetate (DOA) in the strong isoprene emitter hybrid aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus tremuloides</i>). Malate feeding resulted in the inhibition of net assimilation, photosynthetic electron transport, and isoprene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion rates, but DOA feeding did not affect any of these processes except at very high application concentrations. Both malate and DOA did not alter the sensitivity of isoprene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion to high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. Malate inhibition of isoprene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion was associated with enhanced chloroplastic reductive status that suppressed light reactions of photosynthesis, ultimately leading to reduced isoprene substrate dimethylallyl diphosphate pool size. Additional experiments with altered oxygen concentrations in conditions of feedback-limited and non-feedback-limited photosynthesis further indicated that changes in isoprene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion rate in control and malate-inhibited leaves were associated with changes in the share of ATP and reductive equivalent supply for isoprene synthesis. The results of this study collectively indicate that malate importantly controls the chloroplast reductive status and, thereby, affects isoprene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion, but they do not support the hypothesis that cytosolic metabolite availability alters the response of isoprene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion to changes in atmospheric composition.</p>

Assessment of methane emissions from the U.S. oil and gas supply chain
<p>Methane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ions from the U.S. oil and natural gas supply chain were estimated by using ground-based, facility-scale measurements and validated with aircraft observations in areas accounting for ~30% of U.S. gas production. When scaled up nationally, our facility-based estimate of 2015 supply chain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ions is 13 ± 2 teragrams per year, equivalent to 2.3% of gross U.S. gas production. This value is ~60% higher than the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency inventory estimate, likely because existing inventory methods miss <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ions released during abnormal operating conditions. Methane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ions of this magnitude, per unit of natural gas consumed, produce radiative forcing over a 20-year time horizon comparable to the CO<sub>2</sub> from natural gas combustion. Substantial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion reductions are feasible through rapid detection of the root causes of high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ions and deployment of less failure-prone systems.</p>

EIN3-LIKE1, MYB1, and ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR3 Act in a Regulatory Loop That Synergistically Modulates Ethylene Biosynthesis and Anthocyanin Accumulation
<p>Ethylene regulates climacteric fruit ripening, and EIN3-LIKE1 (EIL1) plays an important role in this process. In apple (<i>Malus domestica</i>), fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation is accompanied by ethylene release during fruit ripening, but the molecular mechanism that underlies these two physiological processes is unknown. In this study, we found that ethylene treatment markedly induced fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation as well as the expression of <i>MdMYB1</i>, a positive regulator of anthocyanin biosynthesis and fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation. In addition, we found that MdEIL1 directly bound to the promoter of <i>MdMYB1</i> and transcriptionally activated its expression, which resulted in anthocyanin biosynthesis and fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation. Furthermore, MdMYB1 interacted with the promoter of <i>ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR3</i>, a key regulator of ethylene biosynthesis, thereby providing a positive feedback for ethylene biosynthesis regulation. Overall, our findings provide insight into a mechanism involving the synergistic interaction of the ethylene signal with the MdMYB1 transcription factor to regulate ethylene biosynthesis and fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation in apple.</p>

Origin of the bright photoluminescence of few-atom silver clusters confined in LTA zeolites
<p>Silver (Ag) clusters confined in matrices possess remarkable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">luminesc</span></strong>ence properties, but little is known about their structural and electronic properties. We characterized the <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">bright</span></strong> green <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">luminesc</span></strong>ence of Ag clusters confined in partially exchanged Ag–Linde Type A (LTA) zeolites by means of a combination of x-ray excited optical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">luminesc</span></strong>ence-extended x-ray absorption fine structure, time-dependent–density functional theory calculations, and time-resolved spectroscopy. A mixture of tetrahedral Ag<sub>4</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<i><sub>x</sub></i><sup>2+</sup> (<i>x</i> = 2 and <i>x</i> = 4) clusters occupies the center of a fraction of the sodalite cages. Their optical properties originate from a confined two-electron superatom quantum system with hybridized Ag and water O orbitals delocalized over the cluster. Upon excitation, one electron of the s-type highest occupied molecular orbital is promoted to the p-type lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals and relaxes through enhanced intersystem crossing into long-lived triplet states.</p>

Volatile chemical products emerging as largest petrochemical source of urban organic emissions
<p>A gap in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion inventories of urban volatile organic compound (VOC) sources, which contribute to regional ozone and aerosol burdens, has increased as transportation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ions in the United States and Europe have declined rapidly. A detailed mass balance demonstrates that the use of volatile chemical products (VCPs)—including pesticides, coatings, printing inks, adhesives, cleaning agents, and personal care products—now constitutes half of fossil fuel VOC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ions in industrialized cities. The high fraction of VCP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ions is consistent with observed urban outdoor and indoor air measurements. We show that human exposure to carbonaceous aerosols of fossil origin is transitioning away from transportation-related sources and toward VCPs. Existing U.S. regulations on VCPs emphasize mitigating ozone and air toxics, but they currently exempt many chemicals that lead to secondary organic aerosols.</p>

An accreting pulsar with extreme properties drives an ultraluminous x-ray source in NGC 5907
<p>Ultraluminous x-ray sources (ULXs) in nearby galaxies shine <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">bright</span></strong>er than any x-ray source in our Galaxy. ULXs are usually modeled as stellar-mass black holes (BHs) accreting at very high rates or intermediate-mass BHs. We present observations showing that NGC 5907 ULX is instead an x-ray accreting neutron star (NS) with a spin period evolving from 1.43 seconds in 2003 to 1.13 seconds in 2014. It has an isotropic peak <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">luminos</span></strong>ity of [Formula]1000 times the Eddington limit for a NS at 17.1 megaparsec. Standard accretion models fail to explain its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">luminos</span></strong>ity, even assuming beamed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion, but a strong multipolar magnetic field can describe its properties. These findings suggest that other extreme ULXs (x-ray <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">luminos</span></strong>ity [Formula] 10<sup>41 </sup>erg second[Formula]) might harbor NSs.</p>

Polyamines Regulate Strawberry Fruit Ripening by Abscisic Acid, Auxin, and Ethylene<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Polyamines (PAs) participate in many plant growth and developmental processes, including fruit ripening. However, it is not clear whether PAs play a role in the ripening of strawberry (<i>Fragaria ananassa</i>), a model nonclimacteric plant. Here, we found that the content of the PA spermine (Spm) increased more sharply after the onset of fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation than did that of the PAs putrescine (Put) or spermidine (Spd). Spm dominance in ripe fruit resulted from abundant transcripts of a strawberry <i>S</i>-adenosyl-<sc>l</sc>-Met decarboxylase gene (<i>FaSAMDC</i>), which encodes an enzyme that generates a residue needed for PA biosynthesis. Exogenous Spm and Spd promoted fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation, while exogenous Put and a SAMDC inhibitor inhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation. Based on transcriptome data, up- and down-regulation of <i>FaSAMDC</i> expression promoted and inhibited ripening, respectively, which coincided with changes in several physiological parameters and their corresponding gene transcripts, including firmness, anthocyanin content, sugar content, polyamine content, auxin (indole-3-acetic acid [IAA]) content, abscisic acid (ABA) content, and ethylene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion. Using isothermal titration calorimetry, we found that FaSAMDC also had a high enzymatic activity with a <i>K</i><sub>d</sub> of 1.7 × 10<sup>−3</sup> <sc>m</sc>. In conclusion, PAs, especially Spm, regulate strawberry fruit ripening in an ABA-dominated, IAA-participating, and ethylene-coordinated manner, and FaSAMDC plays an important role in ripening.</p>

Pheromones exert top-down effects on visual recognition in the jumping spider <i>Lyssomanes viridis</i>
<p>In diverse and productive habitats, predaceous arthropods are expected to frequently encounter dangerous conspecifics and heterospecifics. This should make quick and accurate discriminations between species and sexes adaptive. By simultaneously sampling both visual cues and pheromones, and by utilizing stringent species- and sex-specific visual recognition templates, an individual should be able to increase both its speed and accuracy in making such discriminations. We tested for the use and stringency of visual recognition templates in the jumping spider <i>Lyssomanes viridis</i> by presenting males with animated images of conspecifics, heterospecifics and composite images that combined the facial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation and morphology of one sex or species with the leg <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation of another. Males' courtship <i>versus</i> threat displays indicated whether a stimulus was perceived as a potential mate or a threat. By comparing males' visual inspection times of, and display types towards, the various images in the presence <i>versus</i> absence of female pheromones, we were able to deduce whether males tend to inspect a subset of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong> pattern and morphological features that make up their conspecific recognition templates (i.e. those on just the face or just the legs), or all features, and whether this changes in the presence of pheromones. We found that the male recognition template for conspecific female was surprisingly coarse, whereas the recognition template for conspecific male, and especially the male face, was more specific. Pheromones hastened the recognition of images with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation and morphology closely matching those of conspecifics, presumably by activating conspecific visual recognition templates. When males were presented with an image that was, overall, a poor match to a conspecific female, but that contained a subset of female or female-like features, female pheromones usually did not hasten recognition, but did increase the likelihood that the image would be identified as a female. Taken together, our data suggest that males examined features on both the face and the legs in both the presence and absence of pheromones, and that female pheromones tipped the balance in favor of a female identification when a male was unsure how to categorize an incongruous set of visual features.</p>

Redefining near-unity luminescence in quantum dots with photothermal threshold quantum yield
<p>A variety of optical applications rely on the absorption and re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion of light. The quantum yield of this process often plays an essential role. When the quantum yield deviates from unity by significantly less than 1%, applications such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">luminesc</span></strong>ent concentrators and optical refrigerators become possible. To evaluate such high performance, we develop a measurement technique for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">luminesc</span></strong>ence efficiency with sufficient accuracy below one part per thousand. Photothermal threshold quantum yield is based on the quantization of light to minimize overall measurement uncertainty. This technique is used to guide a procedure capable of making ensembles of near-unity emitting cadmium selenide/cadmium sulfide (CdSe/CdS) core-shell quantum dots. We obtain a photothermal threshold quantum yield <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">luminesc</span></strong>ence efficiency of 99.6 ± 0.2%, indicating nearly complete suppression of nonradiative decay channels.</p>

Linking a mutation to survival in wild mice
<p>Adaptive evolution in new or changing environments can be difficult to predict because the functional connections between genotype, phenotype, and fitness are complex.

Next, we show how a mutation in <i>Agouti</i> associated with survival causes lighter coat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong> through changes in its protein binding properties.

Past and future global transformation of terrestrial ecosystems under climate change
<p>Impacts of global climate change on terrestrial ecosystems are imperfectly constrained by ecosystem models and direct observations. Pervasive ecosystem transformations occurred in response to warming and associated climatic changes during the last glacial-to-interglacial transition, which was comparable in magnitude to warming projected for the next century under high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion scenarios. We reviewed 594 published paleoecological records to examine compositional and structural changes in terrestrial vegetation since the last glacial period and to project the magnitudes of ecosystem transformations under alternative future <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion scenarios. Our results indicate that terrestrial ecosystems are highly sensitive to temperature change and suggest that, without major reductions in greenhouse gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ions to the atmosphere, terrestrial ecosystems worldwide are at risk of major transformation, with accompanying disruption of ecosystem services and impacts on biodiversity.</p>

German federal authorities, and police in the country's 15 other states, are only allowed to perform DNA fingerprinting, in which they look for an exact match between crime scene DNA and samples in a database of known criminals or from a suspect. DNA phenotyping and ancestry prediction, however, have been used in the Netherlands, France, the United Kingdom, Canada, and several U.S. states. Some critics caution that although the underlying science connecting genetic markers to certain physical features is solid, DNA phenotyping and ancestry prediction still come with significant uncertainties that can be easily misunderstood by police and the public.</p>

Winter color polymorphisms identify global hot spots for evolutionary rescue from climate change
<p>Maintenance of biodiversity in a rapidly changing climate will depend on the efficacy of evolutionary rescue, whereby population declines due to abrupt environmental change are reversed by shifts in genetically driven adaptive traits. However, a lack of traits known to be under direct selection by anthropogenic climate change has limited the incorporation of evolutionary processes into global conservation efforts. In 21 vertebrate species, some individuals undergo a seasonal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong> molt from summer brown to winter white as camouflage against snow, whereas other individuals remain brown. Seasonal snow duration is decreasing globally, and fitness is lower for winter white animals on snowless backgrounds. Based on 2713 georeferenced samples of known winter coat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>—from eight species across trophic levels—we identify environmentally driven clinal gradients in winter coat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>, including polymorphic zones where winter brown and white morphs co-occur. These polymorphic zones, underrepresented by existing global protected area networks, indicate hot spots for evolutionary rescue in a changing climate.</p>

Illuminating gravitational waves: A concordant picture of photons from a neutron star merger
<p>Merging neutron stars offer an excellent laboratory for simultaneously studying strong-field gravity and matter in extreme environments. We establish the physical association of an electromagnetic counterpart (EM170817) with gravitational waves (GW170817) detected from merging neutron stars. By synthesizing a panchromatic data set, we demonstrate that merging neutron stars are a long-sought production site forging heavy elements by r-process nucleosynthesis. The weak gamma rays seen in EM170817 are dissimilar to classical short gamma-ray bursts with ultrarelativistic jets. Instead, we suggest that breakout of a wide-angle, mildly relativistic cocoon engulfing the jet explains the low-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">luminos</span></strong>ity gamma rays, the high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">luminos</span></strong>ity ultraviolet-optical-infrared, and the delayed radio and x-ray <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion.

Because climate-model simulations of the sea-ice loss differ substantially, we used a robust linear relationship between monthly-mean September sea-ice area and cumulative carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ions to infer the future evolution of Arctic summer sea ice directly from the observational record. The observed linear relationship implies a sustained loss of 3 ± 0.3 square meters of September sea-ice area per metric ton of CO<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion. On the basis of this sensitivity, Arctic sea ice will be lost throughout September for an additional 1000 gigatons of CO<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ions. Most models show a lower sensitivity, which is possibly linked to an underestimation of the modeled increase in incoming longwave radiation and of the modeled transient climate response.</p>

Improving efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells with photocurable fluoropolymers
<p>Organometal halide perovskite solar cells have demonstrated high conversion efficiency but poor long-term stability against ultraviolet irradiation and water. We show that rapid light–induced free-radical polymerization at ambient temperature produces multifunctional fluorinated photopolymer coatings that confer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">luminesc</span></strong>ent and easy-cleaning features on the front side of the devices, while concurrently forming a strongly hydrophobic barrier toward environmental moisture on the back contact side. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">luminesc</span></strong>ent photopolymers re-emit ultraviolet light in the visible range, boosting perovskite solar cells efficiency to nearly 19% under standard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">illumin</span></strong>ation. Coated devices reproducibly retain their full functional performance during prolonged operation, even after a series of severe aging tests carried out for more than 6 months.</p>

CYP79D73 Participates in Biosynthesis of Floral Scent Compound 2-Phenylethanol in <i>Plumeria rubra</i>
<p>Plumeria (<i>Plumeria rubra</i>), well known for its <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">bright</span></strong>ly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ed and fragrant flowers, emits a number of floral volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Plumeria flowers emit a total of 43 VOCs including nine phenylpropanoids/benzenoids, such as 2-phenylethanol (2PE), benzaldehyde, 2-phenylacetaldehyde (PAld), (<i>E/Z</i>)<i>-</i>phenylacetaldoxime (PAOx), benzyl nitrile (BN), and 2-phenylnitroethane (PN). To identify genes and pathways involved in the production of the major compound 2PE, we analyzed the plumeria floral transcriptome and found a highly expressed, flower-specific gene encoding a cytochrome P450 family 79D protein (PrCYP79D73), which catalyzed the formation of (<i>E/Z</i>)-PAOx. Feeding experiments with deuterated phenylalanine or deuterated (<i>E/Z</i>)-PAOx showed that (<i>E/Z</i>)-PAOx is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of 2PE, as are two nitrogen-containing volatiles, BN and PN, in plumeria flowers. Crude enzyme extracts from plumeria flowers converted <sc>l</sc>-phenylalanine to (<i>E/Z</i>)-PAOx, PAld, 2PE, BN, and PN. The biosynthesis of these compounds increased with addition of PrCYP79D73-enriched microsomes but was blocked by pretreatment with 4-phenylimidazole, an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 enzymes. Moreover, overexpression of <i>PrCYP79D73</i> in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> resulted in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion of (<i>E/Z</i>)-PAOx as well as PAld, 2PE, BN, and PN, all of which were also found among plumeria floral VOCs. Taken together, our results demonstrate that PrCYP79D73 is a crucial player in the biosynthesis of the major floral VOC 2PE and other nitrogen-containing volatiles. These volatiles may be required for plant defense as well as to attract pollinators for the successful reproduction of plumeria.</p>

Isoprene Acts as a Signaling Molecule in Gene Networks Important for Stress Responses and Plant Growth
<p>Isoprene synthase converts dimethylallyl diphosphate to isoprene and appears to be necessary and sufficient to allow plants to emit isoprene at significant rates. Isoprene can protect plants from abiotic stress but is not produced naturally by all plants; for example, Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) do not produce isoprene. It is typically present at very low concentrations, suggesting a role as a signaling molecule; however, its exact physiological role and mechanism of action are not fully understood. We transformed Arabidopsis with a <i>Eucalyptus globulus isoprene synthase</i>. The regulatory mechanisms of photosynthesis and isoprene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion were similar to those of native emitters, indicating that regulation of isoprene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion is not specific to isoprene-emitting species. Leaf chlorophyll and carotenoid contents were enhanced by isoprene, which also had a marked positive effect on hypocotyl, cotyledon, leaf, and inflorescence growth in Arabidopsis. By contrast, leaf and stem growth was reduced in tobacco engineered to emit isoprene. Expression of genes belonging to signaling networks or associated with specific growth regulators (e.g. gibberellic acid that promotes growth and jasmonic acid that promotes defense) and genes that lead to stress tolerance was altered by isoprene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion. Isoprene likely executes its effects on growth and stress tolerance through direct regulation of gene expression. Enhancement of jasmonic acid-mediated defense signaling by isoprene may trigger a growth-defense tradeoff leading to variations in the growth response. Our data support a role for isoprene as a signaling molecule.</p>

Improving Assessment of Drug Safety Through Proteomics
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Early detection of adverse effects of novel therapies and understanding of their mechanisms could improve the safety and efficiency of drug development. We have retrospectively applied large-scale proteomics to blood samples from ILLUMINATE (Investigation of Lipid Level Management to Understand its Impact in Atherosclerotic Events), a trial of torcetrapib (a cholesterol ester transfer protein inhibitor), that involved 15 067 participants at high cardiovascular risk. ILLUMINATE was terminated at a median of 550 days because of significant absolute increases of 1.2% in cardiovascular events and 0.4% in mortality with torcetrapib. The aims of our analysis were to determine whether a proteomic analysis might reveal biological mechanisms responsible for these harmful effects and whether harmful effects of torcetrapib could have been detected early in the ILLUMINATE trial with proteomics.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A nested case-control analysis of paired plasma samples at baseline and at 3 months was performed in 249 participants assigned to torcetrapib plus atorvastatin and 223 participants assigned to atorvastatin only. Within each treatment arm, cases with events were matched to controls 1:1. Main outcomes were a survey of 1129 proteins for discovery of biological pathways altered by torcetrapib and a 9-protein risk score validated to predict myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, or death.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Plasma concentrations of 200 proteins changed significantly with torcetrapib. Their pathway analysis revealed unexpected and widespread changes in immune and inflammatory functions, as well as changes in endocrine systems, including in aldosterone function and glycemic control. At baseline, 9-protein risk scores were similar in the 2 treatment arms and higher in participants with subsequent events. At 3 months, the absolute 9-protein derived risk increased in the torcetrapib plus atorvastatin arm compared with the atorvastatin-only arm by 1.08% (<i>P</i>=0.0004). Thirty-seven proteins changed in the direction of increased risk of 49 proteins previously associated with cardiovascular and mortality risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Heretofore unknown effects of torcetrapib were revealed in immune and inflammatory functions. A protein-based risk score predicted harm from torcetrapib within just 3 months. A protein-based risk assessment embedded within a large proteomic survey may prove to be useful in the evaluation of therapies to prevent harm to patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Resting MBF (<i>P</i>=0.383) and hyperemic microvascular resistance (<i>P</i>=0.431) were not changed and maintained stable.

Radar evidence of subglacial liquid water on Mars
<p>The presence of liquid water at the base of the martian polar caps has long been suspected but not observed. We surveyed the Planum Australe region using the MARSIS (Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding) instrument, a low-frequency radar on the Mars Express spacecraft. Radar profiles collected between May 2012 and December 2015 contain evidence of liquid water trapped below the ice of the South Polar Layered Deposits. Anomalously <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">bright</span></strong> subsurface reflections are evident within a well-defined, 20-kilometer-wide zone centered at 193°E, 81°S, which is surrounded by much less reflective areas. Quantitative analysis of the radar signals shows that this <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">bright</span></strong> feature has high relative dielectric permittivity (>15), matching that of water-bearing materials.

A dust-enshrouded tidal disruption event with a resolved radio jet in a galaxy merger
<p>Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are transient flares produced when a star is ripped apart by the gravitational field of a supermassive black hole (SMBH). We have observed a transient source in the western nucleus of the merging galaxy pair Arp 299 that radiated >1.5 × 10<sup>52</sup> erg at infrared and radio wavelengths but was not luminous at optical or x-ray wavelengths. We interpret this as a TDE with much of its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion reradiated at infrared wavelengths by dust. Efficient reprocessing by dense gas and dust may explain the difference between theoretical predictions and observed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">luminos</span></strong>ities of TDEs.

Electrofluorochromism at the single-molecule level

We used a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to characterize and control the fluorescence of a single zinc-phthalocyanine radical cation adsorbed on a sodium chloride–covered gold (111) sample.

The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion of the charged molecule was controlled by tuning the thickness of the insulator and the plasmons localized at the apex of the STM tip.

Neutrino emission from the direction of the blazar TXS 0506+056 prior to the IceCube-170922A alert
<p>A high-energy neutrino event detected by IceCube on 22 September 2017 was coincident in direction and time with a gamma-ray flare from the blazar TXS 0506+056.

We found an excess of high-energy neutrino events, with respect to atmospheric backgrounds, at that position between September 2014 and March 2015.

Microbial oxidation of lithospheric organic carbon in rapidly eroding tropical mountain soils
<p>Lithospheric organic carbon (“petrogenic”; OC<sub>petro</sub>) is oxidized during exhumation and subsequent erosion of mountain ranges. This process is a considerable source of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) to the atmosphere over geologic time scales, but the mechanisms that govern oxidation rates in mountain landscapes are poorly constrained. We demonstrate that, on average, 67 ± 11% of the OC<sub>petro</sub> initially present in bedrock exhumed from the tropical, rapidly eroding Central Range of Taiwan is oxidized in soils, leading to CO<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ions of 6.1 to 18.6 metric tons of carbon per square kilometer per year. The molecular and isotopic evolution of bulk OC and lipid biomarkers during soil formation reveals that OC<sub>petro</sub> remineralization is microbially mediated. Rapid oxidation in mountain soils drives CO<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion fluxes that increase with erosion rate, thereby counteracting CO<sub>2</sub> drawdown by silicate weathering and biospheric OC burial.</p>

Light-induced lattice expansion leads to high-efficiency perovskite solar cells
<p>Light-induced structural dynamics plays a vital role in the physical properties, device performance, and stability of hybrid perovskite–based optoelectronic devices. We report that continuous light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">illumin</span></strong>ation leads to a uniform lattice expansion in hybrid perovskite thin films, which is critical for obtaining high-efficiency photovoltaic devices. Correlated, in situ structural and device characterizations reveal that light-induced lattice expansion benefits the performances of a mixed-cation pure-halide planar device, boosting the power conversion efficiency from 18.5 to 20.5%. The lattice expansion leads to the relaxation of local lattice strain, which lowers the energetic barriers at the perovskite-contact interfaces, thus improving the open circuit voltage and fill factor. The light-induced lattice expansion did not compromise the stability of these high-efficiency photovoltaic devices under continuous operation at full-spectrum 1-sun (100 milliwatts per square centimeter) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">illumin</span></strong>ation for more than 1500 hours.</p>

Natural selection and the predictability of evolution in <i>Timema</i> stick insects

We found that evolution is more difficult to predict when it involves a balance between multiple selective factors and uncertainty in environmental conditions than when it involves feedback loops that cause consistent back-and-forth fluctuations. Specifically, changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>-morph frequencies are modestly predictable through time (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.14) and driven by complex selective regimes and yearly fluctuations in climate. In contrast, temporal changes in pattern-morph frequencies are highly predictable due to negative frequency-dependent selection (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.86). For both traits, however, natural selection drives evolution around a dynamic equilibrium, providing some predictability to the process.</p>

Emission of volatile organic compounds from petunia flowers is facilitated by an ABC transporter
<p>Plants synthesize a diversity of volatile molecules that are important for reproduction and defense, serve as practical products for humans, and influence atmospheric chemistry and climate.

By characterization of a <i>Petunia hybrida</i> adenosine triphosphate–binding cassette (ABC) transporter, PhABCG1, we demonstrate that passage of volatiles across the plasma membrane relies on active transport. <i>PhABCG1</i> down-regulation by RNA interference results in decreased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion of volatiles, which accumulate to toxic levels in the plasma membrane.

High-performance light-emitting diodes based on carbene-metal-amides
<p>Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) promise highly efficient lighting and display technologies. We introduce a new class of linear donor-bridge-acceptor light-emitting molecules, which enable solution-processed OLEDs with near-100% internal quantum efficiency at high <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">bright</span></strong>ness. Key to this performance is their rapid and efficient utilization of triplet states. Using time-resolved spectroscopy, we establish that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">luminesc</span></strong>ence via triplets occurs within 350 nanoseconds at ambient temperature, after reverse intersystem crossing to singlets. We find that molecular geometries exist at which the singlet-triplet energy gap (exchange energy) is close to zero, so that rapid interconversion is possible. Calculations indicate that exchange energy is tuned by relative rotation of the donor and acceptor moieties about the bridge. Unlike other systems with low exchange energy, substantial oscillator strength is sustained at the singlet-triplet degeneracy point.</p>

Efficient and stable solution-processed planar perovskite solar cells via contact passivation
<p>Planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs) made entirely via solution processing at low temperatures (<150°C) offer promise for simple manufacturing, compatibility with flexible substrates, and perovskite-based tandem devices. However, these PSCs require an electron-selective layer that performs well with similar processing. We report a contact-passivation strategy using chlorine-capped TiO<sub>2</sub> colloidal nanocrystal film that mitigates interfacial recombination and improves interface binding in low-temperature planar solar cells. We fabricated solar cells with certified efficiencies of 20.1 and 19.5% for active areas of 0.049 and 1.1 square centimeters, respectively, achieved via low-temperature solution processing. Solar cells with efficiency greater than 20% retained 90% (97% after dark recovery) of their initial performance after 500 hours of continuous room-temperature operation at their maximum power point under 1-sun <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">illumin</span></strong>ation (where 1 sun is defined as the standard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">illumin</span></strong>ation at AM1.5, or 1 kilowatt/square meter).</p>

Rosetta’s comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko sheds its dusty mantle to reveal its icy nature
<p>The Rosetta spacecraft has investigated comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko from large heliocentric distances to its perihelion passage and beyond. We trace the seasonal and diurnal evolution of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>s of the 67P nucleus, finding changes driven by sublimation and recondensation of water ice. The whole nucleus became relatively bluer near perihelion, as increasing activity removed the surface dust, implying that water ice is widespread underneath the surface. We identified large (1500 square meters) ice-rich patches appearing and then vanishing in about 10 days, indicating small-scale heterogeneities on the nucleus. Thin frosts sublimating in a few minutes are observed close to receding shadows, and rapid variations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong> are seen on extended areas close to the terminator. These cyclic processes are widespread and lead to continuously, slightly varying surface properties.</p>

Observations of Ejecta Clouds Produced by Impacts onto Saturn’s Rings
<sec><title>Saturn's Meteoroid Crash</title><p>During Saturn's equinox in 2009, when the Sun <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">illumin</span></strong>ated its rings edge-on, images taken by the Cassini spacecraft showed dust clouds appearing as <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">bright</span></strong> streaks above the rings. Similar streaks were detected in 2005 and 2012 when Cassini observed the C ring at close range. <bold>Tiscareno <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 460) suggest that the cause of each observed feature is likely to be the impact of a stream of recently disrupted material originating from a meteoroid impact onto the ring and derive the influx rate of meteoroids at Saturn.</p></sec>

Parts-Prospecting for a High-Efficiency Thiamin Thiazole Biosynthesis Pathway
<p>Plants synthesize the thiazole precursor of thiamin (cThz-P) via THIAMIN4 (THI4), a suicide enzyme that mediates one reaction cycle and must then be degraded and resynthesized. It has been estimated that this THI4 turnover consumes 2% to 12% of the maintenance energy budget and that installing an energy-efficient alternative pathway could substantially increase crop yield potential. Available data point to two natural alternatives to the suicidal THI4 pathway: (i) nonsuicidal prokaryotic THI4s that lack the active-site Cys residue on which suicide activity depends, and (ii) an uncharacterized thiazole synthesis pathway in flowers of the tropical arum lily <i>Caladium bi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong></i> that enables production and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion of large amounts of the cThz-P analog 4-methyl-5-vinylthiazole (MVT). We used functional complementation of an <i>Escherichia coli</i> Δ<i>thiG</i> strain to identify a nonsuicidal bacterial THI4 (from <i>Thermovibrio ammonificans</i>) that can function in conditions like those in plant cells. We explored whether <i>C. bi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong></i> synthesizes MVT de novo via a novel route, via a suicidal or a nonsuicidal THI4, or by catabolizing thiamin. Analysis of developmental changes in MVT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emiss</span></strong>ion, extractable MVT, thiamin level, and THI4 expression indicated that <i>C. bi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong></i> flowers make MVT de novo via a massively expressed THI4 and that thiamin is not involved. Functional complementation tests indicated that <i>C. bi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong></i> THI4, which has the active-site Cys needed to operate suicidally, may be capable of suicidal and – in hypoxic conditions – nonsuicidal operation. <i>T. ammonificans</i> and <i>C. bi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong></i> THI4s are thus candidate parts for rational redesign or directed evolution of efficient, nonsuicidal THI4s for use in crop improvement.</p>

Digital Imaging Combined with Genome-Wide Association Mapping Links Loci to Plant-Pathogen Interaction Traits
<p>Plant resistance to generalist pathogens with broad host ranges, such as <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> (<i>Botrytis</i>), is typically quantitative and highly polygenic. Recent studies have begun to elucidate the molecular genetic basis of plant-pathogen interactions using commonly measured traits, including lesion size and/or pathogen biomass. However, with the advent of digital imaging and high-throughput phenomics, there are a large number of additional traits available to study quantitative resistance. In this study, we used high-throughput digital imaging analysis to investigate previously poorly characterized visual traits of plant-pathogen interactions related to disease resistance using the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>)/<i>Botrytis</i> pathosystem. From a large collection of visual lesion trait measurements, we focused on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>, shape, and size to test how these aspects of the Arabidopsis/<i>Botrytis</i> interaction are genetically related. Through genome-wide association mapping in Arabidopsis, we show that lesion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong> and shape are genetically separable traits associated with plant disease resistance. Moreover, by employing defined mutants in 23 candidate genes identified from the genome-wide association mapping, we demonstrate links between loci and each of the different plant-pathogen interaction traits. These results expand our understanding of the functional mechanisms driving plant disease resistance.</p>

The Nitrate-Responsive Protein MdBT2 Regulates Anthocyanin Biosynthesis by Interacting with the MdMYB1 Transcription Factor
<p>In addition to scavenging reactive oxygen species, anthocyanins are pigments that give organs their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>. In apple (<i>Malus domestica</i>), R2R3-MYB transcription factor MdMYB1 is a master regulator of anthocyanin biosynthesis and fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation. In this study, we found that MdMYB1 was degraded via a ubiquitin-dependent pathway in response to nitrate, an inhibitor of anthocyanin synthesis. Using a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) approach, we found that the BTB-TAZ protein encoded by the nitrate-responsive gene <i>MdBT2</i> interacts with MdMYB1. Pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation assays supported this conclusion. In vivo and in vitro experiments revealed that MdBT2 promoted the ubiquitination and degradation of MdMYB1 through a cullin protein MdCUL3-independent pathway. Expression analysis demonstrated that MdBT2 and MdMYB1 were inversely regulated by nitrate and other environmental signals. Furthermore, we used transgenic approaches in apple and Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) to characterize the function of <i>MdBT2</i> in regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis in response to nitrate. Our findings provide insight into a mechanism involving the MdBT2-MdMYB1 pathway that regulates anthocyanin accumulation in apple and possibly in other plant species.</p>

Natural Variation Underlies Differences in ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR17 Activity in Fruit Peel Degreening
<p>Through natural or human selection, many fleshy fruits have evolved vivid external or internal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation, which often develops during ripening. Such developmental changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong> are associated with the biosynthesis of pigments as well as with degreening through chlorophyll degradation. Here, we demonstrated that natural variation in the coding region of the gene <i>ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR17</i> (<i>ERF17</i>) contributes to apple (<i>Malus domestica</i>) fruit peel degreening. Specifically, <i>ERF17</i> mutant alleles with different serine (Ser) repeat insertions in the coding region exhibited enhanced transcriptional regulation activity in a dual-luciferase reporter assay when more Ser repeats were present. Notably, surface plasmon resonance analysis showed that the number of Ser repeats affected the binding activity of ERF17 to the promoter sequences of chlorophyll degradation-related genes. In addition, overexpression of <i>ERF17</i> in evergreen apples altered the accumulation of chlorophyll. Furthermore, we demonstrated that <i>ERF17</i> has been under selection since the origin of apple tree cultivation. Taken together, these results reveal allelic variation underlying an important fruit quality trait and a molecular genetic mechanism associated with apple domestication.</p>

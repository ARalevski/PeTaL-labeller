Oligomerization of MrgC11 and μ-opioid receptors in sensory neurons enhances morphine analgesia
<p>The μ-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist morphine is commonly used for pain management, but it has severe adverse effects and produces analgesic tolerance. Thus, alternative ways of stimulating MOR activity are needed. We found that MrgC11, a sensory neuron–specific G protein–coupled receptor, may form heteromeric complexes with MOR. Peptide-mediated activation of MrgC11 enhanced MOR recycling by inducing coendocytosis and sorting of MOR for membrane reinsertion. MrgC11 activation also inhibited the coupling of MOR to β-arrestin-2 and enhanced the morphine-dependent inhibition of cAMP production. Intrathecal coadministration of a low dose of an MrgC agonist potentiated acute morphine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analgesia</span></strong> and reduced chronic morphine tolerance in wild-type mice but not in <i>Mrg</i>-cluster knockout (Mrg KO) mice. BAM22, a bivalent agonist of MrgC and opioid receptors, enhanced the interaction between MrgC11 and MOR and produced stronger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analgesia</span></strong> than did the individual monovalent agonists. Morphine-induced neuronal and pain inhibition was reduced in Mrg KO mice compared to that in wild-type mice. Our results uncover MrgC11-MOR interactions that lead to positive functional modulation of MOR. MrgC shares genetic homogeneity and functional similarity with human MrgX1. Thus, harnessing this positive modulation of MOR function by Mrg signaling may enhance morphine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analgesia</span></strong> in a sensory neuron–specific fashion to limit central side effects.</p>

The transcription factor C/EBPβ in the dorsal root ganglion contributes to peripheral nerve trauma–induced nociceptive hypersensitivity
<p>Changes in gene transcription in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) after nerve trauma contribute to the genesis of neuropathic pain. We report that peripheral nerve trauma caused by chronic constriction injury (CCI) increased the abundance of the transcription factor C/EBPβ (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β) in the DRG. Blocking this increase mitigated the development and maintenance of CCI-induced mechanical, thermal, and cold pain hypersensitivities without affecting basal responses to acute pain and locomotor activity. Conversely, mimicking this increase produced hypersensitivity to mechanical, thermal, or cold pain. In the ipsilateral DRG, C/EBPβ promoted a decrease in the abundance of the voltage-gated potassium channel subunit Kv1.2 and μ opioid receptor (MOR) at the mRNA and protein levels, which would be predicted to increase excitability in the ipsilateral DRG neurons and reduce the efficacy of morphine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analgesia</span></strong>. These effects required C/EPBβ-mediated transcriptional activation of <i>Ehmt2</i> (euchromatic histone-lysine <i>N</i>-methyltransferase 2), which encodes G9a, an epigenetic silencer of the genes encoding Kv1.2 and MOR. Blocking the increase in C/EBPβ in the DRG improved morphine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analgesia</span></strong> after CCI. These results suggest that C/EBPβ is an endogenous initiator of neuropathic pain and could be a potential target for the prevention and treatment of this disorder.</p>

Multimodal infiltration of local anaesthetic in total knee arthroplasty; is posterior capsular infiltration worth the risk?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Multimodal infiltration of local anaesthetic provides effective   control of pain in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA).   There is little information about the added benefits of posterior   capsular infiltration (PCI) using different combinations of local   anaesthetic agents. Our aim was to investigate the effectiveness   of the control of pain using multimodal infiltration with and without   infiltration of the posterior capsule of the knee.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>In a double-blind, randomised controlled trial of patients scheduled   for unilateral primary TKA, 86 were assigned to be treated with   multimodal infiltration with (Group I) or without (Group II) PCI.   Routine associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analgesia</span></strong> included the use of bupivacaine, morphine,   ketorolac and epinephrine. All patients had spinal anaesthesia and patient-controlled   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analgesia</span></strong> (PCA) post-operatively. A visual analogue scale (VAS)   for pain and the use of morphine were recorded 24 hours post-operatively.

TRPV1 promotes opioid analgesia during inflammation
<p>Pain and inflammation are inherently linked responses to injury, infection, or chronic diseases. Given that acute inflammation in humans or mice enhances the analgesic properties of opioids, there is much interest in determining the inflammatory transducers that prime opioid receptor signaling in primary afferent nociceptors. Here, we found that activation of the transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) channel stimulated a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway that was accompanied by the shuttling of the scaffold protein β-arrestin2 to the nucleus. The nuclear translocation of β-arrestin2 in turn prevented its recruitment to the μ-opioid receptor (MOR), the subsequent internalization of agonist-bound MOR, and the suppression of MOR activity that occurs upon receptor desensitization. Using the complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) inflammatory pain model to examine the role of TRPV1 in regulating endogenous opioid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analgesia</span></strong> in mice, we found that naloxone methiodide (Nal-M), a peripherally restricted, nonselective, and competitive opioid receptor antagonist, slowed the recovery from CFA-induced hypersensitivity in wild-type, but not TRPV1-deficient, mice. Furthermore, we showed that inflammation prolonged morphine-induced antinociception in a mouse model of opioid receptor desensitization, a process that depended on TRPV1. Together, our data reveal a TRPV1-mediated signaling pathway that serves as an endogenous pain-resolution mechanism by promoting the nuclear translocation of β-arrestin2 to minimize MOR desensitization. This previously uncharacterized mechanism may underlie the peripheral opioid control of inflammatory pain. Dysregulation of the TRPV1–β-arrestin2 axis may thus contribute to the transition from acute to chronic pain.</p>

Synergistic regulation of serotonin and opioid signaling contributes to pain insensitivity in Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 knockout mice
<p>Genetic loss of the voltage-gated sodium channel Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 (Na<sub>v</sub>1.7<sup>−/−</sup>) results in lifelong insensitivity to pain in mice and humans. One underlying cause is an increase in the production of endogenous opioids in sensory neurons. We analyzed whether Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 deficiency altered nociceptive heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide–binding protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, such as initiated by GPCRs that respond to serotonin (pronociceptive) or opioids (antinociceptive), in sensory neurons. We found that the nociceptive neurons of Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 knockout (Na<sub>v</sub>1.7<sup>−/−</sup>) mice, but not those of Na<sub>v</sub>1.8 knockout (Na<sub>v</sub>1.8<sup>−/−</sup>) mice, exhibited decreased pronociceptive serotonergic signaling through the 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptors, which are Gα<sub>s</sub>-coupled GPCRs that stimulate the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate resulting in protein kinase A (PKA) activity, as well as reduced abundance of the RIIβ regulatory subunit of PKA. Simultaneously, the efficacy of antinociceptive opioid signaling mediated by the Gα<sub>i</sub>-coupled mu opioid receptors was increased. Consequently, opioids inhibited more efficiently tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium currents, which are important for pain-initiating neuronal activity in nociceptive neurons. Thus, Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 controls the efficacy and balance of GPCR-mediated pro- and antinociceptive intracellular signaling, such that without Na<sub>v</sub>1.7, the balance is shifted toward antinociception, resulting in lifelong endogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analgesia</span></strong>.</p>

A nontoxic pain killer designed by modeling of pathological receptor conformations
<p>Indiscriminate activation of opioid receptors provides pain relief but also severe central and intestinal side effects. We hypothesized that exploiting pathological (rather than physiological) conformation dynamics of opioid receptor-ligand interactions might yield ligands without adverse actions. By computer simulations at low pH, a hallmark of injured tissue, we designed an agonist that, because of its low acid dissociation constant, selectively activates peripheral μ-opioid receptors at the source of pain generation. Unlike the conventional opioid fentanyl, this agonist showed pH-sensitive binding, heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide–binding protein (G protein) subunit dissociation by fluorescence resonance energy transfer, and adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate inhibition in vitro<i>.</i> It produced injury-restricted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analgesia</span></strong> in rats with different types of inflammatory pain without exhibiting respiratory depression, sedation, constipation, or addiction potential.</p>

Cost-effective peri-operative pain management
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to determine the optimal regimen for   the management of pain following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) by   comparing the outcomes and cost-effectiveness of different protocols   implemented at a large, urban, academic medical centre.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between September 2013 and September 2015, we used a series of   modifications to our standard regimen for the management of pain   after TKA. In May 2014, there was a department-wide transition from   protocols focused on femoral nerve blocks (FNB) to periarticular   injections of liposomal bupivacaine. In February 2015, patient-controlled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analgesia</span></strong>   (PCA) was removed from the protocol while continuing liposomal bupivacaine   injections.

Impact craters on Pluto and Charon indicate a deficit of small Kuiper belt objects
<p>The flyby of Pluto and Charon by the New Horizons spacecraft provided high-resolution images of cratered surfaces embedded in the Kuiper belt, an extensive region of bodies orbiting beyond Neptune. Impact craters on Pluto and Charon were formed by collisions with other Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) with diameters from ~40 kilometers to ~300 meters, smaller than most KBOs observed directly by telescopes. We find a relative paucity of small craters ≲13 kilometers in diameter, which cannot be explained solely by geological resurfacing. This implies a deficit of small KBOs (≲1 to 2 kilometers in diameter). Some surfaces on Pluto and Charon are likely ≳4 billion years old, thus their crater records provide information on the size-frequency distribution of KBOs in the early Solar System.</p>

A loud quasi-periodic oscillation after a star is disrupted by a massive black hole
<p>The tidal forces close to massive black holes can rip apart stars that come too close to them. As the resulting stellar debris spirals toward the black hole, the debris heats up and emits x-rays. We report observations of a stable 131-second x-ray quasi-periodic oscillation from the tidal disruption event ASASSN-14li. Assuming the black hole mass indicated by host galaxy scaling relations, these observations imply that the periodicity originates from close to the event <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">horizon</span></strong> and that the black hole is rapidly spinning. Our findings demonstrate that tidal disruption events can generate quasi-periodic oscillations that encode information about the physical properties of their black holes.</p>

Assessment of methane emissions from the U.S. oil and gas supply chain
<p>Methane emissions from the U.S. oil and natural gas supply chain were estimated by using ground-based, facility-scale measurements and validated with aircraft observations in areas accounting for ~30% of U.S. gas production. When scaled up nationally, our facility-based estimate of 2015 supply chain emissions is 13 ± 2 teragrams per year, equivalent to 2.3% of gross U.S. gas production. This value is ~60% higher than the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency inventory estimate, likely because existing inventory methods miss emissions released during abnormal operating conditions. Methane emissions of this magnitude, per unit of natural gas consumed, produce radiative forcing over a 20-year time <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">horizon</span></strong> comparable to the CO<sub>2</sub> from natural gas combustion. Substantial emission reductions are feasible through rapid detection of the root causes of high emissions and deployment of less failure-prone systems.</p>

Dunes on Pluto
<p>The surface of Pluto is more geologically diverse and dynamic than had been expected, but the role of its tenuous atmosphere in shaping the landscape remains unclear. We describe observations from the New Horizons spacecraft of regularly spaced, linear ridges whose morphology, distribution, and orientation are consistent with being transverse dunes. These are located close to mountainous regions and are orthogonal to nearby wind streaks. We demonstrate that the wavelength of the dunes (~0.4 to 1 kilometer) is best explained by the deposition of sand-sized (~200 to ~300 micrometer) particles of methane ice in moderate winds (<10 meters per second). The undisturbed morphology of the dunes, and relationships with the underlying convective glacial ice, imply that the dunes have formed in the very recent geological past.</p>

Cost effectiveness of patellofemoral <i>versus</i> total knee arthroplasty in younger patients
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Patellofemoral arthroplasty (PFA) has experienced significant   improvements in implant survivorship with second generation designs.   This has renewed interest in PFA as an alternative to total knee   arthroplasty (TKA) for younger active patients with isolated patellofemoral   osteoarthritis (PF OA). We analysed the cost-effectiveness of PFA <i>versus</i> TKA   for the management of isolated PF OA in the United States-based   population.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We used a Markov transition state model to compare cost-effectiveness   between PFA and TKA. Simulated patients were aged 60 (base case)   and 50 years. Lifetime costs (2015 United States dollars), quality-adjusted   life year (QALY) gains and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio   (ICER) were calculated from a healthcare payer perspective. Annual rates   of revision were derived from the National Joint Registry for England,   Wales, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man. Deterministic and probabilistic   sensitivity analysis was performed for all parameters against a   $50 000/QALY willingness to pay. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>PFA was more expensive ($49 811 <i>versus</i> $46 632)   but more effective (14.3 QALYs <i>versus</i> 13.3 QALYs)   over a lifetime <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">horizon</span></strong>. The ICER associated with the additional   effectiveness of PFA was $3097. The model was mainly sensitive to utility   values, with PFA remaining cost-effective when its utility exceeded   that of TKA by at least 1.0%. PFA provided incremental benefits   at no increased cost when annual rates of revision decreased by   24.5%. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Recent improvements in rates of implant of survival have made   PFA an economically beneficial joint-preserving procedure in younger   patients, delaying TKA until implant failure or tibiofemoral OA   progression. The present study quantified the minimum required marginal   benefit for PFA to be cost-effective compared with TKA and identified survivorship   targets for PFA to become both less expensive and more effective.   These benchmarks might be used to assess clinical outcomes of PFA   from an economic standpoint within the United States healthcare   system.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1028–36.</p></sec>

Evaluating the Impact and Cost-Effectiveness of Statin Use Guidelines for Primary Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease and Stroke
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Statins are effective in the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guideline expands recommended statin use, but its cost-effectiveness has not been compared with other guidelines.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used the Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the ACC/AHA guideline relative to current use, Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines, and universal statin use in all men 45 to 74 years of age and women 55 to 74 years of age over a 10-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">horizon</span></strong> from 2016 to 2025. Sensitivity analyses varied costs, risks, and benefits. Main outcomes were incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and numbers needed to treat for 10 years per quality-adjusted life-year gained.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Each approach produces substantial benefits and net cost savings relative to the status quo. Full adherence to the Adult Treatment Panel III guideline would result in 8.8 million more statin users than the status quo, at a number needed to treat for 10 years per quality-adjusted life-year gained of 35. The ACC/AHA guideline would potentially result in up to 12.3 million more statin users than the Adult Treatment Panel III guideline, with a marginal number needed to treat for 10 years per quality-adjusted life-year gained of 68. Moderate-intensity statin use in all men 45 to 74 years of age and women 55 to 74 years of age would result in 28.9 million more statin users than the ACC/AHA guideline, with a marginal number needed to treat for 10 years per quality-adjusted life-year gained of 108. In all cases, benefits would be greater in men than women. Results vary moderately with different risk thresholds for instituting statins and statin toxicity estimates but depend greatly on the disutility caused by daily medication use (pill burden).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>At a population level, the ACC/AHA guideline for expanded statin use for primary prevention is projected to treat more people, to save more lives, and to cost less compared with Adult Treatment Panel III in both men and women. Whether individuals benefit from long-term statin use for primary prevention depends more on the disutility associated with pill burden than their degree of cardiovascular risk.</p></sec>

An Evidence-Based Medicine Approach to Antihyperglycemic Therapy in Diabetes Mellitus to Overcome Overtreatment
<p>Overtreatment is pervasive in medicine and leads to potential patient harms and excessive costs in health care. Although evidence-based medicine is often derided as practice by rote algorithmic medicine, the appropriate application of key evidence-based medicine principles in clinical decision making is fundamental to preventing overtreatment and promoting high-value, individualized patient-centered care. Specifically, this article discusses the importance of (1) using absolute rather than relative estimates of benefits to inform treatment decisions; (2) considering the time <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">horizon</span></strong> to benefit of treatments; (3) balancing potential harms and benefits; and (4) using shared decision making by physicians to incorporate the patient’s values and preferences into treatment decisions. Here, we illustrate the application of these principles to considering the decision of whether or not to recommend intensive glycemic control to patients to minimize microvascular and cardiovascular complications in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Through this lens, this example will illustrate how an evidence-based medicine approach can be used to individualize glycemic goals and prevent overtreatment, and can serve as a template for applying evidence-based medicine to inform treatment decisions for other conditions to optimize health and individualize patient care.</p>

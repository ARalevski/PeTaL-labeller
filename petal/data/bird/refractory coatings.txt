Mid-term results of the BIOLOX delta ceramic-on-ceramic total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We conducted a prospective study of a delta <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic total hip   arthroplasty (THA) to determine the rate of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic fracture, to   characterise post-operative noise, and to evaluate the mid-term   results and survivorship.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between March 2009 and March 2011, 274 patients (310 hips) underwent   cementless THA using a delta <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic femoral head and liner.

A Kaplan-Meier analysis was undertaken to estimate survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Four patients (four hips) died and 18 patients (20 hips) were   lost to follow-up within five years. The remaining 252 patients   (286 hips) were followed for a mean of 66.5 months (60 to 84). There   were 144 men (166 hips) and 108 women (120 hips) with a mean age   of 49.7 years (16 to 83) at surgery. The mean pre-operative Harris   Hip Score of 47.1 points improved to 93.8 points at final follow-up.   Six patients reported squeaking in seven hips; however, none were   audible. Radiolucent lines involving Gruen zones one and/or seven   were seen in 52 hips (18.2%). No hip had detectable wear, focal   osteolysis or signs of loosening. One hip was revised because of   fracture of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic liner, which occurred due to an undetected   malseating of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic liner at the time of surgery. One hip   was revised for a periprosthetic fracture of the femur, and one   hip was treated for periprosthetic joint infection.

Ceramic-on-ceramic bearing fractures in total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic-on-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic (CoC) bearings in total hip arthroplasty (THA)   are commonly used, but concerns exist regarding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic fracture.   This study aims to report the risk of revision for fracture of modern   CoC bearings and identify factors that might influence this risk,   using data from the National Joint Registry (NJR) for England, Wales, Northern   Ireland and the Isle of Man.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We analysed data on 223 362 bearings from 111 681 primary CoC   THAs and 182 linked revisions for bearing fracture recorded in the   NJR. We used implant codes to identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic bearing composition   and generated Kaplan-Meier estimates for implant survivorship. Logistic   regression analyses were performed for implant size and patient specific   variables to determine any associated risks for revision.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 222 852 bearings (99.8%) were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>Tec Biolox products.   Revisions for fracture were linked to seven of 79 442 (0.009%) Biolox   Delta heads, 38 of 31 982 (0.119%) Biolox Forte heads, 101 of 80   170 (0.126%) Biolox Delta liners and 35 of 31 258 (0.112%) Biolox   Forte liners. Regression analysis of implant size revealed smaller   heads had significantly higher odds of fracture (chi-squared 68.0,   p < 0.001). The highest fracture risk was observed in the 28 mm   Biolox Forte subgroup (0.382%). There were no fractures in the 40   mm head group for either <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic type. Liner thickness was not predictive   of fracture (p = 0.67). Body mass index (BMI) was independently   associated with revision for both head fractures (odds ratio (OR)   1.09 per unit increase, p = 0.031) and liner fractures (OR 1.06   per unit increase, p = 0.006). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We report the largest independent study of CoC bearing fractures   to date. The risk of revision for CoC bearing fracture is very low   but previous studies have underestimated this risk.

A molecular perovskite solid solution with piezoelectricity stronger than lead zirconate titanate
<p>Piezoelectric materials produce electricity when strained, making them ideal for different types of sensing applications. The most effective piezoelectric materials are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic solid solutions in which the piezoelectric effect is optimized at what are termed morphotropic phase boundaries (MPBs). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ics are not ideal for a variety of applications owing to some of their mechanical properties. We synthesized piezoelectric materials from a molecular perovskite (TMFM)<i><sub>x</sub></i>(TMCM)<sub>1–</sub><i><sub>x</sub></i>CdCl<sub>3</sub> solid solution (TMFM, trimethylfluoromethyl ammonium; TMCM, trimethylchloromethyl ammonium, 0 ≤ <i>x</i> ≤ 1), in which the MPB exists between monoclinic and hexagonal phases. We found a composition for which the piezoelectric coefficient <i>d</i><sub>33</sub> is ~1540 picocoulombs per newton, comparable to high-performance piezoelectric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ics. The material has potential applications for wearable piezoelectric devices.</p>

The evolution of an uncemented acetabular component in alumina-on-alumina total hip arthroplasty has improved clinical outcome
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To determine the effect of a change in design of a cementless   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic acetabular component in fixation and clinical outcome after   total hip arthroplasty</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We compared 342 hips (302 patients) operated between 1999 and   2005 with a relatively smooth hydroxyapatite coated acetabular component   (group 1), and 337 hips (310 patients) operated between 2006 and   2011 using a similar acetabular component with a macrotexture on   the entire outer surface of the component (group 2). The mean age of   the patients was 53.5 (14 to 70) in group 1 and 53.0 (15 to 70)   in group 2.

Antiarrhythmic Drugs for Nonshockable-Turned-Shockable Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) commonly presents with nonshockable rhythms (asystole and pulseless electric activity). It is unknown whether antiarrhythmic drugs are safe and effective when nonshockable rhythms evolve to shockable rhythms (ventricular fibrillation/pulseless ventricular tachycardia [VF/VT]) during resuscitation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Adults with nontraumatic OHCA, vascular access, and VF/VT anytime after ≥1 shock(s) were prospectively randomized, double-blind, to receive amiodarone, lidocaine, or placebo by paramedics. Patients presenting with initial shock-refractory VF/VT were previously reported. The current study was a prespecified analysis in a separate cohort that initially presented with nonshockable OHCA and was randomized on subsequently developing shock-refractory VF/VT. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes included discharge functional status and adverse drug-related effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 37 889 patients with OHCA, 3026 with initial VF/VT and 1063 with initial nonshockable-turned-shockable rhythms were treatment-eligible, were randomized, and received their assigned drug. Baseline characteristics among patients with nonshockable-turned-shockable rhythms were balanced across treatment arms, except that recipients of a placebo included fewer men and were less likely to receive bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Active-drug recipients in this cohort required fewer shocks, supplemental doses of their assigned drug, and ancillary antiarrhythmic drugs than recipients of a placebo (<i>P</i><0.05). In all, 16 (4.1%) amiodarone, 11 (3.1%) lidocaine, and 6 (1.9%) placebo-treated patients survived to hospital discharge (<i>P</i>=0.24). No significant interaction between treatment assignment and discharge survival occurred with the initiating OHCA rhythm (asystole, pulseless electric activity, or VF/VT). Survival in each of these categories was consistently higher with active drugs, although the trends were not statistically significant. Adjusted absolute differences (95% confidence interval) in survival from nonshockable-turned-shockable arrhythmias with amiodarone versus placebo were 2.3% (−0.3, 4.8), <i>P</i>=0.08, and for lidocaine versus placebo 1.2% (−1.1, 3.6), <i>P</i>=0.30. More than 50% of these survivors were functionally independent or required minimal assistance. Drug-related adverse effects were infrequent.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Outcome from nonshockable-turned-shockable OHCA is poor but not invariably fatal. Although not statistically significant, point estimates for survival were greater after amiodarone or lidocaine than placebo, without increased risk of adverse effects or disability and consistent with previously observed favorable trends from treatment of initial shock-refractory VF/VT with these drugs. Together the findings may signal a clinical benefit that invites further investigation.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Double-negative-index ceramic aerogels for thermal superinsulation
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic aerogels are attractive for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thermal insul</span></strong>ation but plagued by poor mechanical stability and degradation under thermal shock. In this study, we designed and synthesized hyperbolic architectured <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic aerogels with nanolayered double-pane walls with a negative Poisson’s ratio (−0.25) and a negative linear thermal expansion coefficient (−1.8 × 10<sup>−6</sup> per °C). Our aerogels display robust mechanical and thermal stability and feature ultralow densities down to ~0.1 milligram per cubic centimeter, superelasticity up to 95%, and near-zero strength loss after sharp thermal shocks (275°C per second) or intense thermal stress at 1400°C, as well as ultralow thermal conductivity in vacuum [~2.4 milliwatts per meter-kelvin (mW/m·K)] and in air (~20 mW/m·K). This robust material system is ideal for thermal superinsulation under extreme conditions, such as those encountered by spacecraft.</p>

Which factors influence the rate of failure following metal-on-metal hip arthroplasty revision surgery performed for adverse reactions to metal debris?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To determine the outcomes following revision surgery of metal-on-metal   hip arthroplasties (MoMHA) performed for adverse reactions to metal   debris (ARMD), and to identify factors predictive of re-revision.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We performed a retrospective observational study using National   Joint Registry (NJR) data on 2535 MoMHAs undergoing revision surgery   for ARMD between 2008 and 2014. The outcomes studied following revision were   intra-operative complications, mortality and re-revision surgery.   Predictors of re-revision were identified using competing-risk regression   modelling.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Intra-operative complications occurred in 40 revisions (1.6%).   The cumulative five-year patient survival rate was 95.9% (95% confidence   intervals (CI) 92.3 to 97.8). Re-revision surgery was performed   in 192 hips (7.6%). The cumulative five-year implant survival rate   was 89.5% (95% CI 87.3 to 91.3). Predictors of re-revision were   high body mass index at revision (subhazard ratio (SHR) 1.06 per   kg/m<sup>2 </sup>increase, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.09), modular component   only revisions (head and liner with or without taper adapter; SHR   2.01, 95% CI 1.19 to 3.38), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic-on-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic revision bearings   (SHR 1.86, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.80), and acetabular bone grafting (SHR   2.10, 95% CI 1.43 to 3.07).

Ten-year follow-up study of three alternative bearing surfaces used in total hip arthroplasty in young patients
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We present the ten-year data of a cohort of patients, aged between   18 and 65 years (mean age 52.7 years; 19 to 64), who underwent total   hip arthroplasty. Patients were randomised to be treated with a   cobalt-chrome (CoCr) femoral head with an ultra-high molecular weight   polyethylene (UHMWPE), highly cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) or   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic-on-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic (CoC) bearing surface.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 102 hips (91 patients) were randomised into the three   groups. At ten years, 97 hips were available for radiological and   functional follow-up. Two hips (two patients) had been revised (one   with deep infection and one for periprosthetic fracture) and three   were lost to follow-up. Radiological analysis was performed using   a validated digital assessment programme to give linear, directional   and volumetric wear of the two polyethylene groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was a significantly reduced rate of steady-state linear   wear with XLPE (0.07 mm/yr) compared with UHMWPE (0.37 mm/yr) (p   = 0.001). Volumetric wear was also significantly reduced in the   XLPE group (29.29 mm<sup>3</sup>/yr) compared with the UHMWPE group   (100.75mm<sup>3</sup>/yr) (p = 0.0001). There were six patients   with UHMWPE who had non-progressive osteolysis and none in the XLPE   group. All three bearing groups had significant improvements in   12-item short form health survey scores, Western Ontario and McMaster   Universities Osteoarthritis Index score and Harris Hip Score. However,   the improvement in HSS was significantly less in the UHMWPE group   (p = 0.0188) than in the other two groups.</p><p>At ten years, the rates of volumetric and linear wear in the   XLPE group remain low and predominantly below the estimated threshold   for osteolysis (1 mm/yr). The rate of linear wear in the XLPE group   was three times less than in the UHMWPE group at five-year follow-up   and five times less at ten years. The rate of volumetric wear was also   three times less in the XLPE group at ten years.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>While CoC also performs well, XLPE at ten years remains a safe   and excellent bearing option in young patients, with low rates of   wear and no evidence of osteolysis.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1590–5.</p></sec>

NF-κB signaling dynamics is controlled by a dose-sensing autoregulatory loop
<p>Over the last decade, multiple studies have shown that signaling proteins activated in different temporal patterns, such as oscillatory, transient, and sustained, can result in distinct gene expression patterns or cell fates. However, the molecular events that ensure appropriate stimulus- and dose-dependent dynamics are not often understood and are difficult to investigate. Here, we used single-cell analysis to dissect the mechanisms underlying the stimulus- and dose-encoding patterns in the innate immune signaling network. We found that Toll-like receptor (TLR) and interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling dynamics relied on a dose-dependent, autoinhibitory loop that rendered cells refractory to further stimulation. Using inducible gene expression and optogenetics to perturb the network at different levels, we identified IL-1R–associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) as the dose-sensing node responsible for limiting signal flow during the innate immune response. Although the kinase activity of IRAK1 was not required for signal propagation, it played a critical role in inhibiting the nucleocytoplasmic oscillations of the transcription factor NF-κB. Thus, protein activities that may be “dispensable” from a topological perspective can nevertheless be essential in shaping the dynamic response to the external environment.</p>

Phosphoproteomic analysis of chimeric antigen receptor signaling reveals kinetic and quantitative differences that affect cell function
<p>Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) link an antigen recognition domain to intracellular signaling domains to redirect T cell specificity and function. T cells expressing CARs with CD28/CD3ζ or 4-1BB/CD3ζ signaling domains are effective at treating refractory B cell malignancies but exhibit differences in effector function, clinical efficacy, and toxicity that are assumed to result from the activation of divergent signaling cascades. We analyzed stimulation-induced phosphorylation events in primary human CD8<sup>+</sup> CD28/CD3ζ and 4-1BB/CD3ζ CAR T cells by mass spectrometry and found that both CAR constructs activated similar signaling intermediates. Stimulation of CD28/CD3ζ CARs activated faster and larger-magnitude changes in protein phosphorylation, which correlated with an effector T cell–like phenotype and function. In contrast, 4-1BB/CD3ζ CAR T cells preferentially expressed T cell memory–associated genes and exhibited sustained antitumor activity against established tumors in vivo. Mutagenesis of the CAR CD28 signaling domain demonstrated that the increased CD28/CD3ζ CAR signal intensity was partly related to constitutive association of Lck with this domain in CAR complexes. Our data show that CAR signaling pathways cannot be predicted solely by the domains used to construct the receptor and that signal strength is a key determinant of T cell fate. Thus, tailoring CAR design based on signal strength may lead to improved clinical efficacy and reduced toxicity.</p>

A systems approach for discovering linoleic acid derivatives that potentially mediate pain and itch
<p>Chronic pain and itch are common hypersensitivity syndromes that are affected by endogenous mediators. We applied a systems-based, translational approach to predict, discover, and characterize mediators of pain and itch that are regulated by diet and inflammation. Profiling of tissue-specific precursor abundance and biosynthetic gene expression predicted that inflamed skin would be abundant in four previously unknown 11-hydroxy-epoxy- or 11-keto-epoxy-octadecenoate linoleic acid derivatives and four previously identified 9- or 13-hydroxy-epoxy- or 9- or 13-keto-epoxy-octadecenoate linoleic acid derivatives. All of these mediators were confirmed to be abundant in rat and human skin by mass spectrometry. However, only the two 11-hydroxy-epoxy-octadecenoates sensitized rat dorsal root ganglion neurons to release more calcitonin gene–related peptide (CGRP), which is involved in pain transmission, in response to low pH (which mimics an inflammatory state) or capsaicin (which activates ion channels involved in nociception). The two 11-hydroxy-epoxy-octadecenoates share a 3-hydroxy-<i>Z</i>-pentenyl-<i>E</i>-epoxide moiety, thus suggesting that this substructure could mediate nociceptor sensitization. In rats, intradermal hind paw injection of 11-hydroxy-12,13-<i>trans</i>-epoxy-(9<i>Z</i>)-octadecenoate elicited C-fiber–mediated sensitivity to thermal pain. In a randomized trial testing adjunctive strategies to manage refractory chronic headaches, reducing the dietary intake of linoleic acid was associated with decreases in plasma 11-hydroxy-12,13-<i>trans</i>-epoxy-(9<i>Z</i>)-octadecenoate, which correlated with clinical pain reduction. Human psoriatic skin had 30-fold higher 9-keto-12,13-<i>trans</i>-epoxy-(10<i>E</i>)-octadecenoate compared to control skin, and intradermal injection of this compound induced itch-related scratching behavior in mice. Collectively, these findings define a family of endogenous mediators with potential roles in pain and itch.</p>

Genetic diversity of tumors with mismatch repair deficiency influences anti–PD-1 immunotherapy response
<p>Tumors with mismatch repair deficiency (MMR-d) are characterized by sequence alterations in microsatellites and can accumulate thousands of mutations. This high mutational burden renders tumors immunogenic and sensitive to programmed cell death–1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitors. Yet, despite their tumor immunogenicity, patients with MMR-deficient tumors experience highly variable responses, and roughly half are refractory to treatment. We present experimental and clinical evidence showing that the degree of microsatellite instability (MSI) and resultant mutational load, in part, underlies the variable response to PD-1 blockade immunotherapy in MMR-d human and mouse tumors. The extent of response is particularly associated with the accumulation of insertion-deletion (indel) mutational load. This study provides a rationale for the genome-wide characterization of MSI intensity and mutational load to better profile responses to anti–PD-1 immunotherapy across MMR-deficient human cancers.</p>

A method for single-neuron chronic recording from the retina in awake mice
<p>The retina, which processes visual information and sends it to the brain, is an excellent model for studying neural circuitry. It has been probed extensively ex vivo but has been refractory to chronic in vivo electrophysiology. We report a nonsurgical method to achieve chronically stable in vivo recordings from single retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in awake mice. We developed a noncoaxial intravitreal injection scheme in which injected mesh electronics unrolls inside the eye and conformally coats the highly curved retina without compromising normal eye functions. The method allows 16-channel recordings from multiple types of RGCs with stable responses to visual stimuli for at least 2 weeks, and reveals circadian rhythms in RGC responses over multiple day/night cycles.</p>

Chiromagnetic nanoparticles and gels
<p>Chiral inorganic nanostructures have high circular dichroism, but real-time control of their optical activity has so far been achieved only by irreversible chemical changes. Field modulation is a far more desirable path to chiroptical devices. We hypothesized that magnetic field modulation can be attained for chiral nanostructures with large contributions of the magnetic transition dipole moments to polarization rotation. We found that dispersions and gels of paramagnetic Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles with chiral distortions of the crystal lattices exhibited chiroptical activity in the visible range that was 10 times as strong as that of nonparamagnetic nanoparticles of comparable size. Transparency of the nanoparticle gels to circularly polarized light beams in the ultraviolet range was reversibly modulated by magnetic fields. These phenomena were also observed for other nanoscale metal oxides with lattice distortions from imprinted amino acids and other chiral ligands. The large family of chiral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic nanostructures and gels can be pivotal for new technologies and knowledge at the nexus of chirality and magnetism.</p>

Transferrin receptor 1 is a reticulocyte-specific receptor for <i>Plasmodium vivax</i>
<p><i>Plasmodium vivax</i> shows a strict host tropism for reticulocytes. We identified transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) as the receptor for <i>P. vivax</i> reticulocyte-binding protein 2b (PvRBP2b). We determined the structure of the N-terminal domain of PvRBP2b involved in red blood cell binding, elucidating the molecular basis for TfR1 recognition. We validated TfR1 as the biological target of PvRBP2b engagement by means of TfR1 expression knockdown analysis. TfR1 mutant cells deficient in PvRBP2b binding were refractory to invasion of <i>P. vivax</i> but not to invasion of <i>P. falciparum</i>. Using Brazilian and Thai clinical isolates, we show that PvRBP2b monoclonal antibodies that inhibit reticulocyte binding also block <i>P. vivax</i> entry into reticulocytes. These data show that TfR1-PvRBP2b invasion pathway is critical for the recognition of reticulocytes during <i>P. vivax</i> invasion.</p>

Cryo-EM structures and atomic model of the HIV-1 strand transfer complex intasome
<p>Like all retroviruses, HIV-1 irreversibly inserts a viral DNA (vDNA) copy of its RNA genome into host target DNA (tDNA). The intasome, a higher-order nucleoprotein complex composed of viral integrase (IN) and the ends of linear vDNA, mediates integration. Productive integration into host chromatin results in the formation of the strand transfer complex (STC) containing catalytically joined vDNA and tDNA. HIV-1 intasomes have been refractory to high-resolution structural studies. We used a soluble IN fusion protein to facilitate structural studies, through which we present a high-resolution cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the core tetrameric HIV-1 STC and a higher-order form that adopts carboxyl-terminal domain rearrangements. The distinct STC structures highlight how HIV-1 can use the common retroviral intasome core architecture to accommodate different IN domain modules for assembly.</p>

Hemocompatibility-Related Outcomes in the MOMENTUM 3 Trial at 6 Months
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The HeartMate 3 (HM3) Left Ventricular Assist System (LVAS) (Abbott) is a centrifugal, fully magnetically levitated, continuous-flow blood pump engineered to enhance hemocompatibility and reduce shear stress on blood components. The MOMENTUM 3 trial (Multicenter Study of MagLev Technology in Patients Undergoing Mechanical Circulatory Support Therapy With HeartMate 3) compares the HM3 LVAS with the HeartMate II (HMII) LVAS (Abbott) in advanced heart failure refractory to medical management, irrespective of therapeutic intention (bridge to transplant versus destination therapy). This investigation reported its primary outcome in the short-term cohort (n=294; 6-month follow-up), demonstrating superiority of the HM3 for the trial primary end point (survival free of a disabling stroke or reoperation to replace the pump for malfunction), driven by a reduced need for reoperations. The aim of this analysis was to evaluate the aggregate of hemocompatibility-related clinical adverse events (HRAEs) between the 2 LVAS.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a secondary end point evaluation of HRAE (survival free of any nonsurgical bleeding, thromboembolic event, pump thrombosis, or neurological event) in the short-term cohort (as-treated cohort n=289) at 6 months. The net burden of HRAE was also assessed by using a previously described hemocompatibility score, which uses 4 escalating tiers of hierarchal severity to derive a total score for events encountered during the entire follow-up experience for each patient.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In 289 patients in the as-treated group (151 the HM3 and 138 the HMII), survival free of any HRAE was achieved in 69% of the HM3 group and in 55% of the HMII group (hazard ratio, 0.62; confidence interval, 0.42–0.91; <i>P</i>=0.012). Using the hemocompatibility score, the HM3 group demonstrated less pump thrombosis requiring reoperation (0 versus 36 points, <i>P</i><0.001) or medically managed pump thrombosis (0 versus 5 points, <i>P</i>=0.02), and fewer nondisabling strokes (6 versus 24 points, <i>P</i>=0.026) than the control HMII LVAS. The net hemocompatibility score in the HM3 in comparison with the HMII patients was 101 (0.67±1.50 points/patient) versus 137 (0.99±1.79 points/patient) (odds ratio, 0.64; confidence interval, 0.39–1.03; <i>P</i>=0.065).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In this secondary analysis of the MOMENTUM 3 trial, the HM3 LVAS demonstrated greater freedom from HRAEs in comparison with the HMII LVAS at 6 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

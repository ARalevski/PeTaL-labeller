Reassessing the Roles of PIN Proteins and Anticlinal Microtubules during Pavement Cell Morphogenesis
<p>The leaf epidermis is a biomechanical shell that influences the size and shape of the organ. Its morphogenesis is a multiscale process in which nanometer-scale cytoskeletal protein complexes, individual cells, and groups of cells pattern growth and define macroscopic leaf traits. Interdigitated growth of neighboring cells is an evolutionarily conserved developmental strategy. Understanding how signaling pathways and cytoskeletal proteins pattern cell walls during this form of tissue morphogenesis is an important research challenge. The cellular and molecular control of a lobed cell morphology is currently thought to involve PIN-FORMED (PIN)-type plasma membrane efflux carriers that generate subcellular auxin gradients. Auxin gradients were proposed to function across cell boundaries to encode stable offset patterns of cortical microtubules and actin filaments between adjacent cells. Many models suggest that long-lived microtubules along the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anticlin</span></strong>al cell wall generate local cell wall heterogeneities that restrict local growth and specify the timing and location of lobe formation. Here, we used Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) reverse genetics and multivariate long-term time-lapse imaging to test current cell shape control models. We found that neither PIN proteins nor long-lived microtubules along the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anticlin</span></strong>al wall predict the patterns of lobe formation. In fields of lobing cells, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anticlin</span></strong>al microtubules are not correlated with cell shape and are unstable at the time scales of cell expansion. Our analyses indicate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anticlin</span></strong>al microtubules have multiple functions in pavement cells and that lobe initiation is likely controlled by complex interactions among cell geometry, cell wall stress patterns, and transient microtubule networks that span the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anticlin</span></strong>al and periclinal walls.</p>

Paleo-Drainage Basin Connectivity Predicts Evolutionary Relationships across Three Southeast Asian Biodiversity Hotspots
<p>Understanding factors driving diversity across biodiversity hotspots is critical for formulating conservation priorities in the face of ongoing and escalating environmental deterioration. While biodiversity hotspots encompass a small fraction of Earth's land surface, more than half the world's plants and two-thirds of terrestrial vertebrate species are endemic to these hotspots. Tropical Southeast (SE) Asia displays extraordinary species richness, encompassing four biodiversity hotspots, though disentangling multiple potential drivers of species richness is confounded by the region's dynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geolog</span></strong>ical and climatic history. Here, we use multilocus molecular genetic data from dense multispecies sampling of freshwater fishes across three biodiversity hotspots, to test the effect of Quaternary climate change and resulting drainage rearrangements on aquatic faunal diversification. While Cenozoic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geolog</span></strong>ical processes have clearly shaped evolutionary history in SE Asian halfbeak fishes, we show that paleo-drainage re-arrangements resulting from Quaternary climate change played a significant role in the spatiotemporal evolution of lowland aquatic taxa, and provide priorities for conservation efforts.

ANGUSTIFOLIA Regulates Actin Filament Alignment for Nuclear Positioning in Leaves
<p>During dark adaptation, plant nuclei move centripetally toward the midplane of the leaf blade; thus, the nuclei on both the adaxial and abaxial sides become positioned at the inner periclinal walls of cells. This centripetal nuclear positioning implies that a characteristic cell polarity exists within a leaf, but little is known about the mechanism underlying this process. Here, we show that ANGUSTIFOLIA (AN) and ACTIN7 regulate centripetal nuclear positioning in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves. Two mutants defective in the positioning of nuclei in the dark were isolated and designated as <i>unusual nuclear positioning1</i> (<i>unp1</i>) and <i>unp2</i>. In the dark, nuclei of <i>unp1</i> were positioned at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anticlin</span></strong>al walls of adaxial and abaxial mesophyll cells and abaxial pavement cells, whereas the nuclei of <i>unp2</i> were positioned at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anticlin</span></strong>al walls of mesophyll and pavement cells on both the adaxial and abaxial sides. <i>unp1</i> was caused by a dominant-negative mutation in <i>ACTIN7</i>, and <i>unp2</i> resulted from a recessive mutation in <i>AN</i>. Actin filaments in <i>unp1</i> were fragmented and reduced in number, which led to pleiotropic defects in nuclear morphology, cytoplasmic streaming, and plant growth. The mutation in <i>AN</i> caused aberrant positioning of nuclei-associated actin filaments at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anticlin</span></strong>al walls. AN was detected in the cytosol, where it interacted physically with plant-specific dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinases (DYRKPs) and itself. The DYRK inhibitor (1<i>Z</i>)-1-(3-ethyl-5-hydroxy-2(3<i>H</i>)-benzothiazolylidene)-2-propanone significantly inhibited dark-induced nuclear positioning. Collectively, these results suggest that the AN-DYRKP complex regulates the alignment of actin filaments during centripetal nuclear positioning in leaf cells.</p>

Hydraulic fracturing volume is associated with induced earthquake productivity in the Duvernay play
<p>A sharp increase in the frequency of earthquakes near Fox Creek, Alberta, began in December 2013 in response to hydraulic fracturing. Using a hydraulic fracturing database, we explore relationships between injection parameters and seismicity response. We show that induced earthquakes are associated with completions that used larger injection volumes (10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>5</sup> cubic meters) and that seismic productivity scales linearly with injection volume. Injection pressure and rate have an insignificant association with seismic response. Further findings suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geolog</span></strong>ical factors play a prominent role in seismic productivity, as evidenced by spatial correlations. Together, volume and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geolog</span></strong>ical factors account for ~96% of the variability in the induced earthquake rate near Fox Creek. This result is quantified by a seismogenic index–modified frequency-magnitude distribution, providing a framework to forecast induced seismicity.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Arabidopsis Leaf Flatness Is Regulated by PPD2 and NINJA through Repression of <i>CYCLIN D3</i> Genes
<p>In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), reduced expression of the transcriptional regulator <i>PEAPOD2</i> (<i>PPD2</i>) results in propeller-like rosettes with enlarged and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dome</span></strong>-shaped leaves. However, the molecular and cellular processes underlying this peculiar phenotype remain elusive. Here, we studied the interaction between PPD2 and NOVEL INTERACTOR OF JAZ (NINJA) and demonstrated that <i>ninja</i> loss-of-function plants produce rosettes with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dome</span></strong>-shaped leaves similar to those of <i>ppd</i> mutants but without the increase in size. We showed that <i>ninja</i> mutants have a convex-shaped primary cell cycle arrest front, putatively leading to excessive cell division in the central leaf blade region. Furthermore, <i>ppd</i> and <i>ninja</i> mutants have a similar increase in the expression of <i>CYCLIN D3;2</i> (<i>CYCD3;2</i>), and ectopic overexpression of <i>CYCD3;2</i> phenocopies the <i>ppd</i> and <i>ninja</i> rosette and leaf shape phenotypes without affecting the size. Our results reveal a pivotal contribution of NINJA in leaf development, in addition to its well-studied function in jasmonate signaling, and imply a new function for D3-type cyclins in, at least partially, uncoupling the size and shape phenotypes of <i>ppd</i> leaves.</p>

Root diameter variations explained by anatomy and phylogeny of 50 tropical and temperate tree species
<p>Root diameter, a critical indicator of root physiological function, varies greatly among tree species, but the underlying mechanism of this high variability is unclear. Here, we sampled 50 tree species across tropical and temperate zones in China, and measured root morphological and anatomical traits along the first five branch orders in each species. Our objectives were (i) to reveal the relationships between root diameter, cortical thickness and stele diameter among tree species in tropical and temperate forests, and (ii) to investigate the relationship of both root morphological and anatomical traits with divergence time during species radiation. The results showed that root diameter was strongly affected by cortical thickness but less by stele diameter in both tropical and temperate species. Changes in cortical thickness explained over 90% of variation in root diameter for the first order, and ∼74–87% for the second and third orders. Thicker roots displayed greater cortical thickness and more cortical cell layers than thinner roots. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that root diameter, cortical thickness and number of cortical cell layers significantly correlated with divergence time at the family level, showing similar variation trends in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geolog</span></strong>ical time. The results also suggested that trees tend to decrease their root cortical thickness rather than stele diameter during species radiation. The close linkage of variations in root morphology and anatomy to phylogeny as demonstrated by the data from the 50 tree species should provide some insights into the mechanism of root diameter variability among tree species.</p>

The surface composition of asteroid 162173 Ryugu from Hayabusa2 near-infrared spectroscopy
<p>The near-Earth asteroid 162173 Ryugu, the target of the Hayabusa2 sample-return mission, is thought to be a primitive carbonaceous object. We report reflectance spectra of Ryugu’s surface acquired with the Near-Infrared Spectrometer (NIRS3) on Hayabusa2, to provide direct measurements of the surface composition and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geolog</span></strong>ical context for the returned samples. A weak, narrow absorption feature centered at 2.72 micrometers was detected across the entire observed surface, indicating that hydroxyl (OH)–bearing minerals are ubiquitous there. The intensity of the OH feature and low albedo are similar to thermally and/or shock-metamorphosed carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. There are few variations in the OH-band position, which is consistent with Ryugu being a compositionally homogeneous rubble-pile object generated from impact fragments of an undifferentiated aqueously altered parent body.</p>

Impact craters on Pluto and Charon indicate a deficit of small Kuiper belt objects
<p>The flyby of Pluto and Charon by the New Horizons spacecraft provided high-resolution images of cratered surfaces embedded in the Kuiper belt, an extensive region of bodies orbiting beyond Neptune. Impact craters on Pluto and Charon were formed by collisions with other Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) with diameters from ~40 kilometers to ~300 meters, smaller than most KBOs observed directly by telescopes. We find a relative paucity of small craters ≲13 kilometers in diameter, which cannot be explained solely by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geolog</span></strong>ical resurfacing. This implies a deficit of small KBOs (≲1 to 2 kilometers in diameter). Some surfaces on Pluto and Charon are likely ≳4 billion years old, thus their crater records provide information on the size-frequency distribution of KBOs in the early Solar System.</p>

Temperature-dependent hypoxia explains biogeography and severity of end-Permian marine mass extinction
<p>Rapid climate change at the end of the Permian Period (~252 million years ago) is the hypothesized trigger for the largest mass extinction in Earth’s history. We present model simulations of the Permian/Triassic climate transition that reproduce the ocean warming and oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) loss indicated by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geolog</span></strong>ic record. The effect of these changes on animal survival is evaluated using the Metabolic Index (Φ), a measure of scope for aerobic activity governed by organismal traits sampled in diverse modern species. Modeled loss of aerobic habitat predicts lower extinction intensity in the tropics, a pattern confirmed with a spatially explicit analysis of the marine fossil record. The combined physiological stresses of ocean warming and O<sub>2</sub> loss can account for more than half the magnitude of the “Great Dying.”</p>

Ancient steroids establish the Ediacaran fossil <i>Dickinsonia</i> as one of the earliest animals

Ediacaran macrofossils are as “strange as life on another planet” and have evaded taxonomic classification, with interpretations ranging from marine animals or giant single-celled protists to terrestrial lichens. Here, we show that lipid biomarkers extracted from organically preserved Ediacaran macrofossils unambiguously clarify their phylogeny. <i>Dickinsonia</i> and its relatives solely produced cholesteroids, a hallmark of animals. Our results make these iconic members of the Ediacara biota the oldest confirmed macroscopic animals in the rock record, indicating that the appearance of the Ediacara biota was indeed a prelude to the Cambrian explosion of animal life.</p>

Large-scale ocean deoxygenation during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum
<p>The consequences of global warming for fisheries are not well understood, but the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geolog</span></strong>ical record demonstrates that carbon cycle perturbations are frequently associated with ocean deoxygenation. Of particular interest is the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), where the carbon dioxide input into the atmosphere was similar to the IPCC RCP8.5 emission scenario. Here we present sulfur-isotope data that record a positive 1 per mil excursion during the PETM. Modeling suggests that large parts of the ocean must have become sulfidic. The toxicity of hydrogen sulfide will render two of the largest and least explored ecosystems on Earth, the mesopelagic and bathypelagic zones, uninhabitable by multicellular organisms. This will affect many marine species whose ecozones stretch into the deep ocean.</p>

We describe observations from the New Horizons spacecraft of regularly spaced, linear ridges whose morphology, distribution, and orientation are consistent with being transverse dunes. These are located close to mountainous regions and are orthogonal to nearby wind streaks. We demonstrate that the wavelength of the dunes (~0.4 to 1 kilometer) is best explained by the deposition of sand-sized (~200 to ~300 micrometer) particles of methane ice in moderate winds (<10 meters per second). The undisturbed morphology of the dunes, and relationships with the underlying convective glacial ice, imply that the dunes have formed in the very recent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geolog</span></strong>ical past.</p>

Rapid sea level rise in the aftermath of a Neoproterozoic snowball Earth
<p>Earth’s most severe climate changes occurred during global-scale “snowball Earth” glaciations, which profoundly altered the planet’s atmosphere, oceans, and biosphere. Extreme rates of glacioeustatic sea level rise are predicted by the snowball Earth hypothesis, but supporting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geolog</span></strong>ic evidence has been lacking. We use paleohydraulic analysis of wave ripples and tidal laminae in the Elatina Formation, Australia—deposited after the Marinoan glaciation ~635 million years ago—to show that water depths of 9 to 16 meters remained nearly constant for ~100 years throughout 27 meters of sediment accumulation. This accumulation rate was too great to have been accommodated by subsidence and instead indicates an extraordinarily rapid rate of sea level rise (0.2 to 0.27 meters per year). Our results substantiate a fundamental prediction of snowball Earth models of rapid deglaciation during the early transition to a supergreenhouse climate.</p>

Microbial oxidation of lithospheric organic carbon in rapidly eroding tropical mountain soils
<p>Lithospheric organic carbon (“petrogenic”; OC<sub>petro</sub>) is oxidized during exhumation and subsequent erosion of mountain ranges. This process is a considerable source of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) to the atmosphere over <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geolog</span></strong>ic time scales, but the mechanisms that govern oxidation rates in mountain landscapes are poorly constrained. We demonstrate that, on average, 67 ± 11% of the OC<sub>petro</sub> initially present in bedrock exhumed from the tropical, rapidly eroding Central Range of Taiwan is oxidized in soils, leading to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of 6.1 to 18.6 metric tons of carbon per square kilometer per year. The molecular and isotopic evolution of bulk OC and lipid biomarkers during soil formation reveals that OC<sub>petro</sub> remineralization is microbially mediated. Rapid oxidation in mountain soils drives CO<sub>2</sub> emission fluxes that increase with erosion rate, thereby counteracting CO<sub>2</sub> drawdown by silicate weathering and biospheric OC burial.</p>

Remobilization of crustal carbon may dominate volcanic arc emissions
<p>The flux of carbon into and out of Earth’s surface environment has implications for Earth’s climate and habitability.

The largest volcanic emitters outgas carbon with higher δ<sup>13</sup>C and are located in mature continental arcs that have accreted carbonate platforms, indicating that reworking of crustal limestone is an important source of volcanic carbon. The fractional burial of organic carbon is lower than traditionally determined from a global carbon isotope mass balance and may have varied over <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geolog</span></strong>ical time, modulated by supercontinent formation and breakup.</p>

We synthesize geochemical and mineralogical data from lake-bed mudstones collected during the first 1300 martian solar days of rover operations in Gale. We present evidence for lake redox stratification, established by depth-dependent variations in atmospheric oxidant and dissolved-solute concentrations. Paleoclimate proxy data indicate that a transition from colder to warmer climate conditions is preserved in the stratigraphy.

We derive the structure of <sup>38</sup>Ar/<sup>36</sup>Ar between the homopause and exobase altitudes. Fractionation of argon occurs as a result of loss of gas to space by pickup-ion sputtering, which preferentially removes the lighter atom. The measurements require that 66% of the atmospheric argon has been lost to space. Thus, a large fraction of Mars’ atmospheric gas has been lost to space, contributing to the transition in climate from an early, warm, wet environment to today’s cold, dry atmosphere.</p>

Building Archean cratons from Hadean mafic crust
<p>Geologic processing of Earth’s surface has removed most of the evidence concerning the nature of Earth’s first crust. One region of ancient crust is the Hudson Bay terrane of northeastern Canada, which is mainly composed of Neoarchean felsic crust and forms the nucleus of the Northeastern Superior Province. New data show these ~2.7-billion-year-old rocks to be the youngest to yield variability in neodymium-142 (<sup>142</sup>Nd), the decay product of short-lived samarium-146 (<sup>146</sup>Sm). Combined <sup>146-147</sup>Sm-<sup>142-143</sup>Nd data reveal that this large block of Archean crust formed by reworking of much older (>4.2 billion-year-old) mafic crust over a 1.5-billion-year interval of early Earth history. Thus, unlike on modern Earth, mafic crust apparently could survive for more than 1 billion years to form an important source rock for Archean crustal genesis.</p>

The geologic history of seawater pH
<p>Although pH is a fundamental property of Earth’s oceans, critical to our understanding of seawater biogeochemistry, its long-timescale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geolog</span></strong>ic history is poorly constrained. We constrain seawater pH through time by accounting for the cycles of the major components of seawater. We infer an increase from early Archean pH values between ~6.5 and 7.0 and Phanerozoic values between ~7.5 and 9.0, which was caused by a gradual decrease in atmospheric <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> in response to solar brightening, alongside a decrease in hydrothermal exchange between seawater and the ocean crust. A lower pH in Earth’s early oceans likely affected the kinetics of chemical reactions associated with the origin of life, the energetics of early metabolisms, and climate through the partitioning of CO<sub>2</sub> between the oceans and atmosphere.</p>

Melting of subducted basalt at the core-mantle boundary

We explored the melting properties of mid-oceanic ridge basalt (MORB), which can reach the lowermost mantle after subduction of oceanic crust. At a pressure representative of the core-mantle boundary (135 gigapascals), the onset of melting occurs at ~3800 kelvin, which is ~350 kelvin below the mantle solidus. The SiO<sub>2</sub>-rich liquid generated either remains trapped in the MORB material or solidifies after reacting with the surrounding MgO-rich mantle, remixing subducted MORB with the lowermost mantle.</p>

Vaterite Crystals Contain Two Interspersed Crystal Structures
<sec><title>Double Vision</title><p>Vaterite is the least stable form of anhydrous crystalline calcium carbonate. While rarely found in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geolog</span></strong>ical contexts, it is an important biological precursor and occurs as a minor component in the shells of some organisms. The crystal structure of vaterite has long been debated with no model able to explain all the experimentally observed diffraction spots. <bold>Kabalah-Amitai <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 454) show that vaterite contains two coexisting crystallographic structures that form a pseudo-single crystal.</p></sec>

Chloroplast Accumulation Response Enhances Leaf Photosynthesis and Plant Biomass Production
<p>Under high light intensity, chloroplasts avoid absorbing excess light by moving to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anticlin</span></strong>al cell walls (avoidance response), but under low light intensity, chloroplasts accumulate along periclinal cell walls (accumulation response). In most plant species, these responses are induced by blue light and are mediated by the blue light photoreceptor, phototropin, which also regulates phototropism, leaf flattening, and stomatal opening. These phototropin-mediated responses could enhance photosynthesis and biomass production. Here, using various Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants deficient in chloroplast movement, we demonstrated that the accumulation response enhances leaf photosynthesis and plant biomass production. Conspicuously, <i>phototropin2</i> mutant plants specifically defective in the avoidance response but not in other phototropin-mediated responses displayed a constitutive accumulation response irrespective of light intensities, enhanced leaf photosynthesis, and increased plant biomass production. Therefore, our findings provide clear experimental evidence of the importance of the chloroplast accumulation response in leaf photosynthesis and biomass production.</p>

The correlation between Salter’s criteria for avascular necrosis of the femoral head and Kalamchi’s prognostic classification following the treatment of developmental dysplasia of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between   Salter’s criteria and Kalamchi’s classification of avascular necrosis   in patients treated for developmental dysphasia of the hip (DDH).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The study involved a retrospective analysis of 123 patients (123   hips) with DDH treated by operative and non-operative reduction   before the age of two years, with a minimum follow-up of ten years.   Salter’s criteria (S1 to S4) were determined from radiographs obtained   at one to two years post-reduction, whilst the Kalamchi grade was determined   from radiographs obtained at ten or more years of age. Early post-reduction   radiographs were also used to evaluate the centre-head distance   discrepancy (CHDD) and the occurrence of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dome</span></strong>-shaped deformity   of the proximal femoral metaphysis (D-shaped metaphysis).</p><p>The prognosis was described as good (Kalamchi grade K0 or KI),   fair (Kalamchi grade KII) or poor (Kalamchi grade KIII or KIV) for   analysis and correlation with the early Salter criteria, CHDD and   D-shaped metaphysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>S1 and S2 criteria were predictive of a poor prognosis.

Supracondylar osteotomy for the treatment of cubitus varus in children
<p>Cubitus varus is the most frequent complication   following the treatment of supracondylar humeral fractures in children.   We investigated data from publications reporting on the surgical   management of cubitus varus found in electronic searches of Ovid/MEDLINE   and Cochrane Library databases. In 894 children from 40 included   studies, the mean age at initial injury was 5.7 years (3 to 8.6)   and 9.8 years (4 to 15.7) at the time of secondary correction. The four   osteotomy techniques were classified as lateral closing wedge, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dome</span></strong>,   complex (multiplanar) and distraction osteogenesis. A mean angular   correction of 27.6º (18.5° to 37.0°) was achieved across all classes   of osteotomy. The meta-analytical summary estimate for overall rate   of good to excellent results was 87.8% (95% CI 84.4 to 91.2). No technique   was shown to significantly affect the surgical outcome, and the   risk of complications across all osteotomy classes was 14.5% (95%   CI 10.6 to 18.5). Nerve palsies occurred in 2.53% of cases (95%   CI 1.4 to 3.6), although 78.4% were transient. No one technique   was found to be statistically safer or more effective than any other.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014;96-B:691–700.</p>

Mid-term results of lateral unicondylar mobile bearing knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this independent multicentre study was to assess the   mid-term results of mobile bearing unicondylar knee arthroplasty   (UKA) for isolated lateral osteoarthritis of the knee joint.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We retrospectively evaluated 363 consecutive, lateral UKAs (346   patients) performed using the Oxford <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dome</span></strong>d lateral prosthesis undertaken   in three high-volume knee arthroplasty centres between 2006 and   2014. Mean age of the patients at surgery was 65 years (36 to 88)   with a mean final follow-up of 37 months (12 to 93)</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 36 (10.5%) patients underwent revision surgery, giving   a survival rate of 90.1% at three years (95% confidence intervals   (CI) 86.1 to 93.1; number at risk: 155) and 85.0% at five years   (95% CI 77.9 to 89.9; number at risk: 43). Dislocation of the mobile   bearing occurred in 18 patients (5.6%) at three years (95% CI 1.0   to 16.4; number at risk: 154) and in 20 patients (8.5%) at five   years (95% CI 1.0 to 27.0; number at risk: 42). There were no significant differences   in the dislocation rate between the participating centres or the   surgeons. We were not able to identify an effect of each surgeon’s   learning curve on the dislocation rate of the mobile bearing. The   clinical outcome in patients without revision surgery at final follow-up   was good to excellent, with a mean Oxford knee score of 40.3 (95%   CI 39.4 to 41.2), a mean Tegner activity score of 3.2 (95% CI 3.1   to 3.3) and a mean University of California, Los Angeles score of   5.7 (95% CI 5.5 to 5.9).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our data, which consists of a high number of patients treated   with mobile bearing UKA in the lateral compartment, indicates a   high revision rate of 15% at five years with dislocation of the   mobile bearing being the main reason for implant failure.

<i>ATML1</i> promotes epidermal cell differentiation in <i>Arabidopsis</i> shoots
<p>Molecular mechanisms that generate distinct tissue layers in plant shoots are not well understood. <i>ATML1</i>, an <i>Arabidopsis</i> homeobox gene, is expressed in the outermost cell layer, beginning at an early stage of development. The promoters of many epidermis-specific genes, including <i>ATML1</i>, contain an ATML1-binding site called an L1 box, suggesting that ATML1 regulates epidermal cell fate. Here, we show that overexpression of <i>ATML1</i> was sufficient to activate the expression of epidermal genes and to induce epidermis-related traits such as the formation of stomatal guard cells and trichome-like cells in non-epidermal seedling tissues. Detailed observation of the division planes of these ectopic stomatal cells suggested that a near-surface position, as well as epidermal cell identity, were required for regular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anticlin</span></strong>al cell division, as seen in wild-type epidermis. Moreover, analyses of a loss-of-function mutant and overexpressors implied that differentiation of epidermal cells was associated with repression of mesophyll cell fate. Collectively, our studies contribute new information about the molecular basis of cell fate determination in different layers of plant aerial organs.</p>

Prediction of higher-selectivity catalysts by computer-driven workflow and machine learning
<p>Catalyst design in asymmetric reaction development has traditionally been driven by empiricism, wherein experimentalists attempt to qualitatively recognize structural patterns to improve selectivity. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">machin</span></strong>e learning algorithms and chemoinformatics can potentially accelerate this process by recognizing otherwise inscrutable patterns in large datasets. Herein we report a computationally guided workflow for chiral catalyst selection using chemoinformatics at every stage of development. Robust molecular descriptors that are agnostic to the catalyst scaffold allow for selection of a universal training set on the basis of steric and electronic properties. This set can be used to train <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">machin</span></strong>e learning methods to make highly accurate predictive models over a broad range of selectivity space. Using support vector <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">machin</span></strong>es and deep feed-forward neural networks, we demonstrate accurate predictive modeling in the chiral phosphoric acid–catalyzed thiol addition to <i>N</i>-acylimines.</p>

Semantics derived automatically from language corpora contain human-like biases
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">machin</span></strong>e learning is a means to derive artificial intelligence by discovering patterns in existing data. Here, we show that applying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">machin</span></strong>e learning to ordinary human language results in human-like semantic biases. We replicated a spectrum of known biases, as measured by the Implicit Association Test, using a widely used, purely statistical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">machin</span></strong>e-learning model trained on a standard corpus of text from the World Wide Web. Our results indicate that text corpora contain recoverable and accurate imprints of our historic biases, whether morally neutral as toward insects or flowers, problematic as toward race or gender, or even simply veridical, reflecting the status quo distribution of gender with respect to careers or first names. Our methods hold promise for identifying and addressing sources of bias in culture, including technology.</p>

Neural scene representation and rendering
<p>Scene representation—the process of converting visual sensory data into concise descriptions—is a requirement for intelligent behavior. Recent work has shown that neural networks excel at this task when provided with large, labeled datasets. However, removing the reliance on human labeling remains an important open problem. To this end, we introduce the Generative Query Network (GQN), a framework within which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">machin</span></strong>es learn to represent scenes using only their own sensors. The GQN takes as input images of a scene taken from different viewpoints, constructs an internal representation, and uses this representation to predict the appearance of that scene from previously unobserved viewpoints. The GQN demonstrates representation learning without human labels or domain knowledge, paving the way toward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">machin</span></strong>es that autonomously learn to understand the world around them.</p>

Predicting reaction performance in C–N cross-coupling using machine learning
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">machin</span></strong>e learning methods are becoming integral to scientific inquiry in numerous disciplines. We demonstrated that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">machin</span></strong>e learning can be used to predict the performance of a synthetic reaction in multidimensional chemical space using data obtained via high-throughput experimentation. We created scripts to compute and extract atomic, molecular, and vibrational descriptors for the components of a palladium-catalyzed Buchwald-Hartwig cross-coupling of aryl halides with 4-methylaniline in the presence of various potentially inhibitory additives. Using these descriptors as inputs and reaction yield as output, we showed that a random forest algorithm provides significantly improved predictive performance over linear regression analysis. The random forest model was also successfully applied to sparse training sets and out-of-sample prediction, suggesting its value in facilitating adoption of synthetic methodology.</p>

Transition from turbulent to coherent flows in confined three-dimensional active fluids
<p>Transport of fluid through a pipe is essential for the operation of macroscale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">machin</span></strong>es and microfluidic devices. Conventional fluids only flow in response to external pressure. We demonstrate that an active isotropic fluid, composed of microtubules and molecular motors, autonomously flows through meter-long three-dimensional channels. We establish control over the magnitude, velocity profile, and direction of the self-organized flows and correlate these to the structure of the extensile microtubule bundles. The inherently three-dimensional transition from bulk-turbulent to confined-coherent flows occurs concomitantly with a transition in the bundle orientational order near the surface and is controlled by a scale-invariant criterion related to the channel profile. The nonequilibrium transition of confined isotropic active fluids can be used to engineer self-organized soft <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">machin</span></strong>es.</p>

Keyhole threshold and morphology in laser melting revealed by ultrahigh-speed x-ray imaging
<p>We used ultrahigh-speed synchrotron x-ray imaging to quantify the phenomenon of vapor depressions (also known as keyholes) during laser melting of metals as practiced in additive manufacturing. Although expected from welding and inferred from postmortem cross sections of fusion zones, the direct visualization of the keyhole morphology and dynamics with high-energy x-rays shows that (i) keyholes are present across the range of power and scanning velocity used in laser powder bed fusion; (ii) there is a well-defined threshold from conduction mode to keyhole based on laser power density; and (iii) the transition follows the sequence of vaporization, depression of the liquid surface, instability, and then deep keyhole formation. These and other aspects provide a physical basis for three-dimensional printing in laser powder bed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">machin</span></strong>es.</p>

Using neuroscience to develop artificial intelligence
<p>When the mathematician Alan Turing posed the question “Can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">machin</span></strong>es think?” in the first line of his seminal 1950 paper that ushered in the quest for artificial intelligence (AI) (<i>1</i>), the only known systems carrying out complex computations were biological nervous systems. It is not surprising, therefore, that scientists in the nascent field of AI turned to brain circuits as a source for guidance. One path that was taken since the early attempts to perform intelligent computation by brain-like circuits (<i>2</i>), and which led recently to remarkable successes, can be described as a highly reductionist approach to model cortical circuitry. In its basic current form, known as a “deep network” (or deep net) architecture, this brain-inspired model is built from successive layers of neuron-like elements, connected by adjustable weights, called “synapses” after their biological counterparts (<i>3</i>). The application of deep nets and related methods to AI systems has been transformative. They proved superior to previously known methods in central areas of AI research, including computer vision, speech recognition and production, and playing complex games. Practical applications are already in broad use, in areas such as computer vision and speech and text translation, and large-scale efforts are under way in many other areas. Here, I discuss how additional aspects of brain circuitry could supply cues for guiding network models toward broader aspects of cognition and general AI.</p>

Adaptations of an ancient modular machine

On page 257 of this issue, Schuller <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) report the structure of photosynthetic complex I at atomic resolution. The authors have analyzed how the distinct NADH [reduced form of oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>)] dehydrogenase subunit S (NdhS) facilitates electron transfer from ferredoxin, thereby establishing efficient cyclic electron flow around photosystem I. The findings add an important piece to the puzzle of deciphering the enigmatic mechanisms at work in the remarkable molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">machin</span></strong>es of the complex I superfamily encompassing photosynthetic and respiratory complex I, as well as proton pumping hydrogenases. In combination with high resolution structures of respiratory complex I from bacteria (<i>2</i>), mitochondria (<i>3</i>–<i>5</i>), and membrane bound hydrogenase (<i>6</i>), it is now possible to trace the modular evolution and functional adaptations of the complex I superfamily at the atomic level.</p>

Substrate-engaged 26<i>S</i> proteasome structures reveal mechanisms for ATP-hydrolysis–driven translocation
<p>The 26<i>S</i> proteasome is the primary eukaryotic degradation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">machin</span></strong>e and thus is critically involved in numerous cellular processes. The heterohexameric adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) motor of the proteasome unfolds and translocates targeted protein substrates into the open gate of a proteolytic core while a proteasomal deubiquitinase concomitantly removes substrate-attached ubiquitin chains. However, the mechanisms by which ATP hydrolysis drives the conformational changes responsible for these processes have remained elusive. Here we present the cryo–electron microscopy structures of four distinct conformational states of the actively ATP-hydrolyzing, substrate-engaged 26<i>S</i> proteasome. These structures reveal how mechanical substrate translocation accelerates deubiquitination and how ATP-binding, -hydrolysis, and phosphate-release events are coordinated within the AAA+ (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) motor to induce conformational changes and propel the substrate through the central pore.</p>

Predicting reservoir hosts and arthropod vectors from evolutionary signatures in RNA virus genomes

Using large genomic and ecological datasets, we demonstrate that animal reservoirs and the existence and identity of arthropod vectors can be predicted directly from viral genome sequences via <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">machin</span></strong>e learning. We illustrate the ability of these models to predict the epidemiology of diverse viruses across most human-infective families of single-stranded RNA viruses, including 69 viruses with previously elusive or never-investigated reservoirs or vectors. Models such as these, which capitalize on the proliferation of low-cost genomic sequencing, can narrow the time lag between virus discovery and targeted research, surveillance, and management.</p>

The hopper was readily functionalized to carry cargos. For example, a DNA molecule could be ratcheted along the track in either direction, a prerequisite for nanopore sequencing.</p>

Predictive modeling of U.S. health care spending in late life
<p>That one-quarter of Medicare spending in the United States occurs in the last year of life is commonly interpreted as waste. But this interpretation presumes knowledge of who will die and when. Here we analyze how spending is distributed by predicted mortality, based on a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">machin</span></strong>e-learning model of annual mortality risk built using Medicare claims. Death is highly unpredictable. Less than 5% of spending is accounted for by individuals with predicted mortality above 50%. The simple fact that we spend more on the sick—both on those who recover and those who die—accounts for 30 to 50% of the concentration of spending on the dead. Our results suggest that spending on the ex post dead does not necessarily mean that we spend on the ex ante “hopeless.”</p>

Ghost cytometry
<p>Ghost imaging is a technique used to produce an object’s image without using a spatially resolving detector. Here we develop a technique we term “ghost cytometry,” an image-free ultrafast fluorescence “imaging” cytometry based on a single-pixel detector. Spatial information obtained from the motion of cells relative to a static randomly patterned optical structure is compressively converted into signals that arrive sequentially at a single-pixel detector. Combinatorial use of the temporal waveform with the intensity distribution of the random pattern allows us to computationally reconstruct cell morphology. More importantly, we show that applying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">machin</span></strong>e-learning methods directly on the compressed waveforms without image reconstruction enables efficient image-free morphology-based cytometry. Despite a compact and inexpensive instrumentation, image-free ghost cytometry achieves accurate and high-throughput cell classification and selective sorting on the basis of cell morphology without a specific biomarker, both of which have been challenging to accomplish using conventional flow cytometers.</p>

Ribosomes on the night shift
<p>From an evolutionary perspective, life involves two simple goals: survival and reproduction. But these goals are fundamentally at odds. Reproduction depends on growth, but attempts to grow when nutrients are scarce can jeopardize survival. In cells, growth is accomplished in large part by ribosomes, huge RNA-protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">machin</span></strong>es that translate nucleic acid messages into protein, the main biochemical constituent of cells. In nutrient-rich conditions, cells can be filled with ribosomes; they comprise more than a third of total biomass in rapidly growing <i>Escherichia coli</i> (<i>1</i>). But what happens to ribosomes when nutrient levels decline, as occurs sporadically in microbes and nightly in sleeping humans? Biosynthesis subsides, and ribosomes now serve as a reservoir of nutrients. Building on recent progress probing the regulation of protein synthesis and degradation from Gu <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) and Abu-Remaileh <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>), on page 751 of this issue, Wyant <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) elucidate a pathway in which ribosomes are selectively digested, promoting survival in starved cells.</p>

Improving refugee integration through data-driven algorithmic assignment

Structure-property relationships from universal signatures of plasticity in disordered solids

Experimental results and computations enabled us to measure the spatial correlations and strain response of softness, as well as two measures of plasticity: the size of rearrangements and the yield strain. All four quantities maintained remarkable commonality in their values for disordered packings of objects ranging from atoms to grains, spanning seven orders of magnitude in diameter and 13 orders of magnitude in elastic modulus. These commonalities link the spatial correlations and strain response of softness to rearrangement size and yield strain, respectively.</p>

Neural correlates of ticklishness in the rat somatosensory cortex
<p>Rats emit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ultrason</span></strong>ic vocalizations in response to tickling by humans. Tickling is rewarding through dopaminergic mechanisms, but the function and neural correlates of ticklishness are unknown. We confirmed that tickling of rats evoked vocalizations, approach, and unsolicited jumps (Freudensprünge). Recordings in the trunk region of the rat somatosensory cortex showed intense tickling-evoked activity in most neurons, whereas a minority of cells were suppressed by tickling. Tickling responses predicted nontactile neural responses to play behaviors, which suggests a neuronal link between tickling and play. Anxiogenic conditions suppressed tickling-evoked vocalizations and trunk cortex activity. Deep-layer trunk cortex neurons discharged during vocalizations, and deep-layer microstimulation evoked vocalizations. Our findings provide evidence for deep-layer trunk cortex activity as a neural correlate of ticklishness.</p>

Our structure suggests that Prp2 adenosine triphosphatase–mediated remodeling leads to conformational changes in Hsh155’s HEAT domain that liberate the first-step reactants for catalysis.</p>

How to Build a Dream-Reading Machine
<p>Not long ago, the idea that you could "decode" what people were seeing, thinking, or dreaming about based on brain activity alone was unthinkable. Now, in a new study reported online this week in <i>Science</i>, the authors <ext-link>successfully predicted images seen in sleep</ext-link> based exclusively on MRI scans of brain activity. Although researchers warn that we're still far from having a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">machin</span></strong>e that can fully read our dreams, the work is being described as a success. </p>

Reproductive Long Intergenic Noncoding RNAs Exhibit Male Gamete Specificity and Polycomb Repressive Complex 2-Mediated Repression
<p>Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been characterized extensively in animals and are involved in several processes, including homeobox gene expression and X-chromosome inactivation. In comparison, there has been much less detailed characterization of plant lncRNAs, and the number of distinct lncRNAs encoded in plant genomes and their regulation by developmental and epigenetic mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we analyzed transcriptome data from Asian rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and identified 6,309 long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs), focusing on their expression in reproductive tissues and organs. Most <i>O. sativa</i> lincRNAs were expressed in a highly tissue-specific manner, with an unexpectedly high fraction specifically expressed in male gametes. Mutation of a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex2 (PRC2) resulted in derepression of another large class of lincRNAs, whose expression is correlated with H3K27 trimethylation in developing panicles. Overlap with the sperm cell-specific lincRNAs suggests that epigenetic repression of lincRNAs in the panicles was partially relieved in the male germline. Expression of a subset of lincRNAs also showed modulation by drought in reproductive tissues. Comparison with other cereal genomes showed that the lincRNAs generally have low levels of conservation at both the sequence and structural levels. Use of a novelty detection support vector <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">machin</span></strong>e model enabled the detection of nucleotide sequence and structural homology in ∼10% and ∼4% of the lincRNAs in genomes of purple false brome (<i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>) and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), respectively. This is the first study to report on a large number of lncRNAs that are targets of repression by PRC2 rather than mediating regulation via PRC2. That the vast majority of the lincRNAs reported here do not overlap with those of other rice studies indicates that these are a significant addition to the known lincRNAs in rice.</p>

VIPP1 Involved in Chloroplast Membrane Integrity Has GTPase Activity in Vitro
<p>VESICLE-INDUCING PROTEIN IN PLASTID1 (VIPP1) is conserved among oxygenic photosynthetic organisms and appears to have diverged from the bacterial PspA protein. VIPP1 localizes to the chloroplast envelope and thylakoid membrane, where it forms homooligomers of high molecular mass. Although multiple roles of VIPP1 have been inferred, including thylakoid membrane formation, envelope maintenance, membrane fusion, and regulation of photosynthetic activity, its precise role in chloroplast membrane quality control remains unknown. VIPP1 forms an oligomer through its amino-terminal domain and triggers membrane fusion in an Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner. We previously demonstrated that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) VIPP1 also exhibits dynamic complex disassembly in response to osmotic and heat stresses in vivo. These results suggest that VIPP1 mediates membrane fusion/remodeling in chloroplasts. Considering that protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">machin</span></strong>es that regulate intracellular membrane fusion/remodeling events often require a capacity for GTP binding and/or hydrolysis, we questioned whether VIPP1 has similar properties. We conducted an in vitro assay using a purified VIPP1-His fusion protein expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i> cells. VIPP1-His showed GTP hydrolysis activity that was inhibited competitively by an unhydrolyzable GTP analog, GTPγS, and that depends on GTP binding. It is particularly interesting that the ancestral PspA from <i>E. coli</i> also possesses GTP hydrolysis activity. Although VIPP1 does not contain a canonical G domain, the amino-terminal α-helix was found to be important for both GTP binding and GTP hydrolysis as well as for oligomer formation. Collectively, our results reveal that the properties of VIPP1/PspA are similar to those of GTPases.</p>

Predictive Models of Spatial Transcriptional Response to High Salinity
<p>Plants are exposed to a variety of environmental conditions, and their ability to respond to environmental variation depends on the proper regulation of gene expression in an organ-, tissue-, and cell type-specific manner. Although our knowledge of how stress responses are regulated is accumulating, a genome-wide model of how plant transcription factors (TFs) and cis-regulatory elements control spatially specific stress response has yet to emerge. Using Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) as a model, we identified a set of 1,894 putative cis-regulatory elements (pCREs) that are associated with high-salinity (salt) up-regulated genes in the root or the shoot. We used these pCREs to develop computational models that can better predict salt up-regulated genes in the root and shoot compared with models based on known TF binding motifs. In addition, we incorporated TF binding sites identified via large-scale in vitro assays, chromatin accessibility, evolutionary conservation, and pCRE combinatorial relationships in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">machin</span></strong>e learning models and found that only consideration of pCRE combinations led to better performance in salt up-regulation prediction in the root and shoot. Our results suggest that the plant organ transcriptional response to high salinity is regulated by a core set of pCREs and provide a genome-wide view of the cis-regulatory code of plant spatial transcriptional responses to environmental stress.</p>

Monitoring of Freezing Dynamics in Trees: A Simple Phase Shift Causes Complexity
<p>During winter, trees have to cope with harsh conditions, including extreme freeze-thaw stress. This study focused on ice nucleation and propagation, related water shifts and xylem cavitation, as well as cell damage and was based on in situ monitoring of xylem (thermocouples) and surface temperatures (infrared imaging), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ultrason</span></strong>ic emissions, and dendrometer analysis. Field experiments during late winter on <i>Picea abies</i> growing at the alpine timberline revealed three distinct freezing patterns: (1) from the top of the tree toward the base, (2) from thin branches toward the main stem’s top and base, and (3) from the base toward the top. Infrared imaging showed freezing within branches from their base toward distal parts. Such complex freezing causes dynamic and heterogenous patterns in water potential and probably in cavitation. This study highlights the interaction between environmental conditions upon freezing and thawing and demonstrates the enormous complexity of freezing processes in trees. Diameter shrinkage, which indicated water fluxes within the stem, and acoustic emission analysis, which indicated cavitation events near the ice front upon freezing, were both related to minimum temperature and, upon thawing, related to vapor pressure deficit and soil temperature. These complex patterns, emphasizing the common mechanisms between frost and drought stress, shed new light on winter tree physiology.</p>

Ranking Businesses and Municipal Locations by Spatiotemporal Cardiac Arrest Risk to Guide Public Defibrillator Placement
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Efforts to guide automated external defibrillator placement for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) treatment have focused on identifying broadly defined location categories without considering hours of operation. Broad location categories may be composed of many businesses with varying accessibility. Identifying specific locations for automated external defibrillator deployment incorporating operating hours and time of OHCA occurrence may improve automated external defibrillator accessibility. We aim to identify specific businesses and municipal locations that maximize OHCA coverage on the basis of spatiotemporal assessment of OHCA risk in the immediate vicinity of franchise locations.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This study was a retrospective population-based cohort study using data from the Toronto Regional RescuNET Epistry cardiac arrest database. We identified all nontraumatic public OHCAs occurring in Toronto, ON, Canada, from January 2007 through December 2015. We identified 41 unique businesses and municipal location types with ≥20 locations in Toronto from the YellowPages, Canadian Franchise Association, and the City of Toronto Open Data Portal. We obtained their geographic coordinates and hours of operation from Web sites, by phone, or in person. We determined the number of OHCAs that occurred within 100 m of each location when it was open (spatiotemporal coverage) for Toronto overall and downtown. The businesses and municipal locations were then ranked by spatiotemporal OHCA coverage. To evaluate temporal stability of the rankings, we calculated intraclass correlation of the annual coverage values.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>There were 2654 nontraumatic public OHCAs. Tim Hortons ranked first in Toronto, covering 286 OHCAs. Starbucks ranked first in downtown, covering 110 OHCAs. Coffee shops and bank <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">machin</span></strong>es from the 5 largest Canadian banks occupied 8 of the top 10 spots in both Toronto and downtown. The rankings exhibited high temporal stability with intraclass correlation values of 0.88 (95% confidence interval, 0.83–0.93) in Toronto and 0.79 (95% confidence interval, 0.71–0.86) in downtown.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We identified and ranked businesses and municipal locations by spatiotemporal OHCA risk in their immediate vicinity. This approach may help policy makers and funders to identify and prioritize potential partnerships for automated external defibrillator deployment in public-access defibrillator programs.</p></sec>

Mid-term changes in blood metal ion levels after Articular Surface Replacement arthroplasty of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Our first aim was to determine whether there are significant   changes in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong> of metal ions in the blood at mid-term follow-up,   in patients with an Articular Surface Replacement (ASR) arthroplasty.   Secondly, we sought to identify risk factors for any increases.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The study involved 435 patients who underwent unilateral, metal-on-metal   (MoM) hip resurfacing (HRA) or total hip arthroplasty (THA). These   patients all had one measurement of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong> of metal ions in the   blood before seven years had passed post-operatively (early evaluation)   and one after seven years had passed post-operatively (mid-term evaluation).   Changes in ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s were tested using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test.   We identified subgroups at the highest risk of increase using a   multivariable linear logistic regression model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were significant increases in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s of metal ions   for patients who underwent both MoM HRA (Chromium (Cr): 0.5 parts   per billion (ppb); Cobalt (Co): 1.1 ppb) and MoM THA (Cr: 0.5 ppb;   Co: 0.7 ppb). In a multivariable model considering MoM HRAs, the   change in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s of metal ions was influenced by female gender   (Co: Odds Ratio (OR) 1.42; p = 0.002 and Cr: OR 1.08; p = 0.006).   The change was found to be irrespective of the initial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong> for   the MoM HRAs, whereas there was a negative relationship between   the initial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong> and the change in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong> for those with a MoM   THA (Co: OR -0.43; p < 0.001 and Cr: OR -0.14; p = 0.033).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s of metal ions in the blood increase significantly   over the period until mid-term follow-up in patients with both a   MoM HRA and those with a MoM THA. We recommend that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s of   metal ions be measured most frequently for women with a MoM HRA.   While those with a MoM THA appear to stabilise at a certain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>,   the accuracy of this trend is not yet clear. Vigilant follow-up   is still recommended. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B(4   Supple B):33–40.</p></sec>

Moderate excess of pyruvate augments osteoclastogenesis
<p>Cell differentiation leads to adaptive changes in energy metabolism. Conversely, hyperglycemia induces malfunction of many body systems, including bone, suggesting that energy metabolism reciprocally affects cell differentiation. We investigated how the differentiation of bone-resorbing osteoclasts, large polykaryons formed through fusion and growth of cells of monocytic origin, is affected by excess of energy substrate pyruvate and how energy metabolism changes during osteoclast differentiation. Surprisingly, small increases in pyruvate (1–2 mM above basal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s) augmented osteoclastogenesis <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, while larger increases were not effective <i>in vitro</i>. Osteoclast differentiation increased cell mitochondrial activity and ATP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s, which were further augmented in energy-rich conditions. Conversely, the inhibition of respiration significantly reduced osteoclast number and size. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) acts as a metabolic sensor, which is inhibited in energy-rich conditions. We found that osteoclast differentiation was associated with an increase in AMPK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s and a change in AMPK isoform composition. Increased osteoclast size induced by pyruvate (1 mM above basal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s) was prevented in the presence of AMPK activator 5-amino-4-imidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR). In keeping, inhibition of AMPK using dorsomorphin or siRNA to AMPKγ increased osteoclast size in control cultures to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong> observed in the presence of pyruvate. Thus, we have found that a moderate excess of pyruvate enhances osteoclastogenesis, and that AMPK acts to tailor osteoclastogenesis to a cell's bioenergetics capacity.</p>

Harvesting electrical energy from carbon nanotube yarn twist
<p>Mechanical energy harvesters are needed for diverse applications, including self-powered wireless sensors, structural and human health monitoring systems, and the extraction of energy from ocean waves. We report carbon nanotube yarn harvesters that electrochemically convert tensile or torsional mechanical energy into electrical energy without requiring an external bias voltage. Stretching coiled yarns generated 250 watts per kilogram of peak electrical power when cycled up to 30 hertz, as well as up to 41.2 joules per kilogram of electrical energy per mechanical cycle, when normalized to harvester yarn weight. These energy harvesters were used in the ocean to harvest wave energy, combined with thermally driven artificial muscles to convert temperature fluctuations to electrical energy, sewn into textiles for use as self-powered respiration sensors, and used to power a light-emitting diode and to charge a storage capacitor.</p>

The Mitochondrial Endonuclease M20 Participates in the Down-Regulation of Mitochondrial DNA in Pollen Cells
<p>Maintaining the appropriate number of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) molecules is crucial for supporting mitochondrial metabolism and function in both plant and animal cells. For example, a substantial decrease in mtDNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s occurs as a key part of pollen development. The molecular mechanisms regulating mtDNA copy number are largely unclear, particularly with regard to those that reduce mtDNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s. Here, we identified and purified a 20-kD endonuclease, M20, from maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) pollen mitochondria. We found M20 to be an His-Asn-His/Asn (H-N-H/N) nuclease that degrades linear and circular DNA in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> or Mn<sup>2+</sup>. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) AtM20, which shared high sequence similarity with maize M20, localized to the mitochondria, had a similar H-N-H/N structure, and degraded both linear and circular DNA. <i>AtM20</i> transcript <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s increased during pollen development, in parallel with a rapid reduction in mtDNA. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 genome-editing techniques were used to generate knockout lines of <i>AtM20</i> (<i>atm20</i>), which exhibited a significant delay in the reduction in mtDNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s in pollen vegetative cells but normal mtDNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s in somatic cells. The delayed reduction in pollen mtDNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s was rescued by the transgenic expression of <i>AtM20</i> in <i>atm20</i> plants. This study thus uncovers an endonucleolytic DNase in plant mitochondria and its crucial role in reducing mtDNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s, pointing to the complex mechanism regulating mtDNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s in plants.</p>

The Arabidopsis Mitochondrial Protease FtSH4 Is Involved in Leaf Senescence via Regulation of WRKY-Dependent Salicylic Acid Accumulation and Signaling
<p>Mitochondria and autophagy play important roles in the networks that regulate plant leaf senescence and cell death. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between mitochondrial signaling and autophagy are currently not well understood. This study characterized the function of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mitochondrial AAA-protease gene <i>FtSH4</i> in regulating autophagy and senescence, finding that FtSH4 mediates WRKY-dependent salicylic acid (SA) accumulation and signaling. Knockout of <i>FtSH4</i> in the <i>ftsh4-4</i> mutant resulted in severe leaf senescence, cell death, and high autophagy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong> of SA increased dramatically in the <i>ftsh4-4</i> mutant. Expression of <i>nahG</i> in the <i>ftsh4-4</i> mutant led to decreased SA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s and suppressed the leaf senescence and cell death phenotypes. The transcript <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s of several SA synthesis and signaling genes, including <i>SALICYLIC ACID</i> <i>INDUCTION DEFICIENT2</i> (<i>SID2</i>), <i>NON-RACE-SPECIFIC DISEASE RESISTANCE1</i> (<i>NDR1</i>), and <i>NONEXPRESSOR OF PATHOGENESIS-RELATED PROTEINS1</i> (<i>NPR1</i>), increased significantly in the <i>ftsh4-4</i> mutants compared with the wild type. Loss of function of <i>SID2</i>, <i>NDR1</i>, or <i>NPR1</i> in the <i>ftsh4-4</i> mutant reversed the <i>ftsh4-4</i> senescence and autophagy phenotypes. Furthermore, <i>ftsh4-4</i> mutants had elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s of transcripts of several <i>WRKY</i> genes, including <i>WRKY40</i>, <i>WRKY46</i>, <i>WRKY51</i>, <i>WRKY60</i>, <i>WRKY63</i>, and <i>WRKY75</i>; all of these WRKY proteins can bind to the promoter of <i>SID2</i>. Loss of function of <i>WRKY75</i> in the <i>ftsh4-4</i> mutants decreased the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s of SA and reversed the senescence phenotype. Taken together, these results suggest that the mitochondrial ATP-dependent protease FtSH4 may regulate the expression of <i>WRKY</i> genes by modifying the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong> of reactive oxygen species and the WRKY transcription factors that control SA synthesis and signaling in autophagy and senescence.</p>

Dislocation of a primary total hip arthroplasty is more common in patients with a lumbar spinal fusion
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Lumbar fusion is known to reduce the variation in pelvic tilt   between standing and sitting. A flexible lumbo-pelvic unit increases   the stability of total hip arthroplasty (THA) when seated by increasing   anterior clearance and acetabular anteversion, thereby preventing   impingement of the prosthesis. Lumbar fusion may eliminate this protective   pelvic movement. The effect of lumbar fusion on the stability of   total hip arthroplasty has not previously been investigated.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The Medicare database was searched for patients who had undergone   THA and spinal fusion between 2005 and 2012. PearlDiver software   was used to query the database by the International Classification   of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) procedural   code for primary THA and lumbar spinal fusion. Patients who had   undergone both lumbar fusion and THA were then divided into three   groups: 1 to 2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s, 3 to 7 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s and 8+ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s of fusion. The   rate of dislocation in each group was established using ICD-9-CM codes.   Patients who underwent THA without spinal fusion were used as a   control group. Statistical significant difference between groups   was tested using the chi-squared test, and significance set at p   < 0.05.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At one-year follow-up, 14 747 patients were found to have had   a THA after lumbar spinal fusion (12 079 1 to 2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s, 2594 3 to   7 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s, 74 8+ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s). The control group consisted of 839 004   patients. The dislocation rate in the control group was 1.55%. A   higher rate of dislocation was found in patients with a spinal fusion   of 1 to 2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s (2.96%, p < 0.0001) and 3 to 7 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s (4.12%,   p < 0.0001). Patients with 3 to 7 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s of fusion had a higher   rate of dislocation than patients with 1 to 2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s of fusion (odds   ratio (OR) = 1.60, p < 0.0001). When groups were matched for   age and gender to the unfused cohort, patients with 1 to 2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s   of fusion had an OR of 1.93 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.42 to   2.32, p < 0.001), and those with 3 to 7 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s of fusion an OR   of 2.77 (CI 2.04 to 4.80, p < 0.001) for dislocation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Patients with a previous history of lumbar spinal fusion have   a significantly higher rate of dislocation of their THA than age-   and gender-matched patients without a lumbar spinal fusion.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:585–91.</p></sec>

Nicotinamide Riboside Preserves Cardiac Function in a Mouse Model of Dilated Cardiomyopathy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Myocardial metabolic impairment is a major feature in chronic heart failure. As the major coenzyme in fuel oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation and a substrate for enzymes signaling energy stress and oxidative stress response, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) is emerging as a metabolic target in a number of diseases including heart failure. Little is known on the mechanisms regulating homeostasis of NAD<sup>+</sup> in the failing heart.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To explore possible alterations of NAD<sup>+</sup> homeostasis in the failing heart, we quantified the expression of NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthetic enzymes in the human failing heart and in the heart of a mouse model of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) triggered by Serum Response Factor transcription factor depletion in the heart (SRF<sup>HKO</sup>) or of cardiac hypertrophy triggered by transverse aorta constriction. We studied the impact of NAD<sup>+</sup> precursor supplementation on cardiac function in both mouse models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We observed a 30% loss in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s of NAD<sup>+</sup> in the murine failing heart of both DCM and transverse aorta constriction mice that was accompanied by a decrease in expression of the nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase enzyme that recycles the nicotinamide precursor, whereas the nicotinamide riboside kinase 2 (NMRK2) that phosphorylates the nicotinamide riboside precursor is increased, to a higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong> in the DCM (40-fold) than in transverse aorta constriction (4-fold). This shift was also observed in human failing heart biopsies in comparison with nonfailing controls. We show that the <i>Nmrk2</i> gene is an AMP-activated protein kinase and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α responsive gene that is activated by energy stress and NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion in isolated rat cardiomyocytes. Nicotinamide riboside efficiently rescues NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis in response to FK866-mediated inhibition of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase and stimulates glycolysis in cardiomyocytes. Accordingly, we show that nicotinamide riboside supplementation in food attenuates the development of heart failure in mice, more robustly in DCM, and partially after transverse aorta constriction, by stabilizing myocardial NAD<sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s in the failing heart. Nicotinamide riboside treatment also robustly increases the myocardial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s of 3 metabolites, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide, methylnicotinamide, and N1-methyl-4-pyridone-5-carboxamide, that can be used as validation biomarkers for the treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The data show that nicotinamide riboside, the most energy-efficient among NAD precursors, could be useful for treatment of heart failure, notably in the context of DCM, a disease with few therapeutic options.</p></sec>

Converging Light, Energy and Hormonal Signaling Control Meristem Activity, Leaf Initiation, and Growth<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>The development of leaf primordia is subject to light control of meristematic activity. Light regulates the expression of thousands of genes with roles in cell proliferation, organ development, and differentiation of photosynthetic cells. Previous work has highlighted roles for hormone homeostasis and the energy-dependent Target of Rapamycin (TOR) kinase in meristematic activity, yet a picture of how these two regulatory mechanisms depend on light perception and interact with each other has yet to emerge. Their relevance beyond leaf initiation also is unclear. Here, we report the discovery that the dark-arrested meristematic region of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) experiences a local energy deprivation state and confirm previous findings that the PIN1 auxin transporter is diffusely localized in the dark. Light triggers a rapid removal of the starvation state and the establishment of PIN1 polar membrane localization consistent with auxin export, both preceding the induction of cell cycle- and cytoplasmic growth-associated genes. We demonstrate that shoot meristematic activity can occur in the dark through the manipulation of auxin and cytokinin activity as well as through the activation of energy signaling, both targets of photomorphogenesis action, but the organ developmental outcomes differ: while TOR-dependent energy signals alone stimulate cell proliferation, the development of a normal leaf lamina requires photomorphogenesis-like hormonal responses. We further show that energy signaling adjusts the extent of cell cycle activity and growth of young leaves non-cellautonomously to available photosynthates and leads to organs constituted of a greater number of cells developing under higher irradiance. This makes energy signaling perhaps the most important biomass growth determinant under natural, unstressed conditions.</p>

Heavy Metals Induce Iron Deficiency Responses at Different Hierarchic and Regulatory Levels
<p>In plants, the excess of several heavy metals mimics iron (Fe) deficiency-induced chlorosis, indicating a disturbance in Fe homeostasis. To examine the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong> at which heavy metals interfere with Fe deficiency responses, we carried out an in-depth characterization of Fe-related physiological, regulatory, and morphological responses in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) exposed to heavy metals. Enhanced zinc (Zn) uptake closely mimicked Fe deficiency by leading to low chlorophyll but high ferric-chelate reductase activity and coumarin release. These responses were not caused by Zn-inhibited Fe uptake via IRON-REGULATED TRANSPORTER (IRT1). Instead, Zn simulated the transcriptional response of typical Fe-regulated genes, indicating that Zn affects Fe homeostasis at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong> of Fe sensing. Excess supplies of cobalt and nickel altered root traits in a different way from Fe deficiency, inducing only transient Fe deficiency responses, which were characterized by a lack of induction of the ethylene pathway. Cadmium showed a rather inconsistent influence on Fe deficiency responses at multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s. By contrast, manganese evoked weak Fe deficiency responses in wild-type plants but strongly exacerbated chlorosis in <i>irt1</i> plants, indicating that manganese antagonized Fe mainly at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong> of transport. These results show that the investigated heavy metals modulate Fe deficiency responses at different hierarchic and regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s and that the interaction of metals with physiological and morphological Fe deficiency responses is uncoupled. Thus, this study not only emphasizes the importance of assessing heavy metal toxicities at multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s but also provides a new perspective on how Fe deficiency contributes to the toxic action of individual heavy metals.</p>

Skeletal muscle fuel selection occurs at the mitochondrial level
<p>Mammals exponentially increase the rate of carbohydrate oxidation as exercise intensity rises, while birds combust lipid almost exclusively while flying at high percentages of aerobic capacity. The fuel oxidized by contracting muscle depends on many factors: whole-body fuel storage mass, mobilization, blood transport, cellular uptake, and substrate selection at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong> of the mitochondrion. We examined the fuel preferences of mitochondria isolated from mammalian and avian locomotory muscles using two approaches. First, the influence of substrates on the kinetics of respiration (<i>K</i><sub>m,ADP</sub> and <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>) was evaluated. For all substrates and combinations, <i>K</i><sub>m,ADP</sub> was generally twofold higher in avian mitochondria. Second, fuel competition between pyruvate, glutamate and/or palmitoyl-<sc>l</sc>-carnitine at three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s of ATP free energy was determined using the principle of mass balance and the measured rates of O<sub>2</sub> consumption and metabolite accumulation/utilization. Avian mitochondria strongly spared pyruvate from oxidation when another substrate was available and fatty acid was the dominant substrate, regardless of energy state. Mammalian mitochondria exhibited some preference for fatty acid over pyruvate at lower flux (higher energy state), but exhibited a much greater tendency to select pyruvate and glutamate when available. Studies in sonicated mitochondria revealed twofold higher electron transport chain electron conductance in avian mitochondria. We conclude that substantial fuel selection occurs at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong> of the mitochondrial matrix and that avian flight muscle mitochondria are particularly biased toward the selection of fatty acid, possibly by facilitating high β-oxidation flux by maintaining a more oxidized matrix.</p>

Physiological basis of starvation resistance in <i>Drosophila leontia</i>: analysis of sexual dimorphism
<p>Geographically varying starvation stress has often been considered as a natural selector that constrains between-population differences for starvation resistance (SR) in <i>Drosophila</i> species. On the Indian subcontinent, a dozen <i>Drosophila</i> species have shown clinal variations in SR across latitude, but the evolved physiological basis of such contrasting adaptations is largely unknown. In the present study, I untangled the physiological basis of sex-specific as well as between-population divergence for SR in <i>D. leontia</i>, collected across a latitudinal transect of the Indian subcontinent (11°45′–31°19′N). Secondly, I tested the assumptions that hardening to starvation stress facilitates an increased survival under subsequent lethal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s of starvation, and such plastic effects differ between the sexes. I observed several interesting results. In contrast to a steeper cline of starvation-related traits with latitude in females, a shallower gradient was observed for males. Females stored higher (~1.3-fold) dry-mass-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s of body lipids and glycogen contents, and utilized these both of these energy resources under starvation stress, whereas the starved males metabolized only body lipids as a source of energy. Conversely, the rate of body lipid utilization and threshold need were considerably higher in females as compared with males. Between-population differences were significant for storage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s of energy reserves only, but not for other avenues (rate of metabolite utilization and threshold need) of SR for both sexes. These findings indicate that multiple pathways shape the physiological basis of sexual dimorphism for SR in <i>D. leontia</i>. Further, single or multiple bouts of starvation hardening conferred an increased longevity (~4–9 h; <i>P</i><0.001) under subsequent lethal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s of starvation stress for females only, and such plastic responses were consistent with a decrease in rate of metabolite utilization. Nevertheless, between-population effects were non-significant for absolute hardening capacity (AHC=<i>K</i><sub>SR</sub>–C). Altogether, these findings suggest that similar evolutionary constraints have resulted in divergent genetic as well as plastic responses to evolve adaptations under starvation stress, and account for the observed sexual dimorphism for basal SR in <i>D. leontia</i>.</p>

The limits of applicability of the sound exposure level (SEL) metric to temporal threshold shifts (TTS) in beluga whales, <i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>
<p>The influence of fatiguing sound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong> and duration on post-exposure temporary threshold shift (TTS) was investigated in two beluga whales (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>). The fatiguing sound was half-octave noise with a center frequency of 22.5 kHz. TTS was measured at a test frequency of 32 kHz. Thresholds were measured by recording rhythmic evoked potentials (the envelope following response) to a test series of short (eight cycles) tone pips with a pip rate of 1000 s<sup>−1</sup>. TTS increased approximately proportionally to the dB measure of both sound pressure (sound pressure <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>, SPL) and duration of the fatiguing noise, as a product of these two variables. In particular, when the noise parameters varied in a manner that maintained the product of squared sound pressure and time (sound exposure <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>, SEL, which is equivalent to the overall noise energy) at a constant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>, TTS was not constant. Keeping SEL constant, the highest TTS appeared at an intermediate ratio of SPL to sound duration and decreased at both higher and lower ratios. Multiplication (SPL multiplied by log duration) better described the experimental data than an equal-energy (equal SEL) model. The use of SEL as a sole universal metric may result in an implausible assessment of the impact of a fatiguing sound on hearing thresholds in odontocetes, including under-evaluation of potential risks.</p>

Here we hypothesized that performing genome-wide association studies and exome array analyses on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s of each of these 156 proteins might identify genetic determinants of risk-associated circulating factors and provide insights into early cardiovascular pathophysiology.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied the association of genetic variants with the plasma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s of each of the 156 Framingham Cardiovascular Disease Risk Score–associated proteins using linear mixed-effects models in 2 population-based cohorts. We performed discovery analyses on plasma samples from 759 participants of the Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort, an observational study of the offspring of the original Framingham Heart Study and their spouses, and validated these findings in plasma samples from 1421 participants of the MDCS (Malmö Diet and Cancer Study). To evaluate the utility of this strategy in identifying new biological pathways relevant to cardiovascular disease pathophysiology, we performed studies in a cell-model system to experimentally validate the functional significance of an especially novel genetic association with circulating apolipoprotein E <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified 120 locus-protein associations in genome-wide analyses and 41 associations in exome array analyses, the majority of which have not been described previously. These loci explained up to 66% of interindividual plasma protein-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong> variation and, on average, accounted for 3 times the amount of variation explained by common clinical factors, such as age, sex, and diabetes mellitus status. We described overlap among many of these loci and cardiovascular disease genetic risk variants. Finally, we experimentally validated a novel association between circulating apolipoprotein E <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s and the transcription factor phosphatase 1G. Knockdown of phosphatase 1G in a human liver cell model resulted in decreased apolipoprotein E transcription and apolipoprotein E protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s in cultured supernatants.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We identified dozens of novel genetic determinants of proteins associated with the Framingham Cardiovascular Disease Risk Score and experimentally validated a new role for phosphatase 1G in lipoprotein biology. Further, genome-wide and exome array data for each protein have been made publicly available as a resource for cardiovascular disease research.</p></sec>

Binding of FUN14 Domain Containing 1 With Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptor in Mitochondria-Associated Endoplasmic Reticulum Membranes Maintains Mitochondrial Dynamics and Function in Hearts in Vivo
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>FUN14 domain containing 1 (FUNDC1) is a highly conserved outer mitochondrial membrane protein. The aim of this study is to examine whether FUNDC1 modulates the mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes (MAMs), mitochondrial morphology, and function in cardiomyocytes and intact hearts.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The impacts of FUNDC1 on MAMs formation and cardiac functions were studied in mouse neonatal cardiomyocytes, in mice with cardiomyocyte-specific <i>Fundc1</i> gene knockout (<i>Fundc1</i><sup><i>f/Y</i></sup><i>/Cre</i><sup><i>αMyHC+/−</i></sup>), and in the cardiac tissues of the patients with heart failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In mouse neonatal cardiomyocytes and intact hearts, FUNDC1 was localized in MAMs by binding to ER-resided inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate type 2 receptor (IP<sub>3</sub>R2). <i>Fundc1</i> ablation disrupted MAMs and reduced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s of IP<sub>3</sub>R2 and Ca<sup>2+</sup> in both mitochondria and cytosol, whereas overexpression of <i>Fundc1</i> increased the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s of IP<sub>3</sub>R2 and Ca<sup>2+</sup> in both mitochondria and cytosol. Consistently, <i>Fundc1</i> ablation increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s in ER, whereas <i>Fundc1</i> overexpression lowered ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s. Further, <i>Fundc1</i> ablation in cardiomyocytes elongated mitochondria and compromised mitochondrial functions. Mechanistically, we found that <i>Fundc1</i> ablation-induced reduction of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s suppressed mitochondrial fission 1 protein (<i>Fis1</i>) expression and mitochondrial fission by reducing the binding of the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) in the <i>Fis1</i> promoter. <i>Fundc1</i><sup><i>f/Y</i></sup><i>/Cre</i><sup><i>αMyHC+/−</i></sup> mice but not their littermate control mice (<i>Fundc1</i><sup><i>wt/Y</i></sup><i>/Cre</i><sup><i>αMyHC+/−</i></sup>) exhibited cardiac dysfunction.

Thyroid Function Within the Normal Range, Subclinical Hypothyroidism, and the Risk of Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a highly prevalent disorder leading to heart failure, stroke, and death. Enhanced understanding of modifiable risk factors may yield opportunities for prevention. The risk of AF is increased in subclinical hyperthyroidism, but it is uncertain whether variations in thyroid function within the normal range or subclinical hypothyroidism are also associated with AF.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a systematic review and obtained individual participant data from prospective cohort studies that measured thyroid function at baseline and assessed incident AF. Studies were identified from MEDLINE and EMBASE databases from inception to July 27, 2016. The euthyroid state was defined as thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) 0.45 to 4.49 mIU/L, and subclinical hypothyroidism as TSH 4.5 to 19.9 mIU/L with free thyroxine (fT4) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s within reference range. The association of TSH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s in the euthyroid and subclinical hypothyroid range with incident AF was examined by using Cox proportional hazards models. In euthyroid participants, we additionally examined the association between fT4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s and incident AF.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 30 085 participants from 11 cohorts (278 955 person-years of follow-up), 1958 (6.5%) had subclinical hypothyroidism and 2574 individuals (8.6%) developed AF during follow-up. TSH at baseline was not significantly associated with incident AF in euthyroid participants or those with subclinical hypothyroidism. Higher fT4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s at baseline in euthyroid individuals were associated with increased AF risk in age- and sex-adjusted analyses (hazard ratio, 1.45; 95% confidence interval, 1.26–1.66, for the highest quartile versus the lowest quartile of fT4; <i>P</i> for trend ≤0.001 across quartiles). Estimates did not substantially differ after further adjustment for preexisting cardiovascular disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In euthyroid individuals, higher circulating fT4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s, but not TSH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s, are associated with increased risk of incident AF.</p></sec>

Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinase-C Suppresses cAMP Formation in Human Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Chronic heart failure (HF) is associated with altered signal transduction via β-adrenoceptors and G proteins and with reduced cAMP formation. Nucleoside diphosphate kinases (NDPKs) are enriched at the plasma membrane of patients with end-stage HF, but the functional consequences of this are largely unknown, particularly for NDPK-C. Here, we investigated the potential role of NDPK-C in cardiac cAMP formation and contractility.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Real-time polymerase chain reaction, (far) Western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunocytochemistry were used to study the expression, interaction with G proteins, and localization of NDPKs. cAMP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s were determined with immunoassays or fluorescent resonance energy transfer, and contractility was determined in cardiomyocytes (cell shortening) and in vivo (fractional shortening).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>NDPK-C was essential for the formation of an NDPK-B/G protein complex. Protein and mRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s of NDPK-C were upregulated in end-stage human HF, in rats after long-term isoprenaline stimulation through osmotic minipumps, and after incubation of rat neonatal cardiomyocytes with isoprenaline. Isoprenaline also promoted translocation of NDPK-C to the plasma membrane. Overexpression of NDPK-C in cardiomyocytes increased cAMP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s and sensitized cardiomyocytes to isoprenaline-induced augmentation of contractility, whereas NDPK-C knockdown decreased cAMP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s. In vivo, depletion of NDPK-C in zebrafish embryos caused cardiac edema and ventricular dysfunction. NDPK-B knockout mice had unaltered NDPK-C expression but showed contractile dysfunction and exacerbated cardiac remodeling during long-term isoprenaline stimulation. In human end-stage HF, the complex formation between NDPK-C and Gα<sub>i2</sub> was increased whereas the NDPK-C/Gα<sub>s</sub> interaction was decreased, producing a switch that may contribute to an NDPK-C–dependent cAMP reduction in HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings identify NDPK-C as an essential requirement for both the interaction between NDPK isoforms and between NDPK isoforms and G proteins. NDPK-C is a novel critical regulator of β-adrenoceptor/cAMP signaling and cardiac contractility. By switching from Gα<sub>s</sub> to Gα<sub>i2</sub> activation, NDPK-C may contribute to lower cAMP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s and the related contractile dysfunction in HF.</p></sec>

Suppressing corrosion in primary aluminum–air batteries via oil displacement
<p>Primary aluminum–air batteries boast high theoretical energy densities, but negative electrode corrosion irreversibly limits their shelf life. Most corrosion mitigation methods are insufficient or compromise power and energy density. We suppressed open-circuit corrosion by displacing electrolyte from the electrode surface with a nonconducting oil during battery standby. High power and energy density are enabled by displacing the oil with electrolyte for battery discharge. The underwater-oleophobic wetting properties of the designed cell surfaces allow for reversible oil displacement. We demonstrate this method in an aluminum–air cell that achieves a 420% increase in usable energy density and 99.99% reduction in corrosion, which lowers self-discharge to a rate of 0.02% a month and enables system energy densities of 700 watt-hours per liter and 900 watt-hours per kilogram.</p>

Direct measurements of two-way wave-particle energy transfer in a collisionless space plasma
<p>Particle acceleration by plasma waves and spontaneous wave generation are fundamental energy and momentum exchange processes in collisionless plasmas. Such wave-particle interactions occur ubiquitously in space. We present ultrafast measurements in Earth’s magnetosphere by the Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft that enabled quantitative evaluation of energy transfer in interactions associated with electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves. The observed ion distributions are not symmetric around the magnetic field direction but are in phase with the plasma wave fields. The wave-ion phase relations demonstrate that a cyclotron resonance transferred energy from hot protons to waves, which in turn nonresonantly accelerated cold He<sup>+</sup> to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">energi</span></strong>es up to ~2 kilo–electron volts. These observations provide direct quantitative evidence for collisionless energy transfer in plasmas between distinct particle populations via wave-particle interactions.</p>

Multimessenger observations of a flaring blazar coincident with high-energy neutrino IceCube-170922A
<p>Previous detections of individual astrophysical sources of neutrinos are limited to the Sun and the supernova 1987A, whereas the origins of the diffuse flux of high-energy cosmic neutrinos remain unidentified. On 22 September 2017, we detected a high-energy neutrino, IceCube-170922A, with an energy of ~290 tera–electron volts. Its arrival direction was consistent with the location of a known γ-ray blazar, TXS 0506+056, observed to be in a flaring state. An extensive multiwavelength campaign followed, ranging from radio frequencies to γ-rays. These observations characterize the variability and energetics of the blazar and include the detection of TXS 0506+056 in very-high-energy γ-rays. This observation of a neutrino in spatial coincidence with a γ-ray–emitting blazar during an active phase suggests that blazars may be a source of high-energy neutrinos.</p>

An adipo-biliary-uridine axis that regulates energy homeostasis
<p>Uridine, a pyrimidine nucleoside present at high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s in the plasma of rodents and humans, is critical for RNA synthesis, glycogen deposition, and many other essential cellular processes. It also contributes to systemic metabolism, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We found that plasma uridine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s are regulated by fasting and refeeding in mice, rats, and humans. Fasting increases plasma uridine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s, and this increase relies largely on adipocytes. In contrast, refeeding reduces plasma uridine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s through biliary clearance. Elevation of plasma uridine is required for the drop in body temperature that occurs during fasting. Further, feeding-induced clearance of plasma uridine improves glucose metabolism. We also present findings that implicate leptin signaling in uridine homeostasis and consequent metabolic control and thermoregulation. Our results indicate that plasma uridine governs energy homeostasis and thermoregulation in a mechanism involving adipocyte-dependent uridine biosynthesis and leptin signaling.</p>

Density functional theory is straying from the path toward the exact functional
<p>The theorems at the core of density functional theory (DFT) state that the energy of a many-electron system in its ground state is fully defined by its electron density distribution. This connection is made via the exact functional for the energy, which minimizes at the exact density. For years, DFT development focused on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">energi</span></strong>es, implicitly assuming that functionals producing better <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">energi</span></strong>es become better approximations of the exact functional. We examined the other side of the coin: the energy-minimizing electron densities for atomic species, as produced by 128 historical and modern DFT functionals. We found that these densities became closer to the exact ones, reflecting theoretical advances, until the early 2000s, when this trend was reversed by unconstrained functionals sacrificing physical rigor for the flexibility of empirical fitting.</p>

Vibrationally Promoted Dissociation of Water on Ni(111)
<sec><title>Vibrating Water Apart</title><p>The main route for producing hydrogen for industrial chemical synthesis is steam reforming, in which water and methane react at high temperatures on nickel catalysts to produce hydrogen and carbon dioxide. For both water and methane, the initial dissociation step can be promoted by the translational energy of a molecule as well as its internal vibrational energy, and fundamental studies of these reactions try to determine the relative contributions of these pathways. Although the methane reaction has been well studied, only recently have lasers been available to excite the higher stretching vibrations of water. <bold>Hundt <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 504) now report a joint experimental and theoretical study of D<sub>2</sub>O dissociation on the Ni(111) surface.

Making Epidermal Bladder Cells Bigger: Developmental- and Salinity-Induced Endopolyploidy in a Model Halophyte
<p>Endopolyploidy occurs when DNA replication takes place without subsequent mitotic nuclear division, resulting in cell-specific ploidy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s within tissues. In plants, endopolyploidy plays an important role in sustaining growth and development, but only a few studies have demonstrated a role in abiotic stress response. In this study, we investigated the function of ploidy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong> and nuclear and cell size in leaf expansion throughout development and tracked cell type-specific ploidy in the halophyte <i>Mesembryanthemum crystallinum</i>. In addition to developmental endopolyploidy, we examined the effects of salinity stress on ploidy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>. We focused specifically on epidermal bladder cells (EBC), which are modified balloon-like trichomes, due to their large size and role in salt accumulation. Our results demonstrate that ploidy increases as the leaves expand in a similar manner for each leaf type, and ploidy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s up to 512C were recorded for nuclei in EBC of leaves of adult plants. Salt treatment led to a significant increase in ploidy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s in the EBC, and these cells showed spatially related differences in their ploidy and nuclear and cell size depending on the positions on the leaf and stem surface. Transcriptome analysis highlighted salinity-induced changes in genes involved in DNA replication, cell cycle, endoreduplication, and trichome development in EBC. The increase in cell size and ploidy observed in <i>M. crystallinum</i> under salinity stress may contribute to salt tolerance by increasing the storage capacity for sodium sequestration brought about by higher metabolic activity driving rapid cell enlargement in the leaf tissue and EBC.</p>

Stress-Related Gene Expression Reflects Morphophysiological Responses to Water Deficit
<p>Acclimation to water deficit (WD) enables plants to maintain growth under unfavorable environmental conditions, although the mechanisms are not completely understood. In this study, the natural variation of long-term acclimation to moderate and severe soil WD was investigated in 18 Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) accessions using PHENOPSIS, an automated phenotyping platform. Soil water content was adjusted at an early stage of plant development and maintained at a constant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong> until reproductive age was achieved. The accessions were selected based on the expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s of <i>ANNEXIN1</i>, a drought-related marker. Severe WD conditions had a greater effect on most of the measured morphophysiological traits than moderate WD conditions. Multivariate analyses indicated that trait responses associated with plant size and water management drove most of the variation. Accessions with similar responses at these two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s were grouped in clusters that displayed different response strategies to WD. The expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s of selected stress-response genes revealed large natural variation under WD conditions. Responses of morphophysiological traits, such as projected rosette area, transpiration rate, and rosette water content, were correlated with changes in the expression of stress-related genes, such as <i>NINE-CIS-EPOXYCAROTENOID DIOXYGENASE3</i> and <i>N-MYC DOWNREGULATED-LIKE1</i> (<i>NDL1</i>), in response to WD. Interestingly, the morphophysiological acclimation response to WD also was reflected in the gene expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s (most notably those of <i>NDL1</i>, <i>CHALCONE SYNTHASE</i>, and <i>MYB DOMAIN PROTEIN44</i>) in plants cultivated under well-watered conditions. Our results may lead to the development of biomarkers and predictors of plant morphophysiological responses based on gene expression patterns.</p>

Distinct Mechanisms of the ORANGE Protein in Controlling Carotenoid Flux
<p>β-Carotene adds nutritious value and determines the color of many fruits, including melon (<i>Cucumis melo</i>). In melon mesocarp, β-carotene accumulation is governed by the <i>Orange</i> gene (<i>CmOr</i>) golden single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) through a yet to be discovered mechanism. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), OR increases carotenoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s by posttranscriptionally regulating phytoene synthase (PSY). Here, we identified a <i>CmOr</i> nonsense mutation (<i>Cmor</i>-lowβ) that lowered fruit β-carotene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s with impaired chromoplast biogenesis. <i>Cmor</i>-lowβ exerted a minimal effect on <i>PSY</i> transcripts but dramatically decreased PSY protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s and enzymatic activity, leading to reduced carotenoid metabolic flux and accumulation. However, the golden SNP was discovered to not affect PSY protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s and carotenoid metabolic flux in melon fruit, as shown by carotenoid and immunoblot analyses of selected melon genotypes and by using chemical pathway inhibitors. The high β-carotene accumulation in golden SNP melons was found to be due to a reduced further metabolism of β-carotene. This was revealed by genetic studies with double mutants including <i>carotenoid isomerase</i> (<i>yofi</i>), a carotenoid-isomerase nonsense mutant, which arrests the turnover of prolycopene. The <i>yofi</i> F2 segregants accumulated prolycopene independently of the golden SNP. Moreover, <i>Cmor</i>-lowβ was found to inhibit chromoplast formation and chloroplast disintegration in fruits from 30 d after anthesis until ripening, suggesting that <i>CmOr</i> regulates the chloroplast-to-chromoplast transition. Taken together, our results demonstrate that <i>CmOr</i> is required to achieve PSY protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s to maintain carotenoid biosynthesis metabolic flux but that the mechanism of the <i>CmOr</i> golden SNP involves an inhibited metabolism downstream of β-carotene to dramatically affect both carotenoid content and plastid fate.</p>

Calcium Deficiency Triggers Phloem Remobilization of Cadmium in a Hyperaccumulating Species
<p>Understanding cadmium (Cd) accumulation in plants is critical for the development of plant-based strategies for soil remediation and crop safety. <i>Sedum alfredii</i> is a nonbrassica plant species known to hyperaccumulate Cd. The characteristics of Cd uptake, distribution, and retranslocation affected by the Ca status were investigated at cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s in <i>S. alfredii</i>. Low Ca supply significantly increased Cd contents in shoots of <i>S. alfredii</i>, particularly in the young leaves. Micro x-ray fluorescence images confirmed that sequestration of Cd was greatly enhanced in the young leaves under Ca deficiency stress, with a significant amount of Cd localized in mesophyll cells, compared to the young leaves supplied with high Ca <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s. Cd influx into protoplasts isolated from young leaves was significantly inhibited by the addition of Ca channel inhibitors, but not by pre-exposure to Ca deficiency. In stems, the Cd signal in vascular systems under low Ca <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s was 10-fold higher than in those treated with higher Ca <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s. A detailed investigation of vascular bundles revealed that an extremely high Cd signal induced by low Ca supply occurred in the phloem tissues, but not in the xylem tissues. Transfer of Cd pretreated plants to nutrient solutions at different Ca <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s confirmed that a much higher amount of Cd was reallocated to the new growth tissues under low Ca stress compared to plants supplied with sufficient Ca. These results suggest that Ca deficiency triggered a highly efficient phloem remobilization of Cd in <i>S. alfredii</i> and subsequently enhanced Cd accumulation in its young leaves.</p>

Histone Modifications Define Expression Bias of Homoeologous Genomes in Allotetraploid Cotton
<p>Histone modifications regulate gene expression in eukaryotes, but their roles in gene expression changes in interspecific hybrids or allotetraploids are poorly understood. Histone modifications can be mapped by immunostaining of metaphase chromosomes at the single cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong> and/or by chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) for analyzing individual genes. Here, we comparatively analyzed immunostained metaphase chromosomes and ChIP-seq of individual genes, which revealed a chromatin basis for biased homoeologous gene expression in polyploids. We examined H3K4me3 density and transcriptome maps in root-tip cells of allotetraploid cotton (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>). The overall H3K4me3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s were relatively equal between A and D chromosomes, which were consistent with equal numbers of expressed genes between the two subgenomes. However, intensities per chromosomal area were nearly twice as high in the D homeologs as in the A homeologs. Consistent with the cytological observation, ChIP-seq analysis showed that more D homeologs with biased H3K4me3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s than A homeologs with biased modifications correlated with the greater number of the genes with D-biased expression than that with A-biased expression in most homeologous chromosome pairs. Two chromosomes displayed different expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s compared with other chromosomes, which correlate with known translocations and may affect the local chromatin structure and expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s for the genes involved. This example of genome-wide histone modifications that determine expression bias of homeologous genes in allopolyploids provides a molecular basis for the evolution and domestication of polyploid species, including many important crops.</p>

Free-swimming northern elephant seals have low field metabolic rates that are sensitive to an increased cost of transport
<p>Widely ranging marine predators often adopt stereotyped, energy-saving behaviours to minimize the energetic cost of transport while maximizing energy gain. Environmental and anthropogenic disturbances can disrupt energy balance by prompting avoidance behaviours that increase transport costs, thereby decreasing foraging efficiency. We examined the ability of 12 free-ranging, juvenile northern elephant seals (<i>Mirounga angustirostris</i>) to mitigate the effects of experimentally increased transport costs by modifying their behaviour and/or energy use in a compensatory manner. Under normal locomotion, elephant seals had low energy requirements (106.5±28.2 kJ kg<sup>−1</sup> day<sup>−1</sup>), approaching or even falling below predictions of basal requirements. Seals responded to a small increase in locomotion costs by spending more time resting between dives (149±44 s) compared with matched control treatments (102±11 s; <i>P</i><0.01). Despite incurred costs, most other dive and transit behaviours were conserved across treatments, including fixed, rhythmic swimming gaits. Because of this, and because each flipper stroke had a predictable effect on total costs (<i>P</i><0.001), total energy expenditure was strongly correlated with time spent at sea under both treatments (<i>P</i><0.0001). These results suggest that transiting elephant seals have a limited capacity to modify their locomotory behaviour without increasing their transport costs. Based on this, we conclude that elephant seals and other ocean predators occupying similar niches may be particularly sensitive to increased transport costs incurred when avoiding unanticipated disturbances.</p>

Glycolysis plays an important role in energy transfer from the base to the distal end of the flagellum in mouse sperm
<p>Many studies have been conducted to elucidate the relationship between energy metabolic pathways (glycolysis and respiration) and flagellar motility in mammalian sperm, but the contribution of glycolysis to sperm motility has not yet been fully elucidated. In the present study, we performed detailed analysis of mouse sperm flagellar motility for further understanding of the contribution of glycolysis to mammalian sperm motility. Mouse sperm maintained vigorous motility in the presence of substrates either for glycolysis or for respiration. By contrast, inhibition of glycolysis by alpha-chlorohydrine caused a significant decrease in the bend angle of the flagellar bending wave, sliding velocity of outer doublet microtubules and ATP content even in the presence of respiratory substrates (pyruvate or β-hydroxybutyrate). The decrease of flagellar bend angle and sliding velocity are prominent in the distal part of the flagellum, indicating that glycolysis inhibition caused the decrease in ATP concentration threrein. These results suggest that glycolysis potentially acts as a spatial ATP buffering system, transferring energy (ATP) synthesized by respiration at the mitochondria located in the basal part of the flagellum to the distal part. In order to validate that glycolytic enzymes can transfer high energy phosphoryls, we calculated intraflagellar concentration profiles of adenine nucleotides along the flagellum by computer simulation analysis. The result demonstrated the involvement of glycolysis for maintaining the ATP concentration at the tip of the flagellum. It is likely that glycolysis plays a key role in energy homeostasis in mouse sperm not only through ATP production but also through energy transfer.</p>

Intra- and interspecific challenges modulate cortisol but not androgen levels in a year-round territorial damselfish
<p>Interactions between individuals of different species are commonplace in animal communities. Some behaviors displayed during these interspecific social interactions may be very similar to those displayed during intraspecific social interactions. However, whether functional analogies between intra- and interspecific behaviors translate at the proximate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong> into an overlap in their underlying endocrine mechanisms remains largely unknown. Because steroids both mediate social behaviors and respond to them, we approached this question by comparing the behavioral and steroid response of free-living dusky gregories (<i>Stegastes nigricans</i>) to standardized territorial intrusions (sTI) of either conspecific or heterospecific food competitors. <i>Stegastes nigricans</i> is a year-round territorial fish that ‘cultivates’ the algae on which it feeds and is highly aggressive to both intra- and interspecific intruders. Behavioral differences between intra- and interspecific aggressive responses to sTI were marginal, and sTI tests caused an increase in cortisol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s that was positively related with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s of aggression. In contrast, androgen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s did not increase in response to sTI, yet they showed a positive relationship with agonistic behavior. These results parallel a pattern that was first described for year-round territorial bird species. Furthermore, they suggest that changes in endocrine-hormone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s during territoriality might be independent of the species that induces the territorial response.</p>

Multiple boluses of intravenous tranexamic acid to reduce hidden blood loss and the inflammatory response following enhanced-recovery primary total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy and safety   of multiple boluses of intravenous (IV) tranexamic acid (TXA) on   the hidden blood loss (HBL) and inflammatory response following   primary total hip arthroplasty (THA).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 150 patients were allocated randomly to receive a   single bolus of 20 mg/kg IV TXA before the incision (group A), a   single bolus followed by a second bolus of 1 g IV-TXA three hours   later (group B) or a single bolus followed by two boluses of 1 g   IV-TXA three and six hours later (group C). All patients were treated   using a standard peri-operative enhanced recovery protocol. Primary   outcomes were HBL and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong> of haemoglobin (Hb) as well as the   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s of C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) as markers   of inflammation. Secondary outcomes included the length of stay   in hospital and the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean HBL was significantly lower in group C (402.13 ml standard   deviation (<sc>sd)</sc> 225.97) than group A (679.28 ml<sc> sd</sc> 277.16,   p < 0.001) or B (560.62 ml <sc>sd</sc> 295.22, p = 0.010). The   decrease in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong> of Hb between the pre-operative baseline and   the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong> on the third post-operative day was 30.82 g/L (<sc>sd</sc> 6.31   g/L) in group A, 27.16 g/L (<sc>sd</sc> 6.83) in group B and 21.98   g/L (<sc>sd</sc> 3.72) in group C. This decrease differed significantly   among the three groups (p < 0.01). The mean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong> of CRP was   significantly lower in group C than in the other two groups on the   second (p ≤ 0.034) and third post-operative days (p ≤ 0.014). The   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s of IL-6 were significantly lower in group C than group A   on the first three post-operative days (p = 0.023). The mean length   of stay was significantly lower in group C than group A (p = 0.023).   No VTE or other adverse events occurred.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Multiple boluses of IV-TXA can effectively reduce HBL following   primary THA.

Lower Circulating Folate Induced by a Fidgetin Intronic Variant Is Associated With Reduced Congenital Heart Disease Susceptibility
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Folate deficiency is an independent risk factor for congenital heart disease (CHD); however, the maternal plasma folate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong> is paradoxically not a good diagnostic marker. Genome-wide surveys have identified variants of nonfolate metabolic genes associated with the plasma folate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>, suggesting that these genetic polymorphisms are potential risk factors for CHD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To examine the effects of folate concentration-related variations on CHD risk in the Han Chinese population, we performed 3 independent case-control studies including a total of 1489 patients with CHD and 1745 control subjects. The expression of the Fidgetin (FIGN) was detected in human cardiovascular and decidua tissue specimens with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. The molecular mechanisms were investigated by luciferase reporter assays, surface plasmon resonance, and chromatin immunoprecipitation. FIGN-interacting proteins were confirmed by tandem affinity purification and coimmunoprecipitation. Proteasome activity and metabolite concentrations in the folate pathway were quantified with a commercial proteasome activity assay and immunoassays, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The +94762G>C (rs2119289) variant in intron 4 of the <i>FIGN</i> gene was associated with significant reduction in CHD susceptibility (<i>P</i>=5.1×10<sup>−14</sup> for the allele, <i>P</i>=8.5×10<sup>–−13</sup> for the genotype). Analysis of combined samples indicated that CHD risks in individuals carrying heterozygous (GC) or homozygous (CC) genotypes were reduced by 44% (odds ratio [OR]=0.56; 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.47–0.67) and 66% (OR=0.34; 95% CI=0.23–0.50), respectively, compared with those with the major GG genotype. Minor C allele carriers who had decreased plasma folate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s exhibited significantly increased <i>FIGN</i> expression because the transcription suppressor CREB1 did not bind the alternative promoter of <i>FIGN</i> isoform X3. Mechanistically, increased FIGN expression led to the accumulation of both reduced folate carrier 1 and dihydrofolate reductase via inhibition of their proteasomal degradation, which promoted folate absorption and metabolism.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We report a previously undocumented finding that decreased circulating folate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s induced by increased folate transmembrane transport and utilization, as determined by the <i>FIGN</i> intronic variant, serves as a protective mechanism against CHD. Our results may explain why circulating folate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s do not have a good diagnostic value.</p></sec>

Impact of Smoking on Circulating Cardiac Troponin I Concentrations and Cardiovascular Events in the General Population
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Both tobacco smoking and circulating cardiac troponin I (cTnI) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s are associated with the risk of acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and cardiovascular death. However, whether cTnI <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s differ according to smoking status and whether smoking modifies the prognostic relationship between cTnI and outcomes remain unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using data from a large, population-based cohort, we assessed the association between smoking and cTnI and the impact of smoking on the associations between cTnI <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s and the incidence of acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and cardiovascular death. cTnI was measured with a high-sensitivity assay in 3824 never smokers, 2341 former smokers, and 2550 current smokers participating in the prospective observational HUNT Study (Nord-Trøndelag Health Study). All subjects were free from known prior cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus at baseline.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The age of the participants ranged from 19 to 94 years; 55.5% were women.

We observed an association between increasing concentrations of cTnI and clinical end points in the total study cohort (adjusted hazard ratio per log unit increase in cTnI, 1.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.29–1.54). This association was attenuated for current smokers (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.98–1.40) and was significantly weaker than in never/former smokers (<i>P</i> for interaction=0.003). Prognostic accuracy, as assessed by C statistics, was significantly lower in current smokers than in never smokers (<i>P</i><0.001). In addition, cTnI provided no incremental prognostic information to the Framingham Cardiovascular Disease risk score in current smokers (<i>P</i>=0.08).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Current smoking is associated with lower concentrations of cTnI, suggesting that substances in tobacco smoke may affect cardiomyocyte injury. The association between cTnI <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s and cardiovascular end points is stronger in never/former smokers than in current smokers, compatible with the theory that the detrimental cardiovascular impact of current smoking is mediated via mechanisms other than subclinical myocardial injury.</p></sec>

Reductions in Atherogenic Lipids and Major Cardiovascular Events

However, it is uncertain whether this relationship extends to LDL-C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s <50 mg/dL. We assessed the relationship between additional LDL-C, non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B100 reductions and MACE among patients within the ODYSSEY trials that compared alirocumab with controls (placebo/ezetimibe), mainly as add-on therapy to maximally tolerated statin.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data were pooled from 10 double-blind trials (6699 patient-years of follow-up).

PROHIBITIN3 Forms Complexes with ISOCHORISMATE SYNTHASE1 to Regulate Stress-Induced Salicylic Acid Biosynthesis in Arabidopsis
<p>Salicylic acid (SA) is a major defense signal in plants. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the chloroplast-localized isochorismate pathway is the main source of SA biosynthesis during abiotic stress or pathogen infections. In the first step of the pathway, the enzyme ISOCHORISMATE SYNTHASE1 (ICS1) converts chorismate to isochorismate. An unknown enzyme subsequently converts isochorismate to SA. Here, we show that ICS1 protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s increase during UV-C stress. To identify proteins that may play roles in SA production by regulating ICS1, we analyzed proteins that coimmunoprecipitated with ICS1 via mass spectrometry. The ICS1 complexes contained a large number of peptides from the PROHIBITIN (PHB) protein family, with PHB3 the most abundant. PHB proteins have diverse biological functions that include acting as scaffolds for protein complex formation and stabilization. PHB3 was reported previously to localize to mitochondria. Using fractionation, protease protection, and live imaging, we show that PHB3 also localizes to chloroplasts, where ICS1 resides. Notably, loss of PHB3 function led to decreased ICS1 protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s in response to UV-C stress. However, <i>ICS1</i> transcript <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s remain unchanged, indicating that ICS1 is regulated posttranscriptionally. The <i>phb3</i> mutant displayed reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s of SA, the SA-regulated protein PR1, and hypersensitive cell death in response to UV-C and avirulent strains of <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> and, correspondingly, supported increased growth of <i>P. syringae</i>. The expression of a <i>PHB3</i> transgene in the <i>phb3</i> mutant complemented all of these phenotypes. We suggest a model in which the formation of PHB3-ICS1 complexes stabilizes ICS1 to promote SA production in response to stress.</p>

Signal Dynamics and Interactions during Flooding Stress
<p>Flooding is detrimental for nearly all higher plants, including crops. The compound stress elicited by slow gas exchange and low light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s under water is responsible for both a carbon and an energy crisis ultimately leading to plant death. The endogenous concentrations of four gaseous compounds, oxygen, carbon dioxide, ethylene, and nitric oxide, change during the submergence of plant organs in water. These gases play a pivotal role in signal transduction cascades, leading to adaptive processes such as metabolic adjustments and anatomical features. Of these gases, ethylene is seen as the most consistent, pervasive, and reliable signal of early flooding stress, most likely in tight interaction with the other gases. The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in plant cells during flooding and directly after subsidence, during which the plant is confronted with high light and oxygen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s, is characteristic for this abiotic stress. Low, well-controlled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s of ROS are essential for adaptive signaling pathways, in interaction with the other gaseous flooding signals. On the other hand, excessive uncontrolled bursts of ROS can be highly damaging for plants. Therefore, a fine-tuned balance is important, with a major role for ROS production and scavenging. Our understanding of the temporal dynamics of the four gases and ROS is basal, whereas it is likely that they form a signature readout of prevailing flooding conditions and subsequent adaptive responses.</p>

STOREKEEPER RELATED1/G-Element Binding Protein (STKR1) Interacts with Protein Kinase SnRK1
<p>Sucrose nonfermenting related kinase1 (SnRK1) is a conserved energy sensor kinase that regulates cellular adaptation to energy deficit in plants. Activation of SnRK1 leads to the down-regulation of ATP-consuming biosynthetic processes and the stimulation of energy-generating catabolic reactions by transcriptional reprogramming and posttranslational modifications. Although considerable progress has been made during the last years in understanding the SnRK1 signaling pathway, many of its components remain unidentified. Here, we show that the catalytic α-subunits KIN10 and KIN11 of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) SnRK1 complex interact with the STOREKEEPER RELATED1/G-Element Binding Protein (STKR1) inside the plant cell nucleus. Overexpression of STKR1 in transgenic Arabidopsis plants led to reduced growth, a delay in flowering, and strongly attenuated senescence. Metabolite profiling revealed that the transgenic lines exhausted their carbohydrates during the dark period to a greater extent than the wild type and accumulated a range of amino acids. At the global transcriptome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>, genes affected by STKR1 overexpression were broadly associated with systemic acquired resistance, and transgenic plants showed enhanced resistance toward a virulent strain of the biotrophic oomycete pathogen <i>Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis</i> Noco2. We discuss a possible connection of STKR1 function, SnRK1 signaling, and plant immunity.</p>

Abscisic Acid-Induced Reactive Oxygen Species Are Modulated by Flavonols to Control Stomata Aperture
<p>Abscisic acid (ABA) increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) in guard cells to close Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) stomata. In tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>), we find that ABA-increased ROS is followed by stomatal closure and that both responses are blocked by inhibitors of ROS-producing respiratory burst oxidase enzymes. ABA-induced ROS sensor fluorescence accumulates in the nucleus, chloroplasts, and endomembranes. The accumulation of flavonol antioxidants in guard cells, but not surrounding pavement cells, was visualized by confocal microscopy using a flavonol-specific fluorescent dye. Decreased flavonols in guard cells in the <i>anthocyanin reduced</i> (<i>are</i>) mutant and elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s in the <i>anthocyanin without</i> (<i>aw</i>) mutant were quantified by confocal microscopy and in leaf extracts by mass spectrometry. Consistent with flavonols acting as antioxidants, higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s of ROS were detected in guard cells of the tomato <i>are</i> mutant and lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s were detected in <i>aw</i> both at homeostasis and after treatment with ABA. These results demonstrate the inverse relationship between flavonols and ROS. Guard cells of <i>are</i> show greater ABA-induced closure than the wild type, reduced light-dependent guard cell opening, and reduced water loss, with <i>aw</i> having opposite responses. Ethylene treatment of wild-type tomato plants increased flavonol accumulation in guard cells; however, no flavonol increases were observed in <i>Neverripe</i> (<i>Nr</i>), an ethylene receptor mutant. Consistent with lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s of ROS due to elevated flavonols, ethylene treatments decreased ABA-induced stomatal closure in the wild type, but not <i>Nr</i>, with ethylene responses attenuated in the <i>are</i> mutant. Together, these results are consistent with flavonols dampening the ABA-dependent ROS burst that drives stomatal closure and facilitating stomatal opening to modulate leaf gas exchange.</p>

Leaf and Plant Age Affects Photosynthetic Performance and Photoprotective Capacity
<p>In this work, we studied the changes in high-light tolerance and photosynthetic activity in leaves of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) rosette throughout the vegetative stage of growth. We implemented an image-analysis work flow to analyze the capacity of both the whole plant and individual leaves to cope with excess excitation energy by following the changes in absorbed light energy partitioning. The data show that leaf and plant age are both important factors influencing the fate of excitation energy. During the dark-to-light transition, the age of the plant affects mostly steady-state <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s of photochemical and nonphotochemical quenching, leading to an increased photosynthetic performance of its leaves. The age of the leaf affects the induction kinetics of nonphotochemical quenching. These observations were confirmed using model selection procedures. We further investigated how different leaves on a rosette acclimate to high light and show that younger leaves are less prone to photoinhibition than older leaves. Our results stress that both plant and leaf age should be taken into consideration during the quantification of photosynthetic and photoprotective traits to produce repeatable and reliable results.</p>

Autophagy Deficiency Compromises Alternative Pathways of Respiration following Energy Deprivation in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>Under heterotrophic conditions, carbohydrate oxidation inside the mitochondrion is the primary energy source for cellular metabolism. However, during energy-limited conditions, alternative substrates are required to support respiration. Amino acid oxidation in plant cells plays a key role in this by generating electrons that can be transferred to the mitochondrial electron transport chain via the electron transfer flavoprotein/ubiquinone oxidoreductase system. Autophagy, a catabolic mechanism for macromolecule and protein recycling, allows the maintenance of amino acid pools and nutrient remobilization. Although the association between autophagy and alternative respiratory substrates has been suggested, the extent to which autophagy and primary metabolism interact to support plant respiration remains unclear. To investigate the metabolic importance of autophagy during development and under extended darkness, Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants with disruption of autophagy (<i>atg</i> mutants) were used. Under normal growth conditions, <i>atg</i> mutants showed lower growth and seed production with no impact on photosynthesis. Following extended darkness, <i>atg</i> mutants were characterized by signatures of early senescence, including decreased chlorophyll content and maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II coupled with increases in dark respiration. Transcript <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s of genes involved in alternative pathways of respiration and amino acid catabolism were up-regulated in <i>atg</i> mutants. The metabolite profiles of dark-treated leaves revealed an extensive metabolic reprogramming in which increases in amino acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s were partially compromised in <i>atg</i> mutants. Although an enhanced respiration in <i>atg</i> mutants was observed during extended darkness, autophagy deficiency compromises protein degradation and the generation of amino acids used as alternative substrates to the respiration.</p>

A Rice NAC Transcription Factor Promotes Leaf Senescence via ABA Biosynthesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>It is well known that abscisic acid (ABA)-induced leaf senescence and premature leaf senescence negatively affect the yield of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). However, the molecular mechanism underlying this relationship, especially the upstream transcriptional network that modulates ABA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong> during leaf senescence, remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate a rice NAC transcription factor, OsNAC2, that participates in ABA-induced leaf senescence. Overexpression of <i>OsNAC2</i> dramatically accelerated leaf senescence, whereas its knockdown lines showed a delay in leaf senescence. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative PCR, dual-luciferase, and yeast one-hybrid assays demonstrated that OsNAC2 directly activates expression of chlorophyll degradation genes, <i>OsSGR</i> and <i>OsNYC3</i>. Moreover, ectopic expression of <i>OsNAC2</i> leads to an increase in ABA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s via directly up-regulating expression of ABA biosynthetic genes (<i>OsNCED3</i> and <i>OsZEP1</i>) as well as down-regulating the ABA catabolic gene (<i>OsABA8ox1</i>). Interestingly, <i>OsNAC2</i> is upregulated by a lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong> of ABA but downregulated by a higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong> of ABA, indicating a feedback repression of <i>OsNAC2</i> by ABA. Additionally, reduced <i>OsNAC2</i> expression leads to about 10% increase in the grain yield of RNAi lines. The novel ABA-NAC-SAGs regulatory module might provide a new insight into the molecular action of ABA to enhance leaf senescence and elucidates the transcriptional network of ABA production during leaf senescence in rice.</p>

Phospholipase Dζ Enhances Diacylglycerol Flux into Triacylglycerol<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plant seeds are the primary source of triacylglycerols (TAG) for food, feed, fuel, and industrial applications. As TAG is produced from diacylglycerol (DAG), successful engineering strategies to enhance TAG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s have focused on the conversion of DAG to TAG. However, the production of TAG can be limited by flux through the enzymatic reactions that supply DAG. In this study, two <i>Arabidopsis phospholipase D</i><sub>ζ</sub> genes (<i>AtPLD<sub>ζ1</sub></i> and <i>AtPLD<sub>ζ2</sub></i>) were coexpressed in <i>Camelina sativa</i> to test whether the conversion of phosphatidylcholine to DAG impacts TAG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s in seeds. The resulting transgenic plants produced 2% to 3% more TAG as a component of total seed biomass and had increased 18:3 and 20:1 fatty acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s relative to wild type. Increased DAG and decreased PC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s were examined through the kinetics of lipid assembly by [<sup>14</sup>C]acetate and [<sup>14</sup>C]glycerol incorporation into glycerolipids. [<sup>14</sup>C]acetate was rapidly incorporated into TAG in both wild-type and overexpression lines, indicating a significant flux of nascent and elongated acyl-CoAs into the <i>sn</i>-3 position of TAG. Stereochemical analysis revealed that newly synthesized fatty acids were preferentially incorporated into the <i>sn</i>-2 position of PC, but the <i>sn</i>-1 position of de novo DAG and indicated similar rates of nascent acyl groups into the Kennedy pathway and acyl editing. [<sup>14</sup>C]glycerol studies demonstrated PC-derived DAG is the major source of DAG for TAG synthesis in both tissues. The results emphasize that the interconversions of DAG and PC pools can impact oil production and composition.</p>

Aldehyde Oxidase 4 Plays a Critical Role in Delaying Silique Senescence by Catalyzing Aldehyde Detoxification
<p>The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) aldehyde oxidases are a multigene family of four oxidases (AAO1–AAO4) that oxidize a variety of aldehydes, among them abscisic aldehyde, which is oxidized to the phytohormone abscisic acid. Toxic aldehydes are generated in plants both under normal conditions and in response to stress. The detoxification of such aldehydes by oxidation is attributed to aldehyde dehydrogenases but never to aldehyde oxidases. The feasibility of the detoxification of aldehydes in siliques via oxidation by AAO4 was demonstrated, first, by its ability to efficiently oxidize an array of aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes, including the reactive carbonyl species (RCS) acrolein, hydroxyl-2-nonenal, and malondialdehyde. Next, exogenous application of several aldehydes to siliques in AAO4 knockout (KO) Arabidopsis plants induced severe tissue damage and enhanced malondialdehyde <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s and senescence symptoms, but not in wild-type siliques. Furthermore, abiotic stresses such as dark and ultraviolet C irradiation caused an increase in endogenous RCS and higher expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s of senescence marker genes, leading to premature senescence of KO siliques, whereas RCS and senescence marker <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s in wild-type siliques were hardly affected. Finally, in naturally senesced KO siliques, higher endogenous RCS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s were associated with enhanced senescence molecular markers, chlorophyll degradation, and earlier seed shattering compared with the wild type. The aldehyde-dependent differential generation of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide by AAO4 and the induction of AAO4 expression by hydrogen peroxide shown here suggest a self-amplification mechanism for detoxifying additional reactive aldehydes produced during stress. Taken together, our results indicate that AAO4 plays a critical role in delaying senescence in siliques by catalyzing aldehyde detoxification.</p>

Transcriptional Gene Silencing Maintained by OTS1 SUMO Protease Requires a DNA-Dependent Polymerase V-Dependent Pathway
<p>The expression of genes with aberrant structure is prevented at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s. Aberrant gene silencing at the posttranscriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong> is well studied; however, it is not well understood how aberrant genes are silenced at the transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>. In this study, through genetic screening a transgenic report line that harbors an aberrant gene (<i>35S-LUC</i>, lacking 3′-untranslated region [3′-UTR]) and lacks luciferase (LUC) activity, we identify that the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) protease <i>OTS1</i> gene is required for maintaining the silence of the reporter <i>35S-LUC</i> and an endogenous mutator-like element <i>MULE-F19G14</i> at the transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>, which requires DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Pol) V and DDR complex, but not Pol IV. The increased transcripts in <i>ots1</i> mutants are terminated by the 3′-UTRs of downstream genes. In addition to <i>ots1</i> mutations, mutations in several known or putative SUMO proteases and two SUMO E3 ligases, <i>SIZ1</i> and <i>MMS21</i>, have similar effects on this silencing regulation. Taken together, our results reveal that the enzymes involved in the SUMOylation process restrain aberrant gene transcription by using a downstream gene 3′-UTR, and this regulation requires a functional Pol V-dependent pathway in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>).</p>

Impaired Cyclic Electron Flow around Photosystem I Disturbs High-Light Respiratory Metabolism
<p>The cyclic electron flow around photosystem I (CEF-PSI) increases ATP/NADPH production in the chloroplast, acting as an energy balance mechanism. Higher export of reducing power from the chloroplast in CEF-PSI mutants has been correlated with higher mitochondrial alternative oxidase (AOX) capacity and protein amount under high-light (HL) conditions. However, in vivo measurements of AOX activity are still required to confirm the exact role of AOX in dissipating the excess of reductant power from the chloroplast. Here, CEF-PSI single and double mutants were exposed to short-term HL conditions in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Chlorophyll fluorescence, in vivo activities of the cytochrome oxidase (ν<sub>cyt</sub>) and AOX (ν<sub>alt</sub>) pathways, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s of mitochondrial proteins, metabolite profiles, and pyridine nucleotide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s were determined under normal growth and HL conditions. ν<sub>alt</sub> was not increased in CEF-PSI mutants, while AOX capacity was positively correlated with photoinhibition, probably due to a reactive oxygen species-induced increase of AOX protein. The severe metabolic impairment observed in CEF-PSI mutants, as indicated by the increase in photoinhibition and changes in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s of stress-related metabolites, can explain their lack of ν<sub>alt</sub> induction. By contrast, ν<sub>cyt</sub> was positively correlated with photosynthetic performance. Correlations with metabolite changes suggest that ν<sub>cyt</sub> is coordinated with sugar metabolism and stress-related amino acid synthesis. Furthermore, changes in glycine-serine and NADH-NAD<sup>+</sup> ratios were highly correlated to ν<sub>cyt</sub>. Taken together, our results suggest that ν<sub>cyt</sub> can act as a sink for the excess of electrons from the chloroplast, probably via photorespiratory glycine oxidation, thus improving photosynthetic performance when ν<sub>alt</sub> is not induced under severe HL stress.</p>

Recovery of otoacoustic emissions after high-level noise exposure in the American bullfrog
<p>The American bullfrog (<i>Rana catesbeiana</i>) has an amphibian papilla (AP) that senses airborne, low-frequency sound and generates distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) similar to other vertebrate species. Although ranid frogs are typically found in noisy environments, the effects of noise on the AP have not been studied. First, we determined the noise <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s that diminished DPOAE at 2<i>f</i><sub>1</sub>–<i>f</i><sub>2</sub> using an <i>f</i><sub>2</sub> stimulus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong> at 80 dB SPL and that also produced morphological damage of the sensory epithelium. Second, we compared DPOAE (2<i>f</i><sub>1</sub>–<i>f</i><sub>2</sub>) responses with histopathologic changes occurring in bullfrogs after noise exposure. Consistent morphological damage, such as fragmented hair cells and missing bundles, as well as elimination of DPOAE responses were seen only after very high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong> (>150 dB SPL) sound exposures. The morphological response of hair cells to noise differed along the mediolateral AP axis: medial hair cells were sensitive to noise and lateral hair cells were relatively insensitive to noise. Renewed or repaired hair cells were not observed until 9 days post-exposure. Following noise exposure, DPOAE responses disappeared within 24 h and then recovered to normal pre-exposure <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s within 3–4 days. Our results suggest that DPOAEs in the bullfrog are sensitive to the initial period of hair cell damage. After noise-induced damage, the bullfrog AP has functional recovery mechanisms that do not depend on substantial hair cell regeneration or repair. Thus, the bullfrog auditory system might serve as an interesting model for investigation of ways to prevent noise damage.</p>

Neurohormonal changes associated with ritualized combat and the formation of a reproductive hierarchy in the ant <i>Harpegnathos saltator</i>
<p>Dominance rank in animal societies is correlated with changes in both reproductive physiology and behavior. In some social insects, dominance status is used to determine a reproductive division of labor, where a few colony members reproduce while most remain functionally sterile. Changes in reproduction and behavior in this context must be coordinated through crosstalk between the brain and the reproductive system. We investigated a role for biogenic amines in forming this connection in the ant <i>Harpegnathos saltator</i>. In this species, workers engage in an elaborate dominance tournament to establish a group of reproductive workers termed gamergates. We analyzed biogenic amine content in the brains of gamergates, inside-workers and foragers under stable colony conditions and found that gamergates had the highest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s of dopamine. Dopamine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s were also positively correlated with increased ovarian activity among gamergates. Next, we experimentally induced workers to compete in a reproductive tournament to determine how dopamine may be involved in the establishment of a new hierarchy. Dopamine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s rose in aggressive workers at the start of a tournament, while workers that were policed by their nestmates (a behavior that inhibits ovarian activity) showed a rapid decline in dopamine. In addition to dopamine, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">level</span></strong>s of serotonin and tyramine differed among castes, and these changes could contribute to differences in caste-specific behavioral patterns observed among non-reproductive workers. Overall, these results provide support that biogenic amines link changes in behavior and dominance with reproductive activity in <i>H. saltator</i> as well as drive differences in worker task performance.</p>

Is gastrointestinal plasticity in king quail (<i>Coturnix chinensis</i>) elicited by diet-fibre or diet-energy dilution?
<p>Phenotypic plasticity of organ size allows some animals to manage fluctuations of resource quality or availability. Here, we examined the phenotypic plasticity of the gastrointestinal tract of king quail (<i>Coturnix chinensis</i>) in a diet-fibre manipulation study. Quail were offered either a control low-fibre (high-quality) food (8.5% neutral-detergent fibre; NDF), or one of two experimental diets of higher fibre contents of 16% NDF (i.e. low-quality food). To examine whether phenotypic plasticity of organ size was associated with the fibre content per se, or as a consequence of diluting the diet energy contents by adding fibre, one of the high-fibre feeds was ‘balanced’ with additional energy to match that of the low-fibre control diet. Total empty dry mass of the gastrointestinal tract was significantly heavier among birds offered the unbalanced high-fibre diet as compared with those offered the control diet, with birds offered the fibrous but energy-balanced diet having guts of intermediate size. The heavier entire-gut mass (dry) of quail offered the unbalanced high-fibre diet was associated mainly with these birds having significantly heavier gizzards. Notably, the larger gizzard in the birds offered the unbalanced high-fibre diet was associated with marked increases in their metabolisability (digestion) of diet fibre. Our findings suggest that the available energy in the diet may be more important for eliciting phenotypic changes in the gut of these herbivorous birds rather than simple physical effects of diet fibre on feed intakes or on muscular compensation to fibrous ingesta.</p>

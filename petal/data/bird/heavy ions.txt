Mid-term changes in blood metal ion levels after Articular Surface Replacement arthroplasty of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Our first aim was to determine whether there are significant   changes in the level of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in the blood at mid-term follow-up,   in patients with an Articular Surface Replacement (ASR) arthroplasty.   Secondly, we sought to identify risk factors for any increases.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The study involved 435 patients who underwent unilateral, metal-on-metal   (MoM) hip resurfacing (HRA) or total hip arthroplasty (THA). These   patients all had one measurement of the level of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in the   blood before seven years had passed post-operatively (early evaluat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>)   and one after seven years had passed post-operatively (mid-term evaluat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>).   Changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> levels were tested using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test.   We identified subgroups at the highest risk of increase using a   multivariable linear logistic regress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were significant increases in the levels of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s   for patients who underwent both MoM HRA (Chromium (Cr): 0.5 parts   per bill<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (ppb); Cobalt (Co): 1.1 ppb) and MoM THA (Cr: 0.5 ppb;   Co: 0.7 ppb). In a multivariable model considering MoM HRAs, the   change in the levels of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s was influenced by female gender   (Co: Odds Ratio (OR) 1.42; p = 0.002 and Cr: OR 1.08; p = 0.006).   The change was found to be irrespective of the initial level for   the MoM HRAs, whereas there was a negative relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship between   the initial level and the change in the level for those with a MoM   THA (Co: OR -0.43; p < 0.001 and Cr: OR -0.14; p = 0.033).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong></title><p>The levels of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in the blood increase significantly   over the period until mid-term follow-up in patients with both a   MoM HRA and those with a MoM THA. We recommend that the levels of   metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s be measured most frequently for women with a MoM HRA.   While those with a MoM THA appear to stabilise at a certain level,   the accuracy of this trend is not yet clear. Vigilant follow-up   is still recommended. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B(4   Supple B):33–40.</p></sec>

Room-temperature cycling of metal fluoride electrodes: Liquid electrolytes for high-energy fluoride ion cells
<p>Fluoride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> batteries are potential “next-generat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>” electrochemical storage devices that offer high energy density. At present, such batteries are limited to operat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> at high temperatures because suitable fluoride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>–conducting electrolytes are known only in the solid state. We report a liquid fluoride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>–conducting electrolyte with high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ic conductivity, wide operating voltage, and robust chemical stability based on dry tetraalkylammonium fluoride salts in ether solvents. Pairing this liquid electrolyte with a copper–lanthanum trifluoride (Cu@LaF<sub>3</sub>) core-shell cathode, we demonstrate reversible fluorinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and defluorinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in a fluoride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> electrochemical cell cycled at room temperature.

Risk factors for wear-related failures after hip resurfacing in patients with a low contact patch to rim distance
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>A contact patch to rim (CPR) distance of < 10 mm has been   associated with edge-loading and excessive wear. However, not all   arthroplasties with a low CPR distance show problems with wear.

Chloride Sensing by WNK1 Involves Inhibition of Autophosphorylation
<sec><title>Inhibited by Chloride in the Active Site</title><p>Chloride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s are essential for regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of blood pressure and electrolyte homeostasis.

An evolutionarily conserved gene family encodes proton-selective ion channels
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels form the basis for cellular electrical signaling. Despite the scores of genetically identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels selective for other monatomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, only one type of proton-selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel has been found in eukaryotic cells. By comparative transcriptome analysis of mouse taste receptor cells, we identified Otopetrin1 (OTOP1), a protein required for development of gravity-sensing otoconia in the vestibular system, as forming a proton-selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel. We found that murine OTOP1 is enriched in acid-detecting taste receptor cells and is required for their zinc-sensitive proton conductance. Two related murine genes, <i>Otop2</i> and <i>Otop3</i>, and a <i>Drosophila</i> ortholog also encode proton channels. Evolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ary conservat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the gene family and its widespread tissue distribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> suggest a broad role for proton channels in physiology and pathophysiology.</p>

Dynamic multinuclear sites formed by mobilized copper ions in NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> selective catalytic reduction
<p>Copper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s exchanged into zeolites are active for the selective catalytic reduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (SCR) of nitrogen oxides (NO<i><sub>x</sub></i>) with ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), but the low-temperature rate dependence on copper (Cu) volumetric density is inconsistent with react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> at single sites. We combine steady-state and transient kinetic measurements, x-ray absorpt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> spectroscopy, and first-principles calculat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s to demonstrate that under react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, mobilized Cu <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s can travel through zeolite windows and form transient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> pairs that participate in an oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>)–mediated Cu<sup>I</sup>→Cu<sup>II</sup> redox step integral to SCR. Electrostatic tethering to framework aluminum centers limits the volume that each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> can explore and thus its capacity to form an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> pair. The dynamic, reversible format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of multinuclear sites from mobilized single atoms represents a distinct phenomenon that falls outside the convent<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al boundaries of a heterogeneous or homogeneous catalyst.</p>

The ion channel TRPM7 is required for B cell lymphopoiesis
<p>The transient receptor potential (TRP) family is a large family of widely expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels that regulate the intracellular concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and metals and respond to various chemical and physical stimuli. TRP subfamily M member 7 (TRPM7) is unusual in that it contains both an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel and a kinase domain. TRPM7 is a divalent cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel with preference for Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>. It is required for the survival of DT40 cells, a B cell line; however, delet<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of TRPM7 in T cells does not impair their development. We found that express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of TRPM7 was required for B cell development in mice. Mice that lacked TRPM7 in B cells failed to generate peripheral B cells because of a developmental block at the pro-B cell stage. The loss of TRPM7 kinase activity alone did not affect the proport<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of peripheral mature B cells or the development of B cells in the bone marrow. However, supplementat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with a high concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> partially rescued the development of TRPM7-deficient B cells in vitro. Thus, our findings identify a critical role for TRPM7 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel activity in B cell development.</p>

Identification of site-specific isotopic labels by vibrational spectroscopy in the electron microscope
<p>The identificat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>ic labels by convent<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al macroscopic techniques lacks spatial resolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and requires relatively large quantities of material for measurements.

The Hydrogen Isotope Composition δ<sup>2</sup>H Reflects Plant Performance
<p>The stable carbon (δ<sup>13</sup>C) and oxygen (δ<sup>18</sup>O) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>e composit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in plant matter reflect photosynthetic and transpirative condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in plants, respectively. However, the nature of hydrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>e composit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (δ<sup>2</sup>H) and what it reflects of plant performance is poorly understood. Using durum wheat (<i>Triticum turgidum</i> var <i>durum</i>), this study evaluated the effect of different water and nitrogen growing field condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s on transpirat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and how this effect influenced the performance of δ<sup>2</sup>H in autotrophic (flag leaf), mixotrophic (ears), and heterotrophic (grains and roots) organs. Moreover, δ<sup>2</sup>H was compared with the δ<sup>13</sup>C and δ<sup>18</sup>O in the same organs. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>e composit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s were analyzed in dry matter, the water-soluble fract<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, and in water from different tissues of a set of genotypes. Similar to δ<sup>13</sup>C, the δ<sup>2</sup>H correlated negatively with stomatal conductance, whereas no correlat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> was observed for δ<sup>18</sup>O. Moreover, δ<sup>2</sup>H was not only affected by changes in transpirat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> but also by photosynthetic react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, probably as a consequence of NADPH format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in autotrophic organs. Compared with the δ<sup>2</sup>H of stem water, plant δ<sup>2</sup>H was strongly diminished in photosynthetic organs such as the flag leaves, whereas it strongly increased in heterotrophic organs such as grains and roots. In heterotrophic organs, δ<sup>2</sup>H was associated with postphotosynthetic effects because there are several processes that lead to <sup>2</sup>H-enrichment of carbohydrates. In summary, δ<sup>2</sup>H exhibited specific features that inform about the water condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of the wheat crop, together with the photosynthetic characteristics of the plant part considered. Moreover, correlat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of δ<sup>2</sup>H with grain yield illustrate that this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>e can be used to assess plant performance under different growing condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s.</p>

Rapid cold hardening improves recovery of ion homeostasis and chill coma recovery time in the migratory locust, <i>Locusta migratoria</i>
<p>Chill tolerance of insects is defined as the ability to tolerate low temperature under circumstances not involving freezing of intracellular or extracellular fluids. For many insects chill tolerance is crucial for their ability to persist in cold environments and mounting evidence indicates that chill tolerance is associated with the ability to maintain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and water homeostasis, thereby ensuring muscular funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and preventing chill injury at low temperature. The present study describes the relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship between muscle and haemolymph <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis and time to regain posture following cold shock (CS, 2 h at −4°C) in the chill-susceptible locust <i>Locusta migratoria</i>. This relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship was examined in animals with and without a prior rapid cold-hardening treatment (RCH, 2 h at 0°C) to investigate the physiological underpinnings of RCH. CS elicited a doubling of haemolymph [K<sup>+</sup>] and this disturbance was greater in locusts pre-exposed to RCH. Recovery of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis was, however, markedly faster in RCH-treated animals, which correlated well with whole-organism performance as hardened individuals regained posture faster than non-hardened individuals following CS. The present study indicates that loss and recovery of muscular funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> are associated with the resting membrane potential of excitable membranes as attested by the changes in the equilibrium potential for K<sup>+</sup> (<i>E</i><sub>K</sub>) following CS. Both hardened and non-hardened animals regained movement once K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis had recovered to a fixed level (<i>E</i><sub>K</sub>≈−41 mV). RCH is therefore not associated with altered sensitivity to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> disturbance but instead is correlated to a faster recovery of haemolymph [K<sup>+</sup>].</p>

There is, however, one technical limitat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>: Light-gated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels are typically stimulated with blue-green light, which is heavily scattered by tissue. Thus, deep brain stimulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, focused on small reg<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, is a major challenge. On page 679 of this issue, Chen <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) use transgenic mice implanted with upconverting nanoparticles (NPs) to locally activate light-gated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels and modulate neuronal activity, even deep inside the brain. This method might eventually lead the way for clinical applicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s to optically control neuronal dysfunct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, such as Parkinson's disease or even paralysis.</p>

Size effect in ion transport through angstrom-scale slits
<p>In the field of nanofluidics, it has been an ultimate but seemingly distant goal to controllably fabricate capillaries with dimens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s approaching the size of small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and water molecules. We report <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> transport through ultimately narrow slits that are fabricated by effectively removing a single atomic plane from a bulk crystal. The atomically flat angstrom-scale slits exhibit little surface charge, allowing elucidat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the role of steric effects. We find that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s with hydrated diameters larger than the slit size can still permeate through, albeit with reduced mobility. The confinement also leads to a notable asymmetry between an<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of the same diameter. Our results provide a platform for studying the effects of angstrom-scale confinement, which is important for the development of nanofluidics, molecular separat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, and other nanoscale technologies.</p>

Remobilization of crustal carbon may dominate volcanic arc emissions
<p>The flux of carbon into and out of Earth’s surface environment has implicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s for Earth’s climate and habitability. We compiled a global data set for carbon and helium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>es from volcanic arcs and demonstrated that the carbon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>e composit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of mean global volcanic gas is considerably heavier, at –3.8 to –4.6 per mil (‰), than the canonical mid-ocean ridge basalt value of –6.0‰. The largest volcanic emitters outgas carbon with higher δ<sup>13</sup>C and are located in mature continental arcs that have accreted carbonate platforms, indicating that reworking of crustal limestone is an important source of volcanic carbon. The fract<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al burial of organic carbon is lower than tradit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ally determined from a global carbon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>e mass balance and may have varied over geological time, modulated by supercontinent format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and breakup.</p>

Tungsten-182 heterogeneity in modern ocean island basalts
<p>New tungsten <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>e data for modern ocean island basalts (OIB) from Hawaii, Samoa, and Iceland reveal variable <sup>182</sup>W/<sup>184</sup>W, ranging from that of the ambient upper mantle to ratios as much as 18 parts per mill<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> lower. The tungsten <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>ic data negatively correlate with <sup>3</sup>He/<sup>4</sup>He. These data indicate that each OIB system accesses domains within Earth that formed within the first 60 mill<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> years of solar system history. Combined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>ic and chemical characteristics projected for these ancient domains indicate that they contain metal and are repositories of noble gases. We suggest that the most likely source candidates are mega–ultralow-velocity zones, which lie beneath Hawaii, Samoa, and Iceland but not beneath hot spots whose OIB yield normal <sup>182</sup>W and homogeneously low <sup>3</sup>He/<sup>4</sup>He.</p>

A peptide hormone required for Casparian strip diffusion barrier formation in <i>Arabidopsis</i> roots
<p>Plants achieve mineral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis by means of a hydrophobic barrier on endodermal cells called the Casparian strip, which restricts lateral diffus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s between the root vascular bundles and the soil. We identified a family of sulfated peptides required for contiguous Casparian strip format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in <i>Arabidopsis</i> roots. These peptide hormones, which we named Casparian strip integrity factor 1 (CIF1) and CIF2, are expressed in the root stele and specifically bind the endodermis-expressed leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase GASSHO1 (GSO1)/SCHENGEN3 and its homolog, GSO2. A mutant devoid of CIF peptides is defective in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis in the xylem. <i>CIF</i> genes are environmentally responsive. Casparian strip regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is not merely a passive process driven by root developmental cues; it also serves as an active strategy to cope with adverse soil condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s.</p>

Global atmospheric particle formation from CERN CLOUD measurements
<p>Fundamental quest<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s remain about the origin of newly formed atmospheric aerosol particles because data from laboratory measurements have been insufficient to build global models. In contrast, gas-phase chemistry models have been based on laboratory kinetics measurements for decades. We built a global model of aerosol format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> by using extensive laboratory measurements of rates of nucleat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> involving sulfuric acid, ammonia, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, and organic compounds conducted in the CERN CLOUD (Cosmics Leaving Outdoor Droplets) chamber.

A new potassium ion current induced by stimulation of M<sub>2</sub> cholinoreceptors in fish atrial myocytes
<p>A novel potassium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> current induced by muscarinic stimulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (<i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>) is characterized in atrial cardiomyocytes of teleost fishes (crucian carp, <i>Carassius carassius</i>; rainbow trout, <i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>) by means of the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. The current is elicited in atrial, but not ventricular, cells by applicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of carbamylcholine (CCh) in moderate to high concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s (10<sup>−7</sup>–10<sup>−4</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>). It can be distinguished from the classic <i>I</i><sub>KACh</sub>, activated by the βγ-subunit of the G<sub>i</sub>-protein, because of its low sensitivity to Ba<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and distinct current–voltage relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship with a very small inward current component. Ni<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s (5 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>) and KB-R7943 (10<sup>−5</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>), non-selective blockers of the sodium–calcium exchange current (<i>I</i><sub>NCX</sub>), strongly reduced and completely abolished, respectively, the <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>. Therefore, <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub> was initially regarded as a CCh-induced outward component of the <i>I</i><sub>NCX</sub>. However, the current is not affected by either exclus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> or extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but is completely abolished by intracellular perfus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with K<sup>+</sup>-free solut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Atropine (10<sup>−6</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>), a non-selective muscarinic blocker, completely eliminated the <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>. A selective antagonist of M<sub>2</sub> cholinoreceptors, AF-DX 116 (2×10<sup>−7</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>) and an M<sub>3</sub> antagonist, 4-DAMP (10<sup>−9</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>), decreased <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub> by 84.4% and 16.6%, respectively. Pertussis toxin, which irreversibly inhibits G<sub>i</sub>-protein coupled to M<sub>2</sub> receptors, reduced the current by 95%, when applied into the pipette solut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. It is concluded that <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>, induced by stimulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of M<sub>2</sub> cholinoceptors and subsequent G<sub>i</sub>-protein activat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, represents a new molecular target for the cardiac parasympathetic innervat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>.</p>

Temperature-activated ion channels in neural crest cells confer maternal fever–associated birth defects
<p>Birth defects of the heart and face are common, and most have no known genetic cause, suggesting a role for environmental factors. Maternal fever during the first trimester is an environmental risk factor linked to these defects. Neural crest cells are precursor populat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s essential to the development of both at-risk tissues. We report that two heat-activated transient receptor potential (TRP) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels, TRPV1 and TRPV4, were present in neural crest cells during critical windows of heart and face development. TRPV1 antagonists protected against the development of hyperthermia-induced defects in chick embryos. Treatment with chemical agonists of TRPV1 or TRPV4 replicated hyperthermia-induced birth defects in chick and zebrafish embryos. To test whether transient TRPV channel permeability in neural crest cells was sufficient to induce these defects, we engineered iron-binding modificat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s to TRPV1 and TRPV4 that enabled remote and noninvasive activat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of these channels in specific cellular locat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and at specific developmental times in chick embryos with radio-frequency electromagnetic fields. Transient stimulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of radio frequency–controlled TRP channels in neural crest cells replicated fever-associated defects in developing chick embryos. Our data provide a previously undescribed mechanism for congenital defects, whereby hyperthermia activates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels that negatively affect fetal development.</p>

Large-area graphene-nanomesh/carbon-nanotube hybrid membranes for ionic and molecular nanofiltration

We report a large-area graphene-nanomesh/single-walled carbon nanotube (GNM/SWNT) hybrid membrane with excellent mechanical strength while fully capturing the merit of atomically thin membranes.

Complete steric exclusion of ions and proton transport through confined monolayer water

Laser cooling of ions in a neutral plasma

By using an ultracold neutral plasma created by photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>izat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of an ultracold atomic gas, we avoid this obstacle and demonstrate laser cooling of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in a neutral plasma.

Unusual transcription factor protects against heart failure
<p>The heart pumps blood to the rest of the body in a coordinated and steadfast manner. This pumping funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is achieved through synchronous contract<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of bill<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of cardiomyocytes (heart muscle cells), which is governed by phasic increases in intracellular calcium. As such, cardiomyocytes have evolved intricate cellular structures that tightly couple external electrical impulses to the triggering of calcium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> release from intracellular stores and subsequent activat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of force-producing proteins, a process termed excitat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>-contract<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (E-C) coupling. A key component of this molecular ultrastructure is the cardiac dyad, a microdomain that juxtaposes the plasma membrane L-type calcium channel with the calcium-sensitive ryanodine receptor (RyR) channel complex, the molecular gatekeeper for the release of calcium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s from sarcoplasmic reticulum stores in cardiomyocytes. The cardiac dyad is physically stabilized by a membrane-associated scaffold protein called junctophilin-2 (JP2), which facilitates physiologic calcium release during E-C coupling. Excessive stress or injury to cardiomyocytes results in defective E-C coupling, reduced pumping capacity, and the clinical syndrome of heart failure, a leading cause of death worldwide. On page 1375 of this issue, Guo <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) report the surprising discovery that during cardiac stress, a proteolytically cleaved fragment of JP2 can translocate to the cardiomyocyte nucleus and funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> as a transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> factor that can protect against heart failure pathogenesis. Thus, in addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to its “day job” as a structural protein, this suggest that JP2 can “moonlight” in the nucleus as part of a homeostatic feedback response to cardiac stress.</p>

Structural insight into precursor tRNA processing by yeast ribonuclease P
<p>Ribonuclease P (RNase P) is a universal ribozyme responsible for processing the 5′-leader of pre–transfer RNA (pre-tRNA). Here, we report the 3.5-angstrom cryo–electron microscopy structures of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> RNase P alone and in complex with pre-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup>. The protein components form a hook-shaped architecture that wraps around the RNA and stabilizes RNase P into a “measuring device” with two fixed anchors that recognize the L-shaped pre-tRNA. A universally conserved uridine nucleobase and phosphate backbone in the catalytic center together with the scissile phosphate and the O3′ leaving group of pre-tRNA jointly coordinate two catalytic magnesium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. Binding of pre-tRNA induces a conformat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al change in the catalytic center that is required for catalysis. Moreover, simulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> analysis suggests a two-metal-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> S<sub>N</sub>2 react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> pathway of pre-tRNA cleavage.

Glutamate triggers long-distance, calcium-based plant defense signaling
<p>Animals require rapid, long-range molecular signaling networks to integrate sensing and response throughout their bodies. The amino acid glutamate acts as an excitatory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate central nervous system, facilitating long-range informat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> exchange via activat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of glutamate receptor channels. Similarly, plants sense local signals, such as herbivore attack, and transmit this informat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> throughout the plant body to rapidly activate defense responses in undamaged parts. Here we show that glutamate is a wound signal in plants. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels of the <i>GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR–LIKE</i> family act as sensors that convert this signal into an increase in intracellular calcium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> that propagates to distant organs, where defense responses are then induced.</p>

Postimpact earliest Paleogene warming shown by fish debris oxygen isotopes (El Kef, Tunisia)
<p>Greenhouse warming is a predicted consequence of the Chicxulub impact, but supporting data are sparse. This shortcoming compromises understanding of the impact’s effects, and it has persisted due to an absence of sect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s that both contain suitable material for tradit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al carbonate- or organic-based paleothermometry and are complete and expanded enough to resolve changes on short time scales.

Photoredox-catalyzed deuteration and tritiation of pharmaceutical compounds
<p>Deuterium- and tritium-labeled pharmaceutical compounds are pivotal diagnostic tools in drug discovery research, providing vital informat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> about the biological fate of drugs and drug metabolites. Herein we demonstrate that a photoredox-mediated hydrogen atom transfer protocol can efficiently and selectively install deuterium (D) and tritium (T) at α-amino sp<sup>3</sup> carbon-hydrogen bonds in a single step, using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>ically labeled water (D<sub>2</sub>O or T<sub>2</sub>O) as the source of hydrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>e. In this context, we also report a convenient synthesis of T<sub>2</sub>O from T<sub>2</sub>, providing access to high-specific-activity T<sub>2</sub>O. This protocol has been successfully applied to the high incorporat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of deuterium and tritium in 18 drug molecules, which meet the requirements for use in ligand-binding assays and absorpt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, distribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, metabolism, and excret<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> studies.</p>

Titanium isotopic evidence for felsic crust and plate tectonics 3.5 billion years ago
<p>Earth exhibits a dichotomy in elevat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and chemical composit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> between the continents and ocean floor. Reconstructing when this dichotomy arose is important for understanding when plate tectonics started and how the supply of nutrients to the oceans changed through time. We measured the titanium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>ic composit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of shales to constrain the chemical composit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the continental crust exposed to weathering and found that shales of all ages have a uniform <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>ic composit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. This can only be explained if the emerged crust was predominantly felsic (silica-rich) since 3.5 bill<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> years ago, requiring an early initiat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of plate tectonics. We also observed a change in the abundance of biologically important nutrients phosphorus and nickel across the Archean-Proterozoic boundary, which might have helped trigger the rise in atmospheric oxygen.</p>

Three-dimensional holey-graphene/niobia composite architectures for ultrahigh-rate energy storage
<p>Nanostructured materials have shown extraordinary promise for electrochemical energy storage but are usually limited to electrodes with rather low mass loading (~1 milligram per square centimeter) because of the increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> diffus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> limitat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in thicker electrodes.

The highly interconnected graphene network in the 3D architecture provides excellent electron transport properties, and its hierarchical porous structure facilitates rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> transport. By systematically tailoring the porosity in the holey graphene backbone, charge transport in the composite architecture is optimized to deliver high areal capacity and high-rate capability at high mass loading, which represents a critical step forward toward practical applicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s.</p>

Cryo-EM structures of the triheteromeric NMDA receptor and its allosteric modulation
<p><i>N</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are heterotetrameric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels assembled as diheteromeric or triheteromeric complexes. Here, we report structures of the triheteromeric GluN1/GluN2A/GluN2B receptor in the absence or presence of the GluN2B-specific allosteric modulator Ro 25-6981 (Ro), determined by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). In the absence of Ro, the GluN2A and GluN2B amino-terminal domains (ATDs) adopt “closed” and “open” clefts, respectively. Upon binding Ro, the GluN2B ATD clamshell transit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s from an open to a closed conformat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Consistent with a predominance of the GluN2A subunit in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel gating, the GluN2A subunit interacts more extensively with GluN1 subunits throughout the receptor, in comparison with the GluN2B subunit. Differences in the conformat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the pseudo-2-fold–related GluN1 subunits further reflect receptor asymmetry. The triheteromeric NMDAR structures provide the first view of the most common NMDA receptor assembly and show how incorporat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of two different GluN2 subunits modifies receptor symmetry and subunit interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, allowing each subunit to uniquely influence receptor structure and funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, thus increasing receptor complexity.</p>

Identification of LRRC8 Heteromers as an Essential Component of the Volume-Regulated Anion Channel VRAC
<sec><title>One Swell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> Channel</title><p>When mammalian cells are faced with osmotic challenges, they need to swell or shrink. The molecular characterizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the volume-regulated an<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel (VRAC) remains unknown, although many candidate proteins have been proposed. <bold>Voss <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 634, published online 10 April; see the Perspective by <bold>Mindell</bold>) used a genome-wide screen to identify a group of leucine-rich repeat–containing (LRRC) proteins necessary for forming VRAC.

Cation Specificity of Vacuolar NHX-Type Cation/H<sup>+</sup> Antiporters
<p>Cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>/H<sup>+</sup> (NHX-type) antiporters are important regulators of intracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis and are critical for cell expans<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and plant stress acclimat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), four distinct NHX isoforms, named AtNHX1 to AtNHX4, locate to the tonoplast. To determine the concerted roles of all tonoplast NHXs on vacuolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and pH homeostasis, we examined multiple knockout mutants lacking all but one of the four vacuolar isoforms and quadruple knockout plants lacking any vacuolar NHX activity. The <i>nhx</i> triple and quadruple knockouts displayed reduced growth phenotypes. Exposure to sodium chloride improved growth while potassium chloride was deleterious to some knockouts. Kinetic analysis of K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> transport indicated that AtNHX1 and AtNHX2 are the main contributors to both vacuolar pH and K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> uptake, while AtNHX3 and AtNHX4 differ in Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> selectivity. The lack of any vacuolar NHX activity resulted in no K<sup>+</sup> uptake, highly acidic vacuoles, and reduced but not abolished vacuolar Na<sup>+</sup> uptake. Addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al K<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange activity assays in the quadruple knockout indicated Na<sup>+</sup> uptake that was not H<sup>+</sup> coupled, suggesting the existence of an alternative, cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>/H<sup>+</sup>-independent, Na<sup>+</sup> conductive pathway in vacuoles. These results highlight the importance of NHX-type cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters in the maintenance of cellular cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis and in growth and development.</p>

Estimating Mesophyll Conductance from Measurements of C<sup>18</sup>OO Photosynthetic Discrimination and Carbonic Anhydrase Activity
<p>Carbonic anhydrase (CA) activity in leaves catalyzes the <sup>18</sup>O exchange between CO<sub>2</sub> and water during photosynthesis. This feature has been used to estimate the mesophyll conductance to CO<sub>2</sub> (<i>g</i><sub>m</sub>) from measurements of online C<sup>18</sup>OO photosynthetic discriminat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (<sup>18</sup>O). Based on CA assays on leaf extracts, it has been argued that CO<sub>2</sub> in mesophyll cells should be in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>ic equilibrium with water in most C<sub>3</sub> species as well as many C<sub>4</sub> dicot species. However, this seems incompatible with <sup>18</sup>O data that would indicate a much lower degree of equilibrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, especially in C<sub>4</sub> plants under high light intensity. This apparent contradict<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is resolved here using a new model of C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic discriminat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> that includes competit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> between CO<sub>2</sub> hydrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and carboxylat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and the contribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of respiratory fluxes. This new modeling framework is used to revisit previously published data sets on C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> species, including CA-deficient plants. We conclude that (1) newly <sup>18</sup>O-derived <i>g</i><sub>m</sub> values are usually close but significantly higher (typically 20% and up to 50%) than those derived assuming full equilibrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and (2) despite the uncertainty associated with the respirat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> rate in light, or the water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>e gradient between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells, robust estimates of <sup>18</sup>O-derived <i>g</i><sub>m</sub> can be achieved in both C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> plants.</p>

The Membrane Transport System of the Guard Cell and Its Integration for Stomatal Dynamics
<p>Stomatal guard cells are widely recognized as the premier plant cell model for membrane transport, signaling, and homeostasis. This recognit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is rooted in half a century of research into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> transport across the plasma and vacuolar membranes of guard cells that drive stomatal movements and the signaling mechanisms that regulate them. Stomatal guard cells surround pores in the epidermis of plant leaves, controlling the aperture of the pore to balance CO<sub>2</sub> entry into the leaf for photosynthesis with water loss via transpirat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. The posit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of guard cells in the epidermis is ideally suited for cellular and subcellular research, and their sensitivity to endogenous signals and environmental stimuli makes them a primary target for physiological studies. Stomata underpin the challenges of water availability and crop product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> that are expected to unfold over the next 20 to 30 years. A quantitative understanding of how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> transport is integrated and controlled is key to meeting these challenges and to engineering guard cells for improved water use efficiency and agricultural yields.</p>

The Sites of Evaporation within Leaves
<p>The sites of evaporat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> within leaves are unknown, but they have drawn attent<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> for decades due to their perceived implicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s for many factors, including patterns of leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>ic enrichment, the maintenance of mesophyll water status, stomatal regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, and the interpretat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of measured stomatal and leaf hydraulic conductances. We used a spatially explicit model of coupled water and heat transport outside the xylem, MOFLO 2.0, to map the distribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of net evaporat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> across leaf tissues in relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to anatomy and environmental parameters. Our results corroborate earlier predict<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s that most evaporat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> occurs from the epidermis at low light and moderate humidity but that the mesophyll contributes substantially when the leaf center is warmed by light absorpt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, and more so under high humidity. We also found that the bundle sheath provides a significant minority of evaporat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (15% in darkness and 18% in high light), that the vertical center of amphistomatous leaves supports net condensat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, and that vertical temperature gradients caused by light absorpt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> vary over 10-fold across species, reaching 0.3°C. We show that several hypotheses that depend on the evaporating sites require revis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in light of our findings, including that experimental measurements of stomatal and hydraulic conductances should be affected directly by changes in the locat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the evaporating sites. We propose a new conceptual model that accounts for mixed-phase water transport outside the xylem. These conclus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s have far-reaching implicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s for inferences in leaf hydraulics, gas exchange, water use, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>e physiology.</p>

Changes in Anthocyanin Production during Domestication of <i>Citrus</i>
<p>Mandarin (<i>Citrus reticulata</i>), citron (<i>Citrus medica</i>), and pummelo (<i>Citrus maxima</i>) are important species of the genus <i>Citrus</i> and parents of the interspecific hybrids that constitute the most familiar commercial varieties of <i>Citrus</i>: sweet orange, sour orange, clementine, lemon, lime, and grapefruit. Citron produces anthocyanins in its young leaves and flowers, as do species in genera closely related to <i>Citrus</i>, but mandarins do not, and pummelo varieties that produce anthocyanins have not been reported. We investigated the activity of the <i>Ruby</i> gene, which encodes a MYB transcription factor controlling anthocyanin biosynthesis, in different accessions of a range of <i>Citrus</i> species and in domesticated cultivars. A white mutant of lemon lacks functional alleles of <i>Ruby</i>, demonstrating that <i>Ruby</i> plays an essential role in anthocyanin production in <i>Citrus</i>. Almost all the natural variation in pigmentation by anthocyanins in <i>Citrus</i> species can be explained by differences in activity of the <i>Ruby</i> gene, caused by point mutations and deletions and insertions of transposable elements. Comparison of the allelic constitution of <i>Ruby</i> in different species and cultivars also helps to clarify many of the taxonomic relationships in different species of <i>Citrus</i>, confirms the derivation of commercial varieties during domestication, elucidates the relationships within the subgenus <i>Papeda</i>, and allows a new genetic classification of mandarins.</p>

Sensitive electromechanical sensors using viscoelastic graphene-polymer nanocomposites
<p>Despite its widespread use in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanocomposit</span></strong>es, the effect of embedding graphene in highly viscoelastic polymer matrices is not well understood. We added graphene to a lightly cross-linked polysilicone, often encountered as Silly Putty, changing its electromechanical properties substantially. The resulting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanocomposit</span></strong>es display unusual electromechanical behavior, such as postdeformation temporal relaxation of electrical resistance and nonmonotonic changes in resistivity with strain. These phenomena are associated with the mobility of the nanosheets in the low-viscosity polymer matrix. By considering both the connectivity and mobility of the nanosheets, we developed a quantitative model that completely describes the electromechanical properties. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanocomposit</span></strong>es are sensitive electromechanical sensors with gauge factors >500 that can measure pulse, blood pressure, and even the impact associated with the footsteps of a small spider.</p>

Zeolitic imidazolate framework membranes made by ligand-induced permselectivation
<p>Zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) membranes are emerging as a promising energy-efficient separation technology. However, their reliable and scalable manufacturing remains a challenge. We demonstrate the fabrication of ZIF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanocomposit</span></strong>e membranes by means of an all-vapor-phase processing method based on atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO in a porous support followed by ligand-vapor treatment. After ALD, the obtained <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanocomposit</span></strong>e exhibits low flux and is not selective, whereas after ligand-vapor (2-methylimidazole) treatment, it is partially transformed to ZIF and shows stable performance with high mixture separation factor for propylene over propane (an energy-intensive high-volume separation) and high propylene flux. Membrane synthesis through ligand-induced permselectivation of a nonselective and impermeable deposit is shown to be simple and highly reproducible and holds promise for scalability.</p>

A 28-year clinical and radiological follow-up of alumina ceramic-on-crosslinked polyethylene total hip arthroplasty

Hydrolytically stable fluorinated metal-organic frameworks for energy-efficient dehydration
<p>Natural gas must be dehydrated before it can be transported and used, but conventional drying agents such as activated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alumin</span></strong>a</span></strong> or inorganic molecular sieves require an energy-intensive desiccant-regeneration step. We report a hydrolytically stable fluorinated metal-organic framework, AlFFIVE-1-Ni (KAUST-8), with a periodic array of open metal coordination sites and fluorine moieties within the contracted square-shaped one-dimensional channel. This material selectively removed water vapor from gas streams containing CO<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, and higher hydrocarbons typical of natural gas, as well as selectively removed both H<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub> in N<sub>2</sub>-containing streams. The complete desorption of the adsorbed water molecules contained by the AlFFIVE-1-Ni sorbent requires relatively moderate temperature (~105°C) and about half the energy input for commonly used desiccants.</p>

Instability of the hip after anatomical  re-alignment in patients with a slipped capital femoral epiphysis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Several studies have reported the safety and efficacy of subcapital   re-alignment for patients with slipped capital femoral epiphysis   (SCFE) using surgical dislocation of the hip and an extended retinacular   flap. Instability of the hip and dislocation as a consequence of   this surgery has only recently gained attention. We discuss this   problem with some illustrative cases.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We explored the literature on the possible pathophysiological   causes and surgical steps associated with the risk of post-operative   instability and articular damage. In addition, we describe supplementary   steps that could be used to avoid these problems.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The causes of instability may be divided into three main groups:   the first includes causes directly related to SCFE (acetabular labral   damage, severe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abras</span></strong>ion of the acetabular cartilage, flattening   of the acetabular roof and a bell-shaped deformity of the epiphysis);   the second, causes not related to the SCFE (acetabular orientation   and poor quality of the soft tissues); the third, causes directly   related to the surgery (capsulotomy, division of the ligamentum teres,   shortening of the femoral neck, pelvi-trochanteric impingement,   previous proximal femoral osteotomy and post-operative positioning   of the leg).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We present examples drawn from our clinical practice, as well   as possible ways of reducing the risks of these complications, and   of correcting them if they happen.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:16–21.</p></sec>

Metallosis following implantation of magnetically controlled growing rods in the treatment of scoliosis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We present a case series of five patients who had revision surgery   following magnetic controlled growing rods (MGCR) for early onset   scoliosis. Metallosis was found during revision in four out of five   patients and we postulated a mechanism for rod failure based on   retrieval analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Retrieval analysis was performed on the seven explanted rods.   The mean duration of MCGR from implantation to revision was 35 months   (17 to 46). The mean age at revision was 12 years (7 to 15; four   boys, one girl).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of six out of seven rods had tissue metallosis and pseudo-capsule   surrounding the actuator. A total of four out of seven rods were   pistoning. There were two rods which were broken. All rods had <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abras</span></strong>ive   circumferential markings. A significant amount of metal debris was   found when the actuators were carefully cut open. Analytical electron   microscopy demonstrated metal fragments of predominantly titanium   with a mean particle size of 3.36 microns (1.31 to 6.61).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study highlights concerns with tissue metallosis in MCGR.   We recommend careful follow-up of patients who have received this   implant.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2016;98-B:1662–7.</p></sec>

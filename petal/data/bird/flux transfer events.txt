Structure, force balance, and topology of Earth’s magnetopause
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnetopaus</span></strong>e deflects the solar wind plasma and confines Earth’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnetic field</span></strong>. We combine measurements made by the four spacecraft of the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission to demonstrate how the plasma and magnetic forces at the boundary affect the interaction between the shocked solar wind and Earth’s magnetosphere. We compare these forces with the plasma pressure and examine the electron distribution function. We find that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnetopaus</span></strong>e has sublayers with thickness comparable to the ion scale. Small pockets of low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnetic field</span></strong> strength, small radius of curvature, and high electric current mark the electron diffusion region. The flow of electrons, parallel and antiparallel to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnetic field</span></strong>, reveals a complex topology with the creation of magnetic ropes at the boundary.</p>

Atmospheric <sup>14</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C changes during the last glacial period from Hulu Cave
<p>Paired measurements of <sup>14</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C and <sup>230</sup>Th ages from two Hulu Cave stalagmites complete a precise record of atmospheric <sup>14</sup>C covering the full range of the <sup>14</sup>C dating method (~54,000 years). Over the last glacial period, atmospheric <sup>14</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C ranges from values similar to modern values to values 1.70 times higher (42,000 to 39,000 years ago). The latter correspond to <sup>14</sup>C ages 5200 years less than calibrated ages and correlate with the Laschamp <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geomagnet</span></strong>ic excursion followed by Heinrich Stadial 4. Millennial-scale variations are largely attributable to Earth’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnetic field</span></strong> changes and in part to climate-related changes in the oceanic carbon cycle. A progressive shift to lower <sup>14</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C values between 25,000 and 11,000 years ago is likely related, in part, to progressively increasing ocean ventilation rates.</p>

Pre-settlement coral-reef fish larvae respond to magnetic field changes during the day
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> The individual orientation behaviour of coral-reef fish larvae during the pre-settlement phase is influenced by magnetic-field shifts, which indicates sensitivity to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geomagnet</span></strong>ic field and the use of a magnetic compass during dispersal and settlement.</p>

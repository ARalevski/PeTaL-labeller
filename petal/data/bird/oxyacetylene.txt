Snap deconvolution: An informatics approach to high-throughput discovery of catalytic reactions
<p>We present an approach to multidimensional high-throughput discovery of catalytic coupling reactions that integrates molecular design with automated analysis and interpretation of mass spectral data. We simultaneously assessed the reactivity of three pools of compounds that shared the same functional groups (halides, boronic acids, alkenes, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alkyn</span></strong>es, among other groups) but carried inactive substituents having specifically designed differences in masses. The substituents were chosen such that the products from any class of reaction in multiple reaction sets would have unique differences in masses, thus allowing simultaneous identification of the products of all transformations in a set of reactants. In this way, we easily distinguished the products of new reactions from noise and known couplings. Using this method, we discovered an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alkyn</span></strong>e hydroallylation and a nickel-catalyzed variant of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alkyn</span></strong>e diarylation.</p>

Direct Evidence of a Dinuclear Copper Intermediate in Cu(I)-Catalyzed Azide-Alkyne Cycloadditions
<sec><title>How Copper Clicks</title><p>The copper-catalyzed coupling of azides and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alkyn</span></strong>es has been termed a “click” reaction on account of its efficiency and versatility, but despite its widespread use, the mechanism remains somewhat unclear. Through a series of kinetic and isotopic labeling studies, <bold>Worrell <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 457, published online 4 April) show that, in the case of terminal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alkyn</span></strong>es (capped at one end by an H atom), two equivalents of copper participate in activating each molecule's reactivity toward azide. Surprisingly, the reaction also appears to proceed through an intermediate in which the two copper centers become equivalent and functionally exchangeable, despite initially coordinating to distinct sites on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alkyn</span></strong>e.</p></sec>

Encoding of vinylidene isomerization in its anion photoelectron spectrum
<p>Vinylidene-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acetylen</span></strong>e isomerization is the prototypical example of a 1,2-hydrogen shift, one of the most important classes of isomerization reactions in organic chemistry. This reaction was investigated with quantum state specificity by high-resolution photoelectron spectroscopy of the vinylidene anions H<sub>2</sub>CC and D<sub>2</sub>CC and quantum dynamics calculations. Peaks in the photoelectron spectra are considerably narrower than in previous work and reveal subtleties in the isomerization dynamics of neutral vinylidene, as well as vibronic coupling with an excited state of vinylidene. Comparison with theory permits assignment of most spectral features to eigenstates dominated by vinylidene character. However, excitation of the ν<sub>6</sub> in-plane rocking mode in H<sub>2</sub>CC results in appreciable tunneling-facilitated mixing with highly vibrationally excited states of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acetylen</span></strong>e, leading to broadening and/or spectral fine structure that is largely suppressed for analogous vibrational levels of D<sub>2</sub>CC.</p>

Identification of single-site gold catalysis in acetylene hydrochlorination
<p>There remains considerable debate over the active form of gold under operating conditions of a recently validated gold catalyst for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acetylen</span></strong>e hydrochlorination. We have performed an in situ x-ray absorption fine structure study of gold/carbon (Au/C) catalysts under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acetylen</span></strong>e hydrochlorination reaction conditions and show that highly active catalysts comprise single-site cationic Au entities whose activity correlates with the ratio of Au(I):Au(III) present. We demonstrate that these Au/C catalysts are supported analogs of single-site homogeneous Au catalysts and propose a mechanism, supported by computational modeling, based on a redox couple of Au(I)-Au(III) species.</p>

A general synthesis approach for supported bimetallic nanoparticles via surface inorganometallic chemistry
<p>The synthesis of ultrasmall supported bimetallic nanoparticles (between 1 and 3 nanometers in diameter) with well-defined stoichiometry and intimacy between constituent metals remains a substantial challenge. We synthesized 10 different supported bimetallic nanoparticles via surface inorganometallic chemistry by decomposing and reducing surface-adsorbed heterometallic double complex salts, which are readily obtained upon sequential adsorption of target cations and anions on a silica substrate. For example, adsorption of tetraamminepalladium(II) [Pd(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub><sup>2+</sup>] followed by adsorption of tetrachloroplatinate [PtCl<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>] was used to form palladium-platinum (Pd-Pt) nanoparticles. These supported bimetallic nanoparticles show enhanced catalytic performance in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acetylen</span></strong>e selective hydrogenation, which clearly demonstrates a synergistic effect between constituent metals.</p>

Ultrafast electron diffraction imaging of bond breaking in di-ionized acetylene
<p>Visualizing chemical reactions as they occur requires atomic spatial and femtosecond temporal resolution. Here, we report imaging of the molecular structure of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acetylen</span></strong>e (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>) 9 femtoseconds after ionization. Using mid-infrared laser–induced electron diffraction (LIED), we obtained snapshots as a proton departs the [C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> ion. By introducing an additional laser field, we also demonstrate control over the ultrafast dissociation process and resolve different bond dynamics for molecules oriented parallel versus perpendicular to the LIED field. These measurements are in excellent agreement with a quantum chemical description of field-dressed molecular dynamics.</p>

<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We aimed to evaluate the temperature around the nerve root during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drill</span></strong>ing of the lamina and to   determine whether irrigation during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drill</span></strong>ing can reduce the chance of nerve root injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Lumbar nerve roots were exposed to frictional heat by high-speed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drill</span></strong>ing of the lamina in a live   rabbit model, with saline (room temperature (RT) or chilled saline) or without saline (control)   irrigation.

While the RT group showed a significantly lower temperature around the nerve root   compared with the control group (mean 46.5°C; 34.5°C to 66.9°C, p < 0.001), RT   saline failed to significantly reduce the incidence of nerve root injury (ten out of 26; 38.5%; odds   ratio (OR) 0.96; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.516 to 1.785; p = 0.563).

Increase in predator-prey size ratios throughout the Phanerozoic history of marine ecosystems
<p>The escalation hypothesis posits that predation by increasingly powerful and metabolically active carnivores has been a major driver of metazoan evolution. We test a key tenet of this hypothesis by analyzing predatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drill</span></strong> holes in fossil marine shells, which provide a ~500-million-year record of individual predator-prey interactions. We show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drill</span></strong>-hole size is a robust predictor of body size among modern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drill</span></strong>ing predators and that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drill</span></strong>-hole size (and thus inferred predator size and power) rose substantially from the Ordovician to the Quaternary period, whereas the size of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drill</span></strong>ed prey remained stable. Together, these trends indicate a directional increase in predator-prey size ratios. We hypothesize that increasing predator-prey size ratios reflect increases in prey abundance, prey nutrient content, and predation among predators.</p>

The <i>in vivo</i> effect of a porous titanium alloy flange with hydroxyapatite, silver and fibronectin coatings on soft-tissue integration of intraosseous transcutaneous amputation prostheses
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The Intraosseous Transcutaneous Amputation Prosthesis (ITAP)   may improve quality of life for amputees by avoiding soft-tissue   complications associated with socket prostheses and by improving   sensory feedback and function. It relies on the formation of a seal   between the soft tissues and the implant and currently has a flange   with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drill</span></strong>ed holes to promote dermal attachment. Despite this, infection   remains a significant risk. This study explored alternative strategies   to enhance soft-tissue integration.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The effect of ITAP pins with a fully porous titanium alloy flange   with interconnected pores on soft-tissue integration was investigated.   The flanges were coated with fibronectin-functionalised hydroxyapatite   and silver coatings, which have been shown to have an antibacterial   effect, while also promoting viable fibroblast growth <i>in   vitro. </i>The ITAP pins were implanted along the length of   ovine tibias, and histological assessment was undertaken four weeks   post-operatively.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The porous titanium alloy flange reduced epithelial downgrowth   and increased soft-tissue integration compared with the current   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drill</span></strong>ed flange.

Tree Physiology
An empirical study of the wound effect on sap flux density measured with thermal dissipation probes
<p>The insertion of thermal dissipation (TD) sensors on tree stems for sap flux density (SFD) measurements can lead to SFD underestimations due to a wound formation close to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drill</span></strong> hole. However, the wound effect has not been assessed experimentally for this method yet. Here, we propose an empirical approach to investigate the effect of the wound healing on measured sap flux with TD probes. The approach was performed for both, diffuse-porous (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i> (Linnaeus)) and ring-porous (<i>Quercus petraea</i> (Lieblein)) species. Thermal dissipation probes were installed on different dates along the growing season to document the effects of the dynamic wound formation. The trees were cut in autumn and additional sensors were installed in the cut stems, therefore, without potential effects of wound development. A range of water pressures was applied to the stem segments and SFDs were simultaneously measured by TD sensors as well as gravimetrically in the laboratory. The formation of wounds around sensors installed in living tree stems led to underestimation of SFD by 21.4 ± 3 and 47.5 ± 3.8% in beech and oak, respectively. The differences between SFD underestimations of diffuse-porous beech and ring-porous oak were, however, not statistically significant. Sensors with 5-, 11- and 22-week-old wounds also showed no significant differences, which implies that the influence of wound formation on SFD estimates was completed within the first few weeks after perforation. These results were confirmed by time courses of SFD measurements in the field. Field SFD values decreased immediately after sensor installation and reached stable values after ~2 weeks with similar underestimations to the ones observed in the laboratory. We therefore propose a feasible approach to correct directly field observations of SFD for potential underestimations due to the wound effect.</p>

The formation of peak rings in large impact craters
<p>Large impacts provide a mechanism for resurfacing planets through mixing near-surface rocks with deeper material. Central peaks are formed from the dynamic uplift of rocks during crater formation. As crater size increases, central peaks transition to peak rings. Without samples, debate surrounds the mechanics of peak-ring formation and their depth of origin. Chicxulub is the only known impact structure on Earth with an unequivocal peak ring, but it is buried and only accessible through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drill</span></strong>ing. Expedition 364 sampled the Chicxulub peak ring, which we found was formed from uplifted, fractured, shocked, felsic basement rocks. The peak-ring rocks are cross-cut by dikes and shear zones and have an unusually low density and seismic velocity. Large impacts therefore generate vertical fluxes and increase porosity in planetary crust.</p>

Quantification of the ossification of the lateral cuneiform in the feet of young children with unilateral congenital talipes equinovarus
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>After the initial correction of congenital talipes equinovarus   (CTEV) using the Ponseti method, a subsequent dynamic deformity   is often managed by transfer of the tendon of tibialis anterior   (TATT) to the lateral cuneiform. Many surgeons believe the lateral   cuneiform should be ossified before surgery is undertaken. This   study quantifies the ossification process of the lateral cuneiform   in children with CTEV between one and three years of age. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The length, width and height of the lateral cuneiform were measured   in 43 consecutive patients with unilateral CTEV who had been treated   using the Ponseti method. Measurements were taken by two independent   observers on standardised anteroposterior and lateral radiographs   of both feet taken at one, two and three years of age.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>All dimensions of the lateral cuneiform on the affected side   increased annually but remained smaller than the corresponding dimensions   of the unaffected foot (p < 0.01). The lateral cuneiform resembled   a 9 mm cube at two years and an 11 mm cube at three years.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>At one and two years, the ossification centre of the lateral   cuneiform may not be large enough to accommodate a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drill</span></strong> hole for   tendon transfer. However, by three years, it has undergone sufficient   ossification to do so.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1109–14.</p></sec>

The distribution of heat in bone during radiofrequency ablation of an <i>ex vivo</i> bovine model of osteoid osteoma
<p>Osteoid osteoma is treated primarily by radiofrequency   (RF) ablation. However, there is little information about the distribution   of heat in bone during the procedure and its safety. We constructed   a model of osteoid osteoma to assess the distribution of heat in   bone and to define the margins of safety for ablation. Cavities   were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drill</span></strong>ed in cadaver bovine bones and filled with a liver homogenate   to simulate the tumour matrix. Temperature-sensing probes were placed   in the bone in a radial fashion away from the cavities. RF ablation   was performed 107 times in tumours < 10 mm in diameter (72 of   which were in cortical bone, 35 in cancellous bone), and 41 times   in cortical bone with models > 10 mm in diameter. Significantly   higher temperatures were found in cancellous bone than in cortical   bone (p < 0.05). For lesions up to 10 mm in diameter, in both   bone types, the temperature varied directly with the size of the   tumour (p < 0.05), and inversely with the distance from it. Tumours   of > 10 mm in diameter showed a trend similar to those of smaller   lesions. No temperature rise was seen beyond 12 mm from the edge   of a cortical tumour of any size. Formulae were developed to predict   the expected temperature in the bone during ablation.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014; 96-B:677–83</p>

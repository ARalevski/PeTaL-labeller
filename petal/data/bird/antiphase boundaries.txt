<i>ELIGULUM-A</i> Regulates Lateral Branch and Leaf Development in Barley
<p>The shoot apical and axillary meristems control shoot development, effectively influencing lateral branch and leaf formation. The barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) <i>uniculm2</i> (<i>cul2</i>) mutation blocks axillary meristem development, and mutant plants lack lateral branches (tillers) that normally develop from the crown. A genetic screen for <i>cul2</i> suppressors recovered two recessive alleles of <i>ELIGULUM-A</i> (<i>ELI-A</i>) that partially rescued the <i>cul2</i> tillering phenotype. Mutations in <i>ELI-A</i> produce shorter plants with fewer tillers and disrupt the leaf blade-sheath boundary, producing liguleless leaves and reduced secondary cell wall development in stems and leaves. <i>ELI-A</i> is predicted to encode an unannotated protein containing an RNaseH-like domain that is conserved in land plants. <i>ELI-A</i> transcripts accumulate at the preligule boundary, the developing ligule, leaf margins, cells destined to develop secondary cell walls, and cells surrounding leaf vascular bundles. Recent studies have identified regulatory similarities between boundary development in leaves and lateral organs. Interestingly, we observed <i>ELI-A</i> transcripts at the preligule boundary, suggesting that <i>ELI-A</i> contributes to boundary formation between the blade and sheath. However, we did not observe <i>ELI-A</i> transcripts at the axillary meristem boundary in leaf axils, suggesting that <i>ELI-A</i> is not involved in boundary development for axillary meristem development. Our results show that <i>ELI-A</i> contributes to leaf and lateral branch development by acting as a boundary gene during ligule development but not during lateral branch development.</p>

Segregation-induced ordered superstructures at general grain boundaries in a nickel-bismuth alloy
<p>The properties of materials change, sometimes catastrophically, as alloying elements and impurities accumulate preferentially at grain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">boundari</span></strong>es. Studies of bicrystals show that regular atomic patterns often arise as a result of this solute segregation at high-symmetry <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">boundari</span></strong>es, but it is not known whether superstructures exist at general grain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">boundari</span></strong>es in polycrystals. In bismuth-doped polycrystalline nickel, we found that ordered, segregation-induced grain boundary superstructures occur at randomly selected general grain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">boundari</span></strong>es, and that these reconstructions are driven by the orientation of the terminating grain surfaces rather than by lattice matching between grains. This discovery shows that adsorbate-induced superstructures are not limited to special grain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">boundari</span></strong>es but may exist at a variety of general grain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">boundari</span></strong>es, and hence they can affect the performance of polycrystalline engineering alloys.</p>

Selective increase in CO<sub>2</sub> electroreduction activity at grain-boundary surface terminations
<p>Altering a material’s catalytic properties requires identifying structural features that give rise to active surfaces. Grain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">boundari</span></strong>es create strained regions in polycrystalline materials by stabilizing dislocations and may provide a way to create high-energy surfaces for catalysis that are kinetically trapped. Although grain-boundary density has previously been correlated with catalytic activity for some reactions, direct evidence that grain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">boundari</span></strong>es create surfaces with enhanced activity is lacking. We used a combination of bulk electrochemical measurements and scanning electrochemical cell microscopy with submicrometer resolution to show that grain-boundary surface terminations in gold electrodes are more active than grain surfaces for electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) reduction to carbon monoxide (CO) but not for the competing hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) evolution reaction. The catalytic footprint of the grain boundary is commensurate with its dislocation-induced strain field, providing a strategy for broader exploitation of grain-boundary effects in heterogeneous catalysis.</p>

Tunable porous nanoallotropes prepared by post-assembly etching of binary nanoparticle superlattices
<p>Self-assembly of inorganic nanoparticles has been used to prepare hundreds of different colloidal crystals, but almost invariably with the restriction that the particles must be densely packed. Here, we show that non–close-packed nanoparticle arrays can be fabricated through the selective removal of one of two components comprising binary nanoparticle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superlattic</span></strong>es. First, a variety of binary nanoparticle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superlattic</span></strong>es were prepared at the liquid-air interface, including several arrangements that were previously unknown. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed the particular role of the liquid in templating the formation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superlattic</span></strong>es not achievable through self-assembly in bulk solution. Second, upon stabilization, all of these binary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superlattic</span></strong>es could be transformed into distinct “nanoallotropes”—nanoporous materials having the same chemical composition but differing in their nanoscale architectures.</p>

Clade I TGACG-Motif Binding Basic Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors Mediate BLADE-ON-PETIOLE-Dependent Regulation of Development
<p>Lateral organs formed by the shoot apical meristem (SAM) are separated from surrounding stem cells by regions of low growth called <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">boundari</span></strong>es. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>BLADE-ON-PETIOLE1</i> (<i>BOP1</i>) and <i>BOP2</i> represent a class of genes important for boundary patterning in land plants. Members of this family lack a DNA-binding domain and interact with TGACG-motif binding (TGA) basic Leu zipper (bZIP) transcription factors for recruitment to DNA. Here, we show that clade I bZIP transcription factors TGA1 and TGA4, previously associated with plant defense, are essential cofactors in BOP-dependent regulation of development. <i>TGA1</i> and <i>TGA4</i> are expressed at organ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">boundari</span></strong>es and function in the same genetic pathways as <i>BOP1</i> and <i>BOP2</i> required for SAM maintenance, flowering, and inflorescence architecture. Further, we show that clade I TGAs interact constitutively with BOP1 and BOP2, contributing to activation of <i>ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA HOMEOBOX GENE1</i>, which is needed for boundary establishment. These studies expand the functional repertoire of clade I TGA factors in development and defense.</p>

Inferring Earth’s discontinuous chemical layering from the 660-kilometer boundary topography
<p>Topography, or depth variation, of certain interfaces in the solid Earth can provide important insights into the dynamics of our planet interior. Although the intermediate- and long-range topographic variation of the 660-kilometer boundary between Earth’s upper and lower mantle is well studied, small-scale measurements are far more challenging. We found a surprising amount of topography at short length scale along the 660-kilometer boundary in certain regions using scattered <i>P'P'</i> seismic waves. Our observations required chemical layering in regions with high short-scale roughness. By contrast, we did not see such small-scale topography along the 410-kilometer boundary in the upper mantle. Our ﬁndings support the concept of partially blocked or imperfect circulation between the upper and lower mantle.</p>

Super-resolution chromatin tracing reveals domains and cooperative interactions in single cells
<p>The spatial organization of chromatin is pivotal for regulating genome functions. We report an imaging method for tracing chromatin organization with kilobase- and nanometer-scale resolution, unveiling chromatin conformation across topologically associating domains (TADs) in thousands of individual cells. Our imaging data revealed TAD-like structures with globular conformation and sharp domain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">boundari</span></strong>es in single cells. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">boundari</span></strong>es varied from cell to cell, occurring with nonzero probabilities at all genomic positions but preferentially at CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF)- and cohesin-binding sites. Notably, cohesin depletion, which abolished TADs at the population-average level, did not diminish TAD-like structures in single cells but eliminated preferential domain boundary positions. Moreover, we observed widespread, cooperative, multiway chromatin interactions, which remained after cohesin depletion. These results provide critical insight into the mechanisms underlying chromatin domain and hub formation.</p>

Local transformations of the hippocampal cognitive map
<p>Grid cells are neurons active in multiple fields arranged in a hexagonal lattice and are thought to represent the “universal metric for space.” However, they become nonhomogeneously distorted in polarized enclosures, which challenges this view. We found that local changes to the configuration of the enclosure induce individual grid fields to shift in a manner inversely related to their distance from the reconfigured boundary. The grid remained primarily anchored to the unchanged stable walls and showed a nonuniform rescaling. Shifts in simultaneously recorded colocalized grid fields were strongly correlated, which suggests that the readout of the animal’s position might still be intact. Similar field shifts were also observed in place and boundary cells—albeit of greater magnitude and more pronounced closer to the reconfigured boundary—which suggests that there is no simple one-to-one relationship between these three different cell types.</p>

Coherent, atomically thin transition-metal dichalcogenide superlattices with engineered strain
<p>Epitaxy forms the basis of modern electronics and optoelectronics. We report coherent atomically thin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superlattic</span></strong>es in which different transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers—despite large lattice mismatches—are repeated and laterally integrated without dislocations within the monolayer plane. Grown by an omnidirectional epitaxy, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superlattic</span></strong>es display fully matched lattice constants across heterointerfaces while maintaining an isotropic lattice structure and triangular symmetry. This strong epitaxial strain is precisely engineered via the nanoscale supercell dimensions, thereby enabling broad tuning of the optical properties and producing photoluminescence peak shifts as large as 250 millielectron volts. We present theoretical models to explain this coherent growth and the energetic interplay governing the ripple formation in these strained monolayers. Such coherent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superlattic</span></strong>es provide building blocks with targeted functionalities at the atomically thin limit.</p>

Nanocrystalline copper films are never flat
<p>We used scanning tunneling microscopy to study low-angle grain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">boundari</span></strong>es at the surface of nearly planar copper nanocrystalline (111) films. The presence of grain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">boundari</span></strong>es and their emergence at the film surface create valleys composed of dissociated edge dislocations and ridges where partial dislocations have recombined. Geometric analysis and simulations indicated that valleys and ridges were created by an out-of-plane grain rotation driven by reduction of grain boundary energy. These results suggest that in general, it is impossible to form flat two-dimensional nanocrystalline films of copper and other metals exhibiting small stacking fault energies and/or large elastic anisotropy, which induce a large anisotropy in the dislocation-line energy.</p>

High-temperature quantum oscillations caused by recurring Bloch states in graphene superlattices

Cryogenic temperatures are usually required to observe these oscillations. We show that graphene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superlattic</span></strong>es support a different type of quantum oscillation that does not rely on Landau quantization. The oscillations are extremely robust and persist well above room temperature in magnetic fields of only a few tesla. We attribute this phenomenon to repetitive changes in the electronic structure of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superlattic</span></strong>es such that charge carriers experience effectively no magnetic field at simple fractions of the flux quantum per <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superlattic</span></strong>e unit cell.

Quantized electric multipole insulators

Such systems exhibit gapped <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">boundari</span></strong>es that are themselves lower-dimensional topological phases. Furthermore, they host topologically protected corner states carrying fractional charge, exhibiting fractionalization at the boundary of the boundary. To characterize these insulating phases of matter, we introduce a paradigm in which “nested” Wilson loops give rise to topological invariants that have been overlooked. We propose three realistic experimental implementations of this topological behavior that can be immediately tested. Our work opens a venue for the expansion of the classification of topological phases of matter.</p>

Here, we report the discovery of silicate glass spherules in a discrete stratigraphic layer from three marine P-E boundary sections on the Atlantic margin. Distinct characteristics identify the spherules as microtektites and microkrystites, indicating that an extraterrestrial impact occurred during the carbon isotope excursion at the P-E boundary.</p>

New dimensions for brain mapping
<p>The representation of memory in the brain is one of the unresolved questions in neuroscience. A key feature of learning and memory is the process of neuroplasticity—the ability of the brain to remodel structurally and functionally as a result of cognitive experience. Although the neurobiological basis of this process (that is, synaptic plasticity) is well established, the system level dynamics of neuroplasticity are still unclear. Recently, diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI), which can be carried out noninvasively in humans, provided a new approach to explore neuroplasticity. One of the parameters extracted from DW-MRI is mean diffusivity (MD) of water molecules, which is a biomarker of tissue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microstructur</span></strong>e (<i>1</i>). By probing changes in MD across the brain, areas of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microstructur</span></strong>al plasticity can be detected within hours of learning. On page 1045 of this issue, Brodt <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) used DW-MRI after an object-location memory task and found that brain plasticity occurs in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) rather than in the hippocampus. Furthermore, they demonstrated that localized DW-MRI changes follow the basic definition of a memory engram (the physical manifestation of memories stored in the brain). These observations go beyond the understanding of memory representation in the brain. Probing MD with DW-MRI appears to provide a detailed and comprehensive monitoring of brain microanatomy, revealing uncharted relations between brain structure and function.</p>

Multicomponent intermetallic nanoparticles and superb mechanical behaviors of complex alloys
<p>Alloy design based on single–principal-element systems has approached its limit for performance enhancements. A substantial increase in strength up to gigapascal levels typically causes the premature failure of materials with reduced ductility. Here, we report a strategy to break this trade-off by controllably introducing high-density ductile multicomponent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intermetal</span></strong>lic nanoparticles (MCINPs) in complex alloy systems. Distinct from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intermetal</span></strong>lic-induced embrittlement under conventional wisdom, such MCINP-strengthened alloys exhibit superior strengths of 1.5 gigapascals and ductility as high as 50% in tension at ambient temperature. The plastic instability, a major concern for high-strength materials, can be completely eliminated by generating a distinctive multistage work-hardening behavior, resulting from pronounced dislocation activities and deformation-induced microbands. This MCINP strategy offers a paradigm to develop next-generation materials for structural applications.</p>

Rapid change of superconductivity and electron-phonon coupling through critical doping in Bi-2212
<p>Electron-boson coupling plays a key role in superconductivity for many systems. However, in copper-based high–critical temperature (<i>T</i><sub>c</sub>) superconductors, its relation to superconductivity remains controversial despite strong spectroscopic fingerprints. In this study, we used angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to find a pronounced correlation between the superconducting gap and the bosonic coupling strength near the Brillouin zone boundary in Bi<sub>2</sub>Sr<sub>2</sub>CaCu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8+δ</sub>. The bosonic coupling strength rapidly increases from the overdoped Fermi liquid regime to the optimally doped strange metal, concomitant with the quadrupled superconducting gap and the doubled gap-to-<i>T</i><sub>c</sub> ratio across the pseudogap boundary. This synchronized lattice and electronic response suggests that the effects of electronic interaction and the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) reinforce each other in a positive-feedback loop upon entering the strange-metal regime, which in turn drives a stronger superconductivity.</p>

Postimpact earliest Paleogene warming shown by fish debris oxygen isotopes (El Kef, Tunisia)
<p>Greenhouse warming is a predicted consequence of the Chicxulub impact, but supporting data are sparse. This shortcoming compromises understanding of the impact’s effects, and it has persisted due to an absence of sections that both contain suitable material for traditional carbonate- or organic-based paleothermometry and are complete and expanded enough to resolve changes on short time scales. We address the problem by analyzing the oxygen isotopic composition of fish debris, phosphatic microfossils that are relatively resistant to diagenetic alteration, from the Global Stratotype Section and Point for the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary at El Kef, Tunisia. We report an ~1 per mil decrease in oxygen isotopic values (~5°C warming) beginning at the boundary and spanning ~300 centimeters of section (~100,000 years). The pattern found matches expectations for impact-initiated greenhouse warming.</p>

We showed that the solute induces long-range interactions that determine the solidification <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microstructur</span></strong>e.

Small pockets of low magnetic field strength, small radius of curvature, and high electric current mark the electron diffusion region.

Using a polycrystalline gold thin film subjected to heating, we show how gBCDI resolves grain boundary and dislocation dynamics in individual grains in three-dimensional detail with 10-nanometer spatial and subangstrom displacement field resolution. These results pave the way for understanding polycrystalline material response under external stimuli and, ideally, engineering particular functions.</p>

Grain boundary stability governs hardening and softening in extremely fine nanograined metals
<p>Conventional metals become harder with decreasing grain sizes, following the classical Hall-Petch relationship. However, this relationship fails and softening occurs at some grain sizes in the nanometer regime for some alloys. In this study, we discovered that plastic deformation mechanism of extremely fine nanograined metals and their hardness are adjustable through tailoring grain boundary (GB) stability. The electrodeposited nanograined nickel-molybdenum (Ni–Mo) samples become softened for grain sizes below 10 nanometers because of GB-mediated processes. With GB stabilization through relaxation and Mo segregation, ultrahigh hardness is achieved in the nanograined samples with a plastic deformation mechanism dominated by generation of extended partial dislocations. Grain boundary stability provides an alternative dimension, in addition to grain size, for producing novel nanograined metals with extraordinary properties.</p>

Melting of subducted basalt at the core-mantle boundary
<p>The geological materials in Earth's lowermost mantle control the characteristics and interpretation of seismic ultra–low velocity zones at the base of the core-mantle boundary. Partial melting of the bulk lower mantle is often advocated as the cause, but this does not explain the nonubiquitous character of these regional seismic features. We explored the melting properties of mid-oceanic ridge basalt (MORB), which can reach the lowermost mantle after subduction of oceanic crust. At a pressure representative of the core-mantle boundary (135 gigapascals), the onset of melting occurs at ~3800 kelvin, which is ~350 kelvin below the mantle solidus. The SiO<sub>2</sub>-rich liquid generated either remains trapped in the MORB material or solidifies after reacting with the surrounding MgO-rich mantle, remixing subducted MORB with the lowermost mantle.</p>

The boundary between these two regions is largely controlled by the melting point of iron at ∼330 GPa, which in turn influences heat transfer and geodynamo generation. <bold>Anzellini <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 464, see the Perspective by Fei) compressed iron in a laser-heated diamond anvil cell, tracking its structure and texture by using time-resolved x-ray diffraction as the pressure increased to 200 GPa. The melting curve suggests the possibility of high heat flux and partial melting at the core-mantle boundary.</p></sec>

EPFL Signals in the Boundary Region of the SAM Restrict Its Size and Promote Leaf Initiation
<p>The shoot apical meristem (SAM) enables the formation of new organs throughout the life of a plant. ERECTA family (ERf) receptors restrict SAM size and promote initiation of leaves while simultaneously supporting establishment of correct phyllotaxy. In the epidermis and during organ elongation ERf activity is regulated by a family of Epidermal Patterning Factor-Like (EPFL) secreted Cys-rich small proteins. Here we show that ERfs play a critical role in communication between the SAM leaf boundary and the central zone in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Ectopic expression of <i>ERECTA</i> in the central zone using the <i>CLAVATA3</i> promoter is sufficient to restrict meristem size and promote leaf initiation. Genetic analysis demonstrated that four putative ligands: EPFL1, EPFL2, EPFL4, and EPFL6 function redundantly in the SAM. These genes are expressed at the SAM-leaf boundary and in the peripheral zone. Previously EPFL4 and EPFL6 have been linked with elongation of aboveground organs. Here we demonstrate that EPFL1 and EPFL2 promote organ elongation as well. In addition, we show that expression of <i>ERECTA</i> in the central zone of the SAM has a strong impact on elongation of internodes and pedicels and growth of leaves. These results suggest that ERfs can stimulate organ growth cell nonautonomously.</p>

Roles of miR319 and TCP Transcription Factors in Leaf Development
<p>Sophisticated regulation of gene expression, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and their target genes, is required for leaf differentiation, growth, and senescence. The impact of miR319 and its target <i>TEOSINTE BRANCHED1</i>, <i>CYCLOIDEA</i>, and <i>PROLIFERATING CELL NUCLEAR ANTIGEN BINDING FACTOR</i> (<i>TCP</i>) genes on leaf development has been extensively investigated, but the redundancies of these gene families often interfere with the evaluation of their function and regulation in the developmental context. Here, we present the genetic evidence of the involvement of the <i>MIR319</i> and <i>TCP</i> gene families in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaf development. Single mutations in <i>MIR319A</i> and <i>MIR319B</i> genes moderately inhibited the formation of leaf serrations, whereas double mutations increased the extent of this inhibition and resulted in the formation of smooth leaves. Mutations in <i>MIR319</i> and gain-of-function mutations in the <i>TCP4</i> gene conferred resistance against miR319 and impaired the cotyledon boundary and leaf serration formation. These mutations functionally associated with <i>CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON</i> genes, which regulate the cotyledon boundary and leaf serration formation. In contrast, loss-of-function mutations in miR319-targeted and nontargeted <i>TCP</i> genes cooperatively induced the formation of serrated leaves in addition to changes in the levels of their downstream gene transcript. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the <i>MIR319</i> and <i>TCP</i> gene families underlie robust and multilayer control of leaf development. This study also provides a framework toward future researches on redundant miRNAs and transcription factors in Arabidopsis and crop plants.</p>

Dimerization in LBD16 and LBD18 Transcription Factors Is Critical for Lateral Root Formation
<p>LATERAL ORGAN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">boundari</span></strong>ES DOMAIN/ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2-LIKEs (hereafter referred to as LBD) are plant-specific transcription factors that play important roles in a plethora of plant growth and development. The leucine (Leu) zipper-like coiled-coil motif in the lateral organ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">boundari</span></strong>es domain of the class I LBD proteins has been proposed to mediate protein dimerization, but it has not been experimentally assessed yet. LBD16 and LBD18 have been well characterized to play important roles in lateral root development in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Here, we investigated the role of the coiled-coil motif in the dimerization of LBD16 and LBD18 and in transcriptional regulation and biological function. We built the molecular models of the coiled coil of LBD16 and LBD18, providing the probable Leu zipper models of the helix dimer. Using a variety of molecular techniques, such as bimolecular fluorescence complementation, luciferase complementation imaging, GST pull down, and coimmunoprecipitation assays, we showed that the conserved Leu or valine residues in the coiled-coil motif are critical for the dimerization of LBD16 or LBD18. Using transgenic Arabidopsis plants that overexpress HA:LBD16 or HA:LBD16<sup>Q</sup> in <i>lbd16</i> or HA:LBD18 or HA:LBD18<sup>Q</sup> in <i>lbd18</i>, we demonstrated that the homodimerization of LBD18 mediated by the coiled-coil motif is crucial for transcriptional regulation via promoter binding and for lateral root formation. In addition, we found that the carboxyl-terminal region beyond the coiled-coil motif in LBD18 acts as an additional dimerization domain. These results provide a molecular basis for homodimerization and heterodimerization among the 42 Arabidopsis LBD family members for displaying their biological functions.</p>

Seismic evidence for partial melting at the root of major hot spot plumes
<p>Ultralow-velocity zones are localized regions of extreme material properties detected seismologically at the base of Earth's mantle. Their nature and role in mantle dynamics are poorly understood. We used shear waves diffracted at the core-mantle boundary to illuminate the root of the Iceland plume from different directions. Through waveform modeling, we detected a large ultralow-velocity zone and constrained its shape to be axisymmetric to a very good first order. We thus attribute it to partial melting of a locally thickened, denser- and hotter-than-average layer, reflecting dynamics and elevated temperatures within the plume root. Such structures are few and far apart, and they may be characteristic of the roots of some of the broad mantle plumes tomographically imaged within the large low-shear-velocity provinces in the lower mantle.</p>

Release of mineral-bound water prior to subduction tied to shallow seismogenic slip off Sumatra
<p>Plate-boundary fault rupture during the 2004 Sumatra-Andaman subduction earthquake extended closer to the trench than expected, increasing earthquake and tsunami size. International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 362 sampled incoming sediments offshore northern Sumatra, revealing recent release of fresh water within the deep sediments. Thermal modeling links this freshening to amorphous silica dehydration driven by rapid burial-induced temperature increases in the past 9 million years. Complete dehydration of silicates is expected before plate subduction, contrasting with prevailing models for subduction seismogenesis calling for fluid production during subduction. Shallow slip offshore Sumatra appears driven by diagenetic strengthening of deeply buried fault-forming sediments, contrasting with weakening proposed for the shallow Tohoku-Oki 2011 rupture, but our results are applicable to other thickly sedimented subduction zones including those with limited earthquake records.</p>

Long-range hot-carrier transport in hybrid perovskites visualized by ultrafast microscopy
<p>The Shockley-Queisser limit for solar cell efficiency can be overcome if hot carriers can be harvested before they thermalize. Recently, carrier cooling time up to 100 picoseconds was observed in hybrid perovskites, but it is unclear whether these long-lived hot carriers can migrate long distance for efficient collection. We report direct visualization of hot-carrier migration in methylammonium lead iodide (CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub>) thin films by ultrafast transient absorption microscopy, demonstrating three distinct transport regimes. Quasiballistic transport was observed to correlate with excess kinetic energy, resulting in up to 230 nanometers transport distance that could overcome grain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">boundari</span></strong>es. The nonequilibrium transport persisted over tens of picoseconds and ~600 nanometers before reaching the diffusive transport limit. These results suggest potential applications of hot-carrier devices based on hybrid perovskites.</p>

Controlled growth and form of precipitating microsculptures
<p>Controlled self-assembly of three-dimensional shapes holds great potential for fabrication of functional materials. Their practical realization requires a theoretical framework to quantify and guide the dynamic sculpting of the curved structures that often arise in accretive mineralization. Motivated by a variety of bioinspired coprecipitation patterns of carbonate and silica, we develop a geometrical theory for the kinetics of the growth front that leaves behind thin-walled complex structures. Our theory explains the range of previously observed experimental patterns and, in addition, predicts unexplored assembly pathways. This allows us to design a number of functional base shapes of optical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microstructur</span></strong>es, which we synthesize to demonstrate their light-guiding capabilities. Overall, our framework provides a way to understand and control the growth and form of functional precipitating microsculptures.</p>

Bone-like crack resistance in hierarchical metastable nanolaminate steels
<p>Fatigue failures create enormous risks for all engineered structures, as well as for human lives, motivating large safety factors in design and, thus, inefficient use of resources. Inspired by the excellent fracture toughness of bone, we explored the fatigue resistance in metastability-assisted multiphase steels. We show here that when steel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microstructur</span></strong>es are hierarchical and laminated, similar to the substructure of bone, superior crack resistance can be realized. Our results reveal that tuning the interface structure, distribution, and phase stability to simultaneously activate multiple micromechanisms that resist crack propagation is key for the observed leap in mechanical response. The exceptional properties enabled by this strategy provide guidance for all fatigue-resistant alloy design efforts.</p>

Transformation of bulk alloys to oxide nanowires
<p>One dimensional (1D) nanostructures offer prospects for enhancing the electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties of a broad range of functional materials and composites, but their synthesis methods are typically elaborate and expensive. We demonstrate a direct transformation of bulk materials into nanowires under ambient conditions without the use of catalysts or any external stimuli. The nanowires form via minimization of strain energy at the boundary of a chemical reaction front. We show the transformation of multimicrometer-sized particles of aluminum or magnesium alloys into alkoxide nanowires of tunable dimensions, which are converted into oxide nanowires upon heating in air. Fabricated separators based on aluminum oxide nanowires enhanced the safety and rate capabilities of lithium-ion batteries. The reported approach allows ultralow-cost scalable synthesis of 1D materials and membranes.</p>

Microstructural proliferation in human cortex is coupled with the development of face processing
<p>How does cortical tissue change as brain function and behavior improve from childhood to adulthood? By combining quantitative and functional magnetic resonance imaging in children and adults, we find differential development of high-level visual areas that are involved in face and place recognition. Development of face-selective regions, but not place-selective regions, is dominated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microstructur</span></strong>al proliferation. This tissue development is correlated with specific increases in functional selectivity to faces, as well as improvements in face recognition, and ultimately leads to differentiated tissue properties between face- and place-selective regions in adulthood, which we validate with postmortem cytoarchitectonic measurements. These data suggest a new model by which emergent brain function and behavior result from cortical tissue proliferation rather than from pruning exclusively.</p>

Biaxially strained PtPb/Pt core/shell nanoplate boosts oxygen reduction catalysis
<p>Compressive surface strains have been necessary to boost oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity in core/shell M/platinum (Pt) catalysts (where M can be nickel, cobalt, or iron). We report on a class of platinum-lead/platinum (PtPb/Pt) core/shell nanoplate catalysts that exhibit large biaxial strains. The stable Pt (110) facets of the nanoplates have high ORR specific and mass activities that reach 7.8 milliampere (mA) per centimeter squared and 4.3 ampere per milligram of platinum at 0.9 volts versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), respectively. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the edge-Pt and top (bottom)–Pt (110) facets undergo large tensile strains that help optimize the Pt-O bond strength. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intermetal</span></strong>lic core and uniform four layers of Pt shell of the PtPb/Pt nanoplates appear to underlie the high endurance of these catalysts, which can undergo 50,000 voltage cycles with negligible activity decay and no apparent structure and composition changes.</p>

Localized seismic deformation in the upper mantle revealed by dense seismic arrays
<p>Seismicity along continental transform faults is usually confined to the upper half of the crust, but the Newport-Inglewood fault (NIF), a major fault traversing the Los Angeles basin, is seismically active down to the upper mantle. We use seismic array analysis to illuminate the seismogenic root of the NIF beneath Long Beach, California, and identify seismicity in an actively deforming localized zone penetrating the lithospheric mantle. Deep earthquakes, which are spatially correlated with geochemical evidence of a fluid pathway from the mantle, as well as with a sharp vertical offset in the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary, exhibit narrow size distribution and weak temporal clustering. We attribute these characteristics to a transition from strong to weak interaction regimes in a system of seismic asperities embedded in a ductile fault zone matrix.</p>

Electron optics with p-n junctions in ballistic graphene
<p>Electrons transmitted across a ballistic semiconductor junction are expected to undergo refraction, analogous to light rays across an optical boundary. In graphene, the linear dispersion and zero-gap band structure admit highly transparent p-n junctions by simple electrostatic gating. Here, we employ transverse magnetic focusing to probe the propagation of carriers across an electrostatically defined graphene junction. We find agreement with the predicted Snell’s law for electrons, including the observation of both positive and negative refraction. Resonant transmission across the p-n junction provides a direct measurement of the angle-dependent transmission coefficient. Comparing experimental data with simulations reveals the crucial role played by the effective junction width, providing guidance for future device design. Our results pave the way for realizing electron optics based on graphene p-n junctions.</p>

Tomography reveals buoyant asthenosphere accumulating beneath the Juan de Fuca plate
<p>The boundary between Earth’s strong lithospheric plates and the underlying mantle asthenosphere corresponds to an abrupt seismic velocity decrease and electrical conductivity increase with depth, perhaps indicating a thin, weak layer that may strongly influence plate motion dynamics. The behavior of such a layer at subduction zones remains unexplored. We present a tomographic model, derived from on- and offshore seismic experiments, that reveals a strong low-velocity feature beneath the subducting Juan de Fuca slab along the entire Cascadia subduction zone. Through simple geodynamic arguments, we propose that this low-velocity feature is the accumulation of material from a thin, weak, buoyant layer present beneath the entire oceanic lithosphere. The presence of this feature could have major implications for our understanding of the asthenosphere and subduction zone dynamics.</p>

Synaptotagmin-Associated Endoplasmic Reticulum-Plasma Membrane Contact Sites Are Localized to Immobile ER Tubules
<p>The plant endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is morphologically divided into tubules and sheets, seems to flow continuously as a whole, but locally, mobile and immobile regions exist. In eukaryotes, the ER physically and functionally interacts with the plasma membrane (PM) at domains called ER-PM contact sites (EPCSs). Extended synaptotagmin family proteins are concentrated in the cortical ER to form one type of EPCS; however, it is unclear whether the localization of extended synaptotagmin corresponds to the EPCS and where in the cortical ER the EPCSs are formed. Here, we analyzed the spatiotemporal localization of SYNAPTOTAGMIN1 (SYT1), a synaptotagmin in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), to investigate the precise distribution of SYT1-associated EPCSs in the cortical ER. Three-dimensional imaging using superresolution confocal live imaging microscopy demonstrated that SYT1 was specifically localized to the ER-PM boundary. Time-lapse imaging revealed that SYT1 was distributed to immobile ER tubules, but not to mobile tubules. Moreover, SYT1 was frequently localized to the edges of ER sheets that were transformed into immobile ER tubules over time. A lower intracellular calcium ion concentration resulted in an increased EPCS area and disrupted the ER network. Finally, SYT1 deficiency caused a reduction of the immobile tubules and enlargement of the ER meshes. Taken together, our findings show that SYT1-associated EPCS are distributed to immobile tubules and play an important role in the formation of the tubular ER network. This provides important insight into the relationship between the function and dynamics/morphology of the cortical ER.</p>

The ARF7 and ARF19 Transcription Factors Positively Regulate <i>PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE1</i> in Arabidopsis Roots
<p>PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE1 (PHR1) is a key regulatory component of the response to phosphate (Pi) starvation. However, the regulation of <i>PHR1</i> in this response remains poorly understood. Here, we report that <i>PHR1</i> is a target of the transcription factors AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR7 (ARF7) and ARF19 and is positively regulated by auxin signaling in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) roots. <i>PHR1</i> expression was induced by exogenous auxin and suppressed by auxin transport inhibitors in Arabidopsis roots. In the <i>PHR1</i> promoter, three auxin-response elements, which are bound directly by ARF7 and ARF19, were shown to be essential for <i>PHR1</i> expression. The <i>arf7</i>, <i>arf19</i>, and <i>arf7 arf19</i> mutants showed down-regulated expression of <i>PHR1</i> and downstream Pi starvation-induced genes in roots; they also exhibited defective Pi uptake in roots and overaccumulation of anthocyanin in shoots. The induction of lateral root formation in response to low Pi and to exogenous auxin was decreased in the <i>phr1</i> mutant, whereas the expression of <i>LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES-DOMAIN16</i> (<i>LBD16</i>) and <i>LBD29</i> was not changed significantly. PHR1 acted independently of LBD16 and LBD29 in the regulation of lateral root formation in response to low Pi. Under low-Pi conditions, lateral root impairment in the <i>arf7 arf19</i> mutant was partially rescued by constitutive expression of <i>PHR1</i>, demonstrating that reduced <i>PHR1</i> expression contributed to the <i>arf7 arf19</i> phenotype. In addition to <i>PHR1</i>, other genes encoding MYB-CC members also were targets of ARF7 and ARF19. Our work thus reveals a mechanism coordinating auxin signaling and the PHR1 regulon in Arabidopsis responses to Pi deficiency.</p>

Transcriptional Roadmap to Seasonal Variation in Wood Formation of Norway Spruce
<p>Seasonal cues influence several aspects of the secondary growth of tree stems, including cambial activity, wood chemistry, and transition to latewood formation. We investigated seasonal changes in cambial activity, secondary cell wall formation, and tracheid cell death in woody tissues of Norway spruce (<i>Picea abies</i>) throughout one seasonal cycle. RNA sequencing was performed simultaneously in both the xylem and cambium/phloem tissues of the stem. Principal component analysis revealed gradual shifts in the transcriptomes that followed a chronological order throughout the season. A notable remodeling of the transcriptome was observed in the winter, with many genes having maximal expression during the coldest months of the year. A highly coexpressed set of monolignol biosynthesis genes showed high expression during the period of secondary cell wall formation as well as a second peak in midwinter. This midwinter peak in expression did not trigger lignin deposition, as determined by pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Coexpression consensus network analyses suggested the involvement of transcription factors belonging to the ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2/LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES and MYELOBLASTOSIS-HOMEOBOX families in the seasonal control of secondary cell wall formation of tracheids. Interestingly, the lifetime of the latewood tracheids stretched beyond the winter dormancy period, correlating with a lack of cell death-related gene expression. Our transcriptomic analyses combined with phylogenetic and microscopic analyses also identified the cellulose and lignin biosynthetic genes and putative regulators for latewood formation and tracheid cell death in Norway spruce, providing a toolbox for further physiological and functional assays of these important phase transitions.</p>

Reassessing the Roles of PIN Proteins and Anticlinal Microtubules during Pavement Cell Morphogenesis
<p>The leaf epidermis is a biomechanical shell that influences the size and shape of the organ. Its morphogenesis is a multiscale process in which nanometer-scale cytoskeletal protein complexes, individual cells, and groups of cells pattern growth and define macroscopic leaf traits. Interdigitated growth of neighboring cells is an evolutionarily conserved developmental strategy. Understanding how signaling pathways and cytoskeletal proteins pattern cell walls during this form of tissue morphogenesis is an important research challenge. The cellular and molecular control of a lobed cell morphology is currently thought to involve PIN-FORMED (PIN)-type plasma membrane efflux carriers that generate subcellular auxin gradients. Auxin gradients were proposed to function across cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">boundari</span></strong>es to encode stable offset patterns of cortical microtubules and actin filaments between adjacent cells. Many models suggest that long-lived microtubules along the anticlinal cell wall generate local cell wall heterogeneities that restrict local growth and specify the timing and location of lobe formation. Here, we used Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) reverse genetics and multivariate long-term time-lapse imaging to test current cell shape control models. We found that neither PIN proteins nor long-lived microtubules along the anticlinal wall predict the patterns of lobe formation. In fields of lobing cells, anticlinal microtubules are not correlated with cell shape and are unstable at the time scales of cell expansion. Our analyses indicate that anticlinal microtubules have multiple functions in pavement cells and that lobe initiation is likely controlled by complex interactions among cell geometry, cell wall stress patterns, and transient microtubule networks that span the anticlinal and periclinal walls.</p>

PaCeQuant: A Tool for High-Throughput Quantification of Pavement Cell Shape Characteristics
<p>Pavement cells (PCs) are the most frequently occurring cell type in the leaf epidermis and play important roles in leaf growth and function. In many plant species, PCs form highly complex jigsaw-puzzle-shaped cells with interlocking lobes. Understanding of their development is of high interest for plant science research because of their importance for leaf growth and hence for plant fitness and crop yield. Studies of PC development, however, are limited, because robust methods are lacking that enable automatic segmentation and quantification of PC shape parameters suitable to reflect their cellular complexity. Here, we present our new ImageJ-based tool, PaCeQuant, which provides a fully automatic image analysis workflow for PC shape quantification. PaCeQuant automatically detects cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">boundari</span></strong>es of PCs from confocal input images and enables manual correction of automatic segmentation results or direct import of manually segmented cells. PaCeQuant simultaneously extracts 27 shape features that include global, contour-based, skeleton-based, and PC-specific object descriptors. In addition, we included a method for classification and analysis of lobes at two-cell junctions and three-cell junctions, respectively. We provide an R script for graphical visualization and statistical analysis. We validated PaCeQuant by extensive comparative analysis to manual segmentation and existing quantification tools and demonstrated its usability to analyze PC shape characteristics during development and between different genotypes. PaCeQuant thus provides a platform for robust, efficient, and reproducible quantitative analysis of PC shape characteristics that can easily be applied to study PC development in large data sets.</p>

Spatial Mapping and Profiling of Metabolite Distributions during Germination
<p>Germination is a highly complex process by which seeds begin to develop and establish themselves as viable organisms. In this study, we utilize a combination of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, liquid chromatography-fluorescence, and mass spectrometry imaging approaches to profile and visualize the metabolic distributions of germinating seeds from two different inbreds of maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) seeds, B73 and Mo17. Gas chromatography and liquid chromatography analyses demonstrate that the two inbreds are highly differentiated in their metabolite profiles throughout the course of germination, especially with regard to amino acids, sugar alcohols, and small organic acids. Crude dissection of the seed followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of polar metabolites also revealed that many compounds were highly sequestered among the various seed tissue types. To further localize compounds, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging was utilized to visualize compounds in fine detail in their native environments over the course of germination. Most notably, the fatty acyl chain-dependent differential localization of phospholipids and triacylglycerols was observed within the embryo and radicle, showing correlation with the heterogeneous distribution of fatty acids. Other interesting observations include unusual localization of ceramides on the endosperm/scutellum boundary and subcellular localization of ferulate in the aleurone.</p>

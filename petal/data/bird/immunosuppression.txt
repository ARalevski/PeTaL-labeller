Pericarditis as a Marker of Occult Cancer and a Prognostic Factor for Cancer Mortality
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Pericarditis may be a serious complication of malignancy. Its significance as a first symptom of occult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> and as a prognostic factor for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> survival is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using Danish medical databases, we conducted a nationwide cohort study of all patients with a first-time diagnosis of pericarditis during 1994 to 2013. We excluded patients with previous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> and followed up the remaining patients for subsequent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> diagnosis until November 30, 2013. We calculated risks and standardized incidence ratios of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> for patients with pericarditis compared with the general population. We assessed whether pericarditis predicts <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> survival by the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression using a matched comparison cohort of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> patients without pericarditis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 13 759 patients with acute pericarditis, 1550 subsequently were diagnosed with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> during follow-up. The overall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> standardized incidence ratio was 1.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4–1.5), driven predominantly by increased rates of lung, kidney, and bladder <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>, lymphoma, leukemia, and unspecified metastatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>. The <3-month <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> risk among patients with pericarditis was 2.7%, and the standardized incidence ratio was 12.4 (95% CI, 11.2–13.7). The 3- to <12-month standardized incidence ratio of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> was 1.5 (95% CI, 1.2–1.7), subsequently decreasing to 1.1 (95% CI, 1.0–1.2). Three-month survival after the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> diagnosis was 80% and 86% among those with and without pericarditis, respectively, and the hazard ratio was 1.5 (95% CI, 1.3–1.8). One-year survival was 65% and 70%, respectively, corresponding to a 3- to <12-month hazard ratio of 1.3 (95% CI, 1.1–1.5).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Pericarditis may be a marker of occult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> and augurs increased mortality after a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> diagnosis.</p></sec>

Cardiac Mortality Among 200 000 Five-Year Survivors of Cancer Diagnosed at 15 to 39 Years of Age
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Survivors of teenage and young adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> are acknowledged as understudied. Little is known about their long-term adverse health risks, particularly of cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e that is increased in other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> populations where cardiotoxic treatments have been used.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The Teenage and Young Adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> Survivor Study cohort comprises 200 945 5-year survivors of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> diagnosed at 15 to 39 years of age in England and Wales from 1971 to 2006, and followed to 2014. Standardized mortality ratios, absolute excess risks, and cumulative risks were calculated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Two thousand sixteen survivors died of cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. For all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s combined, the standardized mortality ratios for all cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es combined was greatest for individuals diagnosed at 15 to 19 years of age (4.2; 95% confidence interval, 3.4–5.2) decreasing to 1.2 (95% confidence interval, 1.1–1.3) for individuals aged 35 to 39 years (2<i>P</i> for trend <0.0001). Similar patterns were observed for both standardized mortality ratios and absolute excess risks for ischemic heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, valvular heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, and cardiomyopathy. Survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma, acute myeloid leukaemia, genitourinary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s other than bladder <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, lung <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>, leukaemia other than acute myeloid, central nervous system tumour, cervical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>, and breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> experienced 3.8, 2.7, 2.0, 1.7, 1.7, 1.6, 1.4, 1.3 and 1.2 times the number of cardiac deaths expected from the general population, respectively.

Truncation- and motif-based pan-cancer analysis reveals tumor-suppressing kinases
<p>A major challenge in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> genomics is identifying “driver” mutations from the many neutral “passenger” mutations within a given tumor. To identify driver mutations that would otherwise be lost within mutational noise, we filtered genomic data by motifs that are critical for kinase activity. In the first step of our screen, we used data from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> Cell Line Encyclopedia and The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> Genome Atlas to identify kinases with truncation mutations occurring within or before the kinase domain. The top 30 tumor-suppressing kinases were aligned, and hotspots for loss-of-function (LOF) mutations were identified on the basis of amino acid conservation and mutational frequency. The functional consequences of new LOF mutations were biochemically validated, and the top 15 hotspot LOF residues were used in a pan-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> analysis to define the tumor-suppressing kinome. A ranked list revealed MAP2K7, an essential mediator of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, as a candidate tumor suppressor in gastric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>, despite its mutational frequency falling within the mutational noise for this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> type. The majority of mutations in MAP2K7 abolished its catalytic activity, and reactivation of the JNK pathway in gastric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells harboring LOF mutations in MAP2K7 or the downstream kinase JNK suppressed clonogenicity and growth in soft agar, demonstrating the functional relevance of inactivating the JNK pathway in gastric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>. Together, our data highlight a broadly applicable strategy to identify functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> driver mutations and define the JNK pathway as tumor-suppressive in gastric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>.</p>

Antibody-dependent enhancement of severe dengue disease in humans
<p>For dengue viruses 1 to 4 (DENV1-4), a specific range of antibody titer has been shown to enhance viral replication in vitro and severe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e in animal models. Although suspected, such antibody-dependent enhancement of severe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e has not been shown to occur in humans. Using multiple statistical approaches to study a long-term pediatric cohort in Nicaragua, we show that risk of severe dengue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e is highest within a narrow range of preexisting anti-DENV antibody titers. By contrast, we observe protection from all symptomatic dengue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e at high antibody titers. Thus, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e correlates of severe dengue must be evaluated separately from correlates of protection against symptomatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. These results have implications for studies of dengue pathogenesis and for vaccine development, because enhancement, not just lack of protection, is of concern.</p>

Phenotypic Consequences of a Genetic Predisposition to Enhanced Nitric Oxide Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Nitric oxide signaling plays a key role in the regulation of vascular tone and platelet activation. Here, we seek to understand the impact of a genetic predisposition to enhanced nitric oxide signaling on risk for cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es, thus informing the potential utility of pharmacological stimulation of the nitric oxide pathway as a therapeutic strategy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We analyzed the association of common and rare genetic variants in 2 genes that mediate nitric oxide signaling (Nitric Oxide Synthase 3 [<i>NOS3</i>] and Guanylate Cyclase 1, Soluble, Alpha 3 [<i>GUCY1A3</i>]) with a range of human phenotypes. We selected 2 common variants (rs3918226 in <i>NOS3</i> and rs7692387 in <i>GUCY1A3</i>) known to associate with increased <i>NOS3</i> and <i>GUCY1A3</i> expression and reduced mean arterial pressure, combined them into a genetic score, and standardized this exposure to a 5 mm Hg reduction in mean arterial pressure. Using individual-level data from 335 464 participants in the UK Biobank and summary association results from 7 large-scale genome-wide association studies, we examined the effect of this nitric oxide signaling score on cardiometabolic and other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es.

We measured cumulative numbers of LDIR-related cardiac procedures for each patient until 1 year before the time of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> diagnosis or administrative censoring. To assess the association between LDIR exposure and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> risk, we conducted a nested case-control study and matched <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cases with controls on sex, CHD severity, birth year, and age.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The study included 24 833 adult patients with CHD aged 18 to 64 years from 1995 to 2009. In >250 791 person-years of follow-up, 602 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cases were observed (median age, 55.4 years). The cumulative incidence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> estimated up to 64 years of age was 15.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 14.2–16.5). Cases had more LDIR-related cardiac procedures than controls (1410 versus 921 per 1000 adult patients with CHD, <i>P</i><0.0001). Cumulative LDIR exposure was independently associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> (odds ratio [OR], 1.08 per procedure; 95% CI, 1.04–1.13). Similar results were obtained by using dose estimates for LDIR exposure (OR, 1.10 per 10 mSv; 95% CI, 1.05–1.15) with a possible dose-related response. The effect measure was in the same direction, and the association was persistent for exposure from ≥6 procedures in all sensitivity analyses: after excluding most smoking-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cases (OR, 1.10 per procedure; 95% CI, 1.05–1.16 and OR when exposure from ≥6 procedures, 3.08; 95% CI, 1.77–5.37), and after applying a 3-year lag period (OR, 1.09 per procedure; 95% CI, 1.03–1.14 and OR when exposure from ≥6 procedures: 2.58; 95% CI, 1.43–4.69).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first large population-based study to analyze and document the association between LDIR-related cardiac procedures and incident <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> in the population of adults with CHD.

Targeting TNFR2 with antagonistic antibodies inhibits proliferation of ovarian cancer cells and tumor-associated T<sub>regs</sub>
<p>Major barriers to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> therapy include the lack of selective inhibitors of regulatory T cells (T<sub>regs</sub>) and the lack of broadly applicable ways to directly target tumors through frequently expressed surface oncogenes. Tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2) is an attractive target protein because of its restricted abundance to highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>osuppressive T<sub>regs</sub> and oncogenic presence on human tumors. We characterized the effect of TNFR2 inhibition using antagonistic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es. In culture-based assays, we found that two TNFR2 antagonists inhibited T<sub>reg</sub> proliferation, reduced soluble TNFR2 secretion from normal cells, and enabled T effector cell expansion. The antagonistic activity occurred in the presence of added TNF, a natural TNFR2 agonist. These TNFR2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es killed T<sub>regs</sub> isolated from ovarian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> ascites more potently than it killed T<sub>regs</sub> from healthy donor samples, suggesting that these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es may have specificity for the tumor microenvironment. The TNFR2 antagonists also killed OVCAR3 ovarian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells, which have abundant surface TNFR2. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es stabilized antiparallel dimers in cell surface TNFR2 that rendered the receptor unable to activate the nuclear factor κB pathway and trigger cell proliferation. Our data suggest that, by targeting tumor cells and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>osuppressive tumor-associated T<sub>regs</sub>, antagonistic TNFR2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es may be an effective treatment for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s positive for TNFR2.</p>

Immunity as a continuum of archetypes
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e system</span></strong> has long been recognized for its importance in eliminating pathogens. Recently, it has become appreciated for additional distinct roles in normal tissue biology, contributing to tissue development and maintenance. Further, it is being revealed as a major force in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es as diverse as fibrosis, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer's <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, as well as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e system</span></strong> is exquisitely selective; more than a billion different adaptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e lymphocytes (T cells and B cells) survey the body. These can individually be sensitized to antigens—for example, by vaccination—leading to their expansion and to a rapid and protective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e response that destroys antigen-bearing cells upon reexposure. Alternatively, the system can become “tolerant” when antigen-specific T cells and/or B cells are deleted or inactivated. Historically, activation versus inaction (tolerance) have dominated views of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e system</span></strong>. These, however, should be considered the extremes of a continuum of “archetypal” response states that collections of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e cells can take, many of which serve to accommodate dynamic tissue function.</p>

The paradox of mutations and cancer
<p>The past decade has witnessed the cataloging of genetic mutations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> genomes, providing new insights into how and in what ways <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> can develop and spread (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). The focus has been on defining specific “driver” mutations, genetic errors in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells that reveal basic biological processes gone awry that are required for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> initiation and progression. These drivers are the target of new therapies—this concept is central to precision oncology efforts to treat patients according to the genetic changes that are present in their tumors (<i>3</i>). Along the way, it has also become apparent that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> genomes harbor many additional “passenger” mutations (<i>4</i>). Patterns of driver and passenger DNA mutations derived from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> genomes have provided clues about the different ways that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> can manifest as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e of genetic mutations (<i>5</i>, <i>6</i>). In some circumstances, they can be linked to strong environmental carcinogens (for example, mutation patterns caused by tobacco smoke, ultraviolet radiation, or the fungal toxin aflatoxin) (<i>7</i>). Moreover, these forensic mutational patterns can be used to estimate how long it has taken for a tumor to develop (<i>5</i>). On page 911 of this issue, Martincorena <i>et al.</i> (<i>8</i>) turned their attention toward the detection of mutations in normal tissue, addressing a long-standing paradox that mutations arise in normal tissues but do not necessarily lead to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>.</p>

The chromatin accessibility landscape of primary human cancers
<p>We present the genome-wide chromatin accessibility profiles of 410 tumor samples spanning 23 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> types from The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> Genome Atlas (TCGA). We identify 562,709 transposase-accessible DNA elements that substantially extend the compendium of known cis-regulatory elements. Integration of ATAC-seq (the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing) with TCGA multi-omic data identifies a large number of putative distal enhancers that distinguish molecular subtypes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s, uncovers specific driving transcription factors via protein-DNA footprints, and nominates long-range gene-regulatory interactions in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>. These data reveal genetic risk loci of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> predisposition as active DNA regulatory elements in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>, identify gene-regulatory interactions underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e evasion, and pinpoint noncoding mutations that drive enhancer activation and may affect patient survival. These results suggest a systematic approach to understanding the noncoding genome in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> to advance diagnosis and therapy.</p>

Antibody-mediated inhibition of MICA and MICB shedding promotes NK cell–driven tumor immunity
<p>MICA and MICB are expressed by many human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s as a result of cellular stress, and can tag cells for elimination by cytotoxic lymphocytes through natural killer group 2D (NKG2D) receptor activation. However, tumors evade this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e recognition pathway through proteolytic shedding of MICA and MICB proteins. We rationally designed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es targeting the MICA α3 domain, the site of proteolytic shedding, and found that these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es prevented loss of cell surface MICA and MICB by human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es inhibited tumor growth in multiple fully <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ocompetent mouse models and reduced human melanoma metastases in a humanized mouse model. Antitumor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity was mediated mainly by natural killer (NK) cells through activation of NKG2D and CD16 Fc receptors. This approach prevents the loss of important <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ostimulatory ligands by human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s and reactivates antitumor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity.</p>

Cancer bypasses the lymph nodes
<p>“What did the lymph nodes show?” is the question whose answer is apprehensively awaited by every colon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> patient. Even in the age of molecular medicine, the absence or presence of colon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> spread to regional lymph nodes remains the strongest predictor of whether surgery has cured the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>, or whether an individual may harbor occult metastatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e and thus require adjuvant chemotherapy to reduce the risk of lethal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> metastases recurring in distant organs (<i>1</i>–<i>3</i>). But is colon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> spread to lymph nodes a precursor of spread to another organ (e.g., the liver) or rather an indicator of colon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells' metastatic competence? On page 55 of this issue, Naxerova <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) provide molecular evidence that, in many instances, colon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> metastases in the liver (and possibly other distant organs), originate from distinct clone(s) that differ from the founder(s) of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> deposits in the lymph nodes.</p>

Genetic and phenotypically flexible components of seasonal variation in immune function
<p>Animals cope with seasonal variation in environmental factors by adjustments of physiology and life history. When seasonal variation is partly predictable, such adjustments can be based on a genetic component or be phenotypically flexible. Animals have to allocate limited resources over different demands, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e function. Accordingly, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e traits could change seasonally, and such changes could have a genetic component that differs between environments. We tested this hypothesis in genotypically distinct groups of a widespread songbird, the stonechat (<i>Saxicola torquata</i>). We compared variation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity during 1 year in long-distance migrants, short-distance migrants, tropical residents and hybrids in a common garden environment. Additionally, we investigated phenotypically flexible responses to temperature by applying different temperature regimes to one group. We assessed constitutive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity by measuring hemagglutination, hemolysis, haptoglobin and bactericidal ability against <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. Genotypic groups differed in patterns of variation of all measured <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e indices except haptoglobin. Hybrids differed from, but were rarely intermediate to, parental subspecies. Temperature treatment only influenced patterns of hemolysis and bactericidal ability against <i>E. coli.</i> We conclude that seasonal variation in constitutive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity has a genetic component, that heredity does not follow simple Mendelian rules, and that some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e measures are relatively rigid while others are more flexible. Furthermore, our results support the idea that seasonal variability in constitutive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity is associated with variability in environment and annual-cycle demands. This study stresses the importance of considering seasonal variation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e function in relation to the ecology and life history of the organism of interest.</p>

Functional analysis of a zebrafish <i>myd88</i> mutant identifies key transcriptional components of the innate immune system
<p>Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are an important class of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that recognize microbial and danger signals. Their downstream signaling upon ligand binding is vital for initiation of the innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e response. In human and mammalian models, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MYD88) is known for its central role as an adaptor molecule in interleukin 1 receptor (IL-1R) and TLR signaling. The zebrafish is increasingly used as a complementary model system for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e research and drug screening. Here, we describe a zebrafish line with a truncated version of MyD88 as the first zebrafish mutant for a TLR signaling component. We show that this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e-compromised mutant has a lower survival rate under standard rearing conditions and is more susceptible to challenge with the acute bacterial pathogens <i>Edwardsiella tarda</i> and <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>. Microarray and quantitative PCR analysis revealed that expression of genes for transcription factors central to innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity (including NF-ĸB and AP-1) and the pro-inflammatory cytokine Il1b, is dependent on MyD88 signaling during these bacterial infections. Nevertheless, expression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e genes independent of MyD88 in the <i>myd88</i> mutant line was sufficient to limit growth of an attenuated <i>S. typhimurium</i> strain. In the case of infection with the chronic bacterial pathogen <i>Mycobacterium marinum</i>, we show that MyD88 signaling has an important protective role during early pathogenesis. During mycobacterial infection, the <i>myd88</i> mutant shows accelerated formation of granuloma-like aggregates and increased bacterial burden, with associated lower induction of genes central to innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity. This zebrafish <i>myd88</i> mutant will be a valuable tool for further study of the role of IL1R and TLR signaling in the innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity processes underlying infectious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es, inflammatory disorders and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>.</p>

A new and clinically relevant murine model of solid-organ transplant aspergillosis
<p>Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are a major cause of death in organ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transplant</span></strong> patients. The murine hydrocortisone-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>osuppression model of pulmonary aspergillosis is commonly used to characterise IFIs in these patients. However, this model does not take into account the effects of calcineurin inhibitors on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transplant</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity to IFIs or the fungal calcineurin pathway, which is required for both virulence and antifungal drug resistance. To address these two issues, a new and clinically relevant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transplant</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>osuppression model of tacrolimus (FK506) and hydrocortisone-associated pulmonary aspergillosis was developed. We first characterised IFIs in 406 patients with a lung <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transplant</span></strong>. This showed that all of the patients with pulmonary aspergillosis were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>osuppressed with calcineurin inhibitors and steroids. Murine pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that an ideal dose of 1 mg/kg/day of FK506 intraperitoneally produced blood trough levels in the human therapeutic range (5–12 ng/ml). There was increased mortality from pulmonary aspergillosis in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transplant</span></strong>-relevant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>osuppression model using both FK506 and hydrocortisone as compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>osuppression using hydrocortisone only. Lung histopathology showed neutrophil invasion and tracheobronchitis that was associated with reduced lung tumour necrosis factor-α (TNFα), JE (homologue of human MCP-1) and KC (homologue of human IL-8) at 24 hours, but increased lung TNFα, JE and KC at 48 hours when fungal burden was high. Furthermore, FK506 directly impaired fungal killing in alveolar macrophages <i>in vitro</i>, with FK506-mediated inhibition of the radial growth of <i>Aspergillus fumigatus in vitro</i> occurring at the low concentration of 5 ng/ml. Taken together, these findings show that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>osuppressive activity of FK506 outweighs its antifungal activity <i>in vivo</i>. These observations demonstrate that FK506 impairs innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e responses and leads to an incremental increase in susceptibility to IFIs when it is combined with steroids. This new and clinically relevant mouse model of invasive aspergillosis is a valuable addition to the further study of both fungal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity and antifungal therapy in organ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transplant</span></strong>ation.</p>

Upregulation of Human Endogenous Retrovirus-K Is Linked to Immunity and Inflammation in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e dysregulation has been linked to occlusive vascular remodeling in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) that is hereditary, idiopathic, or associated with other conditions. Circulating auto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es, lung perivascular lymphoid tissue, and elevated cytokines have been related to PAH pathogenesis but without a clear understanding of how these abnormalities are initiated, perpetuated, and connected in the progression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. We therefore set out to identify specific target antigens in PAH lung <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e complexes as a starting point toward resolving these issues to better inform future application of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>omodulatory therapies.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Lung <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e complexes were isolated and PAH target antigens were identified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, confirmed by enzyme-linked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>osorbent assay, and localized by confocal microscopy. One PAH antigen linked to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity and inflammation was pursued and a link to PAH pathophysiology was investigated by next-generation sequencing, functional studies in cultured monocytes and endothelial cells, and hemodynamic and lung studies in a rat.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>SAM domain and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1), an innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e factor that suppresses HIV replication, was identified and confirmed as highly expressed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e complexes from 16 hereditary and idiopathic PAH versus 12 control lungs. Elevated SAMHD1 was localized to endothelial cells, perivascular dendritic cells, and macrophages, and SAMHD1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es were prevalent in tertiary lymphoid tissue. An unbiased screen using metagenomic sequencing related SAMHD1 to increased expression of human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K) in PAH versus control lungs (n=4). HERV-K envelope and deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase mRNAs were elevated in PAH versus control lungs (n=10), and proteins were localized to macrophages. HERV-K deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase induced SAMHD1 and proinflammatory cytokines (eg, interleukin 6, interleukin 1β, and tumor necrosis factor α) in circulating monocytes, pulmonary arterial endothelial cells, and also activated B cells. Vulnerability of pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (PAEC) to apoptosis was increased by HERV-K deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase in an interleukin 6-independent manner.

Has a second person with HIV been cured?
<p>Since the AIDS epidemic surfaced in 1980, some 75 million people have been infected with HIV and only one person has been cured, Timothy Ray Brown, aka the "Berlin patient." Now, a second infected person, who received a similar intervention to Brown, also appears to have cleared his infection. Both Brown and a man dubbed "the London patient" had blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s that required stem cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transplant</span></strong>s. At the advice of their doctors, they received <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transplant</span></strong>s from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ologically matched donors who also happened to have mutations in CCR5, a receptor on white blood cells that HIV uses to establish infections. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transplant</span></strong>s may have also helped rid their bodies of HIV because they required "conditioning" regimens of toxic chemicals—and in the case of Brown, whole body irradiation, too—to kill off their tumor cells. What's more, they both had graft-versus-host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e in which the donor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e cells attack the recipient's tissues as foreign, which further could have killed residual HIV. As the London patient's doctor explained at an AIDS conference in Seattle, Washington, this week and in a description of the case in <i>Nature</i>, the man (who wants to remain anonymous) has been off anti-HIV drugs for 18 months and has no detectable virus in his blood on the most sensitive assays. The researchers studying him are being cautious and saying he is in long-term remission, not cured—and indeed the virus has rebounded in others who looked cured but many months later had HIV resurface. The intensive intervention also will only make sense for HIV-infected people with blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s, a tiny fraction of the 37 million people living with the virus today. But there's hope that if both men indeed are cured it will spur simpler interventions that genetically modify CCR5, some of which are being studied today.</p>

Strain-specific antibody therapy prevents cytomegalovirus reactivation after transplantation
<p>Cytomegalovirus infection is a frequent and life-threatening complication that significantly limits positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transplant</span></strong>ation outcomes. We developed preclinical mouse models of cytomegalovirus reactivation after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transplant</span></strong>ation and found that humoral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity is essential for preventing viral recrudescence. Preexisting antiviral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es decreased after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transplant</span></strong> in the presence of graft-versus-host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e and were not replaced, owing to poor reconstitution of donor B cells and elimination of recipient plasma cells. Viral reactivation was prevented by the transfer of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e serum, without a need to identify and target specific antigenic determinants. Notably, serotherapy afforded complete protection, provided that the serum was matched to the infecting viral strain. Thus, we define the mechanisms for cytomegalovirus reactivation after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transplant</span></strong>ation and identify a readily translatable strategy of exceptional potency, which avoids the constraints of cellular therapies.</p>

B cells, CMV, and stem cell transplant
<p>Hematopoietic stem cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transplant</span></strong>ation (HSCT) is a potentially curative therapy for various malignant and nonmalignant conditions but can be complicated by infections such as reactivation of cytomegalovirus (CMV). CMV is a ubiquitous DNA herpes virus comprising various distinct strains (<i>1</i>). Around 60 to 90% of healthy adults are seropositive, indicating past exposure to the virus, although infections in healthy people are often mild or asymptomatic. After initial acute infection, CMV enters a latent phase, similar to other herpes viruses. It has been suggested that CMV infection may confer an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ological benefit, perhaps explaining its prevalence, because comparison of seropositive and seronegative individuals has shown that CMV infection results in greater responses to the flu vaccine (<i>2</i>). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e system</span></strong> is essential to control the initial infection and to prevent later CMV reactivation, as demonstrated by the high incidence of CMV reactivation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>osuppressed patients such as HSCT recipients. Whereas the incidence and severity of CMV transcriptional reactivation and cell-to-cell dissemination after HSCT has substantially diminished since the adoption of prophylactic or preemptive antiviral therapies (<i>3</i>), CMV remains the most important viral infection after HSCT, especially in high-risk patients (such as seropositive recipients of seronegative donors), and can lead to life-threatening CMV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e in ∼10% of HSCT recipients (<i>4</i>). On page 288 of this issue, Martins <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) make the unexpected observation, in mice undergoing bone marrow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transplant</span></strong>ation (BMT) as a model of HSCT, that strain-specific CMV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es made by host B cells play a crucial role in preventing CMV dissemination after BMT. They propose that passive transfer of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es that are matched to the latent CMV strain in HSCT recipients might constitute a powerful and easy therapeutic approach to prevent CMV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e.</p>

Peanut allergen–specific antibodies go public
<p>Changes in the human environment and activities over the past few decades have caused an epidemic of food allergies (<i>1</i>). People suffering from allergies often feel that they live on a cliff edge, as the allergens to which they react are potentially fatal (<i>2</i>). For example, tiny amounts of peanut picked up on skin or contaminating other foods can be dangerous to peanut-sensitized individuals (<i>2</i>–<i>4</i>). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>oglobulin E (IgE) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es mediate the allergic response. They bind to specific receptors on inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e cells: mast cells in mucosal tissues lining body surfaces and cavities, and basophils in the circulation. These cells mediate allergic responses triggered by specific antigens (allergens) that are recognized by IgE. B cells expressing IgG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es have long served as the paradigm for the development of B cells into antibody-secreting plasma cells in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e response. Until recently, the far less abundant IgE-expressing B cells have proved to be elusive. On page 1306 of this issue, Croote <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) have analyzed single B cells from six individuals with peanut allergy, which enabled the identification of the natural Ig heavy- and light-chain pairs from IgE-expressing B cells that are responsible for peanut allergy. With this information they produced recombinant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es, identified the peanut allergen–specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es, and used site-directed mutagenesis to suppress their activity. The mutated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es could be used to treat peanut allergy.</p>

Redemption for self-reactive antibodies
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity to pathogens and tolerance to self are cardinal features of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e system</span></strong>s. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ological specificity is encoded by receptors expressed on the surface of lymphocytes that are generated through random assembly of variable, diversity, and joining (VDJ) gene segments during B and T lymphocyte development. In addition, B lymphocytes further diversify this initial repertoire through somatic hypermutation of antibody genes in germinal centers (transient structures that form in lymphoid organs in which high-affinity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es arise). On page 223 of this issue, Burnett <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) devise a strategy to track the fate of self-reactive B cells in germinal centers elicited by a foreign antigen that structurally mimics a self-antigen (antigen mimicry). The authors provide evidence that hypermutation of antibody genes in germinal centers can repair self-reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es. These results have implications for how broadly neutralizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es to HIV-1 may be formed.</p>

Mismatch repair deficiency predicts response of solid tumors to PD-1 blockade
<p>The genomes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s deficient in mismatch repair contain exceptionally high numbers of somatic mutations. In a proof-of-concept study, we previously showed that colorectal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s with mismatch repair deficiency were sensitive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e checkpoint blockade with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es to programmed death receptor–1 (PD-1). We have now expanded this study to evaluate the efficacy of PD-1 blockade in patients with advanced mismatch repair–deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s across 12 different tumor types. Objective radiographic responses were observed in 53% of patients, and complete responses were achieved in 21% of patients. Responses were durable, with median progression-free survival and overall survival still not reached. Functional analysis in a responding patient demonstrated rapid in vivo expansion of neoantigen-specific T cell clones that were reactive to mutant neopeptides found in the tumor. These data support the hypothesis that the large proportion of mutant neoantigens in mismatch repair–deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s make them sensitive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e checkpoint blockade, regardless of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s’ tissue of origin.</p>

Can immunotherapy treat neurodegeneration?
<p>Alzheimer's <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e (AD) is a devastating age-related neurodegenerative disorder and the most frequent cause of senile dementia. The appearance of cognitive decline in this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e is associated with synaptic and neuronal loss, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, the accumulation of intracellular and extracellular plaques of misfolded amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide, and local neuroinflammation. The major focus in AD therapeutics has been to directly target specific factors in the brain that are believed to be associated with pathogenesis—primarily Ab and tau proteins—by using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ological or pharmacological tools. However, in the clinic, these therapies have not shown efficacy in restoring cognitive function nor in arresting the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e course. In addition, treating brain inflammation, which often accompanies neurodegenerative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es, with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has shown limited or no effect on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e progression (<i>1</i>). Collectively, these results have led investigators to revisit the identification of the factors participating in AD and in particular the role of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e system</span></strong>, including the resident brain myeloid cells (microglia) and the innate and adaptive arms of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e system</span></strong>.</p>

Dengue may bring out the worst in Zika
<p>Mice infused against either dengue or West Nile virus became far more susceptible to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e and death from Zika virus, a new study published online in <i>Science</i> shows. The mice, engineered to cripple an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e gene that normally helps suppress Zika virus, of course may not represent what happens in humans. But antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is a well-known phenomenon with dengue, which has four “serotypes” that infect humans. Infection with one dengue serotype typically causes little harm, but the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es produced against it can set a people up for severe and even deadly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e if they subsequently become infected by a different serotype. Dengue, West Nile, and Zika are all from the flavivirus family and the researchers warn that a vaccine against one could put a person at risk for ADE from a relative. Dengue is closet to Zika, and indeed the mouse experiment showed that dengue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es led to the most severe Zika <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. ADE also led to high levels of virus in mouse testes and spinal cords, which may help explain sexual transmission of Zika in humans and central nervous system <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es like microcephaly in babies and Guillain-Barré Syndrome in adults.</p>

Stem cell divisions, somatic mutations, cancer etiology, and cancer prevention
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s are caused by mutations that may be inherited, induced by environmental factors, or result from DNA replication errors (R). We studied the relationship between the number of normal stem cell divisions and the risk of 17 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> types in 69 countries throughout the world. The data revealed a strong correlation (median = 0.80) between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> incidence and normal stem cell divisions in all countries, regardless of their environment. The major role of R mutations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> etiology was supported by an independent approach, based solely on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> genome sequencing and epidemiological data, which suggested that R mutations are responsible for two-thirds of the mutations in human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s. All of these results are consistent with epidemiological estimates of the fraction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s that can be prevented by changes in the environment.

<i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> Induces the Expression of a MicroRNA to Suppress the Immune Response in Rice
<p>MicroRNAs play crucial roles in plant responses to pathogen infections. The rice blast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, caused by the fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>, is the most important <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). To explore the microRNA species that participate in rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity against the rice blast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, we compared the expression of small RNAs between mock- and <i>M. oryzae</i>-treated rice. We found that infection by <i>M. oryzae</i> strain Guy11 specifically induced the expression of rice miR319 and, consequently, suppressed its target gene <i>TEOSINTE BRANCHED/CYCLOIDEA/PROLIFERATING CELL FACTOR1</i> (<i>OsTCP21</i>), which encodes a transcription factor. Using transgenic rice that overexpresses miR319b (OE) or expresses <i>OsTCP21</i>-Res (which is resistant to miR319-mediated silencing), we found that <i>OsTCP21</i> is a positive regulator of the rice defense response against the blast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. When wild-type and miR319b-OE rice were infected by Guy11, multiple jasmonic acid (JA) synthetic and signaling components were suppressed, indicating that Guy11 suppresses JA signaling through inducing miR319. In particular, we found that <i>LIPOXYGENASE2</i> (<i>LOX2</i>) and <i>LOX5</i> were specifically suppressed by miR319 overexpression or by Guy11 infection. LOXs are the key enzymes of JA synthesis, which catalyze the conversion of α-linoleic acid to hydroperoxy-octadecadienoic acid. The application of α-linoleic acid rescued <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e symptoms on the <i>OsTCP21</i>-Res rice but not wild-type rice, supporting our hypothesis that <i>OsLOX2</i> and <i>OsLOX5</i> are the key JA synthesis genes hijacked by Guy11 to subvert host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity and facilitate pathogenicity. We propose that induced expression of <i>OsLOX2/5</i> may improve resistance to the rice blast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e.</p>

Analysis of the ZAR1 Immune Complex Reveals Determinants for Immunity and Molecular Interactions<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plants depend on innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity to prevent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. Plant pathogenic bacteria, like <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> and <i>Xanthomonas campestris</i>, use the type III secretion system as a molecular syringe to inject type III secreted effector (T3SE) proteins in plants. The primary function of most T3SEs is to suppress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity; however, the plant can evolve nucleotide-binding domain-leucine-rich repeat domain-containing proteins to recognize specific T3SEs. The AtZAR1 NLR induces strong defense responses against <i>P. syringae</i> and <i>X. campestris</i>. The <i>P. syringae</i> T3SE HopZ1a is an acetyltransferase that acetylates the pseudokinase AtZED1 and triggers recognition by AtZAR1. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that lead to AtZAR1-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity in response to HopZ1a. We established a transient expression system in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> to study detailed interactions among HopZ1a, AtZED1, and AtZAR1. We show that the AtZAR1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e pathway is conserved in <i>N. benthamiana</i> and identify AtZAR1 domains, and residues in AtZAR1 and AtZED1, that are important for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity and protein-protein interactions in planta and in yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>). We show that the coiled-coil domain of AtZAR1 oligomerizes, and this domain acts as a signal to induce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity. This detailed analysis of the AtZAR1-AtZED1 protein complex provides a better understanding of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e signaling hub controlled by AtZAR1.</p>

A Subset of Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes Is Essential for Plant Immunity
<p>Of the three classes of enzymes involved in ubiquitination, ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2) have been often incorrectly considered to play merely an auxiliary role in the process, and few E2 enzymes have been investigated in plants. To reveal the role of E2 in plant innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity, we identified and cloned 40 tomato genes encoding ubiquitin E2 proteins. Thioester assays indicated that the majority of the genes encode enzymatically active E2. Phylogenetic analysis classified the 40 tomato E2 enzymes into 13 groups, of which members of group III were found to interact and act specifically with AvrPtoB, a <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> effector that uses its ubiquitin ligase (E3) activity to suppress host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity. Knocking down the expression of group III E2 genes in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> diminished the AvrPtoB-promoted degradation of the Fen kinase and the AvrPtoB suppression of host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity-associated programmed cell death. Importantly, silencing group III E2 genes also resulted in reduced pattern-triggered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity (PTI). By contrast, programmed cell death induced by several effector-triggered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity elicitors was not affected on group III-silenced plants. Functional characterization suggested redundancy among group III members for their role in the suppression of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity by AvrPtoB and in PTI and identified UBIQUITIN-CONJUGATING11 (UBC11), UBC28, UBC29, UBC39, and UBC40 as playing a more significant role in PTI than other group III members. Our work builds a foundation for the further characterization of E2s in plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity and reveals that AvrPtoB has evolved a strategy for suppressing host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity that is difficult for the plant to thwart.</p>

RUNX2 correlates with subtype-specific breast cancer in a human tissue microarray, and ectopic expression of <i>Runx2</i> perturbs differentiation in the mouse mammary gland
<p>RUNX2, a master regulator of osteogenesis, is oncogenic in the lymphoid lineage; however, little is known about its role in epithelial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s. Upregulation of <i>RUNX2</i> in cell lines correlates with increased invasiveness and the capacity to form osteolytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e in models of breast and prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>. However, most studies have analysed the effects of this gene in a limited number of cell lines and its role in primary breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> has not been resolved. Using a human tumour tissue microarray, we show that high RUNX2 expression is significantly associated with oestrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (PR)/HER2-negative breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s and that patients with high RUNX2 expression have a poorer survival rate than those with negative or low expression. We confirm <i>RUNX2</i> as a gene that has a potentially important functional role in triple-negative breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>. To investigate the role of this gene in breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>, we made a transgenic model in which <i>Runx2</i> is specifically expressed in murine mammary epithelium under the control of the mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV) promoter. We show that ectopic <i>Runx2</i> perturbs normal development in pubertal and lactating animals, delaying ductal elongation and inhibiting lobular alveolar differentiation. We also show that the <i>Runx2</i> transgene elicits age-related, pre-neoplastic changes in the mammary epithelium of older transgenic animals, suggesting that elevated RUNX2 expression renders such tissue more susceptible to oncogenic changes and providing further evidence that this gene might have an important, context-dependent role in breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>.</p>

Dampening oncogenic RAS signaling
<p>The control of normal cellular homeostasis is a function of signaling by the RAS guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) KRAS, NRAS, and HRAS and their downstream signaling proteins, such as the RAF kinases (BRAF and CRAF), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (MEK), and extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK), which together constitute the RAS-MAPK pathway (<i>1</i>). This pathway is dysregulated in human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es, particularly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>, in which mutations or other nongenetic events hyperactivate the pathway in more than 50% of cases (<i>1</i>). Activating mutations in RAS genes occur in more than 30% of all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s and seemingly lock RAS into a constitutively active, GTP-bound state to signal autonomously without the need for upstream input (<i>1</i>). Therapeutic suppression of pathogenic RASMAPK signaling to maximize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e control in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> patients remains an elusive goal. Multiple strategies targeting upstream [e.g., receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)] or downstream (e.g., MEK) RAS pathway proteins to limit RAS-GTP–mediated signaling in RAS-MAPK pathway–driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s are under evaluation (<i>1</i>–<i>3</i>). However, recent studies have extended our knowledge of how certain forms of oncogenic RAS and other oncogenic MAPK pathway proteins function not in an autonomous manner but instead semiautonomously, such that they still respond to upstream regulation (<i>4</i>–<i>8</i>). These findings reveal mechanisms by which RAS signaling is dysregulated in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> and highlight newly identified therapeutic strategies with the potential to target oncogenic RAS-MAPK signaling.</p>

Tissue-specificity in cancer: The rule, not the exception
<p>We are in the midst of a renaissance in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> genetics. Over the past several decades, candidate-based targeted sequencing efforts provided a steady stream of information on the genetic drivers for certain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> types. However, with recent technological advances in DNA sequencing, this stream has become a torrent of unbiased genetic information revealing the frequencies and patterns of point mutations and copy number variations (CNVs) across the entire spectrum of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s. One of the most important observations from this work is that genetic alterations in bona fide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> drivers (those genes that, when mutated, promote tumorigenesis) show a remarkable spectrum of tissue specificity: Alterations in certain driver genes appear only in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s derived from one or a few tissue types (<i>1</i>). Only a handful of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> drivers [such as telomerase reverse transcriptase (<i>TERT</i>), <i>TP53</i>, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (<i>CDKN2A</i>) locus, and <i>MYC</i>] show broad tissue spectrums. Here, we discuss the concept of tissue specificity of genetic alterations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> and provide general hypotheses to help explain this biological phenomenon.</p>

Fusion oncogenes—genetic musical chairs
<p>The cytogenetic definitions of many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s predate the genome sequencing era. Indeed, some classes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s (largely subtypes of sarcomas, lymphomas, and leukemias) have long been defined by simple and distinct patterns of chromosomal changes, or karyotypes, that, in many cases, feature a single pathognomonic somatic translocation of two genomic regions that creates a fusion oncogene (for example, the Philadelphia chromosome translocation in chronic myelogenous leukemia results in the <i>BCR-ABL1</i> fusion oncogene) (<i>1</i>). Whereas many common <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s display genomic complexity consistent with multistep oncogenesis, such as carcinomas of breast and lung, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s that are defined by translocations typically display simple karyotypes, suggesting that they were shaped by a single translocation. However, the cytogenetic simplicity of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s may mask more complex genomic events. On page 891 of this issue, Anderson <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) report whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of 50 Ewing sarcomas (EWSs), an aggressive sarcoma that is defined by fusion between the EWS RNA binding protein 1 (<i>EWSR1</i>) gene on chromosome 22 and an E26 transformation-specific (ETS) family transcription factor gene, either <i>FLI1</i> at 11q24 or <i>ERG</i> at 21q11 (<i>3</i>). Anderson <i>et al.</i> show that ∼40% of <i>EWSR1-FLI1</i> fusions and all <i>EWSR1-ERG</i> fusions arise via a complex rearrangement pattern called chromoplexy, which was first identified in prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> (<i>4</i>). They suggest that chromoplexy “bursts” may be early initiating events in Ewing sarcomagenesis and mark a more aggressive form of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e.</p>

Nonetheless, the mechanisms governing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity to gut fungal communities (mycobiota) remain unknown. We identified CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) as being essential for the initiation of innate and adaptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e responses to intestinal fungi. CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> MNPs express antifungal receptors and activate antifungal responses in a Syk-dependent manner. Genetic ablation of CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> MNPs in mice led to changes in gut fungal communities and to severe colitis that was rescued by antifungal treatment. In Crohn’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e patients, a missense mutation in the gene encoding CX3CR1 was identified and found to be associated with impaired antifungal responses. These results unravel a role of CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> MNPs in mediating interactions between intestinal mycobiota and host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity at steady state and during inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e.</p>

Analysis of <i>Fusobacterium</i> persistence and antibiotic response in colorectal cancer
<p>Colorectal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s comprise a complex mixture of malignant cells, nontransformed cells, and microorganisms. <i>Fusobacterium nucleatum</i> is among the most prevalent bacterial species in colorectal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> tissues. Here we show that colonization of human colorectal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s with <i>Fusobacterium</i> and its associated microbiome—including <i>Bacteroides</i>, <i>Selenomonas</i>, and <i>Prevotella</i> species—is maintained in distal metastases, demonstrating microbiome stability between paired primary and metastatic tumors. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that <i>Fusobacterium</i> is predominantly associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells in the metastatic lesions. Mouse xenografts of human primary colorectal adenocarcinomas were found to retain viable <i>Fusobacterium</i> and its associated microbiome through successive passages. Treatment of mice bearing a colon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> xenograft with the antibiotic metronidazole reduced <i>Fusobacterium</i> load, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cell proliferation, and overall tumor growth. These observations argue for further investigation of antimicrobial interventions as a potential treatment for patients with <i>Fusobacterium</i>-associated colorectal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>.</p>

Osteoblasts remotely supply lung tumors with cancer-promoting SiglecF<sup>high</sup> neutrophils
<p>Bone marrow–derived myeloid cells can accumulate within tumors and foster <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> outgrowth. Local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e-neoplastic interactions have been intensively investigated, but the contribution of the systemic host environment to tumor growth remains poorly understood. Here, we show in mice and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> patients (<i>n</i> = 70) that lung adenocarcinomas increase bone stromal activity in the absence of bone metastasis. Animal studies reveal that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>-induced bone phenotype involves bone-resident osteocalcin-expressing (Ocn<sup>+</sup>) osteoblastic cells. These cells promote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> by remotely supplying a distinct subset of tumor-infiltrating SiglecF<sup>high</sup> neutrophils, which exhibit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>-promoting properties. Experimentally reducing Ocn<sup>+</sup> cell numbers suppresses the neutrophil response and lung tumor outgrowth. These observations posit osteoblasts as remote regulators of lung <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> and identify SiglecF<sup>high</sup> neutrophils as myeloid cell effectors of the osteoblast-driven protumoral response.</p>

Escaping the traps of your own hunters
<p>During the first days of an infection, protection is almost entirely provided by innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity, a large part of which consists of one type of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e cell—the neutrophil. Neutrophils form the largest group of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e cells in the body [humans produce ∼10<sup>11</sup> neutrophils daily (<i>1</i>)], and they carry out a number of defense mechanisms, including pathogen ingestion (phagocytosis) and the production of toxic chemicals that kill intruders directly. They can also cause severe hyperinflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es, such as lethal influenza-associated lung destruction (<i>2</i>, <i>3</i>). In 2004, another neutrophil defense system was discovered. In a final act of protection, dying neutrophils mix their nuclear DNA with toxic components from their cytosolic granules and release it explosively to form a neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) in the surrounding environment. This process is called NETosis (<i>4</i>). In addition to carrying genetic information, DNA is a very long (each nucleus contains ∼2 m of DNA) and sticky polyanionic molecule. Hence, DNA binds to surfaces such as bacterial cell walls by means of charge interactions (<i>5</i>). Through this immobilization on NETs, pathogens are brought into direct contact with cytotoxic molecules on the NET-DNA complex. However, free extracellular DNA is also a potent trigger of severe side effects in the body, for example, by forming <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e complexes with anti nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es that can bind to DNA) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (<i>6</i>) or by directly clogging blood vessels and establishing vessel-blocking thrombi (<i>7</i>). Consequently, finding mechanisms that mediate the degradation of NETs has been a matter of intense research. On page 1202 of this issue, Jiménez-Alcéázar <i>et al.</i> (<i>8</i>) describe two deoxyribonucleases (DNases) [DNase1 and DNase1-like 3 (DNase1L3)], which cleave DNA and together degrade freshly formed NETs. By doing so, they inhibit otherwise lethal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>opathologies such as thrombus-mediated organ failure.</p>

Use of CRISPR-modified human stem cell organoids to study the origin of mutational signatures in cancer
<p>Mutational processes underlie <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> initiation and progression. Signatures of these processes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> genomes may explain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> etiology and could hold diagnostic and prognostic value. We developed a strategy that can be used to explore the origin of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>-associated mutational signatures. We used CRISPR-Cas9 technology to delete key DNA repair genes in human colon organoids, followed by delayed subcloning and whole-genome sequencing. We found that mutation accumulation in organoids deficient in the mismatch repair gene <i>MLH1</i> is driven by replication errors and accurately models the mutation profiles observed in mismatch repair–deficient colorectal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s. Application of this strategy to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> predisposition gene <i>NTHL1</i>, which encodes a base excision repair protein, revealed a mutational footprint (signature 30) previously observed in a breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cohort. We show that signature 30 can arise from germline <i>NTHL1</i> mutations.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
A Synthetic Glycan Microarray Enables Epitope Mapping of Plant Cell Wall Glycan-Directed Antibodies
<p>In the last three decades, more than 200 monoclonal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es have been raised against most classes of plant cell wall polysaccharides by different laboratories worldwide. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es are widely used to identify differences in plant cell wall components in mutants, organ and tissue types, and developmental stages. Despite their importance and broad use, the precise binding epitope has been determined for only a few of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es. Here, we use a plant glycan microarray equipped with 88 synthetic oligosaccharides to comprehensively map the epitopes of plant cell wall glycan-directed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es. Our results reveal the binding epitopes for 78 arabinogalactan-, rhamnogalacturonan-, xylan-, and xyloglucan-directed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es. We demonstrate that, with knowledge of the exact epitopes recognized by individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es, specific glycosyl hydrolases can be implemented into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ological cell wall analyses, providing a framework to obtain structural information on plant cell wall glycans with unprecedented molecular precision.</p>

Immunogene and viral transcript dynamics during parasitic <i>Varroa destructor</i> mite infection of developing honey bee (<i>Apis mellifera</i>) pupae
<p>The ectoparasitic <i>Varroa destructor</i> mite is a major contributor to the ongoing honey bee health crisis. <i>Varroa</i> interacts with honey bee viruses, exacerbating their pathogenicity. In addition to vectoring viruses, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>osuppression of the developing honey bee hosts by <i>Varroa</i> has been proposed to explain the synergy between viruses and mites. However, the evidence for honey bee <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e suppression by <i>V. destructor</i> is contentious. We systematically studied the quantitative effects of experimentally introduced <i>V. destructor</i> mites on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e gene expression at five specific time points during the development of the honey bee hosts. Mites reproduced normally and were associated with increased titers of deformed wing virus in the developing bees. Our data on different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e genes show little evidence for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>osuppression of honey bees by <i>V. destructor</i>. Experimental wounding of developing bees increases relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e gene expression and deformed wing virus titers. Combined, these results suggest that mite feeding activity itself and not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>osuppression may contribute to the synergy between viruses and mites. However, our results also suggest that increased expression of honey bee <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e genes decreases mite reproductive success, which may be explored to enhance mite control strategies. Finally, our expression data for multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e genes across developmental time and different experimental treatments indicates co-regulation of several of these genes and thus improves our understanding of the understudied honey bee <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e system</span></strong>.</p>

CD301b/MGL2<sup>+</sup> Mononuclear Phagocytes Orchestrate Autoimmune Cardiac Valve Inflammation and Fibrosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Valvular heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e is common and affects the mitral valve (MV) most frequently. Despite the prevalence of MV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e (MVD), the cellular and molecular pathways that initiate and perpetuate it are not well understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>K/B.g7 T-cell receptor transgenic mice spontaneously develop systemic autoantibody-associated auto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity, leading to fully penetrant fibroinflammatory MVD and arthritis. We used multiparameter flow cytometry, intracellular cytokine staining, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ofluorescent staining to characterize the cells in inflamed K/B.g7 MVs. We used genetic approaches to study the contribution of mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) to MVD in this model. Specifically, we generated K/B.g7 mice in which either CX3CR1 or CD301b/macrophage galactose <i>N</i>-acetylgalactosamine–specific lectin 2 (MGL2)–expressing MNPs were ablated. Using K/B.g7 mice expressing <i>Cx3Cr1</i>-Cre, we conditionally deleted critical inflammatory molecules from MNPs, including the Fc-receptor signal-transducing tyrosine kinase Syk and the cell adhesion molecule very late antigen–4. We performed complementary studies using monoclonal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antibodi</span></strong>es to block key inflammatory molecules. We generated bone marrow chimeric mice to define the origin of the inflammatory cells present in the MV and to determine which valve cells respond to the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Finally, we examined specimens from patients with rheumatic heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e to correlate our findings to human pathology.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>MNPs comprised the vast majority of MV-infiltrating cells; these MNPs expressed CX3CR1 and CD301b/MGL2. Analogous cells were present in human rheumatic heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e valves. K/B.g7 mice lacking CX3CR1 or in which CD301b/MGL2-expressing MNPs were ablated were protected from MVD. The valve-infiltrating CD301b/MGL2<sup>+</sup> MNPs expressed tissue-reparative molecules including arginase-1 and resistin-like molecule α. These MNPs also expressed the proinflammatory cytokines TNF and interleukin-6, and antibody blockade of these cytokines prevented MVD. Deleting Syk from CX3CR1-expressing MNPs reduced their TNF and interleukin-6 production and also prevented MVD. TNF acted through TNF receptor–1 expressed on valve-resident cells to increase the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule–1. Conditionally deleting the vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ligand very late antigen–4 from CX3CR1-expressing MNPs prevented MVD.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>CD301b/MGL2<sup>+</sup> MNPs are key drivers of auto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e MVD in K/B.g7 mice and are also present in human rheumatic heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e.

At 6 years, we compared <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transplant</span></strong>-free survival and other outcomes between the groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Medical history was collected annually using medical record review, telephone interviews, and the death index. The cohort included 549 patients randomized and treated in the SVR trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transplant</span></strong>-free survival for the RVPAS versus modified Blalock–Taussig shunt groups did not differ at 6 years (64% versus 59%, <i>P</i>=0.25) or with all available follow-up of 7.1±1.6 years (log-rank <i>P</i>=0.13). The RVPAS versus modified Blalock–Taussig shunt treatment effect had nonproportional hazards (<i>P</i>=0.009); the hazard ratio (HR) for death or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transplant</span></strong> favored the RVPAS before stage II surgery (HR, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.48–0.92).

Genetic Architecture of the Cardiovascular Risk Proteome

To evaluate the utility of this strategy in identifying new biological pathways relevant to cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e pathophysiology, we performed studies in a cell-model system to experimentally validate the functional significance of an especially novel genetic association with circulating apolipoprotein E levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified 120 locus-protein associations in genome-wide analyses and 41 associations in exome array analyses, the majority of which have not been described previously.

Genetic and Functional Profiling of CD16-Dependent Natural Killer Activation Identifies Patients at Higher Risk of Cardiac Allograft Vasculopathy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transplant</span></strong>ation is an effective therapy for end-stage heart failure. Because cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the major cause of late mortality after heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transplant</span></strong> (HT), there is a need to identify markers that reflect inflammatory or cytotoxic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e mechanisms contributing to its onset. Noninvasive and early stratification of patients at risk remains a challenge for adapting individualized therapy. The CD16 (Fc-gamma receptor 3A [FCGR3A]) receptor was recently identified as a major determinant of antibody-mediated natural killer (NK) cell activation in HT biopsies; however, little is known about the role of CD16 in promoting allograft vasculopathy. This study aimed to investigate whether markers that reflect CD16-dependent circulating NK cell activation may identify patients at higher risk of developing CAV after HT.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Blood samples were collected from 103 patients undergoing routine coronarography angiography for CAV diagnosis (median 5 years since HT). Genomic and phenotypic analyses of FCGR3A/CD16 Fc-receptor profiles were compared in CAV-positive (n=52) and CAV-free patients (n=51). The levels of CD16 expression and rituximab-dependent cell cytotoxic activity of peripheral NK cells in HT recipients were evaluated using a noninvasive NK-cellular humoral activation test.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Enhanced levels of CD16 expression and antibody-dependent NK cell cytotoxic function of HT recipients were associated with the FCGR3A-VV genotype. The frequency of the FCGR3A-VV genotype was significantly higher in the CAV<sup>+</sup> group (odds ratio, 3.9; <i>P</i>=0.0317) than in the CAV<sup>-</sup> group. The FCGR3A-VV genotype was identified as an independent marker correlated with the presence of CAV at the time of coronary angiography by using multivariate logistic regression models. The FCGR3A-VV genotype was also identified as a baseline-independent predictor of CAV risk (odds ratio, 4.7; <i>P</i>=0.023).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This study unravels a prominent role for the CD16-dependent NK cell activation pathway in the complex array of factors that favor the progression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transplant</span></strong> arteriosclerosis. It highlights the clinical potential of a noninvasive evaluation of FCGR3A/CD16 in the early stratification of CAV risk. The recognition of CD16 as a major checkpoint that controls <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e surveillance may promote the design of individualized NK cell–targeted therapies to limit vascular damage in highly responsive sensitized patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

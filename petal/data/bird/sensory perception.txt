Conscious Sedation Versus General Anesthesia for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement
<sec><title>Background:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conscious</span></strong> sedation is used during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with limited evidence as to the safety and efficacy of this practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The National Cardiovascular Data Registry Society of Thoracic Surgeons/American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry was used to characterize the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anesthesia</span></strong> choice and clinical outcomes of all US patients undergoing elective percutaneous transfemoral TAVR between April 1, 2014, and June 30, 2015. Raw and inverse probability of treatment-weighted analyses were performed to compare patients undergoing TAVR with general <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anesthesia</span></strong> with patients undergoing TAVR with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conscious</span></strong> sedation on an intention-to-treat basis for the primary outcome of in-hospital mortality, and secondary outcomes including 30-day mortality, in-hospital and 30-day death/stroke, procedural success, intensive care unit and hospital length-of-stay, and rates of discharge to home. Post hoc falsification end point analyses were performed to evaluate for residual confounding.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conscious</span></strong> sedation was used in 1737/10 997 (15.8%) cases with a significant trend of increasing usage over the time period studied (<i>P</i> for trend<0.001). In raw analyses, intraprocedural success with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conscious</span></strong> sedation and general <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anesthesia</span></strong> was similar (98.2% versus 98.5%, <i>P</i>=0.31). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conscious</span></strong> sedation group was less likely to experience in-hospital (1.6% versus 2.5%, <i>P</i>=0.03) and 30-day death (2.9% versus 4.1%, <i>P</i>=0.03). Conversion from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conscious</span></strong> sedation to general <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anesthesia</span></strong> was noted in 102 of 1737 (5.9%) of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conscious</span></strong> sedation cases. After inverse probability of treatment-weighted adjustment for 51 covariates, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conscious</span></strong> sedation was associated with lower procedural success (97.9% versus 98.6%, <i>P</i><0.001) and a reduced rate of mortality at the in-hospital (1.5% versus 2.4%, <i>P</i><0.001) and 30-day (2.3% versus 4.0%, <i>P</i><0.001) time points. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conscious</span></strong> sedation was associated with reductions in procedural inotrope requirement, intensive care unit and hospital length of stay (6.0 versus 6.5 days, <i>P</i><0.001), and combined 30-day death/stroke rates (4.8% versus 6.4%, <i>P</i><0.001). Falsification end point analyses of vascular complications, bleeding, and new pacemaker/defibrillator implantation demonstrated no significant differences between groups after adjustment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In US practice, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conscious</span></strong> sedation is associated with briefer length of stay and lower in-hospital and 30-day mortality in comparison with TAVR with general <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anesthesia</span></strong> in both unadjusted and adjusted analyses.

A systems approach for discovering linoleic acid derivatives that potentially mediate pain and itch
<p>Chronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">itch</span></strong> are common hyper<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>itivity syndromes that are affected by endogenous mediators. We applied a systems-based, translational approach to predict, discover, and characterize mediators of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">itch</span></strong> that are regulated by diet and inflammation. Profiling of tissue-specific precursor abundance and biosynthetic gene expression predicted that inflamed skin would be abundant in four previously unknown 11-hydroxy-epoxy- or 11-keto-epoxy-octadecenoate linoleic acid derivatives and four previously identified 9- or 13-hydroxy-epoxy- or 9- or 13-keto-epoxy-octadecenoate linoleic acid derivatives. All of these mediators were confirmed to be abundant in rat and human skin by mass spectrometry. However, only the two 11-hydroxy-epoxy-octadecenoates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>itized rat dorsal root ganglion neurons to release more calcitonin gene–related peptide (CGRP), which is involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> transmission, in response to low pH (which mimics an inflammatory state) or capsaicin (which activates ion channels involved in nociception). The two 11-hydroxy-epoxy-octadecenoates share a 3-hydroxy-<i>Z</i>-pentenyl-<i>E</i>-epoxide moiety, thus suggesting that this substructure could mediate nociceptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>itization. In rats, intradermal hind paw injection of 11-hydroxy-12,13-<i>trans</i>-epoxy-(9<i>Z</i>)-octadecenoate elicited C-fiber–mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>itivity to thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong>. In a randomized trial testing adjunctive strategies to manage refractory chronic headaches, reducing the dietary intake of linoleic acid was associated with decreases in plasma 11-hydroxy-12,13-<i>trans</i>-epoxy-(9<i>Z</i>)-octadecenoate, which correlated with clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> reduction. Human psoriatic skin had 30-fold higher 9-keto-12,13-<i>trans</i>-epoxy-(10<i>E</i>)-octadecenoate compared to control skin, and intradermal injection of this compound induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">itch</span></strong>-related scratching behavior in mice. Collectively, these findings define a family of endogenous mediators with potential roles in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">itch</span></strong>.</p>

miR-183 cluster scales mechanical pain sensitivity by regulating basal and neuropathic pain genes
<p>Nociception is protective and prevents tissue damage but can also facilitate chronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong>. Whether a general principle governs these two types of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> is unknown. Here, we show that both basal mechanical and neuropathic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> are controlled by the microRNA-183 (miR-183) cluster in mice. This single cluster controls more than 80% of neuropathic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong>–regulated genes and scales basal mechanical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>itivity and mechanical allodynia by regulating auxiliary voltage-gated calcium channel subunits α2δ-1 and α2δ-2. Basal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>itivity is controlled in nociceptors, and allodynia involves TrkB<sup>+</sup> light-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">touch</span></strong> mechanoreceptors. These light-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">touch</span></strong>–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>itive neurons, which normally do not elicit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong>, produce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> during neuropathy that is reversed by gabapentin. Thus, a single microRNA cluster continuously scales acute noxious mechanical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>itivity in nociceptive neurons and suppresses neuropathic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> transduction in a specific, light-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">touch</span></strong>–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>itive neuronal type recruited during mechanical allodynia.</p>

Scaling pain threshold with microRNAs
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> is not something universally enjoyed, especially chronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> involving nerve damage, referred to as neuropathic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> (<i>1</i>). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">percept</span></strong>ion can be modulated in a variety of ways—for example, by focusing attention on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong>ful stimulus. On page 1168 of this issue, Peng <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) report that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> threshold in dorsal root ganglion neurons (DRG), which relay peripheral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>ory information to the central nervous system, can be modulated by mechanisms involving a specific cluster of microRNAs (miRNAs). Remarkably, the same cluster also regulates the threshold of neuropathic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> in DRG neurons that would not be involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> under normal conditions. The study provides important new insights into molecular mechanisms that control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> threshold, both in normal and pathological conditions.</p>

Neuropathic pain promotes adaptive changes in gene expression in brain networks involved in stress and depression
<p>Neuropathic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> is a complex chronic condition characterized by various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>ory, cognitive, and affective symptoms. A large percentage of patients with neuropathic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> are also afflicted with depression and anxiety disorders, a pattern that is also seen in animal models. Furthermore, clinical and preclinical studies indicate that chronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> corresponds with adaptations in several brain networks involved in mood, motivation, and reward. Chronic stress is also a major risk factor for depression. We investigated whether chronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> and stress affect similar molecular mechanisms and whether chronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> can affect gene expression patterns that are involved in depression. Using two mouse models of neuropathic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> and depression [spared nerve injury (SNI) and chronic unpredictable stress (CUS)], we performed next-generation RNA sequencing and pathway analysis to monitor changes in gene expression in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and the periaqueductal gray (PAG). In addition to finding unique transcriptome profiles across these regions, we identified a substantial number of signaling pathway–associated genes with similar changes in expression in both SNI and CUS mice. Many of these genes have been implicated in depression, anxiety, and chronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> in patients. Our study provides a resource of the changes in gene expression induced by long-term neuropathic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> in three distinct brain regions and reveals molecular connections between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> and chronic stress.</p>

A central neural circuit for itch sensation
<p>Although <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">itch</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>ation is an important protective mechanism for animals, chronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">itch</span></strong> remains a challenging clinical problem. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">itch</span></strong> processing has been studied extensively at the spinal level. However, how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">itch</span></strong> information is transmitted to the brain and what central circuits underlie the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">itch</span></strong>-induced scratching behavior remain largely unknown. We found that the spinoparabrachial pathway was activated during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">itch</span></strong> processing and that optogenetic suppression of this pathway impaired <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">itch</span></strong>-induced scratching behaviors. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">itch</span></strong>-mediating spinal neurons, which express the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor, are disynaptically connected to the parabrachial nucleus via glutamatergic spinal projection neurons. Blockade of synaptic output of glutamatergic neurons in the parabrachial nucleus suppressed pruritogen-induced scratching behavior. Thus, our studies reveal a central neural circuit that is critical for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">itch</span></strong> signal processing.</p>

An amygdalar neural ensemble that encodes the unpleasantness of pain
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> is an unpleasant experience. How the brain’s affective neural circuits attribute this aversive quality to nociceptive information remains unknown. By means of time-lapse in vivo calcium imaging and neural activity manipulation in freely behaving mice encountering noxious stimuli, we identified a distinct neural ensemble in the basolateral amygdala that encodes the negative affective valence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong>. Silencing this nociceptive ensemble alleviated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> affective-motivational behaviors without altering the detection of noxious stimuli, withdrawal reflexes, anxiety, or reward. Following peripheral nerve injury, innocuous stimuli activated this nociceptive ensemble to drive dysfunctional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">percept</span></strong>ual changes associated with neuropathic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong>, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> aversion to light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">touch</span></strong> (allodynia). These results identify the amygdalar representations of noxious stimuli that are functionally required for the negative affective qualities of acute and chronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">percept</span></strong>ion.</p>

Decreased abundance of TRESK two-pore domain potassium channels in sensory neurons underlies the pain associated with bone metastasis
<p>Cancer-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> is debilitating. Understanding the mechanisms that cause it can inform drug development that may improve quality of life in patients. Here, we found that the reduced abundance of potassium channels called TRESK in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>itized nociceptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>ory neurons and cancer-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong>. Overexpressing TRESK in DRG neurons suppressed tumor-induced neuronal hyperexcitability and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> hyper<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>itivity in bone me<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tast</span></strong>asis model rats, whereas knocking down TRESK increased neuronal hyperexcitability and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> hyper<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>itivity in normal rats. Mechanistically, tumor-associated production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) activated the receptor VEGFR2 on DRGs, which increased the abundance of the calcineurin inhibitor DSCR1, which, in turn, decreased calcineurin-mediated activation of the transcription factor NFAT, thereby reducing the transcription of the gene encoding TRESK. Intrathecal application of exogenous calcineurin to tumor-bearing rats rescued TRESK abundance and abrogated both DRG hyperexcitability and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> hyper<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>itivity, whereas either inhibition or knockdown of calcineurin in normal rats reduced TRESK abundance and increased DRG excitability and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>itivity. These findings identify a potentially targetable mechanism that may cause bone me<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tast</span></strong>asis–associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> in cancer patients.</p>

Bacterial <sc>d</sc>-amino acids suppress sinonasal innate immunity through sweet taste receptors in solitary chemosensory cells
<p>In the upper respiratory epithelium, bitter and sweet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tast</span></strong>e receptors present in solitary chemo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>ory cells influence antimicrobial innate immune defense responses. Whereas activation of bitter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tast</span></strong>e receptors (T2Rs) stimulates surrounding epithelial cells to release antimicrobial peptides, activation of the sweet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tast</span></strong>e receptor (T1R) in the same cells inhibits this response. This mechanism is thought to control the magnitude of antimicrobial peptide release based on the sugar content of airway surface liquid. We hypothesized that <sc>d</sc>-amino acids, which are produced by various bacteria and activate T1R in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tast</span></strong>e receptor cells in the mouth, may also activate T1R in the airway. We showed that both the T1R2 and T1R3 subunits of the sweet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tast</span></strong>e receptor (T1R2/3) were present in the same chemo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>ory cells of primary human sinonasal epithelial cultures. Respiratory isolates of <i>Staphylococcus</i> species, but not <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, produced at least two <sc>d</sc>-amino acids that activate the sweet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tast</span></strong>e receptor. In addition to inhibiting <i>P. aeruginosa</i> biofilm formation, <sc>d</sc>-amino acids derived from <i>Staphylococcus</i> inhibited T2R-mediated signaling and defensin secretion in sinonasal cells by activating T1R2/3. <sc>d</sc>-Amino acid–mediated activation of T1R2/3 also enhanced epithelial cell death during challenge with <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> in the presence of the bitter receptor–activating compound denatonium benzoate. These data establish a potential mechanism for interkingdom signaling in the airway mediated by bacterial <sc>d</sc>-amino acids and the mammalian sweet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tast</span></strong>e receptor in airway chemo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>ory cells.</p>

Piezo2 channel–Merkel cell signaling modulates the conversion of touch to itch
<p>The somato<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>ory system relays many signals ranging from light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">touch</span></strong> to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">itch</span></strong>. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">touch</span></strong> is critical to spatial awareness and communication. However, in disease states, innocuous mechanical stimuli can provoke pathologic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>ations such as mechanical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">itch</span></strong> (alloknesis). The molecular and cellular mechanisms that govern this conversion remain unknown. We found that in mice, alloknesis in aging and dry skin is associated with a loss of Merkel cells, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">touch</span></strong> receptors in the skin. Targeted genetic deletion of Merkel cells and associated mechano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>itive Piezo2 channels in the skin was sufficient to produce alloknesis. Chemogenetic activation of Merkel cells protected against alloknesis in dry skin. This study reveals a previously unknown function of the cutaneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">touch</span></strong> receptors and may provide insight into the development of alloknesis.</p>

The controversial correlates of consciousness
<p>The mechanism of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conscious</span></strong>ness is one of the most fundamental, exciting, and challenging pursuits in 21st-century science. Although the field of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conscious</span></strong>ness studies attracts a diverse array of thinkers who posit myriad physical or metaphysical substrates for experience, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conscious</span></strong>ness must have a neural basis. But where in the brain is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conscious</span></strong> experience generated? It would seem that, given this remarkable era of technical and experimental prowess in the neurosciences, we would be homing in on the specific circuits or precise neuronal subpopulations that generate experience. To the contrary, there is still active debate as to whether the neural correlates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conscious</span></strong>ness are, in coarse terms, located in the back or the front of the brain (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). On page 537 of this issue, van Vugt <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) provide evidence that the prefrontal cortex is one of the brain regions that mediates visual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conscious</span></strong>ness.

Proximal femoral resection without post-operative traction for the painful dislocated hip in young patients with cerebral palsy

Previous authors have recommended   post-operative traction or immobilisation to prevent a recurrence   of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> due to proximal migration of the femoral stump. We present   a series of 79 PFRs in 63 patients, age 14.7 years (10 to 26; 35   male, 28 female), none of whom had post-operative traction or immobilisation.</p><p>A total of 71 hips (89.6%) were reported to be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> free or to   have mild <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> following surgery. Four children underwent further   resection for persistent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong>; of these, three had successful resolution   of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> and one had no benefit. A total of 16 hips (20.2%) showed   radiographic evidence of heterotopic ossification, all of which   had formed within one year of surgery. Four patients had a wound   infection, one of which needed debridement; all recovered fully.   A total of 59 patients (94%) reported improvements in seating and   hygiene.</p><p>The results are as good as or better than the historical results   of using traction or immobilisation. We recommend that following   PFR, children can be managed without traction or immobilisation,   and can be discharged earlier and with fewer complications. However,   care should be taken with severely dystonic patients, in whom more   extensive femoral resection should be considered in combination   with management of the increased tone.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014; 96-B:701–6.</p>

WT1 regulates the development of the posterior taste field
<p>Despite the importance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tast</span></strong>e in determining nutrient intake, our understanding of the processes that control the development of the peripheral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tast</span></strong>e system is lacking. Several early regulators of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tast</span></strong>e development have been identified, including sonic hedgehog, bone morphogenetic protein 4 and multiple members of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. However, the regulation of these factors, including their induction, remains poorly understood. Here, we identify a crucial role for the Wilms' tumor 1 protein (WT1) in circumvallate (CV) papillae development. WT1 is a transcription factor that is important in the normal development of multiple tissues, including both the olfactory and visual systems. In mice, WT1 expression is detectable by E12.5, when the CV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tast</span></strong>e placode begins to form. In mice lacking WT1, the CV fails to develop normally and markers of early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tast</span></strong>e development are dysregulated compared with wild type. We demonstrate that expression of the WT1 target genes <i>Lef1</i>, <i>Ptch1</i> and <i>Bmp4</i> is significantly reduced in developing tongue tissue derived from <i>Wt1</i> knockout mice and that, in normal tongue, WT1 is bound to the promoter regions of these genes. Moreover, siRNA knockdown of WT1 in cultured <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tast</span></strong>e cells leads to a reduction in the expression of <i>Lef1</i> and <i>Ptch1</i>.

Inhibition of somatosensory mechanotransduction by annexin A6
<p>Mechanically activated, slowly adapting currents in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>ory neurons have been linked to noxious mechano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>ation. The conotoxin NMB-1 (noxious mechano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>ation blocker-1) blocks such currents and inhibits mechanical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong>. Using a biotinylated form of NMB-1 in mass spectrometry analysis, we identified 67 binding proteins in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>ory neurons and a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>ory neuron–derived cell line, of which the top candidate was annexin A6, a membrane-associated calcium-binding protein. Annexin A6–deficient mice showed increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>itivity to mechanical stimuli. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>ory neurons from these mice showed increased activity of the cation channel Piezo2, which mediates a rapidly adapting mechano-gated current linked to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">propriocept</span></strong>ion and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">touch</span></strong>, and a decrease in mechanically activated, slowly adapting currents. Conversely, overexpression of annexin A6 in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>ory neurons inhibited rapidly adapting currents that were partially mediated by Piezo2. Furthermore, overexpression of annexin A6 in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>ory neurons attenuated mechanical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> in a mouse model of osteoarthritis, a disease in which mechanically evoked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> is particularly problematic.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
A Mobile Auxin Signal Connects Temperature Sensing in Cotyledons with Growth Responses in Hypocotyls
<p>Plants have a remarkable capacity to adjust their growth and development to elevated ambient temperatures. Increased elongation growth of roots, hypocotyls, and petioles in warm temperatures are hallmarks of seedling thermomorphogenesis. In the last decade, significant progress has been made to identify the molecular signaling components regulating these growth responses. Increased ambient temperature utilizes diverse components of the light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>ing and signal transduction network to trigger growth adjustments. However, it remains unknown whether temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>ing and responses are universal processes that occur uniformly in all plant organs. Alternatively, temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>ing may be confined to specific tissues or organs, which would require a systemic signal that mediates responses in distal parts of the plant. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings show organ-specific transcriptome responses to elevated temperatures and that thermomorphogenesis involves both autonomous and organ-interdependent temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>ing and signaling. Seedling roots can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>e and respond to temperature in a shoot-independent manner, whereas shoot temperature responses require both local and systemic processes. The induction of cell elongation in hypocotyls requires temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>ing in cotyledons, followed by the generation of a mobile auxin signal. Subsequently, auxin travels to the hypocotyl, where it triggers local brassinosteroid-induced cell elongation in seedling stems, which depends upon a distinct, permissive temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>or in the hypocotyl.</p>

Control of Cognate Sense mRNA Translation by cis-Natural Antisense RNAs
<p>Cis-Natural Anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>e Transcripts (cis-NATs), which overlap protein coding genes and are transcribed from the opposite DNA strand, constitute an important group of noncoding RNAs. Whereas several examples of cis-NATs regulating the expression of their cognate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>e gene are known, most cis-NATs function by altering the steady-state level or structure of mRNA via changes in transcription, mRNA stability, or splicing, and very few cases involve the regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>e mRNA translation. This study was designed to systematically search for cis-NATs influencing cognate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>e mRNA translation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Establishment of a pipeline relying on sequencing of total polyA<sup>+</sup> and polysomal RNA from Arabidopsis grown under various conditions (i.e. nutrient deprivation and phytohormone treatments) allowed the identification of 14 cis-NATs whose expression correlated either positively or negatively with cognate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>e mRNA translation. With use of a combination of cis-NAT stable over-expression in transgenic plants and transient expression in protoplasts, the impact of cis-NAT expression on mRNA translation was confirmed for 4 out of 5 tested cis-NAT:<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>e mRNA pairs. These results expand the number of cis-NATs known to regulate cognate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>e mRNA translation and provide a foundation for future studies of their mode of action. Moreover, this study highlights the role of this class of noncoding RNAs in translation regulation.</p>

Biased agonists of the kappa opioid receptor suppress pain and itch without causing sedation or dysphoria
<p>Agonists targeting the kappa opioid receptor (KOR) have been promising therapeutic candidates because of their efficacy for treating intractable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">itch</span></strong> and relieving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong>. Unlike typical opioid narcotics, KOR agonists do not produce euphoria or lead to respiratory suppression or overdose. However, they do produce dysphoria and sedation, side effects that have precluded their clinical development as therapeutics. KOR signaling can be fine-tuned to preferentially activate certain pathways over others, such that agonists can bias signaling so that the receptor signals through G proteins rather than other effectors such as βarrestin2. We evaluated a newly developed G protein signaling–biased KOR agonist in preclinical models of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong>, pruritis, sedation, dopamine regulation, and dysphoria. We found that triazole 1.1 retained the antinociceptive and antipruritic efficacies of a conventional KOR agonist, yet it did not induce sedation or reductions in dopamine release in mice, nor did it produce dysphoria as determined by intracranial self-stimulation in rats. These data demonstrated that biased agonists may be used to segregate physiological responses downstream of the receptor. Moreover, the findings suggest that biased KOR agonists may present a means to treat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> and intractable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">itch</span></strong> without the side effects of dysphoria and sedation and with reduced abuse potential.</p>

TRPV1 promotes opioid analgesia during inflammation
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> and inflammation are inherently linked responses to injury, infection, or chronic diseases. Given that acute inflammation in humans or mice enhances the analgesic properties of opioids, there is much interest in determining the inflammatory transducers that prime opioid receptor signaling in primary afferent nociceptors. Here, we found that activation of the transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) channel stimulated a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway that was accompanied by the shuttling of the scaffold protein β-arrestin2 to the nucleus. The nuclear translocation of β-arrestin2 in turn prevented its recruitment to the μ-opioid receptor (MOR), the subsequent internalization of agonist-bound MOR, and the suppression of MOR activity that occurs upon receptor de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>itization. Using the complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> model to examine the role of TRPV1 in regulating endogenous opioid analgesia in mice, we found that naloxone methiodide (Nal-M), a peripherally restricted, nonselective, and competitive opioid receptor antagonist, slowed the recovery from CFA-induced hyper<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>itivity in wild-type, but not TRPV1-deficient, mice. Furthermore, we showed that inflammation prolonged morphine-induced antinociception in a mouse model of opioid receptor de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>itization, a process that depended on TRPV1. Together, our data reveal a TRPV1-mediated signaling pathway that serves as an endogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong>-resolution mechanism by promoting the nuclear translocation of β-arrestin2 to minimize MOR de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>itization. This previously uncharacterized mechanism may underlie the peripheral opioid control of inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong>. Dysregulation of the TRPV1–β-arrestin2 axis may thus contribute to the transition from acute to chronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong>.</p>

The transcription factor C/EBPβ in the dorsal root ganglion contributes to peripheral nerve trauma–induced nociceptive hypersensitivity
<p>Changes in gene transcription in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) after nerve trauma contribute to the genesis of neuropathic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong>. We report that peripheral nerve trauma caused by chronic constriction injury (CCI) increased the abundance of the transcription factor C/EBPβ (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β) in the DRG. Blocking this increase mitigated the development and maintenance of CCI-induced mechanical, thermal, and cold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> hyper<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>itivities without affecting basal responses to acute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> and locomotor activity. Conversely, mimicking this increase produced hyper<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>itivity to mechanical, thermal, or cold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong>. In the ipsilateral DRG, C/EBPβ promoted a decrease in the abundance of the voltage-gated potassium channel subunit Kv1.2 and μ opioid receptor (MOR) at the mRNA and protein levels, which would be predicted to increase excitability in the ipsilateral DRG neurons and reduce the efficacy of morphine analgesia. These effects required C/EPBβ-mediated transcriptional activation of <i>Ehmt2</i> (euchromatic histone-lysine <i>N</i>-methyltransferase 2), which encodes G9a, an epigenetic silencer of the genes encoding Kv1.2 and MOR. Blocking the increase in C/EBPβ in the DRG improved morphine analgesia after CCI. These results suggest that C/EBPβ is an endogenous initiator of neuropathic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> and could be a potential target for the prevention and treatment of this disorder.</p>

Mitochondrial redox sensing by the kinase ATM maintains cellular antioxidant capacity
<p>Mitochondria are integral to cellular energy metabolism and ATP production and are involved in regulating many cellular processes. Mitochondria produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), which not only can damage cellular components but also participate in signal transduction. The kinase ATM, which is mutated in the neurodegenerative, autosomal recessive disease ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), is a key player in the nuclear DNA damage response. However, ATM also performs a redox-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>ing function mediated through formation of ROS-dependent disulfide-linked dimers. We found that mitochondria-derived hydrogen peroxide promoted ATM dimerization. In HeLa cells, ATM dimers were localized to the nucleus and inhibited by the redox regulatory protein thioredoxin 1 (TRX1), suggesting the existence of a ROS-mediated, stress-signaling relay from mitochondria to the nucleus. ATM dimer formation did not affect its association with chromatin in the absence or presence of nuclear DNA damage, consistent with the separation of its redox and DNA damage signaling functions. Comparative analysis of U2OS cells expressing either wild-type ATM or the redox <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>ing–deficient C2991L mutant revealed that one function of ATM redox <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>ing is to promote glucose flux through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) by increasing the abundance and activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), thereby increasing cellular antioxidant capacity. The PPP produces the coenzyme NADPH needed for a robust antioxidant response, including the regeneration of TRX1, indicating the existence of a regulatory feedback loop involving ATM and TRX1. We propose that loss of the mitochondrial ROS-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>ing function of ATM may cause cellular ROS accumulation and oxidative stress in A-T.</p>

Palmitoylation of δ-catenin promotes kinesin-mediated membrane trafficking of Na<sub>v</sub>1.6 in sensory neurons to promote neuropathic pain
<p>Palmitoylation of δ-catenin is critical to synapse plasticity and memory formation. We found that δ-catenin palmitoylation is also instrumental in the development of neuropathic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong>. The abundances of palmitoylated δ-catenin and the palmitoyl acyltransferase DHHC3 were increased in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>ory neurons in rat models of neuropathic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong>. Inhibiting palmitoyl acyltransferases or decreasing δ-catenin abundance in the DRG by intrathecal injection of 2-bromopalmitate or shRNA, respectively, alleviated oxaliplatin or nerve injury–induced neuropathic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> in the rats. The palmitoylation of δ-catenin, which was induced by the inflammatory cytokine TNF-α, facilitated its interaction with the voltage-gated sodium channel Na<sub>v</sub>1.6 and the kinesin motor protein KIF3A, which promoted the trafficking of Na<sub>v</sub>1.6 to the plasma membrane in DRG neurons and contributed to mechanical hyper<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>itivity and allodynia in rats.

Identification of a selective small-molecule inhibitor of type 1 adenylyl cyclase activity with analgesic properties
<p>Adenylyl cyclase 1 (AC1) belongs to a group of adenylyl cyclases (ACs) that are stimulated by calcium in a calmodulin-dependent manner. Studies with AC1 knockout mice suggest that inhibitors of AC1 may be useful for treating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> and opioid dependence. However, nonselective inhibition of AC isoforms could result in substantial adverse effects. We used chemical library screening to identify a selective AC1 inhibitor with a chromone core structure that may represent a new analgesic agent. After demonstrating that the compound (ST034307) inhibited Ca<sup>2+</sup>-stimulated adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells stably transfected with AC1 (HEK-AC1 cells), we confirmed selectivity for AC1 by testing against all isoforms of membrane-bound ACs. ST034307 also inhibited AC1 activity stimulated by forskolin- and Gα<sub>s</sub>-coupled receptors in HEK-AC1 cells and showed inhibitory activity in multiple AC1-containing membrane preparations and mouse hippocampal homogenates. ST034307 enhanced μ-opioid receptor (MOR)–mediated inhibition of AC1 in short-term inhibition assays in HEK-AC1 cells stably transfected with MOR; however, the compound blocked heterologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>itization of AC1 caused by chronic MOR activation in these cells. ST034307 reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> responses in a mouse model of inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong>. Our data indicate that ST034307 is a selective small-molecule inhibitor of AC1 and suggest that selective AC1 inhibitors may be useful for managing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong>.</p>

Rejecting   the mechanistic theory has also led to abandoning operative treatment   at initial presentation in the first line. Physiotherapy exercise   programmes are the accepted first line treatment. The aim of this   study was to assess the long-term additional benefits of subacromial decompression   in the treatment of rotator cuff tendinopathy.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This randomised controlled trial of 140 patients (52 men, 88   women, mean age 47.1 years; 18 to 60) with rotator cuff tendinopathy   extended previous work up to a maximum of 13 years. The patients   were randomised into two treatment groups: arthroscopic acromioplasty   and a supervised exercise treatment and a similar supervised exercise   treatment alone. Self-reported <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> on a visual analogue scale (VAS)   was the primary outcome measure. Secondary measures were disability,   working ability, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> at night, Shoulder Disability Questionnaire   score and the number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong>ful days during the three months preceding   the final assessment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 90 patients (64%) returned questionnaires at a mean   12 years after randomisation. On an intention-to-treat basis, both   treatment groups reached statistically significant improvement compared   with the initial VAS for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong>, but there was no significant difference   between groups. The same was true in the secondary outcome measures.   Due to group changes, the results were also analysed per protocol:   operated or not. No significant differences between the groups were   found.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The natural history of rotator cuff tendinopathy probably plays   a significant role in the results in the long-term. Even though   the patients who underwent operative treatment had a stronger belief   in recovery, which is likely to be surgical and the effect of placebo,   the exercise group obtained similar results. In the future, an optimum   exercise regime should be searched for, as the most clinically and   cost-effective conservative treatment for rotator cuff tendinopathy.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:799–805.</p></sec>

Discharge on the day of surgery following unicompartmental knee arthroplasty within the United Kingdom NHS
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) has been successfully   performed in the United States healthcare system on outpatients.   Despite differences in healthcare structure and financial environment,   we hypothesised that it would be feasible to replicate this success   and perform UKA with safe day of surgery discharge within the NHS,   in the United Kingdom. This has not been reported in any other United   Kingdom centres.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We report our experience of implementing a pathway to allow safe   day of surgery discharge following UKA. Data were prospectively   collected on 72 patients who underwent UKA as a day case between   December 2011 and September 2015. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 61 patients (85%) were discharged on the same day.   The most common reason for failure was logistical; five patients   had their operation too late in the day. Three patients failed to   mobilise safely, two had inadequate control of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> and one had   a leaking wound. The mean length of stay for those who were not   discharged on the same day was 1.2 nights (1 to 3). During the same   time, 58 patients underwent planned inpatient UKA, as they were deemed   inappropriate for discharge on the day of surgery. However, three   of these were safely discharged on the same day.</p><p>Follow-up data, 24 hours post-operatively, were available for   70 patients; 51 (73%) reported no or mild <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong>, 14 (20%) had moderate   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> and five (7%) had severe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong>. There were no re-admissions.   All patients had a high level of satisfaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We found that patients can be safely and effectively discharged   on the day of surgery after UKA, with high levels of satisfaction.   This clearly offers improved management of resources and financial   savings to healthcare trusts.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:788–92.</p></sec>

Cost-effective peri-operative pain management
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to determine the optimal regimen for   the management of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) by   comparing the outcomes and cost-effectiveness of different protocols   implemented at a large, urban, academic medical centre.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between September 2013 and September 2015, we used a series of   modifications to our standard regimen for the management of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong>   after TKA.

Prognostic Value of Noninvasive Cardiovascular Testing in Patients With Stable Chest Pain
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Optimal management of patients with stable chest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> relies on the prognostic information provided by noninvasive cardiovascular testing, but there are limited data from randomized trials comparing anatomic with functional testing.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In the PROMISE trial (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong>), patients with stable chest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> and intermediate pretest probability for obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) were randomly assigned to functional testing (exercise electrocardiography, nuclear stress, or stress echocardiography) or coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA). Site-based diagnostic test reports were classified as normal or mildly, moderately, or severely abnormal. The primary end point was death, myocardial infarction, or unstable angina hospitalizations over a median follow-up of 26.1 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Both the prevalence of normal test results and incidence rate of events in these patients were significantly lower among 4500 patients randomly assigned to CTA in comparison with 4602 patients randomly assigned to functional testing (33.4% versus 78.0%, and 0.9% versus 2.1%, respectively; both <i>P</i><0.001). In CTA, 54.0% of events (n=74/137) occurred in patients with nonobstructive CAD (1%–69% stenosis). Prevalence of obstructive CAD and myocardial ischemia was low (11.9% versus 12.7%, respectively), with both findings having similar prognostic value (hazard ratio, 3.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.60–5.39; and 3.47; 95% CI, 2.42–4.99). When test findings were stratified as mildly, moderately, or severely abnormal, hazard ratios for events in comparison with normal tests increased proportionally for CTA (2.94, 7.67, 10.13; all <i>P</i><0.001) but not for corresponding functional testing categories (0.94 [<i>P</i>=0.87], 2.65 [<i>P</i>=0.001], 3.88 [<i>P</i><0.001]). The discriminatory ability of CTA in predicting events was significantly better than functional testing (c-index, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.68–0.76 versus 0.64; 95% CI, 0.59–0.69; <i>P</i>=0.04). If 2714 patients with at least an intermediate Framingham Risk Score (>10%) who had a normal functional test were reclassified as being mildly abnormal, the discriminatory capacity improved to 0.69 (95% CI, 0.64–0.74).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Coronary CTA, by identifying patients at risk because of nonobstructive CAD, provides better prognostic information than functional testing in contemporary patients who have stable chest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> with a low burden of obstructive CAD, myocardial ischemia, and events.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

5-oxoETE triggers nociception in constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome through MAS-related G protein–coupled receptor D
<p>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder that is characterized by chronic abdominal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> concurrent with altered bowel habit. Polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) metabolites are increased in abundance in IBS and are implicated in the alteration of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>ation to mechanical stimuli, which is defined as visceral hyper<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>itivity. We sought to quantify PUFA metabolites in patients with IBS and evaluate their role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong>. Quantification of PUFA metabolites by mass spectrometry in colonic biopsies showed an increased abundance of 5-oxoeicosatetraenoic acid (5-oxoETE) only in biopsies taken from patients with IBS with predominant constipation (IBS-C). Local administration of 5-oxoETE to mice induced somatic and visceral hyper<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>itivity to mechanical stimuli without causing tissue inflammation. We found that 5-oxoETE directly acted on both human and mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>ory neurons as shown by lumbar splanchnic nerve recordings and Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. We showed that 5-oxoETE selectively stimulated nonpeptidergic, isolectin B4 (IB4)–positive DRG neurons through a phospholipase C (PLC)– and pertussis toxin–dependent mechanism, suggesting that the effect was mediated by a G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR). The MAS-related GPCR D (Mrgprd) was found in mouse colonic DRG afferents and was identified as being implicated in the noxious effects of 5-oxoETE. Together, these data suggest that 5-oxoETE, a potential biomarker of IBS-C, induces somatic and visceral hyperalgesia without inflammation in an Mrgprd-dependent manner. Thus, 5-oxoETE may play a pivotal role in the abdominal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> associated with IBS-C.</p>

Modulation of Cl<sup>−</sup> signaling and ion transport by recruitment of kinases and phosphatases mediated by the regulatory protein IRBIT
<p>IRBIT is a multifunctional protein that controls the activity of various epithelial ion transporters including NBCe1-B. Interaction with IRBIT increases NBCe1-B activity and exposes two cryptic Cl<sup>−</sup>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>ing GXXXP sites that enable regulation of NBCe1-B by intracellular Cl<sup>−</sup> (Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub>). Here, phosphoproteomic analysis revealed that IRBIT controlled five phosphorylation sites in NBCe1-B that determined both the active conformation of the transporter and its regulation by Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub>. Mutational analysis suggested that the phosphorylation status of Ser<sup>232</sup>, Ser<sup>233</sup>, and Ser<sup>235</sup> was regulated by IRBIT and determined whether NBCe1 transporters are in active or inactive conformations. The absence of phosphorylation at Ser<sup>232</sup>, Ser<sup>233</sup>, or Ser<sup>235</sup> produced NBCe1-B in the conformations pSer<sup>233</sup>/pSer<sup>235</sup>, pSer<sup>232</sup>/pSer<sup>235</sup>, or pSer<sup>232</sup>/pSer<sup>233</sup>, respectively. The activity of the pSer<sup>233</sup>/pSer<sup>235</sup> form was similar to that of IRBIT-activated NBCe1-B, but it was in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>itive to inhibition by Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub>. The properties of the pSer<sup>232</sup>/pSer<sup>235</sup> form were similar to those of wild-type NBCe1-B, whereas the pSer<sup>232</sup>/pSer<sup>233</sup> form was partially active, further activated by IRBIT, but retained inhibition by Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub>. Furthermore, IRBIT recruited the phosphatase PP1 and the kinase SPAK to control phosphorylation of Ser<sup>65</sup>, which affected Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>ing by the <sup>32</sup>GXXXP<sup>36</sup> motif. IRBIT also recruited the phosphatase calcineurin and the kinase CaMKII to control phosphorylation of Ser<sup>12</sup>, which affected Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>ing by the <sup>194</sup>GXXXP<sup>198</sup> motif. Ser<sup>232</sup>, Ser<sup>233</sup>, and Ser<sup>235</sup> are conserved in all NBCe1 variants and affect their activity. These findings reveal how multiple kinase and phosphatase pathways use phosphorylation sites to fine-tune a transporter, which have important implications for epithelial fluid and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> secretion.</p>

Humans may sense Earth's magnetic field
<p>A study published this week offers some of the best evidence yet that humans, like many other creatures, can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>e Earth's magnetic field. But it doesn't settle other questions that have swirled around this contentious idea for decades: If we do have a sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conscious</span></strong> magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>e, do we ever use it? And does it arise from an iron mineral found in our brains, as the authors believe? The experiment recorded brain activity from electrodes on the scalp to search 34 participants for some response to changes in a highly controlled magnetic field equal in strength to Earth's. It revealed a marked change in brain waves of a certain frequency. But some researchers aren't convinced that the brain's reaction to a magnetic field represents a true "<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>e" unless this reaction also guides our behavior.</p>

A gut feeling
<p>The anatomist Friedrich S. Merkel predicted in 1880 that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>ory systems are composed of epithelial cells and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>ory nerves, which together transform environmental cues into neural signals that trigger our rich <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>ory experiences (<i>1</i>). We now know that this hypothesis mostly holds true for the canonical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>es of vision, hearing, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tast</span></strong>e, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">touch</span></strong>. Perhaps surprisingly, the peripheral outposts of these classical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>ory systems (eyes, ears, tongue, and skin) are dwarfed by the human body's largest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>ory organ—the gut. Enteroendocrine cells, which are rare epithelial cells that decorate the gut lining, have long been suspected to be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>ory receptor cells that inform the brain about ingested nutrients (<i>2</i>). Since their description, these cells were assumed to play a role in metabolism and gut physiology by releasing slow-acting peptide hormones that stimulate neurons throughout the gut and in the brain. On page 1219 of this issue, Kaelberer <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) challenge this view by demonstrating that gut enteroendocrine cells locally excite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>ory nerves through release of the neurotransmitter glutamate. A recent study of enterochromaffin cells, a subset of enteroendocrine cells, also found that gut signals are transmitted at epithelial-neural synapses through release of the neurotransmitter serotonin (<i>4</i>). Together, these findings overturn a decades-old dogma that enteroendocrine cells signal exclusively through hormones.</p>

The threshold for conscious report: Signal loss and response bias in visual and frontal cortex
<p>Why are some visual stimuli <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conscious</span></strong>ly detected, whereas others remain subliminal? We investigated the fate of weak visual stimuli in the visual and frontal cortex of awake monkeys trained to report stimulus presence. Reported stimuli were associated with strong sustained activity in the frontal cortex, and frontal activity was weaker and quickly decayed for unreported stimuli. Information about weak stimuli could be lost at successive stages en route from the visual to the frontal cortex, and these propagation failures were confirmed through microstimulation of area V1. Fluctuations in response bias and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>itivity during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">percept</span></strong>ion of identical stimuli were traced back to prestimulus brain-state markers. A model in which stimuli become <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conscious</span></strong>ly reportable when they elicit a nonlinear ignition process in higher cortical areas explained our results.</p>

An evolutionarily conserved gene family encodes proton-selective ion channels
<p>Ion channels form the basis for cellular electrical signaling. Despite the scores of genetically identified ion channels selective for other monatomic ions, only one type of proton-selective ion channel has been found in eukaryotic cells. By comparative transcriptome analysis of mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tast</span></strong>e receptor cells, we identified Otopetrin1 (OTOP1), a protein required for development of gravity-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>ing otoconia in the vestibular system, as forming a proton-selective ion channel. We found that murine OTOP1 is enriched in acid-detecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tast</span></strong>e receptor cells and is required for their zinc-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>itive proton conductance. Two related murine genes, <i>Otop2</i> and <i>Otop3</i>, and a <i>Drosophila</i> ortholog also encode proton channels. Evolutionary conservation of the gene family and its widespread tissue distribution suggest a broad role for proton channels in physiology and pathophysiology.</p>

Obstruction of pilus retraction stimulates bacterial surface sensing
<p>It is critical for bacteria to recognize surface contact and initiate physiological changes required for surface-associated lifestyles. Ubiquitous microbial appendages called pili are involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>ing surfaces and facilitating downstream behaviors, but the mechanism by which pili mediate surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>ing has been unclear. We visualized <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i> pili undergoing dynamic cycles of extension and retraction. Within seconds of surface contact, these cycles ceased, which coincided with synthesis of the adhesive holdfast required for attachment. Physically blocking pili imposed resistance to pilus retraction, which was sufficient to stimulate holdfast synthesis without surface contact. Thus, to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>e surfaces, bacteria use the resistance on retracting, surface-bound pili that occurs upon surface contact.</p>

Nocebo effects can make you feel pain
<p>The mysterious phenomenon known as the nocebo effect describes negative expectancies. This is in contrast to positive expectancies that trigger placebo effects (<i>1</i>). In evolutionary terms, nocebo and placebo effects coexist to favor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">percept</span></strong>ual mechanisms that anticipate threat and dangerous events (nocebo effects) and promote appetitive and safety behaviors (placebo effects). In randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials, patients that receive placebos often report side effects (nocebos) that are similar to those experienced by patients that receive the investigational treatment (<i>2</i>). Information provided during the informed consent process and divulgence of adverse effects contribute to nocebo effects in clinical trials (<i>1</i>). Nocebo (and placebo) effects engage a complex set of neural circuits in the central nervous system that modulate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">percept</span></strong>ion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">touch</span></strong>, pressure, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong>, and temperature (<i>1</i>, <i>3</i>, <i>4</i>). Commercial features of drugs such as price and labeling influence placebos (<i>5</i>, <i>6</i>). On page 105 of this issue, Tinnermann <i>et al.</i> (<i>7</i>) show that price also influences nocebo effects.</p>

A nontoxic pain killer designed by modeling of pathological receptor conformations

We hypothesized that exploiting pathological (rather than physiological) conformation dynamics of opioid receptor-ligand interactions might yield ligands without adverse actions. By computer simulations at low pH, a hallmark of injured tissue, we designed an agonist that, because of its low acid dissociation constant, selectively activates peripheral μ-opioid receptors at the source of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> generation. Unlike the conventional opioid fentanyl, this agonist showed pH-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sens</span></strong>itive binding, heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide–binding protein (G protein) subunit dissociation by fluorescence resonance energy transfer, and adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate inhibition in vitro<i>.</i> It produced injury-restricted analgesia in rats with different types of inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> without exhibiting respiratory depression, sedation, constipation, or addiction potential.</p>

How the body learns to hurt
<p>After 50 years, the neuroscience of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> has a new player. In 1966, researchers traced how the brain learns from repeated stimulation. They found that triggering neurons in one part of the hippocampus—a sliver of brain tissue key to memory—can make linked, distant neurons more likely to fire for many hours afterward, a phenomenon now known as long-term potentiation (LTP). LTP leaves its mark by strengthening some connections between synapses–the connections between brain cells—and not others. Now, researchers have found a new type of LTP that may explain how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> itself "teaches" the brain. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong>-related LTP is driven not by neuronal activity, but by glia—nonneuronal cells that protect neurons from injury, among other duties.</p>

A Cysteine-Rich Protein Kinase Associates with a Membrane Immune Complex and the Cysteine Residues Are Required for Cell Death
<p>Membrane-localized proteins perceive and respond to biotic and abiotic stresses. We performed quantitative proteomics on plasma membrane-enriched samples from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) treated with bacterial flagellin. We identified multiple receptor-like protein kinases changing in abundance, including cysteine (Cys)-rich receptor-like kinases (CRKs) that are up-regulated upon the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">percept</span></strong>ion of flagellin. CRKs possess extracellular Cys-rich domains and constitute a gene family consisting of 46 members in Arabidopsis. The single transfer DNA insertion lines <i>CRK28</i> and <i>CRK29</i>, two CRKs induced in response to flagellin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">percept</span></strong>ion, did not exhibit robust alterations in immune responses. In contrast, silencing of multiple bacterial flagellin-induced CRKs resulted in enhanced susceptibility to pathogenic <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i>, indicating functional redundancy in this large gene family. Enhanced expression of <i>CRK28</i> in Arabidopsis increased disease resistance to <i>P. syringae</i>. Expression of <i>CRK28</i> in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> induced cell death, which required intact extracellular Cys residues and a conserved kinase active site. CRK28-mediated cell death required the common receptor-like protein kinase coreceptor BAK1. CRK28 associated with BAK1 as well as the activated FLAGELLIN-SENSING2 (FLS2) immune receptor complex. CRK28 self-associated as well as associated with the closely related CRK29. These data support a model where Arabidopsis CRKs are synthesized upon pathogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">percept</span></strong>ion, associate with the FLS2 complex, and coordinately act to enhance plant immune responses.</p>

Patients received either   100 ml saline (placebo, n = 27), or 100 ml saline together with   1000 mg of tranexamic acid (TXA, n = 27) intravenously prior to   skin incision and during wound closure.

Assessment of early clinical parameters included the visual analogue   scale for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> (VAS), documentation of haematoma formation and adverse events.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Mean peri-operative blood drainage (placebo: 170 ml <i>versus</i> TXA:   50 ml, p = 0.001) and calculated mean total blood loss (placebo:   1248.2 ml <i>versus</i> TXA: 871.0 ml, p = 0.009) were   significantly lower in the TXA group. No transfusions were necessary   during the study period in either group. Mean VAS for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> significantly   decreased from pre-operative (VAS 7) to the early post-operative   period (VAS 1.7, p < 0.001). Significant differences regarding   mean post-operative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> between placebo (VAS 2.0) and TXA (VAS   1.3) were detected (p = 0.05). The occurrence of haematomas was   significantly more frequent in the placebo (59.3%, n = 16) than   in the TXA group (25.9%, n = 6, p = 0.027). Whereas only mild haematomas   developed in the TXA group, in the placebo group a total of 22.2%   (n = 6) developed either moderate or severe haematomas. No adverse   events associated with administration of TXA occurred.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Intravenous administration of TXA successfully reduced mean peri-operative   blood drainage, total estimated blood loss, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> during the first   post-operative days, and haematoma formation in total shoulder arthroplasty.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1073–9.</p></sec>

A pragmatic randomised controlled trial comparing the efficacy of a femoral nerve block and periarticular infiltration for early pain relief following total knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of a femoral   nerve block and a periarticular infiltration in the management of   early post-operative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> after total knee arthroplasty (TKA).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A pragmatic, single centre, two arm parallel group, patient blinded,   randomised controlled trial was undertaken. All patients due for   TKA were eligible. Exclusion criteria included contraindications   to the medications involved in the study and patients with a neurological   abnormality of the lower limb. Patients received either a femoral   nerve block with 75 mg of 0.25% levobupivacaine hydrochloride around   the nerve, or periarticular infiltration with 150 mg of 0.25% levobupivacaine   hydrochloride, 10 mg morphine sulphate, 30 mg ketorolac trometamol   and 0.25 mg of adrenaline all diluted with 0.9% saline to make a   volume of 150 ml.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 264 patients were recruited and data from 230 (88%)   were available for the primary analysis. Intention-to-treat analysis   of the primary outcome measure of a visual analogue score for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong>   on the first post-operative day, prior to physiotherapy, was similar   in both groups. The mean difference was -0.7 (95% confidence interval   (CI) -5.9 to 4.5; p = 0.834). The periarticular group used less   morphine in the first post-operative day compared with the femoral nerve   block group (74%, 95% CI 55 to 99). The femoral nerve block group   reported 39 adverse events, of which 27 were serious, in 31 patients   and the periarticular group reported 51 adverse events, of which   38 were serious, in 42 patients up to six weeks post-operatively.

Medium-term outcomes of the Universal-2 total wrist arthroplasty in patients with rheumatoid arthritis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of this study were to evaluate the clinical and radiological   outcomes of the Universal-2 total wrist arthroplasty (TWA) in patients   with rheumatoid arthritis.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This was a retrospective review of all 95 Universal-2 TWAs which   were performed in our institution between 2003 to 2012 in patients   with rheumatoid arthritis. A total of six patients were lost to   follow-up and two died of unrelated causes. A total of ten patients   had bilateral procedures. Accordingly, 75 patients (85 TWAs) were   included in the study. There were 59 women and 16 men with a mean   age of 59 years (26 to 86). The mean follow-up was 53 months (24   to 120). Clinical assessment involved recording <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> on a visual   analogue score, range of movement, grip strength, the Quick Disabilities   of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) and Wrightington wrist scores.   Any adverse effects were documented with particular emphasis on   residual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong>, limitation of movement, infection, dislocation and   the need for revision surgery.</p><p>Radiographic assessment was performed pre-operatively and at   three, six and 12 months post-operatively, and annually thereafter.   Arthroplasties were assessed for distal row intercarpal fusion and   loosening. Radiolucent zones around the components were documented   according to a system developed at our institution.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean worst <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> was 8.1 (3 to 10) pre-operatively and 5.4   (0 to 10) at latest follow-up (p < 0.001). Movements were preserved   with mean dorsiflexion of 29<sup>o </sup>(0<sup> o</sup> to 70<sup> o</sup>)   and palmar flexion of 21<sup>o</sup> (0<sup>o</sup> to 50<sup>o</sup>).   The mean grip strength was 4.8 kg (1.7 to 11.5) pre-operatively   and 10 kg (0 to 28) at final follow-up (p < 0.001). The mean   QuickDASH and Wrightington wrist scores improved from 61 (16 to   91) to 46 (0 to 89) and 7.9 (1.8 to 10) to 5.7 (0 to 7.8) (p < 0.001).   A total of six patients (7%) had major complications; three required   revision arthroplasty and three an arthrodesis. The Kaplan-Meier   probability of survival using removal of the components as the endpoint   was 91% at 7.8 years (95% confidence interval 84 to 91).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The Universal-2 TWA is recommended for use in patients with rheumatoid   arthritis.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2016;98-B:1642–7.</p></sec>

Clinical Usefulness, Angiographic Characteristics, and Safety Evaluation of Intracoronary Acetylcholine Provocation Testing Among 921 Consecutive White Patients With Unobstructed Coronary Arteries
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Coronary spasm can cause myocardial ischemia and angina in patients with and those without obstructive coronary artery disease. However, provocation tests using intracoronary acetylcholine administration are rarely performed in clinical routine in the United States and Europe. Thus, we assessed the clinical usefulness, angiographic characteristics, and safety of intracoronary acetylcholine provocation testing in white patients with unobstructed coronary arteries.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>From September 2007 to June 2010, a total of 921 consecutive patients (362 men, mean age 62±12years) who underwent diagnostic angiography for suspected myocardial ischemia and were found to have unobstructed coronary arteries (no stenosis ≥50%) were enrolled. The intracoronary acetylcholine provocation testing was performed directly after angiography according to a standardized protocol. Three hundred forty-six patients (35%) reported chest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> at rest, 222 (22%) reported chest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> on exertion, 238 (24%) reported a combination of effort and resting chest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong>, and 41 (4%) presented with troponin-positive acute coronary syndrome. The overall frequency of epicardial spasm (>75% diameter reduction with angina and ischemic ECG shifts) was 33.4%, and the overall frequency of microvascular spasm (angina and ischemic ECG shifts without epicardial spasm) was 24.2%. Epicardial spasm was most often diffuse and located in the distal coronary segments (<i>P</i><0.01). No fatal or irreversible nonfatal complications occurred. However, 9 patients (1%) had minor complications (nonsustained ventricular tachycardia [n=1], fast paroxysmal atrial fibrillation [n=1], symptomatic bradycardia [n=6], and catheter-induced spasm [n=1]).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Epicardial and microvascular spasm are frequently found in white patients with unobstructed coronary arteries. Epicardial spasm is most often diffuse and located in the distal coronary segments. The intracoronary acetylcholine provocation test is a safe technique to assess coronary vasomotor function.</p></sec>

Association Between Physician Follow-Up and Outcomes of Care After Chest Pain Assessment in High-Risk Patients
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Assessment of chest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> is one of the most common reasons for emergency department visits in developed countries. Although guidelines recommend primary care physician (PCP) follow-up for patients who are subsequently discharged, little is known about the relationship between physician follow-up and clinical outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>An observational study was conducted on patients with higher baseline risk, defined as having diabetes mellitus or established cardiovascular disease, who were evaluated for chest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong>, discharged, and without adverse clinical outcomes for 30 days in Ontario from 2004 to 2010. Multivariable proportional hazard models were constructed to adjust for potential confounding between physician groups (cardiologist, PCP, or none). Among 56767 included patients, 17% were evaluated by cardiologists, 58% were evaluated by PCPs alone, and 25% had no physician follow-up. The mean age was 66±15 years, and 53% were male. The highest rates of diagnostic testing, medical therapy, and coronary revascularization were seen among patients treated by cardiologists. At 1 year, the rate of death or MI was 5.5% (95% confidence interval, 5.0–5.9) in the cardiology group, 7.7% (95% confidence interval, 7.4–7.9) in the PCP group, and 8.6% (95% confidence interval, 8.2–9.1) in the no-physician group. After adjustment, cardiologist follow-up was associated with significantly lower adjusted hazard ratio of death or MI compared with PCP (hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.78–0.92) and no physician (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.71–0.88) follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Among patients with higher baseline cardiovascular risk who were discharged from the emergency department after evaluation for chest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pain</span></strong> in Ontario, follow-up with a cardiologist was associated with a decreased risk of all-cause mortality or hospitalization for MI at 1 year compared with follow-up with a PCP or no physician follow-up.</p></sec>

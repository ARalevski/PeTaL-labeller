Thresholds for Ambulatory Blood Pressure Among African Americans in the Jackson Heart Study
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring is the reference standard for out-of-clinic BP measurement. Thresholds for identifying ambulatory hypertension (daytime systolic BP [SBP]/diastolic BP [DBP] ≥135/85 mm Hg, 24-hour SBP/DBP ≥130/80 mm Hg, and nighttime SBP/DBP ≥120/70 mm Hg) have been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed from European, Asian, and South American populations. We determined BP thresholds for ambulatory hypertension in a US population-based sample of African American adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We analyzed data from the Jackson Heart Study, a population-based cohort study comprised exclusively of African American adults (n=5306). Analyses were restricted to 1016 participants who completed ambulatory BP monitoring at baseline in 2000 to 2004. Mean SBP and DBP levels were calculated for daytime (10:00 am–8:00 pm), 24-hour (all available readings), and nighttime (midnight–6:00 am) periods, separately. Daytime, 24-hour, and nighttime BP thresholds for ambulatory hypertension were identified using regression- and outcome-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed approaches. The composite of a cardiovascular disease or an all-cause mortality event was used in the outcome-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed approach. For this latter approach, BP thresholds were identified only for SBP because clinic DBP was not associated with the outcome. Analyses were stratified by antihypertensive medication use.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among participants not taking antihypertensive medication, the regression-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed thresholds for daytime, 24-hour, and nighttime SBP/DBP corresponding to clinic SBP/DBP of 140/90 mm Hg were 134/85 mm Hg, 130/81 mm Hg, and 123/73 mm Hg, respectively. The outcome-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed thresholds for daytime, 24-hour, and nighttime SBP corresponding to a clinic SBP ≥140 mm Hg were 138 mm Hg, 134 mm Hg, and 129 mm Hg, respectively. Among participants taking antihypertensive medication, the regression-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed thresholds for daytime, 24-hour, and nighttime SBP/DBP corresponding to clinic SBP/DBP of 140/90 mm Hg were 135/85 mm Hg, 133/82 mm Hg, and 128/76 mm Hg, respectively. The corresponding outcome-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed thresholds for daytime, 24-hour, and nighttime SBP were 140 mm Hg, 137 mm Hg, and 133 mm Hg, respectively, among those taking antihypertensive medication.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>On the basis of the outcome-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed approach for SBP and regression-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed approach for DBP, the following def<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ons for daytime, 24-hour, and nighttime hypertension corresponding to clinic SBP/DBP ≥140/90 mm Hg are proposed for African American adults: daytime SBP/DBP ≥140/85 mm Hg, 24-hour SBP/DBP ≥135/80 mm Hg, and nighttime SBP/DBP ≥130/75 mm Hg, respectively.</p></sec>

Derivation and Validation of the CREST Model for Very Early Prediction of Circulatory Etiology Death in Patients Without ST-Segment–Elevation Myocardial Infarction After Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>No practical tool quantitates the risk of circulatory-etiology death (CED) immediately after successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation in patients without ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction. We developed and validated a prediction model to rapidly determine that risk and facilitate triage to individualized treatment pathways.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>With the use of INTCAR (International Cardiac Arrest Registry), an 87-question data set representing 44 centers in the United States and Europe, patients were classified as having had CED or a combined end point of neurological-etiology death or survival. Demographics and clinical factors were modeled in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ation cohort, and backward stepwise logistic regression was used to identify factors independently associated with CED. We demonstrated model performance using area under the curve and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ation and validation cohorts, and assigned a simplified point-scoring system.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 638 patients in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ation cohort, 121 (18.9%) had CED. The final model included preexisting coronary artery disease (odds ratio [OR], 2.86; confidence interval [CI], 1.83–4.49; <i>P</i>≤0.001), nonshockable rhythm (OR, 1.75; CI, 1.10–2.77; P=0.017), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>al ejection fraction<30% (OR, 2.11; CI, 1.32–3.37; <i>P</i>=0.002), shock at presentation (OR, 2.27; CI, 1.42–3.62; P<0.001), and ischemic time >25 minutes (OR, 1.42; CI, 0.90–2.23; P=0.13). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ation model area under the curve was 0.73, and Hosmer-Lemeshow test P=0.47. Outcomes were similar in the 318-patient validation cohort (area under the curve 0.68, Hosmer-Lemeshow test P=0.41). When assigned a point for each associated factor in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ation model, the average predicted versus observed probability of CED with a CREST score (coronary artery disease, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>al heart rhythm, low ejection fraction, shock at the time of admission, and ischemic time >25 minutes) of 0 to 5 was: 7.1% versus 10.2%, 9.5% versus 11%, 22.5% versus 19.6%, 32.4% versus 29.6%, 38.5% versus 30%, and 55.7% versus 50%.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The CREST model stratified patients immediately after resuscitation according to risk of a circulatory-etiology death. The tool may allow for estimation of circulatory risk and improve the triage of survivors of cardiac arrest without ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction at the point of care.</p></sec>

Time to Epinephrine Administration and Survival From Nonshockable Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Among Children and Adults
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that earlier epinephrine administration is associated with improved survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with shockable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>al rhythms. However, the effect of epinephrine timing on patients with nonshockable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>al rhythms is unclear. The objective of this study was to measure the association between time to epinephrine administration and survival in adults and children with emergency medical services (EMS)–treated OHCA with nonshockable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>al rhythms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed a secondary analysis of OHCAs prospectively identified by the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium network from June 4, 2011, to June 30, 2015. We included patients of all ages with an EMS-treated OHCA and an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>al nonshockable rhythm. We excluded those with return of spontaneous circulation in <10 minutes. We conducted a subgroup analysis involving patients <18 years of age. The primary exposure was time (minutes) from arrival of the first EMS agency to the first dose of epinephrine. Secondary exposure was time to epinephrine dichotomized as early (<10 minutes) or late (≥10 minutes). The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. We adjusted for Utstein covariates and Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium study site.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>From 55 568 EMS-treated OHCAs, 32 101 patients with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>al nonshockable rhythms were included. There were 12 238 in the early group, 14 517 in the late group, and 5346 not treated with epinephrine. After adjusting for potential confounders, each minute from EMS arrival to epinephrine administration was associated with a 4% decrease in odds of survival for adults, odds ratio=0.96 (95% confidence interval, 0.95–0.98). A subgroup analysis (n=13 290) examining neurological outcomes showed a similar association (adjusted odds ratio, 0.94 per minute; 95% confidence interval, 0.89–0.98). When epinephrine was given late in comparison with early, odds of survival were 18% lower (odds ratio, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.68–0.98). In a pediatric analysis (n=595), odds of survival were 9% lower (odds ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.81–1.01) for each minute delay in epinephrine.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among OHCAs with nonshockable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>al rhythms, the majority of patients were administered epinephrine >10 minutes after EMS arrival. Each minute delay in epinephrine administration was associated with decreased survival and unfavorable neurological outcomes. EMS agencies should consider strategies to reduce epinephrine administration times in patients with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>al nonshockable rhythms.</p></sec>

Prognostic Implications of Magnetic Resonance–Derived Quantification in Asymptomatic Patients With Organic Mitral Regurgitation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an accurate method for the quantitative assessment of organic mitral regurgitation (OMR). The aim of the present study was to compare the discriminative power of MRI quantification and the recommended Doppler echocardiography (ECHO)–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed integrative approach to identify asymptomatic patients with OMR and adverse outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The study population consisted of 258 asymptomatic patients (63±14 years, 60% men) with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (>60%) and chronic moderate and severe OMR (flail 25%, prolapse 75%) defined by using the ECHO-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed integrative approach. All patients underwent MRI to quantify regurgitant volume (RV) of OMR by subtracting the aortic forward flow volume from the total left ventricular stroke volume. Severe OMR was defined as RV≥60 mL.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Mean ECHO-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed RV was on average 17.1 mL larger than the MRI-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed RV (<i>P</i><0.05). Concordant grading of OMR severity with both techniques was observed in 197 (76%) individuals with 62 (31%) patients having severe OMR (MRI SEV-ECHO SEV) and 135 (69%) patients having moderate OMR (MRI MOD-ECHO MOD). The remaining 61 (24%) individuals had discordant findings (MRI SEV-ECHO MOD or MRI MOD-ECHO SEV) between the 2 techniques. The majority of these differences in OMR classification were observed in patients with late systolic or multiple jets (both κ<0.2). Patients with eccentric jets showed moderate agreement (κ=0.53; 95% confidence interval, 0.41–0.64). In contrast, a very good agreement (κ=0.90; 95% confidence interval, 0.82–0.98) was observed in a combination of holosystolic, central, and single jet. During a median follow-up of 5.0 years (interquartile range, 3.5–6.0 years), 38 (15%) patients died and 106 (41%) either died or developed indication for mitral valve surgery. In separate Cox regression analyses, the MRI-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed left ventricular end-systolic volume index, RV, and OMR category (severe versus moderate), and the ECHO-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed OMR category were independent predictors of all-cause mortality (all <i>P</i><0.05). The MRI-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed RV showed the largest area under the curve to predict mortality (0.72) or its combination with the development of indication for mitral valve surgery (0.83).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The findings of the present study suggest that the MRI-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed assessment of OMR can better identify patients with severe OMR and adverse outcome than ECHO-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed integrative approach warranting close follow-up and perhaps, early mitral valve surgery.</p></sec>

Antiarrhythmic Drugs for Nonshockable-Turned-Shockable Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) commonly presents with nonshockable rhythms (asystole and pulseless electric activity). It is unknown whether antiarrhythmic drugs are safe and effective when nonshockable rhythms evolve to shockable rhythms (ventricular fibrillation/pulseless ventricular tachycardia [VF/VT]) during resuscitation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Adults with nontraumatic OHCA, vascular access, and VF/VT anytime after ≥1 shock(s) were prospectively randomized, double-blind, to receive amiodarone, lidocaine, or placebo by paramedics. Patients presenting with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>al shock-refractory VF/VT were previously reported. The current study was a prespecified analysis in a separate cohort that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ally presented with nonshockable OHCA and was randomized on subsequently developing shock-refractory VF/VT. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes included discharge functional status and adverse drug-related effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 37 889 patients with OHCA, 3026 with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>al VF/VT and 1063 with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>al nonshockable-turned-shockable rhythms were treatment-eligible, were randomized, and received their assigned drug. Baseline characteristics among patients with nonshockable-turned-shockable rhythms were balanced across treatment arms, except that recipients of a placebo included fewer men and were less likely to receive bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Active-drug recipients in this cohort required fewer shocks, supplemental doses of their assigned drug, and ancillary antiarrhythmic drugs than recipients of a placebo (<i>P</i><0.05). In all, 16 (4.1%) amiodarone, 11 (3.1%) lidocaine, and 6 (1.9%) placebo-treated patients survived to hospital discharge (<i>P</i>=0.24). No significant interaction between treatment assignment and discharge survival occurred with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ating OHCA rhythm (asystole, pulseless electric activity, or VF/VT). Survival in each of these categories was consistently higher with active drugs, although the trends were not statistically significant. Adjusted absolute differences (95% confidence interval) in survival from nonshockable-turned-shockable arrhythmias with amiodarone versus placebo were 2.3% (−0.3, 4.8), <i>P</i>=0.08, and for lidocaine versus placebo 1.2% (−1.1, 3.6), <i>P</i>=0.30. More than 50% of these survivors were functionally independent or required minimal assistance. Drug-related adverse effects were infrequent.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Outcome from nonshockable-turned-shockable OHCA is poor but not invariably fatal. Although not statistically significant, point estimates for survival were greater after amiodarone or lidocaine than placebo, without increased risk of adverse effects or disability and consistent with previously observed favorable trends from treatment of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>al shock-refractory VF/VT with these drugs. Together the findings may signal a clinical benefit that invites further investigation.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Large Numbers of Novel miRNAs Originate from DNA Transposons and Are Coincident with a Large Species Radiation in Bats
<p>Vesper bats (family Vespertilionidae) experienced a rapid adaptive radiation beginning around 36 Ma that resulted in the second most species-rich mammalian family (>400 species). Coincident with that radiation was an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>al burst of DNA transposon activity that has continued into the present in some species. Such extensive and recent DNA transposon activity has not been seen in any other extant mammal. Indeed, retrotransposon activity is much more common in all other sequenced mammal genomes. Deep sequencing of the small RNA fraction from a vespertilionid bat, <i>Eptesicus fuscus</i>, as well as a dog and horse revealed large numbers of 17–24 bp putative miRNAs (p/miRNAs). Although the origination rate of p/miRNAs is similar in all three taxa, 61.1% of postdivergence p/miRNAs in <i>Eptesicus</i> are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed from transposable elements (TEs) compared with only 23.9% and 16.5% in the dog and horse, respectively. Not surprisingly, given the retrotransposon bias of dog and horse, the majority of TE-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed p/miRNAs are associated with retrotransposons. In <i>Eptesicus</i>, however, 58.7% of the TE-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed and 35.9% of the total p/miRNAs arose not from retrotransposons but from bat-specific DNA transposons. Notably, we observe that the timing of the DNA transposon expansion and the resulting introduction of novel p/miRNAs coincide with the rapid diversification of the family Vespertilionidae. Furthermore, potential targets of the DNA transposon-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed p/miRNAs are identifiable and enriched for genes that are important for regulation of transcription. We propose that lineage-specific DNA transposon activity lead to the rapid and repeated introduction of novel p/miRNAs. Some of these p/miRNAs are likely functional miRNAs and potentially influenced the diversification of Vespertilionidae. Our observations suggest a mechanism for introducing functional genomic variation rapidly through the expansion of DNA transposons that fits within the TE-thrust hypothesis.</p>

Cardiovascular Outcomes and Risks After Initiation of a Sodium Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitor
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Clinical trials have shown cardiovascular benefits and potential risks from sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i).

Incidence rates, hazard ratios (HRs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for time to first composite end point of all-cause mortality and hospitalization for heart failure event, major adverse cardiovascular events (defined as all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke), and individual end points were evaluated using conditional Cox models comparing new SGLT2i users with other antihyperglycemic agents. The exploratory safety end point was below-knee lower extremity amputation. Intent-to-treat and on-treatment analyses were performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>After propensity matching, 25 258 patients were followed for a median of 1.6 years.

SGLT2i <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ation was also associated with an ≈2-fold higher risk of below-knee lower extremity amputation (0.17 versus 0.09 events per 100 person-years; HR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.12–3.51). Because of the disproportionate canagliflozin exposure in the database, the majority of amputations were observed on canagliflozin. Results were consistent in the on-treatment analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In this high-risk cohort, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ation of SGLT2i was associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality, hospitalization for heart failure, and major adverse cardiovascular events and higher risk of below-knee lower extremity amputation. Findings underscore the potential benefit and risks to be aware of when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ating SGLT2i. It remains unclear whether the below-knee lower extremity amputation risk extends across the class of medication, because the study was not powered to make comparisons among individual treatments.</p></sec>

Duration of Prehospital Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Favorable Neurological Outcomes for Pediatric Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrests
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The appropriate duration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCAs) remains unclear and may differ based on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>al rhythm.

Stress conditioning also increased SERCA2 (Sarco/Endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium ATPase 2) expression, which correlated with a less negative force-frequency relationship. When electric pacing was combined with static stress conditioning, the tissues showed an additional increase in force production (1.34±0.19 mN/mm<sup>2</sup>), with no change in construct alignment or cell size, suggesting maturation of excitation-contraction coupling. Supporting this notion, we found expression of RYR2 (Ryanodine Receptor 2) and SERCA2 further increased by combined static stress and electric stimulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These studies demonstrate that electric pacing and mechanical stimulation promote maturation of the structural, mechanical, and force generation properties of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed cardiac tissues.</p></sec>

Increased activity of TNAP compensates for reduced adenosine production and promotes ectopic calcification in the genetic disease ACDC
<p>ACDC (arterial calcification due to deficiency of CD73) is an autosomal recessive disease resulting from loss-of-function mutations in <i>NT5E</i>, which encodes CD73, a 5′-ectonucleotidase that converts extracellular adenosine monophosphate to adenosine. ACDC patients display progressive calcification of lower extremity arteries, causing limb ischemia. Tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP), which converts pyrophosphate (PPi) to inorganic phosphate (Pi), and extracellular purine metabolism play important roles in other inherited forms of vascular calcification. Compared to cells from healthy subjects, induced pluripotent stem cell–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed mesenchymal stromal cells (iMSCs) from ACDC patients displayed accelerated calcification and increased TNAP activity when cultured under conditions that promote osteogenesis. TNAP activity generated adenosine in iMSCs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed from ACDC patients but not in iMSCs from control subjects, which have CD73. In response to osteogenic stimulation, ACDC patient–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed iMSCs had decreased amounts of the TNAP substrate PPi, an inhibitor of extracellular matrix calcification, and exhibited increased activation of AKT, mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), and the 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K), a pathway that promotes calcification. In vivo, teratomas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed from ACDC patient cells showed extensive calcification and increased TNAP activity. Treating mice bearing these teratomas with an A2b adenosine receptor agonist, the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, or the bisphosphonate etidronate reduced calcification. These results show that an increase of TNAP activity in ACDC contributes to ectopic calcification by disrupting the extracellular balance of PPi and Pi and identify potential therapeutic targets for ACDC.</p>

Functional changes of AMPA responses in human induced pluripotent stem cell–derived neural progenitors in fragile X syndrome
<p>Altered neuronal network formation and function involving dysregulated excitatory and inhibitory circuits are associated with fragile X syndrome (FXS). We examined functional maturation of the excitatory transmission system in FXS by investigating the response of FXS patient–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed neural progenitor cells to the glutamate analog (AMPA). Neural progenitors <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed from induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines generated from boys with FXS had augmented intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses to AMPA and kainate that were mediated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs) lacking the GluA2 subunit. Together with the enhanced differentiation of glutamate-responsive cells, the proportion of CP-AMPAR and <i>N</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate (NMDA) receptor–coexpressing cells was increased in human FXS progenitors. Differentiation of cells lacking GluA2 was also increased and paralleled the increased inward rectification in neural progenitors <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed from <i>Fmr1</i>-knockout mice (the FXS mouse model). Human FXS progenitors had increased the expression of the precursor and mature forms of miR-181a, a microRNA that represses translation of the transcript encoding GluA2. Blocking GluA2-lacking, CP-AMPARs reduced the neurite length of human iPSC-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed control progenitors and further reduced the shortened length of neurites in human FXS progenitors, supporting the contribution of CP-AMPARs to the regulation of progenitor differentiation. Furthermore, we observed reduced expression of <i>Gria2</i> (the GluA2-encoding gene) in the frontal lobe of FXS mice, consistent with functional changes of AMPARs in FXS. Increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through CP-AMPARs may increase the vulnerability and affect the differentiation and migration of distinct cell populations, which may interfere with normal circuit formation in FXS.</p>

OsPINOID Regulates Stigma and Ovule Initiation through Maintenance of the Floral Meristem by Auxin Signaling
<p>Stigma and ovule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ation is essential for sexual reproduction in flowering plants. However, the mechanism underlying the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ation of stigma and ovule primordia remains elusive. We identified a stigma-less mutant of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and revealed that it was caused by the mutation in the <i>PINOID</i> (<i>OsPID</i>) gene. Unlike the <i>pid</i> mutant that shows typical pin-like inflorescences in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) and Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the <i>ospid</i> mutant does not display any defects in inflorescence development and flower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ation, and fails to develop normal ovules in most spikelets. The auxin activity in the young pistil of <i>ospid</i> was lower than that in the wild-type pistil. Furthermore, the expression of most auxin response factor genes was down-regulated, and <i>OsETTIN1</i>, <i>OsETTIN2</i>, and <i>OsMONOPTEROS</i> lost their rearrangements of expression patterns during pistil and stamen primordia development in <i>ospid</i>. Moreover, the transcription of the floral meristem marker gene, <i>OSH1</i>, was down-regulated and <i>FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER4</i>, the putative ortholog of Arabidopsis <i>CLAVATA3</i>, was up-regulated in the pistil primordium of <i>ospid</i>. These results suggested that the meristem proliferation in the pistil primordium might be arrested prematurely in <i>ospid</i>. Based on these results, we propose that the OsPID-mediated auxin signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the regulation of rice stigma and ovule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ation by maintaining the floral meristem.</p>

Synergistic Pectin Degradation and Guard Cell Pressurization Underlie Stomatal Pore Formation
<p>Stomatal pores are vital for the diffusion of gasses into and out of land plants and are, therefore, gatekeepers for photosynthesis and transpiration. Although much published literature has described the intercellular signaling and transcriptional regulators involved in early stomatal development, little is known about the cellular details of the local separation between sister guard cells that give rise to the stomatal pore or how formation of this pore is achieved. Using three-dimensional (3D) time-lapse imaging, we found that stomatal pore formation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) is a highly dynamic process involving pore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ation and enlargement and traverses a set of morphological milestones in 3D. Confocal imaging data revealed an enrichment of exocytic machinery, de-methyl-esterified pectic homogalacturonan (HG), and an HG-degrading enzyme at future pore sites, suggesting that both localized HG deposition and degradation might function in pore formation. By manipulating HG modification via enzymatic, chemical, and genetic perturbations in seedling cotyledons, we found that augmenting HG modification promotes pore formation, whereas preventing HG de-methyl-esterification delays pore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ation and inhibits pore enlargement. Through mechanical modeling and experimentation, we tested whether pore formation is an outcome of sister guard cells being pulled away from each other upon turgor increase. Osmotic treatment to reduce turgor pressure did not prevent pore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ation but did lessen pore enlargement. Together, these data provide evidence that HG delivery and modification, and guard cell pressurization, make functional contributions to stomatal pore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ation and enlargement.</p>

A Family of NAI2-Interacting Proteins in the Biogenesis of the ER Body and Related Structures
<p>Plants produce different types of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed vesicles that accumulate and transport proteins, lipids, and metabolites. In the Brassicales, a distinct ER-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed structure called the ER body is found throughout the epidermis of cotyledons, hypocotyls, and roots. NAI2 is a key factor for ER body formation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Homologs of NAI2 are found only in the Brassicales and therefore may have evolved specifically to enable ER body formation. Here, we report that three related Arabidopsis NAI2-interacting proteins (NAIP1, NAIP2, and NAIP3) play a critical role in the biogenesis of ER bodies and related structures. Analysis using GFP fusions revealed that all three NAIPs are components of the ER bodies found in the cotyledons, hypocotyls, and roots. Genetic analysis with <i>naip</i> mutants indicates that they have a critical and redundant role in ER body formation. NAIP2 and NAIP3 are also components of other vesicular structures likely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed from the ER that are formed independent of NAI2 and are present not only in the cotyledons, hypocotyls, and roots, but also in the rosettes. Thus, while NAIP1 is a specialized ER body component, NAIP2 and NAIP3 are components of different types of ER-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed structures. Analysis of chimeric NAIP proteins revealed that their N-terminal domains play a major role in the functional specialization between NAIP1 and NAIP3. Unlike NAI2, NAIPs have homologs in all plants; therefore, NAIP-containing ER structures, from which the ER bodies in the Brassicales may have evolved, are likely to be present widely in plants.</p>

Regulation of Hormonal Control, Cell Reprogramming, and Patterning during De Novo Root Organogenesis
<p>Body regeneration through formation of new organs is a major question in developmental biology. We investigated de novo root formation using whole leaves of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Our results show that local cytokinin biosynthesis and auxin biosynthesis in the leaf blade followed by auxin long-distance transport to the petiole leads to proliferation of J0121-marked xylem-associated tissues and others through signaling of INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID INDUCIBLE28 (IAA28), CRANE (IAA18), WOODEN LEG, and ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATORS1 (ARR1), ARR10, and ARR12. Vasculature proliferation also involves the cell cycle regulator KIP-RELATED PROTEIN2 and ABERRANT LATERAL ROOT FORMATION4, resulting in a mass of cells with rooting competence that resembles callus formation. Endogenous callus formation precedes specification of postembryonic root founder cells, from which roots are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ated through the activity of SHORT-ROOT, PLETHORA1 (PLT1), and PLT2. Primordia <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ation is blocked in <i>shr plt1 plt2</i> mutant. Stem cell regulators SCHIZORIZA, JACKDAW, BLUEJAY, and SCARECROW also participate in root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ation and are required to pattern the new organ, as mutants show disorganized and reduced number of layers and tissue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>als resulting in reduced rooting. Our work provides an organ regeneration model through de novo root formation, stating key stages and the primary pathways involved.</p>

Transcriptome Profiling of Wheat Inflorescence Development from Spikelet Initiation to Floral Patterning Identified Stage-Specific Regulatory Genes
<p>Early reproductive development in cereals is crucial for final grain number per spike and hence the yield potential of the crop. To date, however, no systematic analyses of gene expression profiles during this important process have been conducted for common wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>). Here, we studied the transcriptome profiles at four stages of early wheat reproductive development, from spikelet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ation to floral organ differentiation. <i>K</i>-means clustering and stage-specific transcript identification detected dynamically expressed homeologs of important transcription regulators in spikelet and floral meristems that may be involved in spikelet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ation, floret meristem specification, and floral organ patterning, as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infer</span></strong>red from their homologs in model plants. Small RNA transcriptome sequencing discovered key microRNAs that were differentially expressed during wheat inflorescence development alongside their target genes, suggesting that miRNA-mediated regulatory mechanisms for floral development may be conserved in cereals and Arabidopsis. Our analysis was further substantiated by the functional characterization of the <i>ARGONAUTE1d</i> (<i>AGO1d</i>) gene, which was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ally expressed in stamen primordia and later in the tapetum during anther maturation. In agreement with its stage-specific expression pattern, the loss of function of the predominantly expressed B homeolog of <i>AGO1d</i> in a tetraploid durum wheat mutant resulted in smaller anthers with more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infer</span></strong>tile pollens than the wild type and a reduced grain number per spike. Together, our work provides a first glimpse of the gene regulatory networks in wheat inflorescence development that may be pivotal for floral and grain development, highlighting potential targets for genetic manipulation to improve future wheat yields.</p>

Cellulose-Derived Oligomers Act as Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns and Trigger Defense-Like Responses
<p>The plant cell wall, often the site of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>al encounters between plants and their microbial pathogens, is composed of a complex mixture of cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin polysaccharides as well as proteins. The concept of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) was proposed to describe plant elicitors like oligogalacturonides (OGs), which can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed by the breakdown of the pectin homogalacturon by pectinases. OGs act via many of the same signaling steps as pathogen- or microbe-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) to elicit defenses and provide protection against pathogens. Given both the complexity of the plant cell wall and the fact that many pathogens secrete a wide range of cell wall-degrading enzymes, we reasoned that the breakdown products of other cell wall polymers may be similarly biologically active as elicitors and may help to reinforce the perception of danger by plant cells. Our results indicate that oligomers <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed from cellulose are perceived as signal molecules in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), triggering a signaling cascade that shares some similarities to responses to well-known elicitors such as chitooligomers and OGs. However, in contrast to other known PAMPs/DAMPs, cellobiose stimulates neither detectable reactive oxygen species production nor callose deposition. Confirming our idea that both PAMPs and DAMPs are likely to cooccur at infection sites, cotreatments of cellobiose with flg22 or chitooligomers led to synergistic increases in gene expression. Thus, the perception of cellulose-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed oligomers may participate in cell wall integrity surveillance and represents an additional layer of signaling following plant cell wall breakdown during cell wall remodeling or pathogen attack.</p>

A Comprehensive Expression Profile of MicroRNAs and Other Classes of Non-Coding Small RNAs in Barley Under Phosphorous-Deficient and -Sufficient Conditions
<p>Phosphorus (P) is essential for plant growth. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a key role in phosphate homeostasis. However, little is known about P effect on miRNA expression in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i> L.). In this study, we used Illumina's next-generation sequencing technology to sequence small RNAs (sRNAs) in barley grown under P-deficient and P-sufficient conditions. We identified 221 conserved miRNAs and 12 novel miRNAs, of which 55 were only present in P-deficient treatment while 32 only existed in P-sufficient treatment. Total 47 miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed between the two P treatments (|log<sub>2</sub>| > 1). We also identified many other classes of sRNAs, including sense and antisense sRNAs, repeat-associated sRNAs, transfer RNA (tRNA)-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed sRNAs and chloroplast-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed sRNAs, and some of which were also significantly differentially expressed between the two P treatments. Of all the sRNAs identified, antisense sRNAs were the most abundant sRNA class in both P treatments. Surprisingly, about one-fourth of sRNAs were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed from the chloroplast genome, and a chloroplast-encoded tRNA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed sRNA was the most abundant sRNA of all the sRNAs sequenced. Our data provide valuable clues for understanding the properties of sRNAs and new insights into the potential roles of miRNAs and other classes of sRNAs in the control of phosphate homeostasis.</p>

Derivation and Validation of a Novel Right-Sided Heart Failure Model After Implantation of Continuous Flow Left Ventricular Assist Devices
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The aim of the study was to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>e and validate a novel risk score for early right-sided heart failure (RHF) after left ventricular assist device implantation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The EUROMACS (European Registry for Patients with Mechanical Circulatory Support) was used to identify adult patients undergoing continuous-flow left ventricular assist device implantation with mainstream devices. Eligible patients (n=2988) were randomly divided into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ation (n=2000) and validation (n=988) cohorts. The primary outcome was early (<30 days) severe postoperative RHF, defined as receiving short- or long-term right-sided circulatory support, continuous inotropic support for ≥14 days, or nitric oxide ventilation for ≥48 hours. The secondary outcome was all-cause mortality and length of stay in the intensive care unit. Covariates found to be associated with RHF (exploratory univariate <i>P</i><0.10) were entered into a multivariable logistic regression model. A risk score was then generated using the relative magnitude of the exponential regression model coefficients of independent predictors at the last step after checking for collinearity, likelihood ratio test, c index, and clinical weight at each step.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A 9.5-point risk score incorporating 5 variables (Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support class, use of multiple inotropes, severe right ventricular dysfunction on echocardiography, ratio of right atrial/pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, hemoglobin) was created. The mean scores in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ation and validation cohorts were 2.7±1.9 and 2.6±2.0, respectively (<i>P</i>=0.32). RHF in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ation cohort occurred in 433 patients (21.7%) after left ventricular assist device implantation and was associated with a lower 1-year (53% versus 71%; <i>P</i><0.001) and 2-year (45% versus 58%; <i>P</i><0.001) survival compared with patients without RHF. RHF risk ranged from 11% (low risk score 0–2) to 43.1% (high risk score >4; <i>P</i><0.0001). Median intensive care unit stay was 7 days (interquartile range, 4–15 days) versus 24 days (interquartile range, 14–38 days) in patients without versus with RHF, respectively (<i>P</i><0.001). The c index of the composite score was 0.70 in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ation and 0.67 in the validation cohort.

Identification of Toll-like receptor signaling inhibitors based on selective activation of hierarchically acting signaling proteins
<p>Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize various pathogen- and host tissue–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed molecules and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ate inflammatory immune responses. Exaggerated or prolonged TLR activation, however, can lead to etiologically diverse diseases, such as bacterial sepsis, metabolic and autoimmune diseases, or stroke. Despite the apparent medical need, no small-molecule drugs against TLR pathways are clinically available. This may be because of the complex signaling mechanisms of TLRs, which are governed by a series of protein-protein interactions <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ated by Toll/interleukin-1 receptor homology domains (TIR) found in TLRs and the cytoplasmic adaptor proteins TIRAP and MyD88. Oligomerization of TLRs with MyD88 or TIRAP leads to the recruitment of members of the IRAK family of kinases and the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF6. We developed a phenotypic drug screening system based on the inducible homodimerization of either TIRAP, MyD88, or TRAF6, that ranked hits according to their hierarchy of action. From a bioactive compound library, we identified methyl-piperidino-pyrazole (MPP) as a TLR-specific inhibitor. Structure-activity relationship analysis, quantitative proteomics, protein-protein interaction assays, and cellular thermal shift assays suggested that MPP targets the TIR domain of MyD88. Chemical evolution of the original MPP scaffold generated compounds with selectivity for distinct TLRs that interfered with specific TIR interactions. Administration of an MPP analog to mice protected them from TLR4-dependent inflammation. These results validate this phenotypic screening approach and suggest that the MPP scaffold could serve as a starting point for the development of anti-inflammatory drugs.</p>

Fluid-induced aseismic fault slip outpaces pore-fluid migration
<p>Earthquake swarms attributed to subsurface fluid injection are usually assumed to occur on faults destabilized by increased pore-fluid pressures. However, fluid injection could also activate aseismic slip, which might outpace pore-fluid migration and transmit earthquake-triggering stress changes beyond the fluid-pressurized region. We tested this theoretical prediction against data <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed from fluid-injection experiments that activated and measured slow, aseismic slip on preexisting, shallow faults. We found that the pore pressure and slip history imply a fault whose strength is the product of a slip-weakening friction coefficient and the local effective normal stress.

A molecular assembly phase transition and kinetic proofreading modulate Ras activation by SOS
<p>The guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Son of Sevenless (SOS) is a key Ras activator that is autoinhibited in the cytosol and activates upon membrane recruitment. Autoinhibition release involves structural rearrangements of the protein at the membrane and thus introduces a delay between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>al recruitment and activation. In this study, we designed a single-molecule assay to resolve the time between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>al receptor-mediated membrane recruitment and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ation of GEF activity of individual SOS molecules on microarrays of Ras-functionalized supported membranes. The rise-and-fall shape of the measured SOS activation time distribution and the long mean time scale to activation (~50 seconds) establish a basis for kinetic proofreading in the receptor-mediated activation of Ras. We further demonstrate that this kinetic proofreading is modulated by the LAT (linker for activation of T cells)–Grb2–SOS phosphotyrosine-driven phase transition at the membrane.</p>

Precursors of logical reasoning in preverbal human infants

At the moment of a potential deduction, infants’ pupils dilated, and their eyes moved toward the ambiguous object when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infer</span></strong>ences could be computed, in contrast to transparent scenes not requiring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infer</span></strong>ences to identify the object.

Angular momentum–induced delays in solid-state photoemission enhanced by intra-atomic interactions
<p>Attosecond time-resolved photoemission spectroscopy reveals that photoemission from solids is not yet fully understood. The relative emission delays between four photoemission channels measured for the van der Waals crystal tungsten diselenide (WSe<sub>2</sub>) can only be explained by accounting for both propagation and intra-atomic delays. The intra-atomic delay depends on the angular momentum of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>al localized state and is determined by intra-atomic interactions. For the studied case of WSe<sub>2</sub>, the photoemission events are time ordered with rising <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>al-state angular momentum. Including intra-atomic electron-electron interaction and angular momentum of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>al localized state yields excellent agreement between theory and experiment. This has required a revision of existing models for solid-state photoemission, and thus, attosecond time-resolved photoemission from solids provides important benchmarks for improved future photoemission models.</p>

RNA polymerase motions during promoter melting
<p>All cellular RNA polymerases (RNAPs), from those of bacteria to those of man, possess a clamp that can open and close, and it has been assumed that the open RNAP separates promoter DNA strands and then closes to establish a tight grip on the DNA template. Here, we resolve successive motions of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ating bacterial RNAP by studying real-time signatures of fluorescent reporters placed on RNAP and DNA in the presence of ligands locking the clamp in distinct conformations. We report evidence for an unexpected and obligatory step early in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ation involving a transient clamp closure as a prerequisite for DNA melting. We also present a 2.6-angstrom crystal structure of a late-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ation intermediate harboring a rotationally unconstrained downstream DNA duplex within the open RNAP active site cleft. Our findings explain how RNAP thermal motions control the promoter search and drive DNA melting in the absence of external energy sources.</p>

<i>ESA1</i> Is Involved in Embryo Sac Abortion in Interspecific Hybrid Progeny of Rice
<p>The emergence of sterile individuals in the hybrid backcross progeny of wild and cultivated rice limits the use of wild rice alleles for improving cultivated rice, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this sterility remain unclear. Here, we identified the semisterile introgression line YIL42, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed from a cross between the <i>indica</i> rice variety Teqing (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and <i>Oryza rufipogon</i> accession YJCWR (Yuanjiang common wild rice), which exhibits semisterility. Using positional cloning, we isolated <i>EMBRYO SAC ABORTION 1</i> (<i>ESA1</i>), which encodes a nuclear-membrane localized protein containing an armadillo repeat domain. A mutation in <i>ESA1</i> at position 1819 (<sup>T</sup>1819<sup>C</sup>) converts a stop codon into an Arg (R) codon, causing delayed termination of protein translation. Analysis of transgenic lines indicated that the difference in ESA1 protein structure between <i>O. rufipogon</i>–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed <i>ESA1</i> and Teqing-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed <i>esa1</i> affects female gamete abortion during early mitosis. Fertility investigation and expression analysis indicated that the interaction between <i>ESA1</i><sup>T1819</sup> and unknown gene(s) of Teqing affects spikelet fertility of the hybrid backcross progeny. The <i>ESA1</i><sup>T1819</sup> allele is present in <i>O. rufipogon</i> but absent in <i>O. sativa</i>, suggesting that variation in <i>ESA1</i> may be associated with interspecific hybrid incompatibility between wild and cultivated rice. Our findings provide insight into the molecular mechanism underlying female sterility, which is useful for improving the panicle seed setting rate of rice and for developing a strategy to overcome interspecific hybrid sterility between cultivated rice and wild rice.</p>

CYP76B74 Catalyzes the 3′′-Hydroxylation of Geranylhydroquinone in Shikonin Biosynthesis
<p>Shikonin and its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>atives are the most abundant naphthoquinone pigments formed in species of the medicinally and economically valuable Boraginaceae. A key step in the shikonin biosynthetic pathway, namely the C-3′′ hydroxylation of the prenylated phenolic intermediate geranylhydroquinone, is expected to be catalyzed by a cytochrome P450. To identify cytochrome P450 candidates with transcription profiles similar to those of genes known to be involved in shikonin biosynthesis, we carried out coexpression analysis of transcriptome data sets of shikonin-proficient and shikonin-deficient cell lines and examined the spatial expression of candidate genes in different organs of <i>Arnebia euchroma</i>. In biochemical assays using geranylhydroquinone as the substrate, CYP76B74 exhibited geranylhydroquinone 3′′-hydroxylase activity and produced 3′′-hydroxy-geranylhydroquinone. In <i>CYP76B74</i> RNA interference <i>A. euchroma</i> hairy roots, shikonin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ative accumulation decreased dramatically, which demonstrated that CYP76B74 is required for shikonin biosynthesis in the plant. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that CYP76B74 belonged to the CYP76B subfamily and was most likely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed from an ancestral geraniol 10-hydroxylase. In a subcellular localization analysis, a GFP-CYP76B74 fusion localized to endoplasmic reticulum membranes. Our results demonstrate that CYP76B74 catalyzes the key hydroxylation step in shikonin biosynthesis with high efficiency. The characterization of the CYP76B74 described here paves the way for further exploration of the ring closure reactions generating the naphthoquinone skeleton as well as for the alternative metabolism of geranylhydroquinone 3′′-hydroxylase to dihydroechinofuran.</p>

Estimating Mesophyll Conductance from Measurements of C<sup>18</sup>OO Photosynthetic Discrimination and Carbonic Anhydrase Activity
<p>Carbonic anhydrase (CA) activity in leaves catalyzes the <sup>18</sup>O exchange between CO<sub>2</sub> and water during photosynthesis. This feature has been used to estimate the mesophyll conductance to CO<sub>2</sub> (<i>g</i><sub>m</sub>) from measurements of online C<sup>18</sup>OO photosynthetic discrimination (<sup>18</sup>O). Based on CA assays on leaf extracts, it has been argued that CO<sub>2</sub> in mesophyll cells should be in isotopic equilibrium with water in most C<sub>3</sub> species as well as many C<sub>4</sub> dicot species. However, this seems incompatible with <sup>18</sup>O data that would indicate a much lower degree of equilibration, especially in C<sub>4</sub> plants under high light intensity. This apparent contradiction is resolved here using a new model of C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic discrimination that includes competition between CO<sub>2</sub> hydration and carboxylation and the contribution of respiratory fluxes. This new modeling framework is used to revisit previously published data sets on C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> species, including CA-deficient plants. We conclude that (1) newly <sup>18</sup>O-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed <i>g</i><sub>m</sub> values are usually close but significantly higher (typically 20% and up to 50%) than those <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed assuming full equilibration and (2) despite the uncertainty associated with the respiration rate in light, or the water isotope gradient between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells, robust estimates of <sup>18</sup>O-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed <i>g</i><sub>m</sub> can be achieved in both C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> plants.</p>

Predicted Arabidopsis Interactome Resource and Gene Set Linkage Analysis: A Transcriptomic Analysis Resource
<p>An advanced functional understanding of omics data is important for elucidating the design logic of physiological processes in plants and effectively controlling desired traits in plants. We present the latest versions of the Predicted Arabidopsis Interactome Resource (PAIR) and of the gene set linkage analysis (GSLA) tool, which enable the interpretation of an observed transcriptomic change (differentially expressed genes [DEGs]) in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) with respect to its functional impact for biological processes. PAIR version 5.0 integrates functional association data between genes in multiple forms and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infer</span></strong>s 335,301 putative functional interactions. GSLA relies on this high-confidence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infer</span></strong>red functional association network to expand our perception of the functional impacts of an observed transcriptomic change. GSLA then interprets the biological significance of the observed DEGs using established biological concepts (annotation terms), describing not only the DEGs themselves but also their potential functional impacts. This unique analytical capability can help researchers gain deeper insights into their experimental results and highlight prospective directions for further investigation. We demonstrate the utility of GSLA with two case studies in which GSLA uncovered how molecular events may have caused physiological changes through their collective functional influence on biological processes. Furthermore, we showed that typical annotation-enrichment tools were unable to produce similar insights to PAIR/GSLA. The PAIR version 5.0-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infer</span></strong>red interactome and GSLA Web tool both can be accessed at <ext-link>http://public.synergylab.cn/pair/</ext-link>.</p>

Extended Vernalization Regulates Inflorescence Fate in <i>Arabis alpina</i> by Stably Silencing <i>PERPETUAL FLOWERING1</i>
<p>The alpine perennial <i>Arabis alpina</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ates flower buds during prolonged exposure to cold. In the accession Pajares, we demonstrate that the length of vernalization influences flowering time and inflorescence fate but does not affect the axillary branches that maintain vegetative growth. The expression of floral organ identity genes gradually increases in the main shoot apex during vernalization, correlating with an increase in floral commitment. In northern Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) accessions, the length of vernalization modulates the stable silencing of the floral repressor <i>FLOWERING LOCUS C</i> (<i>FLC</i>). We demonstrate that expression of <i>PERPETUAL FLOWERING1</i> (<i>PEP1</i>), the ortholog of <i>FLC</i> in <i>A. alpina</i>, is similarly influenced by the duration of the exposure to cold. Extended vernalization results in stable silencing of <i>PEP1</i> in the inflorescence. In contrast, insufficient vernalization leads to <i>PEP1</i> reactivation after cold treatment, which correlates with delayed flowering and the appearance of floral reversion phenotypes such as bracts and vegetative inflorescence branches. Floral reversion phenotypes are reduced in the <i>pep1-1</i> mutant, suggesting that <i>PEP1</i> regulates the fate of the inflorescence after vernalization. The effect of vernalization duration on stable silencing of <i>PEP1</i> is specific to meristems that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ate flowering during cold treatment. Extended vernalization fails to silence <i>PEP1</i> in young seedlings and axillary branches that arise from buds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ated during cold treatment, which remain vegetative. We conclude that the duration of vernalization in <i>A. alpina</i> differentially regulates <i>PEP1</i> in the inflorescence and axillary branches. <i>PEP1</i> has a dual role regulating meristem fate; it prevents meristems from flowering and antagonizes inflorescence development after vernalization.</p>

Proliferation of Regulatory DNA Elements Derived from Transposable Elements in the Maize Genome
<p>Genomic regions free of nucleosomes, which are hypersensitive to DNase I digestion, are known as DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) and frequently contain cis-regulatory DNA elements. To investigate their prevalence and characteristics in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), we developed high-resolution genome-wide DHS maps using a modified DNase-seq technique. Maize DHSs exhibit depletion of nucleosomes and low levels of DNA methylation and are enriched with conserved noncoding sequences (CNSs). We developed a protoplast-based transient transformation assay to assess the potential gene expression enhancer and/or promoter functions associated with DHSs, which showed that more than 80% of DHSs overlapping with CNSs showed an enhancer function. Strikingly, nearly 25% of maize DHSs were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed from transposable elements (TEs), including both class I and class II transposons. Interestingly, TE-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed DHSs (teDHSs) homologous to retrotransposons were enriched with sequences related to the intrinsic cis-regulatory elements within the long terminal repeats of retrotransposons. We demonstrate that more than 80% of teDHSs can drive transcription of a reporter gene in protoplast assays. These results reveal the widespread occurrence of TE-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed cis-regulatory sequences and suggest that teDHSs play a major role in transcriptional regulation in maize.</p>

Carnosic Acid and Carnosol, Two Major Antioxidants of Rosemary, Act through Different Mechanisms
<p>Carnosic acid, a phenolic diterpene specific to the Lamiaceae family, is highly abundant in rosemary (<i>Rosmarinus officinalis</i>). Despite numerous industrial and medicinal/pharmaceutical applications of its antioxidative features, this compound in planta and its antioxidant mechanism have received little attention, except a few studies of rosemary plants under natural conditions. In vitro analyses, using high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet and luminescence imaging, revealed that carnosic acid and its major oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ative, carnosol, protect lipids from oxidation. Both compounds preserved linolenic acid and monogalactosyldiacylglycerol from singlet oxygen and from hydroxyl radical. When applied exogenously, they were both able to protect thylakoid membranes prepared from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves against lipid peroxidation. Different levels of carnosic acid and carnosol in two contrasting rosemary varieties correlated with tolerance to lipid peroxidation. Upon reactive oxygen species (ROS) oxidation of lipids, carnosic acid was consumed and oxidized into various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>atives, including into carnosol, while carnosol resisted, suggesting that carnosic acid is a chemical quencher of ROS. The antioxidative function of carnosol relies on another mechanism, occurring directly in the lipid oxidation process. Under oxidative conditions that did not involve ROS generation, carnosol inhibited lipid peroxidation, contrary to carnosic acid. Using spin probes and electron paramagnetic resonance detection, we confirmed that carnosic acid, rather than carnosol, is a ROS quencher. Various oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>atives of carnosic acid were detected in rosemary leaves in low light, indicating chronic oxidation of this compound, and accumulated in plants exposed to stress conditions, in parallel with a loss of carnosic acid, confirming that chemical quenching of ROS by carnosic acid takes place in planta.</p>

Different Routes for Conifer- and Sinapaldehyde and Higher Saccharification upon Deficiency in the Dehydrogenase CAD1
<p>In the search for renewable energy sources, genetic engineering is a promising strategy to improve plant cell wall composition for biofuel and bioproducts generation. Lignin is a major factor determining saccharification efficiency and, therefore, is a prime target to engineer. Here, lignin content and composition were modified in poplar (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus alba</i>) by specifically down-regulating <i>CINNAMYL ALCOHOL DEHYDROGENASE1</i> (<i>CAD1</i>) by a hairpin-RNA-mediated silencing approach, which resulted in only 5% residual <i>CAD1</i> transcript abundance. These transgenic lines showed no biomass penalty despite a 10% reduction in Klason lignin content and severe shifts in lignin composition. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and thioacidolysis revealed a strong increase (up to 20-fold) in sinapaldehyde incorporation into lignin, whereas coniferaldehyde was not increased markedly. Accordingly, ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based phenolic profiling revealed a more than 24,000-fold accumulation of a newly identified compound made from 8-8 coupling of two sinapaldehyde radicals. However, no additional cinnamaldehyde coupling products could be detected in the CAD1-deficient poplars. Instead, the transgenic lines accumulated a range of hydroxycinnamate-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed metabolites, of which the most prominent accumulation (over 8,500-fold) was observed for a compound that was identified by purification and nuclear magnetic resonance as syringyl lactic acid hexoside. Our data suggest that, upon down-regulation of <i>CAD1</i>, coniferaldehyde is converted into ferulic acid and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>atives, whereas sinapaldehyde is either oxidatively coupled into S′(8-8)S′ and lignin or converted to sinapic acid and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>atives. The most prominent sink of the increased flux to hydroxycinnamates is syringyl lactic acid hexoside. Furthermore, low-extent saccharification assays, under different pretreatment conditions, showed strongly increased glucose (up to +81%) and xylose (up to +153%) release, suggesting that down-regulating <i>CAD1</i> is a promising strategy for improving lignocellulosic biomass for the sugar platform industry.</p>

Construction and Optimization of a Large Gene Coexpression Network in Maize Using RNA-Seq Data
<p>With the emergence of massively parallel sequencing, genomewide expression data production has reached an unprecedented level. This abundance of data has greatly facilitated maize research, but may not be amenable to traditional analysis techniques that were optimized for other data types. Using publicly available data, a gene coexpression network (GCN) can be constructed and used for gene function prediction, candidate gene selection, and improving understanding of regulatory pathways. Several GCN studies have been done in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), mostly using microarray datasets. To build an optimal GCN from plant materials RNA-Seq data, parameters for expression data normalization and network <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infer</span></strong>ence were evaluated. A comprehensive evaluation of these two parameters and a ranked aggregation strategy on network performance, using libraries from 1266 maize samples, were conducted. Three normalization methods and 10 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infer</span></strong>ence methods, including six correlation and four mutual information methods, were tested. The three normalization methods had very similar performance. For network <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">infer</span></strong>ence, correlation methods performed better than mutual information methods at some genes. Increasing sample size also had a positive effect on GCN. Aggregating single networks together resulted in improved performance compared to single networks.</p>

A Single Arabidopsis Gene Encodes Two Differentially Targeted Geranylgeranyl Diphosphate Synthase Isoforms
<p>A wide diversity of isoprenoids is produced in different plant compartments. Most groups of isoprenoids synthesized in plastids, and some produced elsewhere in the plant cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>e from geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) synthesized by GGPP synthase (GGPPS) enzymes. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), five genes appear to encode GGPPS isoforms localized in plastids (two), the endoplasmic reticulum (two), and mitochondria (one). However, the loss of function of the plastid-targeted GGPPS11 isoform (referred to as G11) is sufficient to cause lethality. Here, we show that the absence of a strong transcription <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ation site in the <i>G11</i> gene results in the production of transcripts of different lengths. The longer transcripts encode an isoform with a functional plastid import sequence that produces GGPP for the major groups of photosynthesis-related plastidial isoprenoids. However, shorter transcripts are also produced that lack the first translation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ation codon and rely on a second in-frame ATG codon to produce an enzymatically active isoform lacking this N-terminal domain. This short enzyme localizes in the cytosol and is essential for embryo development. Our results confirm that the production of differentially targeted enzyme isoforms from the same gene is a central mechanism to control the biosynthesis of isoprenoid precursors in different plant cell compartments.</p>

Neurons and cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells as a model for mitochondrial defects in Friedreich’s ataxia
<p>Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA) is a recessive neurodegenerative disorder commonly associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. FRDA is due to expanded GAA repeats within the first intron of the gene encoding frataxin, a conserved mitochondrial protein involved in iron-sulphur cluster biosynthesis. This mutation leads to partial gene silencing and substantial reduction of the frataxin level. To overcome limitations of current cellular models of FRDA, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from two FRDA patients and successfully differentiated them into neurons and cardiomyocytes, two affected cell types in FRDA. All FRDA iPSC lines displayed expanded GAA alleles prone to high instability and decreased levels of frataxin, but no biochemical phenotype was observed. Interestingly, both FRDA iPSC-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed neurons and cardiomyocytes exhibited signs of impaired mitochondrial function, with decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and progressive mitochondrial degeneration, respectively. Our data show for the first time that FRDA iPSCs and their neuronal and cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>atives represent promising models for the study of mitochondrial damage and GAA expansion instability in FRDA.</p>

Extramacrochaetae imposes order on the <i>Drosophila</i> eye by refining the activity of the Hedgehog signaling gradient
<p>The compound eye of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> is configured by a differentiating wave, the morphogenetic furrow, that sweeps across the eye imaginal disc and transforms thousands of undifferentiated cells into a precisely ordered repetitive array of 800 ommatidia. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ation of the furrow at the posterior margin of the epithelium and its subsequent movement across the eye field is controlled by the activity of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. Differentiating photoreceptors that lie behind the furrow produce and secrete the Hh morphogen, which is captured by cells within the furrow itself. This leads to the stabilization of the full-length form of the zinc-finger transcription factor Cubitus interruptus (Ci<sup>155</sup>), the main effector of Hh signaling. Ci<sup>155</sup> functions as a transcriptional activator of a number of downstream targets, including <i>decapentaplegic</i> (<i>dpp</i>), a TGFβ homolog. In this report, we describe a mechanism that is in place within the fly retina to limit Hh pathway activity within and ahead of the furrow. We demonstrate that the helix-loop-helix (HLH) protein Extramacrochaetae (Emc) regulates Ci<sup>155</sup> levels. Loss of <i>emc</i> leads to an increase in Ci<sup>155</sup> levels, nuclear migration, apical cell constriction and an acceleration of the furrow. We find that these roles are distinct from the bHLH protein Hairy (H), which we show restricts <i>atonal</i> (<i>ato</i>) expression ahead of the furrow. Secondary furrow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ation along the dorsal and ventral margins is blocked by the activity of the Wingless (Wg) pathway. We also show that Emc regulates and cooperates with Wg signaling to inhibit lateral furrow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ation.</p>

Median time to first follow-up RHC was 4.6 months (interquartile range, 3.7–7.8 months). At first follow-up RHC (n=763), New York Heart Association functional class, 6-minute walk distance, stroke volume index (SVI), and right atrial pressure were independently associated with death or lung transplantation, adjusted for age, sex, and type of PAH.

Cardiac pressure overload resulted in a modest increase in c-kit-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed cardiomyocytes, with significant increases in the numbers of endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Doxorubicin-induced acute cardiotoxicity did not increase c-kit-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed endothelial cell fates but instead induced cardiomyocyte differentiation. Mechanistically, doxorubicin-induced DNA damage in c-kit<sup>+</sup> cells resulted in expression of p53. Inhibition of p53 blocked cardiomyocyte differentiation in response to doxorubicin, whereas stabilization of p53 was sufficient to increase c-kit-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed cardiomyocyte differentiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These results demonstrate that different pathological stimuli induce different cell fates of c-kit<sup>+</sup> cells in vivo. Although the overall rate of cardiomyocyte formation from c-kit<sup>+</sup> cells is still below clinically relevant levels, we show that p53 is central to the ability of c-kit<sup>+</sup> cells to adopt cardiomyocyte fates, which could lead to the development of strategies to preferentially generate cardiomyocytes from c-kit<sup>+</sup> cells.</p></sec>

Enhanced Therapeutic and Long-Term Dynamic Vascularization Effects of Human Pluripotent Stem Cell–Derived Endothelial Cells Encapsulated in a Nanomatrix Gel
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed endothelial cells (ECs) have limited clinical utility because of undefined components in the differentiation system and poor cell survival in vivo. Here, we aimed to develop a fully defined and clinically compatible system to differentiate hPSCs into ECs. Furthermore, we aimed to enhance cell survival, vessel formation, and therapeutic potential by encapsulating hPSC-ECs with a peptide amphiphile (PA) nanomatrix gel.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We induced differentiation of hPSCs into the mesodermal lineage by culturing on collagen-coated plates with a glycogen synthase kinase 3β inhibitor. Next, vascular endothelial growth factor, endothelial growth factor, and basic fibroblast growth factor were added for endothelial lineage differentiation, followed by sorting for CDH5 (VE-cadherin). We constructed an extracellular matrix–mimicking PA nanomatrix gel (PA-RGDS) by incorporating the cell adhesive ligand Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS) and a matrix metalloproteinase-2–degradable sequence. We then evaluated whether the encapsulation of hPSC-CDH5<sup>+</sup> cells in PA-RGDS could enhance long-term cell survival and vascular regenerative effects in a hind-limb ischemia model with laser Doppler perfusion imaging, bioluminescence imaging, real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction, and histological analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The resultant hPSC-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed CDH5<sup>+</sup> cells (hPSC-ECs) showed highly enriched and genuine EC characteristics and proangiogenic activities. When injected into ischemic hind limbs, hPSC-ECs showed better perfusion recovery and higher vessel-forming capacity compared with media-, PA-RGDS–, or human umbilical vein EC–injected groups. However, the group receiving the PA-RGDS–encapsulated hPSC-ECs showed better perfusion recovery, more robust and longer cell survival (> 10 months), and higher and prolonged angiogenic and vascular incorporation capabilities than the bare hPSC-EC–injected group. Surprisingly, the engrafted hPSC-ECs demonstrated previously unknown sustained and dynamic vessel-forming behavior: <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>al perivascular concentration, a guiding role for new vessel formation, and progressive incorporation into the vessels over 10 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We generated highly enriched hPSC-ECs via a clinically compatible system. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that a biocompatible PA-RGDS nanomatrix gel substantially improved long-term survival of hPSC-ECs in an ischemic environment and improved neovascularization effects of hPSC-ECs via prolonged and unique angiogenic and vessel-forming properties. This PA-RGDS–mediated transplantation of hPSC-ECs can serve as a novel platform for cell-based therapy and investigation of long-term behavior of hPSC-ECs.</p></sec>

EMC10 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Membrane Protein Complex Subunit 10) Is a Bone Marrow–Derived Angiogenic Growth Factor Promoting Tissue Repair After Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Clinical trials of bone marrow cell–based therapies after acute myocardial infarction (MI) have produced mostly neutral results. Treatment with specific bone marrow cell–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed secreted proteins may provide an alternative biological approach to improving tissue repair and heart function after MI. We recently performed a bioinformatic secretome analysis in bone marrow cells from patients with acute MI and discovered a poorly characterized secreted protein, EMC10 (endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein complex subunit 10), showing activity in an angiogenic screen.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We investigated the angiogenic potential of EMC10 and its mouse homolog (Emc10) in cultured endothelial cells and infarcted heart explants. We defined the cellular sources and function of Emc10 after MI using wild-type, <i>Emc10</i>-deficient, and <i>Emc10</i> bone marrow–chimeric mice subjected to transient coronary artery ligation. Furthermore, we explored the therapeutic potential of recombinant Emc10 delivered by osmotic minipumps after MI in heart failure–prone FVB/N mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Emc10 signaled through small GTPases, p21-activated kinase, and the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)–MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2) pathway to promote actin polymerization and endothelial cell migration. Confirming the importance of these signaling events in the context of acute MI, Emc10 stimulated endothelial cell outgrowth from infarcted mouse heart explants via p38 MAPK-MK2. Emc10 protein abundance was increased in the infarcted region of the left ventricle and in the circulation of wild-type mice after MI. Emc10 expression was also increased in left ventricular tissue samples from patients with acute MI. Bone marrow–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed monocytes and macrophages were the predominant sources of Emc10 in the infarcted murine heart. <i>Emc10</i> KO mice showed no cardiovascular phenotype at baseline. After MI, however, capillarization of the infarct border zone was impaired in KO mice, and the animals developed larger infarct scars and more pronounced left ventricular remodeling compared with wild-type mice. Transplanting KO mice with wild-type bone marrow cells rescued the angiogenic defect and ameliorated left ventricular remodeling. Treating FVB/N mice with recombinant Emc10 enhanced infarct border-zone capillarization and exerted a sustained beneficial effect on left ventricular remodeling.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We have identified Emc10 as a previously unknown angiogenic growth factor that is produced by bone marrow–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed monocytes and macrophages as part of an endogenous adaptive response that can be enhanced therapeutically to repair the heart after MI.</p></sec>

Genetic Obesity and the Risk of Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Observational studies have identified an association between body mass index (BMI) and incident atrial fibrillation (AF). Inferring causality from observational studies, however, is subject to residual confounding, reverse causation, and bias. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the causal association between BMI and AF by using genetic predictors of BMI.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We identified 51 646 individuals of European ancestry without AF at baseline from 7 prospective population-based cohorts <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ated between 1987 and 2002 in the United States, Iceland, and the Netherlands with incident AF ascertained between 1987 and 2012. Cohort-specific mean follow-up ranged from 7.4 to 19.2 years, over which period there was a total of 4178 cases of incident AF. We performed a Mendelian randomization with instrumental variable analysis to estimate a cohort-specific causal hazard ratio for the association between BMI and AF. Two genetic instruments for BMI were used: <i>FTO</i> genotype (rs1558902) and a BMI gene score comprising 39 single-nucleotide polymorphisms identified by genome-wide association studies to be associated with BMI. Cohort-specific estimates were combined by random-effects, inverse variance–weighted meta-analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In age- and sex-adjusted meta-analysis, both genetic instruments were significantly associated with BMI (<i>FTO</i>: 0.43 [95% confidence interval, 0.32–0.54] kg/m<sup>2</sup> per A-allele, <i>P</i><0.001; BMI gene score: 1.05 [95% confidence interval, 0.90–1.20] kg/m<sup>2</sup> per 1-U increase, <i>P</i><0.001) and incident AF (<i>FTO</i>, hazard ratio, 1.07 [1.02–1.11] per A-allele, <i>P</i>=0.004; BMI gene score, hazard ratio, 1.11 [1.05–1.18] per 1-U increase, <i>P</i><0.001). Age- and sex-adjusted instrumental variable estimates for the causal association between BMI and incident AF were hazard ratio, 1.15 (1.04–1.26) per kg/m<sup>2</sup>, <i>P</i>=0.005 (<i>FTO</i>) and 1.11 (1.05–1.17) per kg/m<sup>2</sup>, <i>P</i><0.001 (BMI gene score). Both of these estimates were consistent with the meta-analyzed estimate between observed BMI and AF (age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio 1.05 [1.04–1.06] per kg/m<sup>2</sup>, <i>P</i><0.001). Multivariable adjustment did not significantly change findings.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our data are consistent with a causal relationship between BMI and incident AF. These data support the possibility that public health <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>atives targeting primordial prevention of obesity may reduce the incidence of AF.</p></sec>

Endothelial Microparticles From Acute Coronary Syndrome Patients Induce Premature Coronary Artery Endothelial Cell Aging and Thrombogenicity
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Microparticles (MPs) have emerged as a surrogate marker of endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular risk. This study examined the potential of MPs from senescent endothelial cells (ECs) or from patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) to promote premature EC aging and thrombogenicity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Primary porcine coronary ECs were isolated from the left circumflex coronary artery. MPs were prepared from ECs and venous blood from patients with ACS (n=30) and from healthy volunteers (n=4) by sequential centrifugation. The level of endothelial senescence was assessed as senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity using flow cytometry, oxidative stress using the redox-sensitive probe dihydroethidium, tissue factor activity using an enzymatic Tenase assay, the level of target protein expression by Western blot analysis, platelet aggregation using an aggregometer, and shear stress using a cone-and-plate viscometer.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Senescence, as assessed by senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, was induced by the passaging of porcine coronary artery ECs from passage P1 to P4, and was associated with a progressive shedding of procoagulant MPs. Exposure of P1 ECs to MPs shed from senescent P3 cells or circulating MPs from ACS patients induced increased senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, oxidative stress, early phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and Akt, and upregulation of p53, p21, and p16. Ex vivo, the prosenescent effect of circulating MPs from ACS patients was evidenced only under conditions of low shear stress. Depletion of endothelial-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed MPs from ACS patients reduced the induction of senescence. Prosenescent MPs promoted EC thrombogenicity through tissue factor upregulation, shedding of procoagulant MPs, endothelial nitric oxide synthase downregulation, and reduced nitric oxide–mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation. These MPs exhibited angiotensin-converting enzyme activity and upregulated AT1 receptors and angiotensin-converting enzyme in P1 ECs. Losartan, an AT1 receptor antagonist, and inhibitors of either mitogen-activated protein kinases or phosphoinositide 3-kinase prevented the MP-induced endothelial senescence.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These findings indicate that endothelial-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed MPs from ACS patients induce premature endothelial senescence under atheroprone low shear stress and thrombogenicity through angiotensin II–induced redox-sensitive activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt. They further suggest that targeting endothelial-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed MP shedding and their bioactivity may be a promising therapeutic strategy to limit the development of an endothelial dysfunction post-ACS.</p></sec>

Defined Engineered Human Myocardium With Advanced Maturation for Applications in Heart Failure Modeling and Repair
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Advancing structural and functional maturation of stem cell–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed cardiomyocytes remains a key challenge for applications in disease modeling, drug screening, and heart repair. Here, we sought to advance cardiomyocyte maturation in engineered human myocardium (EHM) toward an adult phenotype under defined conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We systematically investigated cell composition, matrix, and media conditions to generate EHM from embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cell–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts with organotypic functionality under serum-free conditions. We used morphological, functional, and transcriptome analyses to benchmark maturation of EHM.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>EHM demonstrated important structural and functional properties of postnatal myocardium, including: (1) rod-shaped cardiomyocytes with M bands assembled as a functional syncytium; (2) systolic twitch forces at a similar level as observed in bona fide postnatal myocardium; (3) a positive force-frequency response; (4) inotropic responses to β-adrenergic stimulation mediated via canonical β<sub>1</sub>- and β<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor signaling pathways; and (5) evidence for advanced molecular maturation by transcriptome profiling. EHM responded to chronic catecholamine toxicity with contractile dysfunction, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, cardiomyocyte death, and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide release; all are classical hallmarks of heart failure. In addition, we demonstrate the scalability of EHM according to anticipated clinical demands for cardiac repair.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We provide proof-of-concept for a universally applicable technology for the engineering of macroscale human myocardium for disease modeling and heart repair from embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cell–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed cardiomyocytes under defined, serum-free conditions.</p></sec>

Existence, Functional Impairment, and Lung Repair Potential of Endothelial Colony-Forming Cells in Oxygen-Induced Arrested Alveolar Growth
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Bronchopulmonary dysplasia and emphysema are life-threatening diseases resulting from impaired alveolar development or alveolar destruction. Both conditions lack effective therapies. Angiogenic growth factors promote alveolar growth and contribute to alveolar maintenance. Endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) represent a subset of circulating and resident endothelial cells capable of self-renewal and de novo vessel formation. We hypothesized that resident ECFCs exist in the developing lung, that they are impaired during arrested alveolar growth in experimental bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and that exogenous ECFCs restore disrupted alveolar growth.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Human fetal and neonatal rat lungs contain ECFCs with robust proliferative potential, secondary colony formation on replating, and de novo blood vessel formation in vivo when transplanted into immunodeficient mice. In contrast, human fetal lung ECFCs exposed to hyperoxia in vitro and neonatal rat ECFCs isolated from hyperoxic alveolar growth–arrested rat lungs mimicking bronchopulmonary dysplasia proliferated less, showed decreased clonogenic capacity, and formed fewer capillary-like networks. Intrajugular administration of human cord blood–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed ECFCs after established arrested alveolar growth restored lung function, alveolar and lung vascular growth, and attenuated pulmonary hypertension. Lung ECFC colony- and capillary-like network-forming capabilities were also restored. Low ECFC engraftment and the protective effect of cell-free ECFC-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed conditioned media suggest a paracrine effect. Long-term (10 months) assessment of ECFC therapy showed no adverse effects with persistent improvement in lung structure, exercise capacity, and pulmonary hypertension.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Impaired ECFC function may contribute to arrested alveolar growth. Cord blood–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed ECFC therapy may offer new therapeutic options for lung diseases characterized by alveolar damage.</p></sec>

Drug Screening Using a Library of Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell–Derived Cardiomyocytes Reveals Disease-Specific Patterns of Cardiotoxicity
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Cardiotoxicity is a leading cause for drug attrition during pharmaceutical development and has resulted in numerous preventable patient deaths. Incidents of adverse cardiac drug reactions are more common in patients with preexisting heart disease than the general population. Here we generated a library of human induced pluripotent stem cell–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) from patients with various hereditary cardiac disorders to model differences in cardiac drug toxicity susceptibility for patients of different genetic backgrounds.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Action potential duration and drug-induced arrhythmia were measured at the single cell level in hiPSC-CMs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed from healthy subjects and patients with hereditary long QT syndrome, familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and familial dilated cardiomyopathy. Disease phenotypes were verified in long QT syndrome, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and dilated cardiomyopathy hiPSC-CMs by immunostaining and single cell patch clamp. Human embryonic stem cell–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deriv</span></strong>ed cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) and the human <i>ether-a-go-go</i>–related gene expressing human embryonic kidney cells were used as controls. Single cell PCR confirmed expression of all cardiac ion channels in patient-specific hiPSC-CMs as well as hESC-CMs, but not in human embryonic kidney cells. Disease-specific hiPSC-CMs demonstrated increased susceptibility to known cardiotoxic drugs as measured by action potential duration and quantification of drug-induced arrhythmias such as early afterdepolarizations and delayed afterdepolarizations.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>We have recapitulated drug-induced cardiotoxicity profiles for healthy subjects, long QT syndrome, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and dilated cardiomyopathy patients at the single cell level for the first time. Our data indicate that healthy and diseased individuals exhibit different susceptibilities to cardiotoxic drugs and that use of disease-specific hiPSC-CMs may predict adverse drug responses more accurately than the standard human <i>ether-a-go-go</i>–related gene test or healthy control hiPSC-CM/hESC-CM screening assays.</p></sec>

Acute Aortic Dissection Determines the Fate of Initially Untreated Aortic Segments in Marfan Syndrome
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>The aim of the current study was to investigate incidence and causes of surgical interventions in primarily nontreated aortic segments after previous aortic repair in patients with Marfan syndrome.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Retrospective analysis of 86 consecutive Marfan syndrome patients fulfilling Ghent criteria that underwent 136 aortic surgeries and were followed at this institution in the past 15 years. Mean follow-up was 8.8±6.8 y. Thirty-day, 6-month, 1-year, and overall mortality was 3.5%, 5.8%, 7.0%, and 12.8%, respectively. Ninety-two percent of patients <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ally presented with aortic root, ascending aortic or arch lesions, whereas 8% presented with descending aortic or thoraco-abdominal lesions. Primary presentation was acute aortic dissection (AAD) in 36% (77% type A, 23% type B) and aneurismal disease in 64%. Secondary complete arch replacement had to be performed in only 6% of patients without AAD, but in 36% with AAD (<i>P</i>=0.0005). In patients without AAD, 11% required surgery on primarily nontreated aortic segments (5 of 6 patients experienced type B dissection during follow-up), whereas in patients after AAD, 48% underwent surgery of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ally nontreated aortic segments (42% of patients with type A and 86% of those with type B dissection; <i>P</i>=0.0002).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>The need for surgery in primarily nontreated aortic segments is precipitated by an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>al presentation with AAD. Early elective surgery is associated with low mortality and reintervention rates. Type B dissection in patients with Marfan syndrome is associated with a high need for extensive aortic repair, even if the dissection is being considered uncomplicated by conventional criteria.</p></sec>

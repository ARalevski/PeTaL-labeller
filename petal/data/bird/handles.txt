Thirst-associated preoptic neurons encode an aversive motivational drive
<p>Water deprivation produces a drive to seek and consume water. How neural activity creates this motivation remains poorly understood. We used activity-dependent genetic labeling to characterize neurons activated by water deprivation in the hypothalamic median preoptic nucleus (MnPO). Single-cell transcriptional profiling revealed that dehydration-activated MnPO neurons consist of a single excitatory cell type. After optogenetic activation of these neurons, mice drank water and performed an operant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lever</span></strong>-pressing task for water reward with rates that scaled with stimulation frequency. This stimulation was aversive, and instrumentally pausing stimulation could reinforce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lever</span></strong>-pressing. Activity of these neurons gradually decreased over the course of an operant session. Thus, the activity of dehydration-activated MnPO neurons establishes a scalable, persistent, and aversive internal state that dynamically controls thirst-motivated behavior.</p>

A comparison study of stem taper material loss at similar and mixed metal head-neck taper junctions
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We sought to determine whether cobalt-chromium alloy (CoCr) femoral   stem tapers (trunnions) wear more than titanium (Ti) alloy stem   tapers (trunnions) when used in a large diameter (LD) metal-on-metal   (MoM) hip arthroplasty system.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We performed explant analysis using validated methodology to   determine the volumetric material loss at the taper surfaces of   explanted LD CoCr MoM hip arthroplasties used with either a Ti alloy   (n = 28) or CoCr femoral stem (n = 21). Only 12/14 taper constructs   with a rough male taper surface and a nominal included angle close   to 5.666° were included. Multiple regression modelling was undertaken   using taper angle, taper roughness, bearing diameter (horizontal   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lever</span></strong> arm) as independent variables. Material loss was mapped using   a coordinate measuring machine, profilometry and scanning electron   microscopy.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>After adjustment for other factors, CoCr stem tapers were found   to have significantly greater volumetric material loss than the   equivalent Ti stem tapers.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>When taper junction damage is identified during revision of a   LD MoM hip, it should be suspected that a male taper composed of   a standard CoCr alloy has sustained significant changes to the taper   cone geometry which are likely to be more extensive than those affecting   a Ti alloy stem.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1304–12.</p></sec>

Integrated Consensus Map of Cultivated Peanut and Wild Relatives Reveals Structures of the A and B Genomes of <i>Arachis</i> and Divergence of the Legume Genomes
<p>The complex, tetraploid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e structure of peanut (<i>Arachis hypogaea</i>) has obstructed advances in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ics and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics in the species. The aim of this study is to understand the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e structure of <i>Arachis</i> by developing a high-density integrated consensus map. Three recombinant inbred line populations derived from crosses between the A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e diploid species, <i>Arachis duranensis</i> and <i>Arachis stenosperma</i>; the B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e diploid species, <i>Arachis ipaënsis</i> and <i>Arachis magna</i>; and between the AB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e tetraploids, <i>A. hypogaea</i> and an artificial amphidiploid (<i>A. ipaënsis</i> × <i>A. duranensis</i>)<sup>4×</sup>, were used to construct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic linkage maps: 10 linkage groups (LGs) of 544 cM with 597 loci for the A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e; 10 LGs of 461 cM with 798 loci for the B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e; and 20 LGs of 1442 cM with 1469 loci for the AB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. The resultant maps plus 13 published maps were integrated into a consensus map covering 2651 cM with 3693 marker loci which was anchored to 20 consensus LGs corresponding to the A and B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. The comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequences of <i>Cajanus cajan</i>, <i>Glycine max</i>, <i>Lotus japonicus</i>, and <i>Medicago truncatula</i> revealed that the <i>Arachis</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e has segmented synteny relationship to the other legumes. The comparative maps in legumes, integrated tetraploid consensus maps, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-specific diploid maps will increase the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic understanding of <i>Arachis</i> and should facilitate molecular breeding.</p>

Old but Not (So) Degenerated—Slow Evolution of Largely Homomorphic Sex Chromosomes in Ratites
<p>Degeneration of the nonrecombining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e is a common feature of sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e evolution, readily evident by the presence of a pair of largely heteromorphic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es, like in eutherian mammals and birds. However, in ratites (order Palaeognathae, including, e.g., ostrich), the Z and W <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es are similar in size and largely undifferentiated, despite avian sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e evolution was initiated > 130 Ma. To better understand what may limit sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e evolution, we performed ostrich transcriptome sequencing and studied genes from the nonrecombining region of the W <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e. Fourteen gametologous gene pairs present on the W <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e and Z <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e were identified, with synonymous sequence divergence of 0.027–0.177. The location of these genes on the Z <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e was consistent with a sequential increase in divergence, starting 110–157 and ending 24–30 Ma. On the basis of the occurrence of Z-linked genes hemizygous in females, we estimate that about one-third of the Z <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e does not recombine with the W <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e in female meiosis. Pairwise <i>d</i><sub>N</sub><i>/d</i><sub>S</sub> between gametologs decreased with age, suggesting strong evolutionary constraint in old gametologs. Lineage-specific <i>d</i><sub>N</sub><i>/d</i><sub>S</sub> was consistently higher in W-linked genes, in accordance with the lower efficacy of selection expected in nonrecombining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es. A higher ratio of GC > AT:AT > GC substitutions in W-linked genes supports a role for GC-biased gene conversion in differentially driving base composition on the two sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es. A male-to-female (M:F) expression ratio of close to one for recombining genes and close to two for Z-linked genes lacking a W copy show that dosage compensation is essentially absent. Some gametologous genes have retained active expression of the W copy in females (giving a M:F ratio of 1 for the gametologous gene pair), whereas for others W expression has become severely reduced resulting in a M:F ratio of close to 2. These observations resemble the patterns of sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e evolution seen in other avian and mammalian lineages, suggesting similar underlying evolutionary processes, although the rate of sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e differentiation has been atypically low. Lack of dosage compensation may be a factor hindering sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e evolution in this lineage.</p>

Truncation- and motif-based pan-cancer analysis reveals tumor-suppressing kinases
<p>A major challenge in cancer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics is identifying “driver” <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions from the many neutral “passenger” <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions within a given tumor. To identify driver <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions that would otherwise be lost within <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional noise, we filtered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic data by motifs that are critical for kinase activity. In the first step of our screen, we used data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and The Cancer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e Atlas to identify kinases with truncation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions occurring within or before the kinase domain. The top 30 tumor-suppressing kinases were aligned, and hotspots for loss-of-function (LOF) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions were identified on the basis of amino acid conservation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional frequency. The functional consequences of new LOF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions were biochemically validated, and the top 15 hotspot LOF residues were used in a pan-cancer analysis to define the tumor-suppressing kinome. A ranked list revealed MAP2K7, an essential mediator of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, as a candidate tumor suppressor in gastric cancer, despite its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional frequency falling within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional noise for this cancer type. The majority of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in MAP2K7 abolished its catalytic activity, and reactivation of the JNK pathway in gastric cancer cells harboring LOF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in MAP2K7 or the downstream kinase JNK suppressed clonogenicity and growth in soft agar, demonstrating the functional relevance of inactivating the JNK pathway in gastric cancer. Together, our data highlight a broadly applicable strategy to identify functional cancer driver <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions and define the JNK pathway as tumor-suppressive in gastric cancer.</p>

The paradox of mutations and cancer
<p>The past decade has witnessed the cataloging of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in cancer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es, providing new insights into how and in what ways cancer can develop and spread (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). The focus has been on defining specific “driver” <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic errors in cancer cells that reveal basic biological processes gone awry that are required for cancer initiation and progression. These drivers are the target of new therapies—this concept is central to precision oncology efforts to treat patients according to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic changes that are present in their tumors (<i>3</i>). Along the way, it has also become apparent that cancer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es harbor many additional “passenger” <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions (<i>4</i>). Patterns of driver and passenger DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions derived from cancer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es have provided clues about the different ways that cancer can manifest as a disease of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions (<i>5</i>, <i>6</i>). In some circumstances, they can be linked to strong environmental carcinogens (for example, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion patterns caused by tobacco smoke, ultraviolet radiation, or the fungal toxin aflatoxin) (<i>7</i>). Moreover, these forensic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional patterns can be used to estimate how long it has taken for a tumor to develop (<i>5</i>). On page 911 of this issue, Martincorena <i>et al.</i> (<i>8</i>) turned their attention toward the detection of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in normal tissue, addressing a long-standing paradox that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions arise in normal tissues but do not necessarily lead to cancer.</p>

TZAP: A telomere-associated protein involved in telomere length control
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">telomer</span></strong>es are found at the end of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es and are important for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e stability. Here we describe a specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">telomer</span></strong>e-associated protein: TZAP (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">telomer</span></strong>ic zinc finger–associated protein). TZAP binds preferentially to long <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">telomer</span></strong>es that have a low concentration of shelterin complex, competing with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">telomer</span></strong>ic-repeat binding factors TRF1 and TRF2. When localized at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">telomer</span></strong>es, TZAP triggers a process known as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">telomer</span></strong>e trimming, which results in the rapid deletion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">telomer</span></strong>ic repeats. On the basis of these results, we propose a model for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">telomer</span></strong>e length regulation in mammalian cells: The reduced concentration of the shelterin complex at long <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">telomer</span></strong>es results in TZAP binding and initiation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">telomer</span></strong>e trimming. Binding of TZAP to long <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">telomer</span></strong>es represents the switch that triggers <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">telomer</span></strong>e trimming, setting the upper limit of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">telomer</span></strong>e length.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Healthy Roots and Leaves: Comparative Genome Structure of Horseradish and Watercress
<p>Horseradish (<i>Armoracia rusticana</i>) and watercress (<i>Nasturtium officinale</i>) are economically important cruciferous vegetable species with limited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic resources. We used comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e painting to identify the extent of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>al collinearity between horseradish and watercress, and to reconstruct the origin and evolution of the two tetraploid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es (2<i>n</i> = 4<i>x</i> = 32). Our results show that horseradish and watercress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es originated from a common ancestral (<i>n</i> = 8) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e, structurally resembling the Ancestral Crucifer Karyotype (<i>n</i> = 8), which, however, contained two unique translocation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es (AK6/8 and AK8/6). Except for a 2.4-Mb unequal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e translocation in watercress, both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es are structurally identical. The structural similarity of the two parental sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es might suggest an autotetraploid origin of horseradish and watercress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. The sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e stasis, apart from the single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e translocation, indicates that homeologous recombination played a limited role in postpolyploid evolution in both tetraploid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. The octoploid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e of one-rowed watercress (<i>N. microphyllum</i>, 2<i>n</i> = 8<i>x</i> = 64), structurally mirroring the tetraploid horseradish and watercress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es, originated via autopolyploidization from the immediate tetraploid predecessor of watercress or hybridization between this and another now-extinct tetraploid <i>Nasturtium</i> species. These comparative cyto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic maps in horseradish and watercress represent a first stepping stone for future whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequencing efforts and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic improvement of both crop species.</p>

Genome-Wide Biases in the Rate and Molecular Spectrum of Spontaneous Mutations in <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> and <i>Vibrio fischeri</i>
<p>The vast diversity in nucleotide composition and architecture among bacterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es may be partly explained by inherent biases in the rates and spectra of spontaneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions. Bacterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es with multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es are relatively unusual but some are relevant to human health, none more so than the causative agent of cholera, <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>. Here, we present the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-wide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion spectra in wild-type and mismatch repair (MMR) defective backgrounds of two <i>Vibrio</i> species, the low-%GC squid symbiont <i>V. fischeri</i> and the pathogen <i>V. cholerae</i>, collected under conditions that greatly minimize the efficiency of natural selection. In apparent contrast to their high diversity in nature, both wild-type <i>V. fischeri</i> and <i>V. cholerae</i> have among the lowest rates for base-substitution <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions (bpsms) and insertion–deletion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions (indels) that have been measured, below 10<sup>−</sup><sup>3</sup>/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e/generation. <i>Vibrio fischeri</i> and <i>V. cholerae</i> have distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion spectra, but both are AT-biased and produce a surprising number of multi-nucleotide indels. Furthermore, the loss of a functional MMR system caused the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion spectra of these species to converge, implying that the MMR system itself contributes to species-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion patterns. Bpsm and indel rates varied among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e regions, but do not explain the more rapid evolutionary rates of genes on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e 2, which likely result from weaker purifying selection. More generally, the very low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rates of <i>Vibrio</i> species correlate inversely with their immense population sizes and suggest that selection may not only have maximized replication fidelity but also optimized other polygenic traits relative to the constraints of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic drift.</p>

Phenotypic Characterization of <i>EIF2AK4</i> Mutation Carriers in a Large Cohort of Patients Diagnosed Clinically With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare disease with an emerging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic basis. Heterozygous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in the gene encoding the bone morpho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic protein receptor type 2 (<i>BMPR2</i>) are the commonest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic cause of PAH, whereas biallelic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 4 gene (<i>EIF2AK4</i>) are described in pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis.

Biallelic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in <i>EIF2AK4</i> were identified in 5 patients with a clinical diagnosis of pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis. Furthermore, 9 patients with a clinical diagnosis of PAH carried biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions. These patients had a reduced transfer coefficient for carbon monoxide (K<sc>co</sc>; 33% [interquartile range, 30%–35%] predicted) and younger age at diagnosis (29 years; interquartile range, 23–38 years) and more interlobular septal thickening and mediastinal lymphadenopathy on computed tomography of the chest compared with patients with PAH without <i>EIF2AK4</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions.

Progressive Recombination Suppression and Differentiation in Recently Evolved Neo-sex Chromosomes
<p>Recombination suppression leads to the structural and functional differentiation of sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es and is thus a crucial step in the process of sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e evolution. Despite extensive theoretical work, the exact processes and mechanisms of recombination suppression and differentiation are not well understood. In threespine sticklebacks (<i>Gasterosteus aculeatus</i>), a different sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e system has recently evolved by a fusion between the Y <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e and an autosome in the Japan Sea lineage, which diverged from the ancestor of other lineages approximately 2 Ma. We investigated the evolutionary dynamics and differentiation processes of sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es based on comparative analyses of these divergent lineages using 63 microsatellite loci. Both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e-wide differentiation patterns and phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic inferences with X and Y alleles indicated that the ancestral sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es were extensively differentiated before the divergence of these lineages. In contrast, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic differentiation appeared to have proceeded only in a small region of the neo-sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es. The recombination maps constructed for the Japan Sea lineage indicated that recombination has been suppressed or reduced over a large region spanning the ancestral and neo-sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>al regions exhibiting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic differentiation and suppressed or reduced recombination were detected continuously and sequentially in the neo-sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es, suggesting that differentiation has gradually spread from the fusion point following the extension of recombination suppression. Our study illustrates an ongoing process of sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e differentiation, providing empirical support for the theoretical model postulating that recombination suppression and differentiation proceed in a gradual manner in the very early stage of sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e evolution.</p>

Tree Physiology
Revisiting the sequencing of the first tree genome: <i>Populus trichocarpa</i>
<p>Ten years ago, it was announced that the Joint <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e Institute with funds provided by the Department of Energy, Office of Science, Biological and Environmental Research would sequence the black cottonwood (<i>Populus trichocarpa</i> Torr. & Gray) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. This landmark decision was the culmination of work by the forest science community to develop <i>Populus</i> as a model system. Since its public release in late 2006, the availability of the <i>Populus</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e has spawned research in plant biology, morphology, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ics and ecology. Here we address how the tree physiologist has used this resource. More specifically, we revisit our earlier contention that the rewards of sequencing the <i>Populus</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e would depend on how quickly scientists working with woody perennials could adopt molecular approaches to investigate the mechanistic underpinnings of basic physiological processes. Several examples illustrate the integration of functional and comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics into the forest sciences, especially in areas that target improved understanding of the developmental differences between woody perennials and herbaceous annuals (e.g., phase transitions). Sequencing the <i>Populus</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e and the availability of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic resources has also been instrumental in identifying candidate genes that underlie physiological and morphological traits of interest. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-enabled research has advanced our understanding of how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>e and genotype are related and provided insights into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic mechanisms whereby woody perennials adapt to environmental stress. In the future, we anticipate that low-cost, high-throughput sequencing will continue to facilitate research in tree physiology and enhance our understanding at scales of individual organisms and populations. A challenge remains, however, as to how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic resources, including the <i>Populus</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e, can be used to understand ecosystem function. Although examples are limited, progress in this area is encouraging and will undoubtedly improve as future research targets the many unique aspects of <i>Populus</i> as a keystone species in terrestrial ecosystems.</p>

Global Analysis of Gene Expression in Response to Whole-Chromosome Aneuploidy in Hexaploid Wheat
<p>Aneuploidy, a condition of unbalanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e content, represents a large-effect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion that bears significant relevance to human health and microbe adaptation. As such, extensive studies of aneuploidy have been conducted in unicellular model organisms and cancer cells. Aneuploidy also frequently is associated with plant polyploidization, but its impact on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene express</span></strong>ion and its relevance to polyploid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e evolution/functional innovation remain largely unknown. Here, we used a panel of diverse types of whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e aneuploidy of hexaploid wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>), all under the common <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic background of cv Chinese Spring, to systemically investigate the impact of aneuploidy on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-, sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e-wide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene express</span></strong>ion. Compared with prior findings in haploid or diploid aneuploid systems, we unravel additional and novel features of alteration in global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene express</span></strong>ion resulting from the two major impacts of aneuploidy, cis- and trans-regulation, as well as dosage compensation. We show that the expression-altered genes map evenly along each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e, with no evidence for coregulating aggregated expression domains. However, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es and sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es in hexaploid wheat are unequal in their responses to aneuploidy with respect to the number of genes being dysregulated. Strikingly, homeologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es do not differ from nonhomologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es in terms of aneuploidy-induced trans-acting effects, suggesting that the three constituent sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es of hexaploid wheat are largely uncoupled at the transcriptional level of gene regulation. Together, our findings shed new insights into the functional interplay between homeologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es and interactions between sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es in hexaploid wheat, which bear implications to further our understanding of allopolyploid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e evolution and efforts in breeding new allopolyploid crops.</p>

Spontaneous Mutation Accumulation in <i>Daphnia pulex</i> in Selection-Free vs. Competitive Environments
<p>Understanding the rates, spectra, and fitness effects of spontaneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions is fundamental to answering key questions in evolution, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecular biolog</span></strong>y, disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ics, and conservation biology. To estimate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rates and evaluate the effect of selection on new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions, we propagated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion accumulation (MA) lines of <i>Daphnia pulex</i> for more than 82 generations and maintained a non-MA population under conditions where selection could act. Both experiments were started with the same obligate asexual progenitor clone. By sequencing 30 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es and implementing a series of validation steps that informed the bioinformatic analyses, we identified a total of 477 single nucleotide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions (SNMs) in the MA lines, corresponding to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rate of 2.30 × 10<sup>−9</sup> (95% CI 1.90–2.70 × 10<sup>−9</sup>) per nucleotide per generation. The high overall rate of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of 4.82 × 10<sup>−5</sup> per site per generation was due to a large ameiotic recombination event spanning an entire arm of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e (∼6 Mb) and several hemizygous deletion events spanning ∼2 kb each. In the non-MA population, we found significantly fewer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions than expected based on the rate derived from the MA experiment, indicating purifying selection was likely acting to remove new deleterious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions. We observed a surprisingly high level of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic variability in the non-MA population, which we propose to be driven by balancing selection. Our findings suggest that both positive and negative selection on new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions is powerful and effective in a strictly clonal population.</p>

The chromatin of cancer
<p>Developments in modern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics tools have led to rapid progress in our understanding of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic basis of cancer. Recent large-scale efforts have primarily focused on two types of analysis: mapping acquired somatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions by whole-exome and whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequencing (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>), and identification of common inherited variants that increase cancer risk using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-wide association studies (GWAS) (<i>3</i>). Despite the power of these technologies, we are still far from understanding how the variants and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions found in individual tumors precisely drive the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>ic process. A large number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic variants increase risk for cancer, but most explain only a very small fraction of the risk. Furthermore, although acquired somatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions are found in almost all tumors, most do not carry complete sets of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions that, according to our present mechanistic understanding, would be sufficient to cause cancer. On page 420 of this issue, Corces <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) show how a third type of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics approach—functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic analyses of primary human tumors—can begin to bridge this gap in our mechanistic understanding of the tumorigenic process.</p>

Competing chromosomes explain junk DNA
<p>The vast majority of eukaryotes have two copies of each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e and reproduce sexually. Meiosis is a vital process that produces gametes (eggs and sperm) by reducing the number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e copies to one; fertilization between egg and sperm restores the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e copy number to two. During female meiosis, one set of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es is expelled into a tiny cell called a polar body, whereas the other is segregated into the egg. It is a fundamental tenet of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ics that there is a random, 50% chance for any particular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e to be segregated into the egg versus the polar body. However, cases in which one copy of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e is inherited with greater than 50% frequency have been reported in many species (<i>1</i>), but the molecular mechanism of this preferential inheritance has remained obscure. Recent work has indicated that centromeres, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>al regions that form attachments to microtubules that mediate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e segregation during meiosis, compete with each other for inheritance during female meiosis (<i>2</i>). Thus, the essential DNA sequences that mediate accurate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e segregation are actually “selfish” (or parasitic) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic elements that have invaded our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. On page 668 of this issue, Akera <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) provide the most detailed molecular mechanism to date that explains how a parasitic DNA sequence has used the asymmetry of oocyte meiosis to ensure its own inheritance and therefore its spread through populations.</p>

The Genetic Basis of Plant Architecture in 10 Maize Recombinant Inbred Line Populations
<p>Plant architecture is a key factor affecting planting density and grain yield in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). However, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic mechanisms underlying plant architecture in diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic backgrounds have not been fully addressed. Here, we performed a large-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ing of 10 plant architecture-related traits and dissected the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic loci controlling these traits in 10 recombinant inbred line populations derived from 14 diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic backgrounds. Nearly 800 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with major and minor effects were identified as contributing to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ic variation of plant architecture-related traits. Ninety-two percent of these QTLs were detected in only one population, confirming the diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic backgrounds of the mapping populations and the prevalence of rare alleles in maize. The numbers and effects of QTLs are positively associated with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ic variation in the population, which, in turn, correlates positively with parental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic variations. A large proportion (38.5%) of QTLs was associated with at least two traits, suggestive of the frequent occurrence of pleiotropic loci or closely linked loci. Key developmental genes, which previously were shown to affect plant architecture in mutant studies, were found to colocalize with many QTLs. Five QTLs were further validated using the segregating populations developed from residual heterozygous lines present in the recombinant inbred line populations. Additionally, one new plant height QTL, <i>qPH3</i>, has been fine-mapped to a 600-kb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic region where three candidate genes are located. These results provide insights into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic mechanisms controlling plant architecture and will benefit the selection of ideal plant architecture in maize breeding.</p>

Direct Determination of the Mutation Rate in the Bumblebee Reveals Evidence for Weak Recombination-Associated Mutation and an Approximate Rate Constancy in Insects
<p>Accurate knowledge of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rate provides a base line for inferring expected rates of evolution, for testing evolutionary hypotheses and for estimation of key parameters. Advances in sequencing technology now permit direct estimates of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rate from sequencing of close relatives. Within insects there have been three prior such estimates, two in nonsocial insects (<i>Drosophila</i>: 2.8 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> per bp per haploid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e per generation; <i>Heliconius</i>: 2.9 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>) and one in a social species, the honeybee (3.4 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>). Might the honeybee’s rate be ∼20% higher because it has an exceptionally high recombination rate and recombination may be directly or indirectly mutagenic? To address this possibility, we provide a direct estimate of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rate in the bumblebee (<i>Bombus terrestris</i>), this being a close relative of the honeybee but with a much lower recombination rate. We confirm that the crossover rate of the bumblebee is indeed much lower than honeybees (8.7 cM/Mb vs. 37 cM/Mb). Importantly, we find no significant difference in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rates: we estimate for bumblebees a rate of 3.6 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> per haploid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e per generation (95% confidence intervals 2.38 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> and 5.37 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>) which is just 5% higher than the estimate that of honeybees. Both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es have approximately one new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion per haploid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e per generation. While we find evidence for a direct coupling between recombination and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion (also seen in honeybees), the effect is so weak as to leave almost no footprint on any between-species differences. The similarity in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rates suggests an approximate constancy of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rate in insects.</p>

A Comprehensive, High-Resolution Map of a Gene’s Fitness Landscape
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions are central to evolution, providing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic variation upon which selection acts. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion’s effect on the suitability of a gene to perform a particular function (gene fitness) can be positive, negative, or neutral. Knowledge of the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions is fundamental for understanding evolutionary dynamics, molecular-level <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic variation, complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic disease, the accumulation of deleterious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions, and the molecular clock. We present comprehensive DFEs for point and codon mutants of the <i>Escherichia coli TEM-1</i> β-lactamase gene and missense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in the TEM-1 protein. These DFEs provide insight into the inherent benefits of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic cod</span></strong>e’s architecture, support for the hypothesis that mRNA stability dictates codon usage at the beginning of genes, an extensive framework for understanding protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional tolerance, and evidence that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional effects on protein thermodynamic stability shape the DFE. Contrary to prevailing expectations, we find that deleterious effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion primarily arise from a decrease in specific protein activity and not cellular protein levels.</p>

We examined associations between AF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic risk scores and ischemic stroke in a separate study of 509 ischemic stroke cases (202 cardioembolic [40%]) and 3028 referents.

Mutations in the promoter of the telomerase gene <i>TERT</i> contribute to tumorigenesis by a two-step mechanism
<p><i>TERT</i> promoter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions (TPMs) are the most common noncoding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in cancer. The timing and consequences of TPMs have not been fully established. Here, we show that TPMs acquired at the transition from benign nevus to malignant melanoma do not support <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">telomer</span></strong>e maintenance. In vitro experiments revealed that TPMs do not prevent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">telomer</span></strong>e attrition, resulting in cells with critically short and unprotected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">telomer</span></strong>es. Immortalization by TPMs requires a gradual up-regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">telomer</span></strong>ase, coinciding with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">telomer</span></strong>e fusions. These data suggest that TPMs contribute to tumorigenesis by promoting immortalization and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic instability in two phases. In an initial phase, TPMs do not prevent bulk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">telomer</span></strong>e shortening but extend cellular life span by healing the shortest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">telomer</span></strong>es. In the second phase, the critically short <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">telomer</span></strong>es lead to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e instability and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">telomer</span></strong>ase is further up-regulated to sustain cell proliferation.</p>

Multi-Omics Driven Assembly and Annotation of the Sandalwood (<i>Santalum album</i>) Genome
<p>Indian sandalwood (<i>Santalum album</i>) is an important tropical evergreen tree known for its fragrant heartwood-derived essential oil and its valuable carving wood. Here, we applied an integrated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic, transcriptomic, and proteomic approach to assemble and annotate the Indian sandalwood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. Our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequencing resulted in the establishment of a draft map of the smallest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e for any woody tree species to date (221 Mb). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e annotation predicted 38,119 protein-coding genes and 27.42% repetitive DNA elements. In-depth proteome analysis revealed the identities of 72,325 unique peptides, which confirmed 10,076 of the predicted genes. The addition of transcriptomic and proteo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic approaches resulted in the identification of 53 novel proteins and 34 gene-correction events that were missed by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic approaches. Proteo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic analysis also helped in reassigning 1,348 potential noncoding RNAs as bona fide protein-coding messenger RNAs. Gene expression patterns at the RNA and protein levels indicated that peptide sequencing was useful in capturing proteins encoded by nuclear and organellar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es alike. Mass spectrometry-based proteomic evidence provided an unbiased approach toward the identification of proteins encoded by organellar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. Such proteins are often missed in transcriptome data sets due to the enrichment of only messenger RNAs that contain poly(A) tails. Overall, the use of integrated omic approaches enhanced the quality of the assembly and annotation of this nonmodel plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. The availability of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data will enhance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics-assisted breeding, germplasm characterization, and conservation of sandalwood trees.</p>

<p>An increase in gene copy number is often associated with changes in the number and structure of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es, as has been widely observed in yeast and eukaryotic tumors, yet little is known about stress-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>al changes in plants. Previously, we reported that the <i>EPSPS</i> (5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase) gene, the molecular target of glyphosate, was amplified at the native locus and on an extra <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e in glyphosate-resistant <i>Amaranthus tuberculatus</i>. Here, we report that the extra <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e is a ring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e termed extra circular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e carrying amplified <i>EPSPS</i> (ECCAE). The ECCAE is heterochromatic, harbors four major <i>EPSPS</i> amplified foci, and is sexually transmitted to 35% of the progeny. Two highly glyphosate resistant (HGR) <i>A. tuberculatus</i> plants with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e constitution of 2n = 32+1 ECCAE displayed soma cell heterogeneity. Some cells had secondary ECCAEs, which displayed size polymorphisms and produced novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>al variants with multiple gene amplification foci. We hypothesize that the ECCAE in the soma cells of HGR <i>A. tuberculatus</i> plants underwent breakage-fusion-bridge cycles to generate the observed soma cell heterogeneity, including de novo <i>EPSPS</i> gene integration into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es. Resistant soma cells with stable <i>EPSPS</i> amplification events as de novo insertions into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es may survive glyphosate selection pressure during the sporophytic phase and are plausibly transmitted to germ cells leading to durable glyphosate resistance in <i>A. tuberculatus</i>. This is the first report of early events in aneuploidy-triggered de novo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e integration by an as yet unknown mechanism, which may drive rapid adaptive evolution of herbicide resistance in common waterhemp.</p>

Monophyletic Origin and Evolution of the Largest Crucifer Genomes
<p>Clade E, or the <i>Hesperis</i> clade, is one of the major Brassicaceae (Crucifereae) clades, comprising some 48 genera and 351 species classified into seven tribes and is distributed predominantly across arid and montane regions of Asia. Several taxa have socioeconomic significance, being important ornamental but also weedy and invasive species. From the comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic perspective, the clade is noteworthy as it harbors species with the largest crucifer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es but low numbers of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es (<i>n</i> = 5–7). By applying comparative cyto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic analysis and whole-chloroplast phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ics, we constructed, to our knowledge, the first partial and complete cyto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic maps for selected representatives of clade E tribes and investigated their relationships in a family-wide context. The <i>Hesperis</i> clade is a well-supported monophyletic lineage comprising seven tribes: Anchonieae, Buniadeae, Chorisporeae, Dontostemoneae, Euclidieae, Hesperideae, and Shehbazieae. The clade diverged from other Brassicaceae crown-group clades during the Oligocene, followed by subsequent Miocene tribal diversifications in central/southwestern Asia. The inferred ancestral karyotype of clade E (CEK; <i>n</i> = 7) originated from an older <i>n</i> = 8 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e, which also was the purported progenitor of tribe Arabideae (KAA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e). In most taxa of clade E, the seven linkage groups of CEK either remained conserved (Chorisporeae) or were reshuffled by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>al translocations (Euclidieae). In 50% of Anchonieae and Hesperideae species, the CEK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e has undergone descending dysploidy toward <i>n</i> = 6 (−5). These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic data elucidate early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e evolution in Brassicaceae and pave the way for future whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequencing and assembly efforts in this as yet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ically neglected group of crucifer plants.</p>

Correlation between genome reduction and bacterial growth
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e reduction by removing dispensable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic sequences in bacteria is commonly used in both fundamental and applied studies to determine the minimal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic requirements for a living system or to develop highly efficient bioreactors. Nevertheless, whether and how the accumulative loss of dispensable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic sequences disturbs bacterial growth remains unclear. To investigate the relationship between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e reduction and growth, a series of <i>Escherichia coli</i> strains carrying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es reduced in a stepwise manner were used. Intensive growth analyses revealed that the accumulation of multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic deletions caused decreases in the exponential growth rate and the saturated cell density in a deletion-length-dependent manner as well as gradual changes in the patterns of growth dynamics, regardless of the growth media. Accordingly, a perspective growth model linking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e evolution to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e engineering was proposed. This study provides the first demonstration of a quantitative connection between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic sequence and bacterial growth, indicating that growth rate is potentially associated with dispensable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic sequences.</p>

Phylogenetic Signal Variation in the Genomes of <i>Medicago</i> (Fabaceae)
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-scale data offer the opportunity to clarify phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic relationships that are difficult to resolve with few loci, but they can also identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic regions with evolutionary history distinct from that of the species history. We collected whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequence data from 29 taxa in the legume genus <i>Medicago</i>, then aligned these sequences to the <i>Medicago truncatula</i> reference <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e to confidently identify 87 596 variable homologous sites. We used this data set to estimate phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic relationships among <i>Medicago</i> species, to investigate the number of sites needed to provide robust phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic estimates and to identify specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic regions supporting topologies in conflict with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-wide phylogeny. Our full <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic data set resolves relationships within the genus that were previously intractable. Subsampling the data reveals considerable variation in phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic signal and power in smaller subsets of the data. Even when sampling 5000 sites, no random sample of the data supports a topology identical to that of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-wide phylogeny. Phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic relationships estimated from 500-site sliding windows revealed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e regions supporting several alternative species relationships among recently diverged taxa, consistent with the expected effects of deep coalescence or introgression in the recent history of <i>Medicago</i>.

Germline selection shapes human mitochondrial DNA diversity
<p>Approximately 2.4% of the human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e exhibits common homoplasmic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic variation. We analyzed 12,975 whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequences to show that 45.1% of individuals from 1526 mother–offspring pairs harbor a mixed population of mtDNA (heteroplasmy), but the propensity for maternal transmission differs across the mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. Over one generation, we observed selection both for and against variants in specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic regions; known variants were more likely to be transmitted than previously unknown variants. However, new heteroplasmies were more likely to match the nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic ancestry as opposed to the ancestry of the mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e on which the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions occurred, validating our findings in 40,325 individuals. Thus, human mtDNA at the population level is shaped by selective forces within the female germ line under nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic control, which ensures consistency between the two independent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic lineages.</p>

Fusion oncogenes—genetic musical chairs
<p>The cyto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic definitions of many cancers predate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequencing era. Indeed, some classes of cancers (largely subtypes of sarcomas, lymphomas, and leukemias) have long been defined by simple and distinct patterns of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>al changes, or karyotypes, that, in many cases, feature a single pathognomonic somatic translocation of two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic regions that creates a fusion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>e (for example, the Philadelphia <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e translocation in chronic myelogenous leukemia results in the <i>BCR-ABL1</i> fusion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>e) (<i>1</i>). Whereas many common cancers display <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic complexity consistent with multistep <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oncogen</span></strong>esis, such as carcinomas of breast and lung, cancers that are defined by translocations typically display simple karyotypes, suggesting that they were shaped by a single translocation. However, the cyto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic simplicity of these cancers may mask more complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic events. On page 891 of this issue, Anderson <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) report whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequencing (WGS) of 50 Ewing sarcomas (EWSs), an aggressive sarcoma that is defined by fusion between the EWS RNA binding protein 1 (<i>EWSR1</i>) gene on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e 22 and an E26 transformation-specific (ETS) family transcription factor gene, either <i>FLI1</i> at 11q24 or <i>ERG</i> at 21q11 (<i>3</i>). Anderson <i>et al.</i> show that ∼40% of <i>EWSR1-FLI1</i> fusions and all <i>EWSR1-ERG</i> fusions arise via a complex rearrangement pattern called chromoplexy, which was first identified in prostate cancer (<i>4</i>). They suggest that chromoplexy “bursts” may be early initiating events in Ewing sarcomagenesis and mark a more aggressive form of the disease.</p>

Mutation dynamics and fitness effects followed in single cells
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions have been investigated for more than a century but remain difficult to observe directly in single cells, which limits the characterization of their dynamics and fitness effects. By combining microfluidics, time-lapse imaging, and a fluorescent tag of the mismatch repair system in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, we visualized the emergence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in single cells, revealing Poissonian dynamics. Concomitantly, we tracked the growth and life span of single cells, accumulating ~20,000 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-wide over hundreds of generations. This analysis revealed that 1% of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions were lethal; nonlethal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions displayed a heavy-tailed distribution of fitness effects and were dominated by quasi-neutral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions with an average cost of 0.3%. Our approach has enabled the investigation of single-cell individuality in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rate, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion fitness costs, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion interactions.</p>

Wild emmer genome architecture and diversity elucidate wheat evolution and domestication
<p>Wheat (<i>Triticum</i> spp.) is one of the founder crops that likely drove the Neolithic transition to sedentary agrarian societies in the Fertile Crescent more than 10,000 years ago. Identifying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic modifications underlying wheat’s domestication requires knowledge about the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e of its allo-tetraploid progenitor, wild emmer (<i>T. turgidum</i> ssp. <i>dicoccoides</i>). We report a 10.1-gigabase assembly of the 14 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es of wild tetraploid wheat, as well as analyses of gene content, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e architecture, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic diversity.

A study of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic diversity among wild and domesticated accessions revealed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic regions bearing the signature of selection under domestication.

Exploring genetic suppression interactions on a global scale
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic suppression occurs when the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ic defects caused by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion in a particular gene are rescued by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion in a second gene. To explore the principles of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic suppression, we examined both literature-curated and unbiased experimental data, involving systematic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic mapping and whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequencing, to generate a large-scale suppression network among yeast genes. Most suppression pairs identified novel relationships among functionally related genes, providing new insights into the functional wiring diagram of the cell. In addition to suppressor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions, we identified frequent secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions,in a subset of genes, that likely cause a delay in the onset of stationary phase, which appears to promote their enrichment within a propagating population. These findings allow us to formulate and quantify general mechanisms of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic suppression.</p>

One brain, many genomes

But as anyone who has used a copy machine or played the childhood game of “telephone” knows, copies are never perfect. Every cell in an individual actually has a unique <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e, an imperfect copy of its cellular ancestor differentiated by inevitable somatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions arising from errors in DNA replication and other mutagenic forces (<i>1</i>).

MAPINS, a Highly Efficient Detection Method That Identifies Insertional Mutations and Complex DNA Rearrangements
<p>Insertional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutagenesi</span></strong>s, in which a piece of exogenous DNA is integrated randomly into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic DNA of the recipient cell, is a useful method to generate new mutants with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>es of interest. The unicellular green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> is an outstanding model for studying many biological processes. We developed a new computational algorithm, MAPINS (mapping insertions), to efficiently identify insertion sites created by the integration of an <i>APHVIII</i> (<i>aminoglycoside 3′-phosphotransferase VIII</i>) cassette that confers paromomycin resistance. Using whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequencing data, this method eliminates the need for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic DNA manipulation and retains all the sequencing information provided by paired-end sequencing. We experimentally verified 38 insertion sites out of 41 sites (93%) identified by MAPINS from 20 paromomycin-resistant strains. Using meiotic analysis of 18 of these strains, we identified insertion sites that completely cosegregate with paromomycin resistance. In six of the seven strains with a mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>e, we demonstrated complete cosegregation of the mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>e and the verified insertion site. In addition, we provide direct evidence of complex rearrangements of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic DNA in five strains, three of which involve the <i>APHVIII</i> insertion site. We suggest that strains obtained by insertional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutagenesi</span></strong>s are more complicated than expected from previous analyses in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>. To map the locations of some complex insertions, we designed 49 molecular markers based on differences identified via whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequencing between wild-type strains CC-124 and CC-125. Overall, MAPINS provides a low-cost, efficient method to characterize insertional mutants in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>.</p>

Scanning for New BRI1 Mutations via TILLING Analysis
<p>The identification and characterization of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional spectrum for a specific protein can help to elucidate its detailed cellular functions. BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1 (BRI1), a multidomain transmembrane receptor-like kinase, is a major receptor of brassinosteroids in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Within the last two decades, over 20 different <i>bri1</i> mutant alleles have been identified, which helped to determine the significance of each domain within BRI1. To further understand the molecular mechanisms of BRI1, we tried to identify additional alleles via targeted induced local lesions in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. Here, we report our identification of 83 new point <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in <i>BRI1</i>, including nine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions that exhibit an allelic series of typical <i>bri1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>es, from subtle to severe morphological alterations. We carried out biochemical analyses to investigate possible mechanisms of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in affecting brassinosteroid signaling. A number of interesting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions have been isolated via this study. For example, <i>bri1-702</i>, the only weak allele identified so far with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion in the activation loop, showed reduced autophosphorylation activity. <i>bri1-705</i>, a subtle allele with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion in the extracellular portion, disrupts the interaction of BRI1 with its ligand brassinolide and coreceptor BRI1-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR KINASE1. <i>bri1-706</i>, with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion in the extracellular portion, is a subtle defective mutant. Surprisingly, root inhibition analysis indicated that it is largely insensitive to exogenous brassinolide treatment. In this study, we found that <i>bri1-301</i> possesses kinase activity in vivo, clarifying a previous report arguing that kinase activity may not be necessary for the function of BRI1. These data provide additional insights into our understanding of the early events in the brassinosteroid signaling pathway.</p>

Epistasis and Pleiotropy Affect the Modularity of the Genotype–Phenotype Map of Cross-Resistance in HIV-1
<p>The genotype–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>e (GP) map is a central concept in evolutionary biology as it describes the mapping of molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic variation onto <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ic trait variation. Our understanding of that mapping remains partial, especially when trying to link functional clustering of pleiotropic gene effects with patterns of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ic trait co-variation. Only on rare occasions have studies been able to fully explore that link and tend to show poor correspondence between modular structures within the GP map and among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>es. By dissecting the structure of the GP map of the replicative capacity of HIV-1 in 15 drug environments, we provide a detailed view of that mapping from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional pleiotropic variation to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ic co-variation, including epistatic effects of a set of amino-acid substitutions in the reverse transcriptase and protease genes. We show that epistasis increases the pleiotropic degree of single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions and provides modularity to the GP map of drug resistance in HIV-1. Moreover, modules of epistatic pleiotropic effects within the GP map match the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ic modules of correlated replicative capacity among drug classes. Epistasis thus increases the evolvability of cross-resistance in HIV by providing more drug- and class-specific pleiotropic profiles to the main effects of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions. We discuss the implications for the evolution of cross-resistance in HIV.</p>

Whole-Genome Sequencing of Tibetan Macaque (<i>Macaca thibetana</i>) Provides New Insight into the Macaque Evolutionary History
<p>Macaques are the most widely distributed nonhuman primates and used as animal models in biomedical research. The availability of full-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequences from them would be essential to both biomedical and primate evolutionary studies. Previous studies have reported whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequences from rhesus macaque (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>) and cynomolgus macaque (<i>M. fascicularis</i>, CE), both of which belong to the <i>fascicularis</i> group. Here, we present a 37-fold coverage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequence of the Tibetan macaque (<i>M. thibetana</i>; TM). TM is an endemic species to China belonging to the <i>sinica</i> group<i>.</i> On the basis of mapping to the rhesus macaque <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e, we identified approximately 11.9 million single-nucleotide variants), of which 3.9 million were TM specific, as assessed by comparison two Chinese rhesus macaques (CR) and two CE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. Some genes carried TM-specific homozygous nonsynonymous variants (TSHNVs), which were scored as deleterious in human by both PolyPhen-2 and SIFT (Sorting Tolerant From Intolerant) and were enriched in the eye disease genes. In total, 273 immune response and disease-related genes carried at least one TSHNV. The heterozygosity rates of two CRs (0.002617 and 0.002612) and two CEs (0.003004 and 0.003179) were approximately three times higher than that of TM (0.000898). Polymerase chain reaction resequencing of 18 TM individuals showed that 29 TSHNVs exhibited high allele frequencies, thus confirming their low heterozygosity. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-wide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic divergence analysis demonstrated that TM was more closely related to CR than to CE. We further detected unusual low divergence regions between TM and CR. In addition, after applying statistical criteria to detect putative introgression regions (PIRs) in the TM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e, up to 239,620 kb PIRs (8.84% of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e) were identified. Given that TM and CR have overlapping geographical distributions, had the same refuge during the Middle Pleistocene, and show similar mating behaviors, it is highly likely that there was an ancient introgression event between them. Moreover, demographic inferences revealed that TM exhibited a similar demographic history as other macaques until 0.5 Ma, but then it maintained a lower effective population size until present time. Our study has provided new insight into the macaque evolutionary history, confirming hybridization events between macaque species groups based on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-wide data.</p>

Efficient Inference of Recombination Hot Regions in Bacterial Genomes
<p>In eukaryotes, detailed surveys of recombination rates have shown variation at multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic scales and the presence of “hotspots” of highly elevated recombination. In bacteria, studies of recombination rate variation are less developed, in part because there are few analysis methods that take into account the clonal context within which bacterial evolution occurs. Here, we focus in particular on identifying “hot regions” of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e where DNA is transferred frequently between isolates. We present a computationally efficient algorithm based on the recently developed “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e painting” algorithm, which characterizes patterns of haplotype sharing across a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. We compare the average <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e wide painting, which principally reflects clonal descent, with the painting for each site which additionally reflects the specific deviations at the site due to recombination. Using simulated data, we show that hot regions have consistently higher deviations from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e wide average than normal regions. We applied our approach to previously analyzed <i>Escherichia coli</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es and revealed that the new method is highly correlated with the number of recombination events affecting each site inferred by ClonalOrigin, a method that is only applicable to small numbers of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. Furthermore, we analyzed recombination hot regions in <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> by using 200 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. We identified three recombination hot regions, which are enriched for genes related to membrane proteins. Our approach and its implementation, which is downloadable from <ext-link>https://github.com/bioprojects/orderedPainting</ext-link>, will help to develop a new phase of population <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic studies of recombination in prokaryotes.</p>

Absence of strong strain effects in behavioral analyses of <i>Shank3</i>-deficient mice
<p>Haploinsufficiency of <i>SHANK3</i>, caused by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>al abnormalities or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions that disrupt one copy of the gene, leads to a neurodevelopmental syndrome called Phelan-McDermid syndrome, symptoms of which can include absent or delayed speech, intellectual disability, neurological changes and autism spectrum disorders. The SHANK3 protein forms a key structural part of the post-synaptic density. We previously generated and characterized mice with a targeted disruption of <i>Shank3</i> in which exons coding for the ankyrin-repeat domain were deleted and expression of full-length Shank3 was disrupted. We documented specific deficits in synaptic function and plasticity, along with reduced reciprocal social interactions, in <i>Shank3</i> heterozygous mice. Changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>e owing to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion at a single locus are quite frequently modulated by other loci, most dramatically when the entire <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic background is changed. In mice, each strain of laboratory mouse represents a distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic background and alterations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>e owing to gene knockout or transgenesis are frequently different across strains, which can lead to the identification of important modifier loci. We have investigated the effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic background on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>es of <i>Shank3</i> heterozygous, knockout and wild-type mice, using C57BL/6, 129SVE and FVB/Ntac strain backgrounds. We focused on observable behaviors with the goal of carrying out subsequent analyses to identify modifier loci. Surprisingly, there were very modest strain effects over a large battery of analyses. These results indicate that behavioral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>es associated with <i>Shank3</i> haploinsufficiency are largely strain-independent.</p>

Histopathology reveals correlative and unique phenotypes in a high-throughput mouse phenotyping screen
<p>The Mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ics Project (MGP) at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute aims to generate and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>e over 800 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ically modified mouse lines over the next 5 years to gain a better understanding of mammalian gene function and provide an invaluable resource to the scientific community for follow-up studies. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ing includes the generation of a standardized biobank of paraffin-embedded tissues for each mouse line, but histopathology is not routinely performed. In collaboration with the Pathology Core of the Centre for Modeling Human Disease (CMHD) we report the utility of histopathology in a high-throughput primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ing screen. Histopathology was assessed in an unbiased selection of 50 mouse lines with (<i>n</i>=30) or without (<i>n</i>=20) clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>es detected by the standard MGP primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ing screen. Our findings revealed that histopathology added correlating morphological data in 19 of 30 lines (63.3%) in which the primary screen detected a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>e. In addition, seven of the 50 lines (14%) presented significant histopathology findings that were not associated with or predicted by the standard primary screen. Three of these seven lines had no clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>e detected by the standard primary screen. Incidental and strain-associated background lesions were present in all mutant lines with good concordance to wild-type controls. These findings demonstrate the complementary and unique contribution of histopathology to high-throughput primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ing of mutant mice.</p>

Genetics, Lifestyle, and Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol in Young and Apparently Healthy Women
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Atherosclerosis starts in childhood but low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), a causal risk factor, is mostly studied and dealt with when clinical events have occurred. Women are usually affected later in life than men and are underdiagnosed, undertreated, and understudied in cardiovascular trials and research. This study aims at a better understanding of lifestyle and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic factors that affect LDL-C in young women.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We randomly selected for every year of age 8 women with LDL-C ≤1st percentile (≤50 mg/dL) and 8 women with LDL-C ≥99th percentile (≥186 mg/dL) from 28 000 female participants aged between 25 to 40 years of a population-based cohort study. The resulting groups include 119 and 121 women, respectively, of an average 33 years of age. A gene-sequencing panel was used to assess established monogenic and polygenic origins of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>es. Information on lifestyle was extracted from questionnaires. A healthy lifestyle score was allocated based on a recently developed algorithm.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of the women with LDL-C ≤1st percentile, 19 (15.7%) carried <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions that are causing monogenic hypocholesterolemia and 60 (49.6%) were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ically predisposed to low LDL-C on the basis of an extremely low weighted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic risk score. In comparison with control groups, a healthier lifestyle was not associated with low LDL-C in women without <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic predispositions. Among women with LDL-C ≥99th percentile, 20 women (16.8%) carried <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions that cause familial hypercholesterolemia, whereas 25 (21%) were predisposed to high LDL-C on the basis of a high-weighted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic risk score.

Phenotypic Consequences of a Genetic Predisposition to Enhanced Nitric Oxide Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Nitric oxide signaling plays a key role in the regulation of vascular tone and platelet activation. Here, we seek to understand the impact of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic predisposition to enhanced nitric oxide signaling on risk for cardiovascular diseases, thus informing the potential utility of pharmacological stimulation of the nitric oxide pathway as a therapeutic strategy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We analyzed the association of common and rare <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic variants in 2 genes that mediate nitric oxide signaling (Nitric Oxide Synthase 3 [<i>NOS3</i>] and Guanylate Cyclase 1, Soluble, Alpha 3 [<i>GUCY1A3</i>]) with a range of human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>es. We selected 2 common variants (rs3918226 in <i>NOS3</i> and rs7692387 in <i>GUCY1A3</i>) known to associate with increased <i>NOS3</i> and <i>GUCY1A3</i> expression and reduced mean arterial pressure, combined them into a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic score, and standardized this exposure to a 5 mm Hg reduction in mean arterial pressure. Using individual-level data from 335 464 participants in the UK Biobank and summary association results from 7 large-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e-wide association studies, we examined the effect of this nitric oxide signaling score on cardiometabolic and other diseases. We also examined whether rare loss-of-function <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in <i>NOS3</i> and <i>GUCY1A3</i> were associated with coronary heart disease using gene sequencing data from the Myocardial Infarction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ics Consortium (n=27 815).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic predisposition to enhanced nitric oxide signaling was associated with reduced risks of coronary heart disease (odds ratio, 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31-0.45; <i>P</i>=5.5*10<sup>–26</sup>], peripheral arterial disease (odds ratio 0.42; 95% CI, 0.26-0.68; <i>P</i>=0.0005), and stroke (odds ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.37-0.76; <i>P</i>=0.0006). In a mediation analysis, the effect of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic score on decreased coronary heart disease risk extended beyond its effect on blood pressure.

Female Mice With an XY Sex Chromosome Complement Develop Severe Angiotensin II–Induced Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are a deadly pathology with strong sexual dimorphism. Similar to humans, female mice exhibit far lower incidences of angiotensin II–induced AAAs than males. In addition to sex hormones, the X and Y sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es, and their unique complements of genes, may contribute to sexually dimorphic AAA pathology. Here, we defined the effect of female (XX) versus male (XY) sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e complement on angiotensin II–induced AAA formation and rupture in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ically female mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Female low-density lipoprotein receptor (<i>Ldlr</i>) deficient mice with an XX or XY sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e complement were infused with angiotensin II for 28 days to induce AAAs. Abdominal aortic lumen diameters were quantified by ultrasound, whereas AAA diameters were quantified at study end point. DNA microarrays were performed on abdominal aortas. To mimic males, female mice were administered a single dose of testosterone as neonates or as adults before angiotensin II infusions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Female <i>Ldlr</i><sup>–/–</sup> deficient mice with an XX and XY sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e complement had similar sex organ weights and low serum testosterone concentrations. Abdominal aortas from female XY mice selectively expressed Y <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e genes, whereas genes known to escape X inactivation were higher in XX females. The majority of aortic gene differences in XY versus XX females fell within inflammatory pathways. AAA incidences doubled and aneurysms ruptured in XY females. AAAs from XY females exhibited inflammation, and plasma interleukin-1β concentrations were increased in XY females. Moreover, aortas from XY females had augmented matrix metalloproteinase activity and increased oxidative stress. Last, testosterone exposure applied chronically, or as a single bolus at postnatal day 1, markedly worsened AAA outcomes in XY in comparison with XX adult females.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>An XY sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e complement in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ic females profoundly influenced aortic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene express</span></strong>ion profiles and promoted AAA severity. When XY females were exposed to testosterone, aneurysm rupture rates were striking. Mechanisms for augmented AAA severity in XY females include increased inflammation, augmented matrix metalloproteineases, and oxidative stress. Our results demonstrate that genes on the sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es regulate aortic vascular biology and contribute to sexual dimorphism of AAAs.

Catastrophic Unbalanced Genome Rearrangements Cause Somatic Loss of Berry Color in Grapevine
<p>Grape (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) color somatic variants that can be used to develop new grapevine cultivars occasionally appear associated with deletion events of uncertain origin. To understand the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional mechanisms generating somatic structural variation in grapevine, we compared the Tempranillo Blanco (TB) white berry somatic variant with its black berry ancestor, Tempranillo Tinto. Whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e sequencing uncovered a catastrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e rearrangement in TB that caused the hemizygous deletion of 313 genes, including the loss of the functional copy for the <i>MYB</i> transcription factors required for anthocyanin pigmentation in the berry skin. Loss of heterozygosity and decreased copy number delimited interspersed monosomic and disomic regions in the right arm of linkage groups 2 and 5. At least 11 validated clustered breakpoints involving intra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>al and inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>al translocations between three linkage groups flanked the deleted fragments, which, according to segregation analyses, are phased in a single copy of each of the affected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es. These hallmarks, along with the lack of homology between breakpoint joins and the randomness of the order and orientation of the rearranged fragments, are all consistent with a chromothripsis-like pattern generated after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>e breakage and illegitimate rejoining. This unbalanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e reshuffling has additional consequences in reproductive development. In TB, lack of sexual transmission of rearranged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es associates with low gamete viability, which compromises fruit set and decreases fruit production. Our findings show that catastrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e rearrangements arise spontaneously and stabilize during plant somatic growth. These dramatic rearrangements generate new interesting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>es that can be selected for the improvement of vegetatively propagated plant species.</p>

Generation of a Collection of Mutant Tomato Lines Using Pooled CRISPR Libraries
<p>The high efficiency of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutagenesi</span></strong>s in plants enables the development of high-throughput <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutagenesi</span></strong>s strategies. By transforming pooled CRISPR libraries into tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>), collections of mutant lines were generated with minimal transformation attempts and in a relatively short period of time. Identification of the targeted gene(s) was easily determined by sequencing the incorporated guide RNA(s) in the primary transgenic events. From a single transformation with a CRISPR library targeting the immunity-associated leucine-rich repeat subfamily XII genes, heritable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions were recovered in 15 of the 54 genes targeted. To increase throughput, a second CRISPR library was made containing three guide RNAs per construct to target 18 putative transporter genes. This resulted in stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in 15 of the 18 targeted genes, with some primary transgenic plants having as many as five <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ed genes. Furthermore, the redundancy in this collection of plants allowed for the association of aberrant T0 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>es with the underlying targeted genes. Plants with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in a homolog of an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) boron efflux transporter displayed boron deficiency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>es. The strategy described here provides a technically simple yet high-throughput approach for generating a collection of lines with targeted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions and should be applicable to any plant transformation system.</p>

Stearoyl-Acyl Carrier Protein Desaturase Mutations Uncover an Impact of Stearic Acid in Leaf and Nodule Structure
<p>Stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturase (SACPD-C) has been reported to control the accumulation of seed stearic acid; however, no study has previously reported its involvement in leaf stearic acid content and impact on leaf structure and morphology. A subset of an ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenized population of soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) ‘Forrest’ was screened to identify mutants within the <i>GmSACPD-C</i> gene. Using a forward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ics approach, one nonsense and four missense <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutants were identified to have high levels of seed, nodule, and leaf stearic acid content. Homology modeling and in silico analysis of the GmSACPD-C enzyme revealed that most of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions were localized near or at conserved residues essential for diiron ion coordination. Soybeans carrying <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions at conserved residues showed the highest stearic acid content, and these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions were found to have deleterious effects on nodule development and function. Interestingly, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions at nonconserved residues show an increase in stearic acid content yet retain healthy nodules. Thus, random <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutagenesi</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional analysis allows for the achievement of high seed stearic acid content with no associated negative agronomic characteristics. Additionally, expression analysis demonstrates that nodule leghemoglobin transcripts were significantly more abundant in soybeans with deleterious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions at conserved residues of GmSACPD-C. Finally, we report that <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions cause an increase in leaf stearic acid content and an alteration of leaf structure and morphology in addition to differences in nitrogen-fixing nodule structure.</p>

Hierarchically Aligning 10 Legume Genomes Establishes a Family-Level Genomics Platform

However, a family-level comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics analysis has been unavailable. With grape (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) and selected legume <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es as outgroups, we managed to perform a hierarchical and event-related alignment of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es and deconvoluted layers of homologous regions produced by ancestral polyploidizations or speciations. Consequently, we illustrated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ic fractionation characterized by widespread gene losses after the polyploidizations. Notably, high similarity in gene retention between recently duplicated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromosom</span></strong>es in soybean supported the likely autopolyploidy nature of its tetraploid ancestor. Moreover, although most gene losses were nearly random, largely but not fully described by geometric distribution, we showed that polyploidization contributed divergently to the copy number variation of important gene families. Besides, we showed significantly divergent evolutionary levels among legumes and, by performing synonymous nucleotide substitutions at synonymous sites correction, redated major evolutionary events during their expansion. This effort laid a solid foundation for further <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics exploration in the legume research community and beyond. We describe only a tiny fraction of legume comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics analysis that we performed; more information was stored in the newly constructed Legume Comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>ics Research Platform (<ext-link>www.legumegrp.org</ext-link>).</p>

Histone Lysine-to-Methionine Mutations Reduce Histone Methylation and Cause Developmental Pleiotropy
<p>Epi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic modifications play critical roles in diverse biological processes. Histone Lys-to-Met (K-to-M) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions act as gain-of-function <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions to inhibit a wide range of histone methyltransferases and are thought to promote tumorigenesis. However, it is largely unknown whether K-to-M <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions impact organismal development. Using Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) as a model system, we discovered that a transgene exogenously expressing histone 3 Lys-36 to Met <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion (K36M) acts in a dominant-negative manner to cause global reduction of H3K36 methylation. Remarkably, this dominant repressive activity is dosage-dependent and causes strong developmental perturbations including extreme branching and early flowering by affecting the expression of genes involved in developmental and metabolic processes. Besides the established pathological roles of K-to-M <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in tumor cells, we demonstrate a physiological outcome for K-to-M induced H3K36 hypomethylation. This study provides evidence for a conserved dominant-negative inhibitory role of histone K-to-M <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion across the plant and animal kingdoms. We also highlight the unique ability of K36M <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions to alter plant developmental processes leading to severe pleiotropic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>es. Finally, our data suggests K-to-M <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions may provide a useful strategy for altering epi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic landscapes in organisms where histone methyltransferases are uncharacterized.</p>

Developmental Defects Mediated by the P1/HC-Pro Potyviral Silencing Suppressor Are Not Due to Misregulation of <i>AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 8</i>
<p>Plant viral suppressors of RNA silencing induce developmental defects similar to those caused by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in genes involved in the microRNA pathway. A recent report has attributed viral suppressor-mediated developmental defects to up-regulation of <i>AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 8</i> (<i>ARF8</i>), a target of miR167. The key piece of evidence was that the developmental defects in transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) expressing viral suppressors were greatly alleviated in the F1 progeny of a cross with plants carrying the <i>arf8-6</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion. <i>Arf8-6</i> is a SALK line T-DNA insertion mutant, a class of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions prone to inducing transcriptional silencing of transgenes expressed from the 35S promoter. We have reinvestigated the role of <i>ARF8</i> in viral suppressor-mediated developmental defects, using two independent <i>arf8</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions and the P1/HC-Pro potyviral suppressor of silencing. Progeny of a cross between <i>P1/HC-Pro</i> transgenic Arabidopsis and the <i>arf8-6</i> T-DNA insertion mutant showed little effect on the P1/HC-Pro <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>e in the F1 generation, but almost all <i>arf8-6</i>/<i>P1/HC-Pro</i> progeny had lost the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>e in the F2 generation. However, the loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>e in the F2 generation was not correlated with the number of functional copies of the <i>ARF8</i> gene. Instead, it reflected transcriptional silencing of the <i>P1/HC-Pro</i> transgene, as evidenced by a pronounced decrease in P1/HC-Pro mRNA and the appearance of 35S promoter small interfering RNAs. Furthermore, an independent loss-of-function point <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion, <i>Arf8-8</i>, had no detectable effects on P1/HC-Pro <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>e in either the F1 or F2 generations. Together, these data argue against the previously reported role of increased <i>ARF8</i> expression in developmental defects caused by <i>P1/HC-Pro</i>.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
The Roles of Mutation, Selection, and Expression in Determining Relative Rates of Evolution in Mitochondrial versus Nuclear Genomes
<p>Eukaryotes rely on proteins encoded by the nuclear and mitochondrial (mt) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es, which interact within multisubunit complexes such as oxidative-phosphorylation enzymes. Although selection is thought to be less efficient on the asexual mt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e, in bilaterian animals the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions (<i>ω</i>) is lower in mt- compared with nuclear-encoded OXPHOS subunits, suggesting <i>stronger</i> effects of purifying selection in the mt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. Because high levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene express</span></strong>ion constrain protein sequence evolution, one proposed resolution to this paradox is that mt genes are expressed more highly than nuclear genes. To test this hypothesis, we investigated expression and sequence evolution of mt and nuclear genes from 84 diverse eukaryotes that vary in mt gene content and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rate. We found that the relationship between mt and nuclear <i>ω</i> values varied dramatically across eukaryotes. In contrast, transcript abundance is consistently higher for mt genes than nuclear genes, regardless of which genes happen to be in the mt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. Consequently, expression levels cannot be responsible for the differences in <i>ω</i>. Rather, 84% of the variance in the ratio of <i>ω</i> values between mt and nuclear genes could be explained by differences in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rate between the two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>es. We relate these findings to the hypothesis that high rates of mt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion select for compensatory changes in the nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genom</span></strong>e. We also propose an explanation for why mt transcripts consistently outnumber their nuclear counterparts, with implications for mitonuclear protein imbalance and aging.</p>

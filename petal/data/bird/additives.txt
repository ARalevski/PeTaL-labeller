Fixation and clinical outcome of uncemented peri-apatite-coated <i>versus</i> cemented total knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The optimal method of tibial component fixation remains uncertain   in total knee arthroplasty (TKA).

In 60   patients (30 in each group), radiostereometric analysis of tibial   component migration was evaluated as the primary outcome at baseline,   three months post-operatively and at one, two and five years.

Overall, uncemented PA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed tibial   components migrated significantly more    (p = 0.003), with the mean maximum total point motion (MTPM) at   five years being 0.62 mm (95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.49 to   0.76) for cemented tibial components and 0.97 mm (95% CI 0.81 to   1.15) for PA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed tibial components in TKA. However, between three   months and five years the cemented TKAs migrated significantly more   (p = 0.02), displaying a MTPM of 0.27 mm (95% CI, 0.19 to 0.36) <i>versus</i> 0.13   mm (95% CI, 0.01 to 0.25) for PA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed tibial components.

Plastic waste associated with disease on coral reefs
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong> waste can promote microbial colonization by pathogens implicated in outbreaks of disease in the ocean. We assessed the influence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong> waste on disease risk in 124,000 reef-building corals from 159 reefs in the Asia-Pacific region. The likelihood of disease increases from 4% to 89% when corals are in contact with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>. Structurally complex corals are eight times more likely to be affected by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>, suggesting that microhabitats for reef-associated organisms and valuable fisheries will be disproportionately affected. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong> levels on coral reefs correspond to estimates of terrestrial mismanaged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong> waste entering the ocean. We estimate that 11.1 billion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong> items are entangled on coral reefs across the Asia-Pacific and project this number to increase 40% by 2025. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong> waste management is critical for reducing diseases that threaten ecosystem health and human livelihoods.</p>

Fitness Trade-Offs Lead to Suppressor Tolerance in Yeast
<p>Genetic variation among individuals within a population provides the raw material for phenotypic diversity upon which natural selection operates. Some given variants can act on multiple standing genomic variations simultaneously and release previously inaccessible phenotypes, leading to increased adaptive potential upon challenging environments. Previously, we identified such a variant related to a tRNA nonsense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> in yeast. When introduced into other genetic backgrounds, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> led to an increased population phenotypic variance on various culture conditions, conferring background and environment specific selective advantages. Nonetheless, most isolates are intolerant to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> on rich media due to a severe fitness cost. Here, we found that the tolerance to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> is related to a surprising level of fitness outburst, showing a trade-off effect to accommodate the cost of carrying the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong>. To dissect the genetic basis of such trade-offs, we crossed strains with contrasting tolerance levels on rich media, and analyzed the fitness distribution patterns in the offspring. Combining quantitative tetrad analysis and bulk segregant analysis, we identified two genes, namely <i>MKT1</i> and <i>RGA1</i>, involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> tolerance. We showed that alleles from the tolerant parent for both genes conferred a significant gain of fitness, which increased the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> tolerance. Our results present a detailed dissection of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> tolerance in yeast and provide insights into the molecular basis of trade-offs between fitness and evolutionary potential.</p>

Differential effects of vitamins E and C and carotenoids on growth, resistance to oxidative stress, fledging success and plumage colouration in wild great tits
<p>Oxidative stress is the imbalance between the production of reactive species and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ants, which causes damage to lipids, proteins and DNA. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ants, like vitamins and carotenoids, can limit oxidative damage and can therefore regulate the trade-off between growth, which is a period of high reactive species production, and self-maintenance. However, the role of carotenoids as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ants <i>in vivo</i> has been debated, and it has been suggested that carotenoid-based signals indicate the availability of non-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong>ary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ants (e.g. vitamins) that protect carotenoids from oxidation, known as the ‘protection hypothesis’. To evaluate the importance of vitamins versus carotenoids as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ants during growth and to test the protection hypothesis, we supplemented nestling great tits, <i>Parus major</i>, 3, 5 and 7 days after hatching with a single dose of carotenoids and/or vitamins in a 2×2 full-factorial design. We subsequently measured body condition, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ant capacity, oxidative damage, fledging success and plumage reflectance. Vitamins enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ant capacity, but did not affect oxidative damage. Vitamin-treated nestlings had higher growth rates and higher probability of fledging. In contrast, carotenoids did not affect any of these traits. Furthermore, carotenoid-based colouration increased over the breeding season in nestlings that received vitamins only. This study shows that vitamins are limiting for growth rate and fledging success, and suggests that vitamins could regulate the trade-off between growth and self-maintenance in favour of the former. Moreover, our results are consistent with the idea that carotenoids are minor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ants in birds, but they do not support the protection hypothesis.</p>

A unique type of GSK-3 inhibitor brings new opportunities to the clinic
<p>Development of protein kinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s is a focus of many drug discovery programs. A major problem, however, is the limited specificity of the commonly used adenosine triphosphate–competitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s and the weak inhibition of the more selective substrate-competitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s. Glycogen synthase kinase–3 (GSK-3) is a promising drug target for treating neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but most GSK-3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s have not reached the clinic. We describe a new type of GSK-3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>, L807mts, that acts through a substrate-to-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> conversion mechanism that occurs within the catalytic site of the enzyme. We determined that L807mts was a potent and highly selective GSK-3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> with reasonable pharmacological and safety properties when tested in rodents. Treatment with L807mts enhanced the clearance of β-amyloid loads, reduced inflammation, enhanced autophagic flux, and improved cognitive and social skills in the 5XFAD AD mouse model. This new modality of GSK-3 inhibition may be therapeutic in patients with AD or other central nervous system disorders associated with dysregulated GSK-3.</p>

Mammalian pigmentation is regulated by a distinct cAMP-dependent mechanism that controls melanosome pH
<p>The production of melanin increases skin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong>ation and reduces the risk of skin cancer. Melanin production depends on the pH of melanosomes, which are more acidic in lighter-skinned than in darker-skinned people. We showed that inhibition of soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) controlled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong>ation by increasing the pH of melanosomes both in cells and in vivo. Distinct from the canonical melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R)–dependent cAMP pathway that controls <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong>ation by altering gene expression, we found that inhibition of sAC increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong>ation by increasing the activity of tyrosinase, the rate-limiting enzyme in melanin synthesis, which is more active at basic pH. We demonstrated that the effect of sAC activity on pH and melanin production in human melanocytes depended on the skin color of the donor. Last, we identified sAC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s as a new class of drugs that increase melanosome pH and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong>ation in vivo, suggesting that pharmacologic inhibition of this pathway may affect skin cancer risk or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong>ation conditions.</p>

Catalytic molten metals for the direct conversion of methane to hydrogen and separable carbon
<p>Metals that are active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong>s for methane (Ni, Pt, Pd), when dissolved in inactive low–melting temperature metals (In, Ga, Sn, Pb), produce stable molten metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong>s for pyrolysis of methane into hydrogen and carbon.

Androgen receptor inhibitor–induced “BRCAness” and PARP inhibition are synthetically lethal for castration-resistant prostate cancer
<p>Cancers with loss-of-function mutations in <i>BRCA1</i> or <i>BRCA2</i> are deficient in the DNA damage repair pathway called homologous recombination (HR), rendering these cancers exquisitely vulnerable to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s. This functional state and therapeutic sensitivity is referred to as “BRCAness” and is most commonly associated with some breast cancer types. Pharmaceutical induction of BRCAness could expand the use of PARP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s to other tumor types. For example, <i>BRCA</i> mutations are present in only ~20% of prostate cancer patients. We found that castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells showed increased expression of a set of HR-associated genes, including <i>BRCA1</i>, <i>RAD54L</i>, and <i>RMI2</i>. Although androgen-targeted therapy is typically not effective in CRPC patients, the androgen receptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> enzalutamide suppressed the expression of those HR genes in CRPC cells, thus creating HR deficiency and BRCAness. A “lead-in” treatment strategy, in which enzalutamide was followed by the PARP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> olaparib, promoted DNA damage–induced cell death and inhibited clonal proliferation of prostate cancer cells in culture and suppressed the growth of prostate cancer xenografts in mice. Thus, antiandrogen and PARP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> combination therapy may be effective for CRPC patients and suggests that pharmaceutically inducing BRCAness may expand the clinical use of PARP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s.</p>

Human-level performance in 3D multiplayer games with population-based reinforcement learning
<p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great success in increasingly complex single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">agent</span></strong> environments and two-player turn-based games. However, the real world contains multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">agent</span></strong>s, each learning and acting independently to cooperate and compete with other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">agent</span></strong>s. We used a tournament-style evaluation to demonstrate that an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">agent</span></strong> can achieve human-level performance in a three-dimensional multiplayer first-person video game, <i>Quake III Arena</i> in Capture the Flag mode, using only pixels and game points scored as input.

Each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">agent</span></strong> learns its own internal reward signal and rich representation of the world.

Laser cooling of ions in a neutral plasma

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
A Maternally Deposited Endosperm Cuticle Contributes to the Physiological Defects of <i>transparent testa</i> Seeds
<p>Mature dry seeds are highly resilient plant structures where the encapsulated embryo is kept protected and dormant to facilitate its ultimate dispersion. Seed viability is heavily dependent on the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>’s capacity to shield living tissues from mechanical and oxidative stress. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>, also called the testa, arises after the differentiation of maternal ovular integuments during seed development. We recently described a thick cuticle tightly embedded in the mature seed’s endosperm cell wall. We show here that it is produced by the maternal inner integument 1 layer and, remarkably, transferred to the developing endosperm. Arabidopsis <i>transparent testa</i> (<i>tt</i>) mutations cause maternally derived seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong>ation defects. <i>TT</i> gene products encode proteins involved in flavonoid metabolism and regulators of seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> development. <i>tt</i> mutants have abnormally high seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> permeability, resulting in lower seed viability and dormancy. However, the biochemical basis of this high permeability is not fully understood. We show that the cuticles of developing <i>tt</i> mutant integuments have profound structural defects, which are associated with enhanced cuticle permeability. Genetic analysis indicates that a functional proanthocyanidin synthesis pathway is required to limit cuticle permeability, and our results suggest that proanthocyanidins could be intrinsic components of the cuticle. Together, these results show that the formation of a maternal cuticle is an intrinsic part of the normal integumental differentiation program leading to testa formation and is essential for the seed’s physiological properties.</p>

<i>MYB52</i> Negatively Regulates Pectin Demethylesterification in Seed Coat Mucilage
<p>Pectin, which is a major component of the plant primary cell walls, is synthesized and methyl-esterified in the Golgi apparatus and then demethylesterified by pectin methylesterases (PMEs) located in the cell wall. The degree of methylesterification affects the functional properties of pectin, and thereby influences plant growth, development and defense. However, little is known about the mechanisms that regulate pectin demethylesterification. Here, we show that in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> mucilage, the absence of the <i>MYB52</i> transcription factor is correlated with an increase in PME activity and a decrease in the degree of pectin methylesterification. Decreased methylesterification in the <i>myb52</i> mutant is also correlated with an increase in the calcium content of the seed mucilage. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis and molecular genetic studies suggest that <i>MYB52</i> transcriptionally activates <i>PECTIN METHYLESTERASE INHIBITOR6</i> (<i>PMEI6</i>), <i>PMEI14</i>, and <i>SUBTILISIN-LIKE SER PROTEASE1.7</i> (<i>SBT1.7</i>) by binding to their promoters. <i>PMEI6</i> and <i>SBT1.7</i> have previously been shown to be involved in seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> mucilage demethylesterification. Our characterization of two <i>PMEI14</i> mutants suggests that PMEI14 has a role in seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> mucilage demethylesterification, although its activity may be confined to the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> in contrast to PMEI6, which functions in the whole seed. Our demonstration that <i>MYB52</i> negatively regulates pectin demethylesterification in seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> mucilage, and the identification of components of the molecular network involved, provides new insight into the regulatory mechanism controlling pectin demethylesterification and increases our understanding of the transcriptional regulation network involved in seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> mucilage formation.</p>

Targeting NOTCH activation in small cell lung cancer through LSD1 inhibition
<p>Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a recalcitrant, aggressive neuroendocrine-type cancer for which little change to first-line standard-of-care treatment has occurred within the last few decades. Unlike nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), SCLC harbors few actionable mutations for therapeutic intervention. Lysine-specific histone demethylase 1A (LSD1 also known as KDM1A) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s were previously shown to have selective activity in SCLC models, but the underlying mechanism was elusive. Here, we found that exposure to the selective LSD1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> ORY-1001 activated the NOTCH pathway, resulting in the suppression of the transcription factor ASCL1 and the repression of SCLC tumorigenesis. Our analyses revealed that LSD1 bound to the <i>NOTCH1</i> locus, thereby suppressing NOTCH1 expression and downstream signaling. Reactivation of NOTCH signaling with the LSD1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> reduced the expression of ASCL1 and neuroendocrine cell lineage genes. Knockdown studies confirmed the pharmacological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>-based results. In vivo, sensitivity to LSD1 inhibition in SCLC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models correlated with the extent of consequential NOTCH pathway activation and repression of a neuroendocrine phenotype. Complete and durable tumor regression occurred with ORY-1001–induced NOTCH activation in a chemoresistant PDX model. Our findings reveal how LSD1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s function in this tumor and support their potential as a new and targeted therapy for SCLC.</p>

Skp2-dependent reactivation of AKT drives resistance to PI3K inhibitors
<p>The PI3K-AKT kinase signaling pathway is frequently deregulated in human cancers, particularly breast cancer, where amplification and somatic mutations of <i>PIK3CA</i> occur with high frequency in patients. Numerous small-molecule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s targeting both PI3K and AKT are under clinical evaluation, but dose-limiting toxicities and the emergence of resistance limit therapeutic efficacy. Various resistance mechanisms to PI3K <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s have been identified, including de novo mutations, feedback activation of AKT, or cross-talk pathways. We found a previously unknown resistance mechanism to PI3K pathway inhibition that results in AKT rebound activation. In a subset of triple-negative breast cancer cell lines, treatment with a PI3K <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> or depletion of <i>PIK3CA</i> expression ultimately promoted AKT reactivation in a manner dependent on the E3 ubiquitin ligase Skp2, the kinases IGF-1R (insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor) and PDK-1 (phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1), and the cell growth and metabolism-regulating complex mTORC2 (mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2), but was independent of PI3K activity or PIP<sub>3</sub> production. Resistance to PI3K <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s correlated with the increased abundance of Skp2, ubiquitylation of AKT, cell proliferation in culture, and xenograft tumor growth in mice. These findings reveal a ubiquitin signaling feedback mechanism by which PI3K <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> resistance may emerge in aggressive breast cancer cells.</p>

Identification of a selective small-molecule inhibitor of type 1 adenylyl cyclase activity with analgesic properties
<p>Adenylyl cyclase 1 (AC1) belongs to a group of adenylyl cyclases (ACs) that are stimulated by calcium in a calmodulin-dependent manner. Studies with AC1 knockout mice suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s of AC1 may be useful for treating pain and opioid dependence. However, nonselective inhibition of AC isoforms could result in substantial adverse effects. We used chemical library screening to identify a selective AC1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> with a chromone core structure that may represent a new analgesic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">agent</span></strong>. After demonstrating that the compound (ST034307) inhibited Ca<sup>2+</sup>-stimulated adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells stably transfected with AC1 (HEK-AC1 cells), we confirmed selectivity for AC1 by testing against all isoforms of membrane-bound ACs. ST034307 also inhibited AC1 activity stimulated by forskolin- and Gα<sub>s</sub>-coupled receptors in HEK-AC1 cells and showed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>y activity in multiple AC1-containing membrane preparations and mouse hippocampal homogenates. ST034307 enhanced μ-opioid receptor (MOR)–mediated inhibition of AC1 in short-term inhibition assays in HEK-AC1 cells stably transfected with MOR; however, the compound blocked heterologous sensitization of AC1 caused by chronic MOR activation in these cells. ST034307 reduced pain responses in a mouse model of inflammatory pain. Our data indicate that ST034307 is a selective small-molecule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> of AC1 and suggest that selective AC1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s may be useful for managing pain.</p>

Mechanistic origin and prediction of enhanced ductility in magnesium alloys
<p>Pure magnesium exhibits poor ductility owing to pyramidal [Formula] dislocation transformations to immobile structures, making this lowest-density structural metal unusable for many applications where it could enhance energy efficiency. We show why magnesium can be made ductile by specific dilute solute additions, which increase the [Formula] cross-slip and multiplication rates to levels much faster than the deleterious [Formula] transformation, enabling both favorable texture during processing and continued <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong> straining during deformation. A quantitative theory establishes the conditions for ductility as a function of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong> composition in very good agreement with experiments on many existing magnesium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong>s, and the solute-enhanced cross-slip mechanism is confirmed by transmission electron microscopy observations in magnesium-yttrium.

<i>Rb1</i> and <i>Trp53</i> cooperate to suppress prostate cancer lineage plasticity, metastasis, and antiandrogen resistance
<p>Prostate cancer relapsing from antiandrogen therapies can exhibit variant histology with altered lineage marker expression, suggesting that lineage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity facilitates therapeutic resistance. The mechanisms underlying prostate cancer lineage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity are incompletely understood. Studying mouse models, we demonstrate that <i>Rb1</i> loss facilitates lineage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity and metastasis of prostate adenocarcinoma initiated by <i>Pten</i> mutation. Additional loss of <i>Trp53</i> causes resistance to antiandrogen therapy.

Clinically relevant Ezh2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s restore androgen receptor expression and sensitivity to antiandrogen therapy.

The Tomato Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase SlMPK1 Is as a Negative Regulator of the High-Temperature Stress Response
<p>High-temperature (HT) stress is a major environmental stress that limits plant growth and development. MAPK cascades play key roles in plant growth and stress signaling, but their involvement in the HT stress response is poorly understood. Here, we describe a 47-kD MBP-phosphorylated protein (p47-MBPK) activated in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) leaves under HT and identify it as SlMPK1 by tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Silencing of <i>SlMPK1</i> in transgenic tomato plants resulted in enhanced tolerance to HT, while overexpression resulted in reduced tolerance. Proteomic analysis identified a set of proteins involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ant defense that are significantly more abundant in RNA interference-<i>SlMPK1</i> plants than nontransgenic plants under HT stress. RNA interference-<i>SlMPK1</i> plants also showed changes in membrane lipid peroxidation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ant enzyme activities. Furthermore, using yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified a serine-proline-rich protein homolog, SlSPRH1, which interacts with SlMPK1 in yeast, in plant cells, and in vitro. We demonstrate that SlMPK1 can directly phosphorylate SlSPRH1. Furthermore, the serine residue serine-44 of SlSPRH1 is a crucial phosphorylation site in the SlMPK1-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ant defense mechanism activated during HT stress. We also demonstrate that heterologous expression of <i>SlSPRH1</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) led to a decrease in thermotolerance and lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ant capacity. Taken together, our results suggest that SlMPK1 is a negative regulator of thermotolerance in tomato plants. SlMPK1 acts by regulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ant defense, and its substrate SlSPRH1 is involved in this pathway.</p>

The MYB107 Transcription Factor Positively Regulates Suberin Biosynthesis
<p>Suberin, a lipophilic polymer deposited in the outer integument of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>, represents an essential sealing component controlling water and solute movement and protecting seed from pathogenic infection. Although many genes responsible for suberin synthesis are identified, the regulatory components controlling its biosynthesis have not been definitively determined. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis MYB107 transcription factor acts as a positive regulator controlling suberin biosynthetic gene expression in the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>. <i>MYB107</i> coexpresses with suberin biosynthetic genes in a temporal manner during seed development. Disrupting <i>MYB107</i> particularly suppresses the expression of genes involved in suberin but not cutin biosynthesis, lowers seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> suberin accumulation, alters suberin lamellar structure, and consequently renders higher seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> permeability and susceptibility to abiotic stresses. Furthermore, MYB107 directly binds to the promoters of suberin biosynthetic genes, verifying its primary role in regulating their expression. Identifying MYB107 as a positive regulator for seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> suberin synthesis offers a basis for discovering the potential transcriptional network behind one of the most abundant lipid-based polymers in nature.</p>

Developmental Defects Mediated by the P1/HC-Pro Potyviral Silencing Suppressor Are Not Due to Misregulation of <i>AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 8</i>
<p>Plant viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong>s of RNA silencing induce developmental defects similar to those caused by mutations in genes involved in the microRNA pathway. A recent report has attributed viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong>-mediated developmental defects to up-regulation of <i>AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 8</i> (<i>ARF8</i>), a target of miR167. The key piece of evidence was that the developmental defects in transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) expressing viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong>s were greatly alleviated in the F1 progeny of a cross with plants carrying the <i>arf8-6</i> mutation. <i>Arf8-6</i> is a SALK line T-DNA insertion mutant, a class of mutations prone to inducing transcriptional silencing of transgenes expressed from the 35S promoter. We have reinvestigated the role of <i>ARF8</i> in viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong>-mediated developmental defects, using two independent <i>arf8</i> mutations and the P1/HC-Pro potyviral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> of silencing. Progeny of a cross between <i>P1/HC-Pro</i> transgenic Arabidopsis and the <i>arf8-6</i> T-DNA insertion mutant showed little effect on the P1/HC-Pro phenotype in the F1 generation, but almost all <i>arf8-6</i>/<i>P1/HC-Pro</i> progeny had lost the phenotype in the F2 generation. However, the loss of phenotype in the F2 generation was not correlated with the number of functional copies of the <i>ARF8</i> gene. Instead, it reflected transcriptional silencing of the <i>P1/HC-Pro</i> transgene, as evidenced by a pronounced decrease in P1/HC-Pro mRNA and the appearance of 35S promoter small interfering RNAs. Furthermore, an independent loss-of-function point mutation, <i>Arf8-8</i>, had no detectable effects on P1/HC-Pro phenotype in either the F1 or F2 generations. Together, these data argue against the previously reported role of increased <i>ARF8</i> expression in developmental defects caused by <i>P1/HC-Pro</i>.</p>

Cardiovascular Effects of Performance-Enhancing Drugs
<p>Exercise and competitive sports should be associated with a wide range of health benefits with the potential to inspire a positive community health legacy. However, the reputation of sports is being threatened by an ever-expanding armamentarium of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">agent</span></strong>s with real or perceived benefits in performance enhancement. In addition to the injustice of unfair advantage for dishonest athletes, significant potential health risks are associated with performance-enhancing drugs. Performance-enhancing drugs may have an effect on the cardiovascular system by means of directly altering the myocardium, vasculature, and metabolism. However, less frequently considered is the potential for indirect effects caused through enabling athletes to push beyond normal physiological limits with the potential consequence of exercise-induced arrhythmias. This review will summarize the known health effects of PEDs but will also focus on the potentially greater health threat posed by the covert search for performance-enhancing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">agent</span></strong>s that have yet to be recognized by the World Anti-Doping Agency. History has taught us that athletes are subjected to unmonitored trials with experimental drugs that have little or no established efficacy or safety data. One approach to decrease drug abuse in sports would be to accept that there is a delay from when athletes start experimenting with novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">agent</span></strong>s to the time when authorities become aware of these drugs. This provides a window of opportunity for athletes to exploit with relative immunity. It could be argued that all off-label use of any <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">agent</span></strong> should be deemed illegal.</p>

Medical Therapy for Secondary Prevention and Long-Term Outcome in Patients With Myocardial Infarction With Nonobstructive Coronary Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) occurs in 5% to 10% of all patients with myocardial infarction. Clinical trials of secondary prevention treatment in MINOCA patients are lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the associations between treatment with statins, renin-angiotensin system blockers, β-blockers, dual antiplatelet therapy, and long-term cardiovascular events.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This is an observational study of MINOCA patients recorded in the SWEDEHEART registry (the Swedish Web-system for Enhancement and Development of Evidence-based care in Heart disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapy) between July 2003 and June 2013 and followed until December 2013 for outcome events in the Swedish Cause of Death Register and National Patient Register. Of 199 162 myocardial infarction admissions, 9466 consecutive unique patients with MINOCA were identified.

The exposures were treatment at discharge with statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s/angiotensin receptor blockers, β-blockers, and dual antiplatelet therapy.

Nrf2 inactivation enhances placental angiogenesis in a preeclampsia mouse model and improves maternal and fetal outcomes
<p>Placental activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a key role in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are thought to affect placental angiogenesis, which is critical for preventing preeclampsia pathology. We examined the role of ROS in preeclampsia by genetically modifying the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway, a cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ant defense system, in a mouse model of RAS-induced preeclampsia. Nrf2 deficiency would be expected to impair cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ant responses; however, Nrf2 deficiency in preeclamptic mice improved maternal and fetal survival, ameliorated intra-uterine growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retard</span></strong>ation, and augmented oxidative DNA damage. Furthermore, the placentas of Nrf2-deficient mice had increased endothelial cell proliferation with dense vascular networks. In contrast, the placentas of preeclamptic mice with overactive Nrf2 showed repressed angiogenesis, which was associated with decreased expression of genes encoding angiogenic chemokines and cytokines. Our findings support the notion that ROS-mediated signaling is essential for maintaining placental angiogenesis in preeclampsia and may provide mechanistic insight into the negative results of clinical trials for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ants in preeclampsia.</p>

Spin coating epitaxial films
<p>Spin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed films, such as photoresists for lithography or perovskite films for solar cells, are either amorphous or polycrystalline. We show that epitaxial films of inorganic materials such as cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr<sub>3</sub>), lead(II) iodide (PbI<sub>2</sub>), zinc oxide (ZnO), and sodium chloride (NaCl) can be deposited onto a variety of single-crystal and single-crystal–like substrates by simply spin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ing either solutions of the material or precursors to the material. The out-of-plane and in-plane orientations of the spin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ed films are determined by the substrate. The thin stagnant layer of supersaturated solution produced during spin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ing promotes heterogeneous nucleation of the material onto the single-crystal substrate over homogeneous nucleation in the bulk solution, and ordered anion adlayers may lower the activation energy for nucleation on the surface. The method can be used to produce functional materials such as inorganic semiconductors or to deposit water-soluble materials such as NaCl that can serve as growth templates.</p>

Quantum-critical conductivity of the Dirac fluid in graphene
<p>Graphene near charge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong>ity is expected to behave like a quantum-critical, relativistic plasma—the “Dirac fluid”—in which massless electrons and holes collide at a rapid rate.

At charge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong>ity, we observed the quantum-critical scattering rate characteristic of the Dirac fluid.

Multicomponent intermetallic nanoparticles and superb mechanical behaviors of complex alloys
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong> design based on single–principal-element systems has approached its limit for performance enhancements. A substantial increase in strength up to gigapascal levels typically causes the premature failure of materials with reduced ductility. Here, we report a strategy to break this trade-off by controllably introducing high-density ductile multicomponent intermetallic nanoparticles (MCINPs) in complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong> systems. Distinct from the intermetallic-induced embrittlement under conventional wisdom, such MCINP-strengthened <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong>s exhibit superior strengths of 1.5 gigapascals and ductility as high as 50% in tension at ambient temperature. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong> instability, a major concern for high-strength materials, can be completely eliminated by generating a distinctive multistage work-hardening behavior, resulting from pronounced dislocation activities and deformation-induced microbands. This MCINP strategy offers a paradigm to develop next-generation materials for structural applications.</p>

We show that nanotubes can grow chiral because of the configurational entropy of their nanometer-sized edge, thus explaining experimentally observed temperature evolutions of chiral distributions. Taking the chemical nature of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong> into account through interfacial energies, we derive structural maps and phase diagrams that will guide a rational choice of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong> and growth parameters toward a better selectivity.</p>

Locally coordinated synaptic plasticity of visual cortex neurons in vivo
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity of cortical responses in vivo involves activity-dependent changes at synapses, but the manner in which different forms of synaptic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity act together to create functional changes in neurons remains unknown. We found that spike timing–induced receptive field <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity of visual cortex neurons in mice is anchored by increases in the synaptic strength of identified spines. This is accompanied by a decrease in the strength of adjacent spines on a slower time scale. The locally coordinated potentiation and depression of spines involves prominent AMPA receptor redistribution via targeted expression of the immediate early gene product Arc. Hebbian strengthening of activated synapses and heterosynaptic weakening of adjacent synapses thus cooperatively orchestrate cell-wide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity of functional neuronal responses.</p>

Loci associated with skin pigmentation identified in African populations
<p>Despite the wide range of skin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong>ation in humans, little is known about its genetic basis in global populations. Examining ethnically diverse African genomes, we identify variants in or near <i>SLC24A5</i>, <i>MFSD12</i>, <i>DDB1</i>, <i>TMEM138</i>, <i>OCA2</i>, and <i>HERC2</i> that are significantly associated with skin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong>ation. Genetic evidence indicates that the light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong>ation variant at <i>SLC24A5</i> was introduced into East Africa by gene flow from non-Africans. At all other loci, variants associated with dark <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong>ation in Africans are identical by descent in South Asian and Australo-Melanesian populations. Functional analyses indicate that <i>MFSD12</i> encodes a lysosomal protein that affects melanogenesis in zebrafish and mice, and that mutations in melanocyte-specific regulatory regions near <i>DDB1/TMEM138</i> correlate with expression of ultraviolet response genes under selection in Eurasians.</p>

Potent peptidic fusion inhibitors of influenza virus
<p>Influenza therapeutics with new targets and mechanisms of action are urgently needed to combat potential pandemics, emerging viruses, and constantly mutating strains in circulation. We report here on the design and structural characterization of potent peptidic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s of influenza hemagglutinin. The peptide design was based on complementarity-determining region loops of human broadly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong>izing antibodies against the hemagglutinin (FI6v3 and CR9114). The optimized peptides exhibit nanomolar affinity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong>ization against influenza A group 1 viruses, including the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and avian H5N1 strains. The peptide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s bind to the highly conserved stem epitope and block the low pH–induced conformational rearrangements associated with membrane fusion. These peptidic compounds and their advantageous biological properties should accelerate the development of new small molecule– and peptide-based therapeutics against influenza virus.</p>

Preventing mussel adhesion using lubricant-infused materials
<p>Mussels are opportunistic macrofouling organisms that can attach to most immersed solid surfaces, leading to serious economic and ecological consequences for the maritime and aquaculture industries. We demonstrate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lubric</span></strong>ant-infused <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>ings exhibit very low preferential mussel attachment and ultralow adhesive strengths under both controlled laboratory conditions and in marine field studies. Detailed investigations across multiple length scales—from the molecular-scale characterization of deposited adhesive proteins to nanoscale contact mechanics to macroscale live observations—suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lubric</span></strong>ant infusion considerably reduces fouling by deceiving the mechanosensing ability of mussels, deterring secretion of adhesive threads, and decreasing the molecular work of adhesion. Our study demonstrates that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lubric</span></strong>ant infusion represents an effective strategy to mitigate marine biofouling and provides insights into the physical mechanisms underlying adhesion prevention.</p>

Restoring auditory cortex plasticity in adult mice by restricting thalamic adenosine signaling
<p>Circuits in the auditory cortex are highly susceptible to acoustic influences during an early postnatal critical period. The auditory cortex selectively expands neural representations of enriched acoustic stimuli, a process important for human language acquisition. Adults lack this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity. Here we show in the murine auditory cortex that juvenile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity can be reestablished in adulthood if acoustic stimuli are paired with disruption of ecto-5′-nucleotidase–dependent adenosine production or A<sub>1</sub>–adenosine receptor signaling in the auditory thalamus. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity occurs at the level of cortical maps and individual neurons in the auditory cortex of awake adult mice and is associated with long-term improvement of tone-discrimination abilities. We conclude that, in adult mice, disrupting adenosine signaling in the thalamus rejuvenates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity in the auditory cortex and improves auditory perception.</p>

Activity-based protein profiling reveals off-target proteins of the FAAH inhibitor BIA 10-2474
<p>A recent phase 1 trial of the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> BIA 10-2474 led to the death of one volunteer and produced mild-to-severe neurological symptoms in four others. Although the cause of the clinical neurotoxicity is unknown, it has been postulated, given the clinical safety profile of other tested FAAH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s, that off-target activities of BIA 10-2474 may have played a role. Here we use activity-based proteomic methods to determine the protein interaction landscape of BIA 10-2474 in human cells and tissues. This analysis revealed that the drug inhibits several lipases that are not targeted by PF04457845, a highly selective and clinically tested FAAH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>. BIA 10-2474, but not PF04457845, produced substantial alterations in lipid networks in human cortical neurons, suggesting that promiscuous lipase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s have the potential to cause metabolic dysregulation in the nervous system.</p>

“Ab initio” synthesis of zeolites for preestablished catalytic reactions
<p>Unlike homogeneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong>s that are often designed for particular reactions, zeolites are heterogeneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong>s that are explored and optimized in a heuristic fashion.

In these zeolites, the pores and cavities could be generated approaching a molecular-recognition pattern. For disproportionation of toluene and isomerization of ethylbenzene into xylenes, the TSs are larger than the reaction products. Zeolite ITQ-27 showed high disproportionation activity, and ITQ-64 showed high selectivity for the desired para and ortho isomers.

<i>SOX2</i> promotes lineage plasticity and antiandrogen resistance in <i>TP53</i>- and <i>RB1</i>-deficient prostate cancer
<p>Some cancers evade targeted therapies through a mechanism known as lineage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity, whereby tumor cells acquire phenotypic characteristics of a cell lineage whose survival no longer depends on the drug target. We use in vitro and in vivo human prostate cancer models to show that these tumors can develop resistance to the antiandrogen drug enzalutamide by a phenotypic shift from androgen receptor (AR)–dependent luminal epithelial cells to AR-independent basal-like cells. This lineage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity is enabled by the loss of TP53 and RB1 function, is mediated by increased expression of the reprogramming transcription factor <i>SOX2</i>, and can be reversed by restoring TP53 and RB1 function or by inhibiting <i>SOX2</i> expression. Thus, mutations in tumor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> genes can create a state of increased cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity that, when challenged with antiandrogen therapy, promotes resistance through lineage switching.</p>

Jasmonic Acid Inhibits Auxin-Induced Lateral Rooting Independently of the CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 Receptor
<p>Plant root systems are indispensable for water uptake, nutrient acquisition, and anchoring plants in the soil. Previous studies using auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s definitively established that auxin plays a central role regulating root growth and development. Most auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s affect all auxin signaling at the same time, which obscures an understanding of individual events. Here, we report that jasmonic acid (JA) functions as a lateral root (LR)-preferential auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) in a manner that is independent of the JA receptor, CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 (COI1). Treatment of wild-type Arabidopsis with either (−)-JA or (+)-JA reduced primary root length and LR number; the reduction of LR number was also observed in <i>coi1</i> mutants. Treatment of seedlings with (−)-JA or (+)-JA suppressed auxin-inducible genes related to LR formation, diminished accumulation of the auxin reporter <i>DR5::GUS</i>, and inhibited auxin-dependent DII-VENUS degradation. A structural mimic of (−)-JA and (+)-coronafacic acid also inhibited LR formation and stabilized DII-VENUS protein. COI1-independent activity was retained in the double mutant of <i>transport <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> response1</i> and <i>auxin signaling f-box protein2</i> (<i>tir1 afb2</i>) but reduced in the <i>afb5</i> single mutant. These results reveal JAs and (+)-coronafacic acid to be selective counter-auxins, a finding that could lead to new approaches for studying the mechanisms of LR formation.</p>

Functional Analysis of Short Linear Motifs in the Plant Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor SIAMESE
<p>Endoreplication, a modified cell cycle in which DNA is replicated without subsequent cell division, plays an important but poorly understood role in plant growth and in plant responses to biotic and abiotic stress. The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>SIAMESE</i> (<i>SIM</i>) gene encodes the first identified member of the SIAMESE-RELATED (SMR) family of cyclin-dependent kinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s. <i>SIM</i> controls endoreplication during trichome development, and <i>sim</i> mutant trichomes divide several times instead of endoreplicating their DNA. The SMR family is defined by several short linear amino acid sequence motifs of largely unknown function, and family members have little sequence similarity to any known protein functional domains. Here, we investigated the roles of the conserved motifs in <i>SIM</i> site-directed Arabidopsis mutants using several functional assays. We identified a potential cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-binding site, which bears no resemblance to other known CDK interaction motifs. We also identified a potential site of phosphorylation and two redundant nuclear localization sequences. Surprisingly, the only motif with similarity to the other family of plant CDK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>/INTERACTOR OF CDC2 KINASE/KIP-RELATED PROTEIN proteins, is not required for <i>SIM</i> function in vivo. Because even highly divergent members of the <i>SMR</i> family are able to replace <i>SIM</i> function in Arabidopsis trichomes, it is likely that the results obtained here for <i>SIM</i> will apply to other members of this plant-specific family of CDK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s.</p>

Carnosic Acid and Carnosol, Two Major Antioxidants of Rosemary, Act through Different Mechanisms
<p>Carnosic acid, a phenolic diterpene specific to the Lamiaceae family, is highly abundant in rosemary (<i>Rosmarinus officinalis</i>). Despite numerous industrial and medicinal/pharmaceutical applications of its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ative features, this compound in planta and its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ant mechanism have received little attention, except a few studies of rosemary plants under natural conditions. In vitro analyses, using high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet and luminescence imaging, revealed that carnosic acid and its major oxidized derivative, carnosol, protect lipids from oxidation. Both compounds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">preserv</span></strong>ed linolenic acid and monogalactosyldiacylglycerol from singlet oxygen and from hydroxyl radical. When applied exogenously, they were both able to protect thylakoid membranes prepared from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves against lipid peroxidation. Different levels of carnosic acid and carnosol in two contrasting rosemary varieties correlated with tolerance to lipid peroxidation. Upon reactive oxygen species (ROS) oxidation of lipids, carnosic acid was consumed and oxidized into various derivatives, including into carnosol, while carnosol resisted, suggesting that carnosic acid is a chemical quencher of ROS. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ative function of carnosol relies on another mechanism, occurring directly in the lipid oxidation process. Under oxidative conditions that did not involve ROS generation, carnosol inhibited lipid peroxidation, contrary to carnosic acid. Using spin probes and electron paramagnetic resonance detection, we confirmed that carnosic acid, rather than carnosol, is a ROS quencher. Various oxidized derivatives of carnosic acid were detected in rosemary leaves in low light, indicating chronic oxidation of this compound, and accumulated in plants exposed to stress conditions, in parallel with a loss of carnosic acid, confirming that chemical quenching of ROS by carnosic acid takes place in planta.</p>

Genetic Control of Plasticity in Root Morphology and Anatomy of Rice in Response to Water Deficit
<p>Elucidating the genetic control of rooting behavior under water-deficit stress is essential to breed climate-robust rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) cultivars. Using a diverse panel of 274 <i>indica</i> genotypes grown under control and water-deficit conditions during vegetative growth, we phenotyped 35 traits, mostly related to root morphology and anatomy, involving 45,000 root-scanning images and nearly 25,000 cross sections from the root-shoot junction. The phenotypic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity of these traits was quantified as the relative change in trait value under water-deficit compared with control conditions. We then carried out a genome-wide association analysis on these traits and their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity, using 45,608 high-quality single-nucleotide polymorphisms. One hundred four significant loci were detected for these traits under control conditions, 106 were detected under water-deficit stress, and 76 were detected for trait <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity. We predicted 296 (control), 284 (water-deficit stress), and 233 (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plastic</span></strong>ity) a priori candidate genes within linkage disequilibrium blocks for these loci. We identified key a priori candidate genes regulating root growth and development and relevant alleles that, upon validation, can help improve rice adaptation to water-deficit stress.</p>

Identification and Characterization of Arabidopsis Seed Coat Mucilage Proteins
<p>Plant cell wall proteins are important regulators of cell wall architecture and function. However, because cell wall proteins are difficult to extract and analyze, they are generally poorly understood. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of proteins integral to the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> mucilage, a specialized layer of the extracellular matrix composed of plant cell wall carbohydrates that is used as a model for cell wall research. The proteins identified in mucilage include those previously identified by genetic analysis, and several mucilage proteins are reduced in mucilage-deficient mutant seeds, suggesting that these proteins are genuinely associated with the mucilage. Arabidopsis mucilage has both nonadherent and adherent layers. Both layers have similar protein profiles except for proteins involved in lipid metabolism, which are present exclusively in the adherent mucilage. The most abundant mucilage proteins include a family of proteins named TESTA ABUNDANT1 (TBA1) to TBA3; a less abundant fourth homolog was named TBA-LIKE (TBAL). <i>TBA</i> and <i>TBAL</i> transcripts and promoter activities were detected in developing seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>s, and their expression requires seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> differentiation regulators. TBA proteins are secreted to the mucilage pocket during differentiation. Although reverse genetics failed to identify a function for TBAs/TBAL, the <i>TBA</i> promoters are highly expressed and cell type specific and so should be very useful tools for targeting proteins to the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> epidermis. Altogether, these results highlight the mucilage proteome as a model for cell walls in general, as it shares similarities with other cell wall proteomes while also containing mucilage-specific features.</p>

Optimization of Light-Harvesting Pigment Improves Photosynthetic Efficiency
<p>Maximizing light capture by light-harvesting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong> optimization represents an attractive but challenging strategy to improve photosynthetic efficiency. Here, we report that loss of a previously uncharacterized gene, <i>HIGH PHOTOSYNTHETIC EFFICIENCY1</i> (<i>HPE1</i>), optimizes light-harvesting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong>s, leading to improved photosynthetic efficiency and biomass production. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>hpe1</i> mutants show faster electron transport and increased contents of carbohydrates. <i>HPE1</i> encodes a chloroplast protein containing an RNA recognition motif that directly associates with and regulates the splicing of target RNAs of plastid genes. HPE1 also interacts with other plastid RNA-splicing factors, including CAF1 and OTP51, which share common targets with HPE1. Deficiency of HPE1 alters the expression of nucleus-encoded chlorophyll-related genes, probably through plastid-to-nucleus signaling, causing decreased total content of chlorophyll (<i>a</i>+<i>b</i>) in a limited range but increased chlorophyll <i>a</i>/<i>b</i> ratio. Interestingly, this adjustment of light-harvesting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong> reduces antenna size, improves light capture, decreases energy loss, mitigates photodamage, and enhances photosynthetic quantum yield during photosynthesis. Our findings suggest a novel strategy to optimize light-harvesting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong>s that improves photosynthetic efficiency and biomass production in higher plants.</p>

Activation of the cnidarian oxidative stress response by ultraviolet radiation, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and crude oil
<p>Organisms are continuously exposed to reactive chemicals capable of causing oxidative stress and cellular damage. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutases (SODs) and catalases, are present in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes and provide an important means of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong>izing such oxidants. Studies in cnidarians have previously documented the occurrence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ant enzymes (transcript expression, protein expression and/or enzymatic activity), but most of these studies have not been conducted in species with sequenced genomes or included phylogenetic analyses, making it difficult to compare results across species due to uncertainties in the relationships between genes. Through searches of the genome of the sea anemone <i>Nematostella vectensis</i> Stephenson, one catalase gene and six SOD family members were identified, including three copper/zinc-containing SODs (CuZnSODs), two manganese-containing SODs (MnSODs) and one copper chaperone of SOD (CCS). In 24 h acute toxicity tests, juvenile <i>N. vectensis</i> showed enhanced sensitivity to combinations of ultraviolet radiation (UV) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs, specifically pyrene, benzo[a]pyrene and fluoranthene) relative to either stressor alone. Adult <i>N. vectensis</i> exhibited little or no mortality following UV, benzo[a]pyrene or crude oil exposure but exhibited changes in gene expression. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ant enzyme transcripts were both upregulated and downregulated following UV and/or chemical exposure. Expression patterns were most strongly affected by UV exposure but varied between experiments, suggesting that responses vary according to the intensity and duration of exposure. These experiments provide a basis for comparison with other cnidarian taxa and for further studies of the oxidative stress response in <i>N. vectensis.</i></p>

Comparison of the elution properties of commercially available gentamicin and bone cement containing vancomycin with ‘home-made’ preparations
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Vancomycin is commonly added to acrylic bone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong> during revision   arthroplasty surgery. Proprietary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong> preparations containing   vancomycin are available, but are significantly more expensive.   We investigated whether the elution of antibiotic from ‘home-made’   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong> containing vancomycin was comparable with more expensive   commercially available vancomycin impregnated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A total of 18 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong> discs containing either proprietary CopalG+V;   or ‘home-made’ CopalR+G with vancomycin added by hand, were made.   Each disc contained the same amount of antibiotic (0.5 g gentamycin,   2 g vancomycin) and was immersed in ammonium acetate buffer in a   sealed container. Fluid from each container was sampled at eight   time points over a two-week period. The concentrations of gentamicin   and vancomycin in the fluid were analysed using high performance   liquid chromatography mass spectrometry.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The highest peak concentrations of antibiotic were observed from   the ‘home-made’ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>s containing vancomycin, added as in the operating   theatre. The overall elution of antibiotic was, fivefold (vancomycin)   and twofold (gentamicin) greater from the ‘home-made’ mix compared   with the commercially mixed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>. The use of a vacuum during mixing   had no significant effect on antibiotic elution in any of the samples.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These findings suggest that the addition of 2 g vancomycin powder   to gentamicin-impregnated bone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong> by hand significantly increases   the elution of both antibiotics compared with commercially prepared   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>s containing vancomycin. We found no significant advantages   of using expensive commercially produced vancomycin-impregnated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>   and recommend the addition of vancomycin powder by hand in the operating theatre.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:73–7.</p></sec>

Risk of early mortality after cemented compared with cementless total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>It has been suggested that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ed fixation of total hip arthroplasty   (THA) is associated with an increased peri-operative mortality compared   with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>less THA. Our aim was to investigate this through a nationwide   matched cohort study adjusting for age, comorbidity, and socioeconomic   background.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 178 784 patients with osteoarthritis who underwent   either <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ed or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>less THA from the Swedish Hip Arthroplasty   Register were matched with 862 294 controls from the general population.   Information about the causes of death, comorbidities, and socioeconomic   background was obtained. Mortality within the first 90 days after   the operation was the primary outcome measure.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Patients who underwent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ed THA had an increased risk of   death during the first 14 days compared with the controls (hazard   ratio (HR) 1.3, confidence interval (CI) 1.11 to 1.44), corresponding   to an absolute increase in risk of five deaths per 10 000 observations.   No such early increase of risk was seen in those who underwent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>less THA.   Between days 15 and 29 the risk of mortality was decreased for those   with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ed THA (HR 0.7, CI 0.62 to 0.87). Between days 30 and   90 all patients undergoing THA, irrespective of the mode of fixation,   had a lower risk of death than controls. Patients selected for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>less   fixation were younger, healthier and had a higher level of education   and income than those selected for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ed THA. A supplementary   analysis of 16 556 hybrid THAs indicated that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ation of the   femoral component was associated with a slight increase in mortality   up to 15 days, whereas no such increase in mortality was seen in   those with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ed acetabular component combined with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>less   femoral component.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This nationwide matched cohort study indicates that patients   receiving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ed THA have a minimally increased relative risk   of early mortality that is reversed from day 15 and thereafter.   The absolute increase in risk is very small.

Long-term outcomes of cemented <i>versus</i> cementless humeral components in arthroplasty of the shoulder
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>In the initial development of total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA),   the humeral component was usually fixed with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>less   components were subsequently introduced. The aim of this study was   to compare the long-term outcome of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ed and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>less humeral   components in arthroplasty of the shoulder.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>All patients who underwent primary arthroplasty of the shoulder   at our institution between 1970 and 2012 were included in the study.   There were 4636 patients with 1167 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ed humeral components and   3469 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>less components. Patients with the two types of fixation   were matched for nine different covariates using a propensity score   analysis. A total of 551 well-balanced pairs of patients with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ed   and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>less components were available after matching for comparison   of the outcomes. The clinical outcomes which were analysed included loosening   of the humeral component determined at revision surgery, periprosthetic   fractures, post-operative infection and operating time.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The overall five-, ten-, 15- and 20-year rates of survival were   98.9%, 97.2%, 95.5%, and 94.4%, respectively.

Cement-in-cement revision of the femoral stem
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Compared with primary total hip arthroplasty (THA), revision   surgery can be challenging. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>-in-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong> femoral revision   technique involves removing a femoral component from a well-fixed   femoral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong> mantle and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ing a new stem into the original   mantle. This technique is widely used and when carried out for the   correct indications, is fast, relatively inexpensive and carries   a reduced short-term risk for the patient compared with the alternative   of removing well-fixed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>.

Fixation and clinical outcome of uncemented peri-apatite-coated <i>versus</i> cemented total knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The optimal method of tibial component fixation remains uncertain   in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Hydroxyapatite coatings have been   applied to improve bone ingrowth in un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ed designs, but may   only coat the directly accessible surface. As peri-apatite (PA)   is solution deposited, this may increase the coverage of the implant   surface and thereby fixation. We assessed the tibial component fixation   of un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ed PA-coated TKAs <i>versus</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ed TKAs.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Patients were randomised to PA-coated or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ed TKAs. In 60   patients (30 in each group), radiostereometric analysis of tibial   component migration was evaluated as the primary outcome at baseline,   three months post-operatively and at one, two and five years. A   linear mixed-effects model was used to analyse the repeated measurements.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>After five years of follow-up, one (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ed) component was revised   due to ligament instability. Overall, un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ed PA-coated tibial   components migrated significantly more    (p = 0.003), with the mean maximum total point motion (MTPM) at   five years being 0.62 mm (95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.49 to   0.76) for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ed tibial components and 0.97 mm (95% CI 0.81 to   1.15) for PA-coated tibial components in TKA. However, between three   months and five years the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ed TKAs migrated significantly more   (p = 0.02), displaying a MTPM of 0.27 mm (95% CI, 0.19 to 0.36) <i>versus</i> 0.13   mm (95% CI, 0.01 to 0.25) for PA-coated tibial components. One implant   in each group was considered at risk for aseptic loosening due to continuous   migration after five years of follow-up, albeit with different migration   patterns for each group (i.e. higher initial migration but diminishing   over time for the PA-coated component <i>versus</i> gradually   increasing migration for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ed component).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The tibial components of PA-coated TKAs showed more overall migration   compared with the tibial components of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ed TKAs.

Local bisphosphonate reduces migration and formation of radiolucent lines adjacent to cemented acetabular components
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Post-operative migration of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ed acetabular components as   measured by radiostereometric analysis (RSA) has a strong predictive   power for late, aseptic loosening. Also, radiolucent lines predict   late loosening. Migration has been reduced by systemic bisphosphonate   treatment in randomised trials of hip and knee arthroplasty. Used   as a local treatment, a higher local dose of bisphosphonate can   be achieved without systemic exposure. We wished to see if this   principle could be applied usefully in total hip arthroplasty (THA).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>In this randomised placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial with   60 participants, we compressed gauze soaked in bisphosphonate solution   (ibandronate) or saline against the acetabular bone bed immediately   before <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ing the acetabular component. RSA, classification of   radiolucent lines, the Harris Hip Score (HHS) and the Western Ontario McMasters   Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) were carried out at three-,   six-, 12-, and 24-month follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Migration of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ed acetabular component relative to the   pelvis was reduced by movement almost half in the ibandronate group,   when measured as maximum total point or as movement of the femoral   head (p = 0.001 and 0.004, respectively). Radiolucent lines after   one year were classified as absent, partial or complete, and correlated with   treatment (rho 0.37; p = 0.004). Only three of 30 patients in the   ibandronate group had complete lines, compared with 13 of 28 in   the placebo group (p = 0.002).

Continuous distal migration and internal rotation of the C-stem prosthesis without any adverse clinical effects
<p>In 2005, we demonstrated that the polished triple-tapered   C-stem at two years had migrated distally and rotated internally.   From that series, 33 patients have now been followed radiologically,   clinically and by radiostereometric analysis (RSA) for up to ten   years. The distal migration within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong> mantle had continued   and reached a mean of 2 mm (0.5 to 4.0) at ten years. Internal rotation,   also within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong> mantle, was a mean 3.8° (external 1.6° to   internal 6.6°) The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong> mantle did not show any sign of migration   or loosening in relation to the femoral bone. There were no clinical   or radiological signs indicating that the migration or rotation   within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong> mantle had had any adverse effects for the patients.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014;96-B:604–8.</p>

Handedness in shearing auxetics creates rigid and compliant structures
<p>In nature, repeated base units produce handed structures that selectively bond to make rigid or compliant materials. Auxetic tilings are scale-independent frameworks made from repeated unit cells that expand under tension. We discovered how to produce handedness in auxetic unit cells that shear as they expand by changing the symmetries and alignments of auxetic tilings. Using the symmetry and alignment rules that we developed, we made handed shearing auxetics that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tile</span></strong> planes, cylinders, and spheres. By compositing the handed shearing auxetics in a manner inspired by keratin and collagen, we produce both compliant structures that expand while twisting and deployable structures that can rigidly lock. This work opens up new possibilities in designing chemical frameworks, medical devices like stents, robotic systems, and deployable engineering structures.</p>

Pcdhαc2 is required for axonal tiling and assembly of serotonergic circuitries in mice
<p>Serotonergic neurons project their axons pervasively throughout the brain and innervate various target fields in a space-filling manner, leading to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tile</span></strong>d arrangements of their axon terminals to allow optimal allocation of serotonin among target neurons. Here we show that conditional deletion of the mouse protocadherin α (<i>Pcdh</i>α) gene cluster in serotonergic neurons disrupts local axonal tiling and global assembly of serotonergic circuitries and results in depression-like behaviors. Genetic dissection and expression profiling revealed that this role is specifically mediated by Pcdhαc2, which is the only Pcdhα isoform expressed in serotonergic neurons. We conclude that, in contrast to neurite self-avoidance, which requires single-cell identity mediated by Pcdh diversity, a single cell-type identity mediated by the common C-type Pcdh isoform is required for axonal tiling and assembly of serotonergic circuitries.</p>

<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We report the incidence of radiolucent lines (RLLs) using two   flanged acetabular components at total hip arthroplasty (THA) and   the effect of the Rim Cutter.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We performed a retrospective review of 300 hips in 292 patients   who underwent primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ed THA. A contemporary flanged acetabular   component was used with (group 1) and without (group 2) the use   of the Rim Cutter and the Rimfit acetabular component was used with   the Rim Cutter (group 3). RLLs and clinical outcomes were evaluated   immediately post-operatively and at five years post-operatively.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was no significant difference in the incidence of RLLs   on the immediate post-operative radiographs (p = 0.241) or at five   years post-operatively (p = 0.463). RLLs were seen on the immediate   post-operative radiograph in 2% of hips in group 1, in 5% in group   2 and in 7% in group 3. Five years post-operatively, there were   RLLs in 42% of hips in group 1, 41% in group 2 and in 49% in group   3. In the vast majority of hips, in each group, the RLL was present   in DeLee and Charnley zone 1 only (86%, 83%, 67% respectively).   Oxford and Harris Hip scores improved significantly in all groups.   There was no significant difference in these scores or in the change   in scores between the groups, with follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Despite the Rim Cutter showing promising results in early laboratory   and clinical studies, this analysis of the radiological and clinical   outcome five years post-operatively does not show any advantage   over and above modern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ing techniques in combination with a   well performing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ed acetabular component.

Cemented total hip arthroplasty following acetabular fracture
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To evaluate the outcomes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ed total hip arthroplasty (THA)   following a fracture of the acetabulum, with evaluation of risk   factors and comparison with a patient group with no history of fracture. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 1992 and 2016, 49 patients (33 male) with mean age of   57 years (25 to 87) underwent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ed THA at a mean of 6.5 years   (0.1 to 25) following acetabular fracture. A total of 38 had undergone   surgical fixation and 11 had been treated non-operatively; 13 patients   died at a mean of 10.2 years after THA (0.6 to 19). Patients were   assessed pre-operatively, at one year and at final follow-up (mean   9.1 years, 0.5 to 23) using the Oxford Hip Score (OHS). Implant   survivorship was assessed. An age and gender-matched cohort of THAs   performed for non-traumatic osteoarthritis (OA) or avascular necrosis   (AVN) (n = 98) were used to compare complications and patient-reported outcome   measures (PROMs).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean time from fracture to THA was significantly shorter   for patients with AVN    (2.2 years) or protrusio (2.2 years) than those with post-traumatic   OA (9.4 years) or infection (8.0 years) (p = 0.03). Nine contained   and four uncontained defects were managed with autograft (n = 11),   bulk allograft (n = 1), or trabecular metal augment (n = 1). Initial   fracture management (open reduction and internal fixation or non-operative),   timing of THA    (>/< one year), and age (>/< 55 years) had no significant   effect on OHS or ten-year survival. Six THAs were revised at mean   of 12 years (5 to 23) with ten-year all-cause survival of 92% (95%   confidence interval 80.8 to 100). THA complication rates (all complications,   heterotopic ossification, leg length discrepancy > 10 mm) were significantly higher   following acetabular fracture compared with atraumatic OA/AVN and   OHSs were inferior: one-year OHS    (35.7 v<i>ersus</i> 40.2, p = 0.026); and final follow-up   OHS (33.6 v<i>ersus</i> 40.9, p = 0.008). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion </title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ed THA is a reasonable option for the sequelae of acetabular   fracture.

Single-component quasicrystalline nanocrystal superlattices through flexible polygon tiling rule
<p>Quasicrystalline superlattices (QC-SLs) generated from single-component colloidal building blocks have been predicted by computer simulations but are challenging to reproduce experimentally. We discovered that 10-fold QC-SLs could self-organize from truncated tetrahedral quantum dots with anisotropic patchiness. Transmission electron microscopy and tomography measurements allow structural reconstruction of the QC-SL from the nanoscale packing to the atomic-scale orientation alignments. The unique QC order leads to a tiling concept, the “flexible polygon tiling rule,” that replicates the experimental observations. The keys for the single-component QC-SL formation were identified to be the anisotropic shape and patchiness of the building blocks and the assembly microscopic environment. Our discovery may spur the creation of various superstructures using anisotropic objects through an enthalpy-driven route.</p>

Evolution of alluvial mudrock forced by early land plants
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mud</span></strong>rocks are a primary archive of Earth’s history from the Archean eon to recent times, and their source-to-sink production and deposition play a central role in long-term ocean chemistry and climate regulation. Using original and published stratigraphic data from all 704 of Earth’s known alluvial formations from the Archean eon (3.5 billion years ago) to the Carboniferous period (0.3 billion years ago), we prove contentions of an upsurge in the proportion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mud</span></strong> retained on land coeval with vegetation evolution. We constrain the onset of the upsurge to the Ordovician-Silurian and show that alluvium deposited after land plant evolution contains a proportion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mud</span></strong>rock that is, on average, 1.4 orders of magnitude greater than the proportion contained in alluvium from the preceding 90% of Earth’s history. We attribute this shift to the ways in which vegetation revolutionized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mud</span></strong> production and sediment flux from continental interiors.</p>

The image-forming mirror in the eye of the scallop
<p>Scallops possess a visual system comprising up to 200 eyes, each containing a concave mirror rather than a lens to focus light. The hierarchical organization of the multilayered mirror is controlled for image formation, from the component guanine crystals at the nanoscale to the complex three-dimensional morphology at the millimeter level. The layered structure of the mirror is tuned to reflect the wavelengths of light penetrating the scallop’s habitat and is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tile</span></strong>d with a mosaic of square guanine crystals, which reduces optical aberrations. The mirror forms images on a double-layered retina used for separately imaging the peripheral and central fields of view. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tile</span></strong>d, off-axis mirror of the scallop eye bears a striking resemblance to the segmented mirrors of reflecting telescopes.</p>

Intercalary allograft augmented with intramedullary cement and plate fixation is a reliable solution after resection of a diaphyseal tumour
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Intercalary allografts following resection of a primary diaphyseal   tumour have high rates of complications and failures. At our institution   intercalary allografts are augmented with intramedullary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>   and fixed using compression plating. Our aim was to evaluate their   long-term outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 46 patients underwent reconstruction with an intercalary   allograft between 1989 and 2014. The patients had a mean age of   32.8 years (14 to 77). The most common diagnoses were osteosarcoma   (n = 16) and chondrosarcoma (n = 9). The location of the tumours   was in the femur in 21, the tibia in 16 and the humerus in nine.

Topological protection of biphoton states
<p>The robust generation and propagation of multiphoton quantum states are crucial for applications in quantum information, computing, and communications. Although photons are intrinsically well isolated from the thermal environment, scaling to large quantum optical devices is still limited by scattering loss and other errors arising from random fabrication imperfections. The recent discoveries regarding topological phases have introduced avenues to construct quantum systems that are protected against scattering and imperfections. We experimentally demonstrate topological protection of biphoton states, the building block for quantum information systems. We provide clear evidence of the robustness of the spatial features and the propagation constant of biphoton states generated within a nanophotonics lattice with nontrivial topology and propose a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concret</span></strong>e path to build robust entangled states for quantum gates.</p>

DNA Fountain enables a robust and efficient storage architecture
<p>DNA is an attractive medium to store digital information. Here we report a storage strategy, called DNA Fountain, that is highly robust and approaches the information capacity per nucleotide. Using our approach, we stored a full computer operating system, movie, and other files with a total of 2.14 × 10<sup>6</sup> bytes in DNA oligonucleotides and perfectly retrieved the information from a sequencing coverage equivalent to a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tile</span></strong> of Illumina sequencing. We also tested a process that can allow 2.18 × 10<sup>15</sup> retrievals using the original DNA sample and were able to perfectly decode the data. Finally, we explored the limit of our architecture in terms of bytes per molecule and obtained a perfect retrieval from a density of 215 petabytes per gram of DNA, orders of magnitude higher than previous reports.</p>

Reconstruction of non-contained acetabular defects with impaction grafting, a reinforcement mesh and a cemented polyethylene acetabular component
<p>This review summarises the technique of impaction   grafting with mesh augmentation for the treatment of uncontained   acetabular defects in revision hip arthroplasty.</p><p>The ideal acetabular revision should restore bone stock, use   a small socket in the near-anatomic position, and provide durable   fixation. Impaction bone grafting, which has been in use for over   40 years, offers the ability to achieve these goals in uncontained   defects. The precepts of modern, revision impaction grafting are   that the segmental or cavitary defects must be supported with a   mesh; the contained cavity is filled with vigorously impacted morselised   fresh-frozen allograft; and finally, acrylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong> is used to stabilise   the graft and provide rigid, long-lasting fixation of the revised   acetabular component.</p><p>Favourable results have been published with this technique. While   having its limitations, it is a viable option to address large acetabular   defects in revision arthroplasty.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B(1 Supple   A):25–30.</p>

<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Following the resection of an extensive amount of bone in the   treatment of a tumour, the residual segment may be insufficient   to accept a standard length intramedullary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ed stem. Short-stemmed   endoprostheses conceivably have an increased risk of aseptic loosening.   Extra-cortical plates have been added to minimise this risk by supplementing   fixation. The aim of this study was to investigate the survivorship   of short-stemmed endoprostheses and extra-cortical plates.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The study involved 37 patients who underwent limb salvage surgery   for a primary neoplasm of bone between 1998 and 2013. Endoprosthetic   repla<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong> involved the proximal humerus in nine, the proximal   femur in nine, the distal femur in 13 and the proximal tibia in   six patients. There were 12 primary (32%) and 25 revision procedures (68%).   Implant survivorship was compared with matched controls. The amount   of bone that was resected was > 70% of its length and statistically   greater than the standard control group at each anatomical site.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean follow-up was seven years (one to 17). The mean length   of the stem was 33 mm (20 to 60) in the humerus and 79 mm (34 to   100) in the lower limb. Kaplan-Meier analysis of survival of the   implant according to anatomical site confirmed that there was no   statistically significant difference between the short-stemmed endoprostheses and   the standard stemmed controls at the proximal humeral (p = 0.84),   proximal femoral (p = 0.57), distal femoral (p = 0.21) and proximal   tibial (p = 0.61) sites.</p><p>In the short-stemmed group, no implants with extra-cortical plate   osseointegration suffered loosening at a mean of 8.5 years (range   2 to 16 years). Three of ten (30%) without osseointegration suffered   aseptic loosening at a mean of 7.7 years (range 2 to 11.5 years).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>When extensive resections of bone are required in the surgical   management of tumours, and in revision cases, the addition of extra-cortical   plates to short medullary stems has shown non-inferiority to standard   length medullary stems and minimises aseptic failure.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1689–95.</p></sec>

Impact of a learning curve on the survivorship of 4802 cementless total hip arthroplasties
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Our aim was to report survivorship data and lessons learned with   the Corail/Pinnacle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>less total hip arthroplasty (THA) system.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between August 2005 and March 2015, a total of 4802 primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>less   Corail/Pinnacle THAs were performed in 4309 patients. In March 2016,   we reviewed these hips from a prospectively maintained database.</p></sec><sec><title>Results </title><p>A total of 80 hips (1.67%) have been revised which is equivalent   to a cumulative risk of revision of 2.5% at ten years. The rate   of revision was not significantly higher in patients aged ≥ 70 years   (p = 0.93). The leading indications for revision were instability   (n = 22, 0.46%), infection (n = 20, 0.42%), aseptic femoral loosening   (n = 15, 0.31%) and femoral fracture (n = 6, 0.12%). There were   changes in the surgical technique with respect to the Corail femoral component   during the ten-year period involving a change to collared components   and a trend towards larger size. These resulted in a decrease in   the rate of iatrogenic femoral fracture and a decrease in the rate   of aseptic loosening.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The rate of revision in this series is comparable with the best   performing THAs in registry data. Most revisions were not directly   related to the implants. Despite extensive previous experience with   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong>ed femoral components, the senior author noted a learning   curve requiring increased focus on primary stability. The number   of revisions related to the femoral component is reducing.</p><p>Any new technology has a learning curve that may be independent   of surgical experience.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2016;98-B:1589–96.</p></sec>

Outcomes after extensive manual curettage and limited burring for atypical cartilaginous tumour of long bone
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Adjuvant treatment after intralesional curettage for atypical   cartilaginous tumours (ACTs) of long bones is widely accepted for   extending surgical margins. However, evaluating the isolated effect   of adjuvant treatment is difficult, and it is unclear whether not   using such adjuvants provides poor oncological outcomes. Hence,   we analyzed whether intralesional curettage without cryosurgery   or chemical adjuvants provides poor oncological outcomes in patients   with an ACT.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 24 patients (nine men, 15 women) (mean age 45 years;   18 to 62) were treated for ACTs of long bones and followed up for   a median of 66 months (interquar<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tile</span></strong> range 50 to 84). All patients   were treated with extensive manual curettage and limited burring.   Bone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cement</span></strong> and grafts were used to fill bone defects in 16 and eight   patients, respectively. No chemical adjuvants or cryosurgery were   used.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>No local recurrence was detectable on plain radiographs and MRI   or CT images. At the last follow-up, there were no distant metastases   or disease-specific deaths. No procedure-related complications or   postoperative fractures developed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Intralesional curettage without cryosurgery or chemical adjuvants   may provide excellent oncological outcomes for patients with ACTs   of long bones, without the risk of complications related to adjuvant   use. Our investigation suggests thorough curettage alone is a reasonable   treatment option for ACT. However, we acknowledge the limited size   of our investigation warrants a multicentre collaborative study   to confirm our findings.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:256–61.</p></sec>

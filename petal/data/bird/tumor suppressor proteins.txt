Breast tumors educate the proteome of stromal tissue in an individualized but coordinated manner
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> forms specialized microenvironmental niches that promote local invasion and colonization. Engrafted patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) locally invade and colonize naive stroma in mice while enabling unambiguous molecular discrimination of human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> from mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s in the microenvironment. To characterize how patient breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s form a niche and educate naive stroma, subcutaneous breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> PDXs were globally profiled by species-specific quantitative proteomics. Regulation of PDX stromal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s by breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s was extensive, with 35% of the stromal proteome altered by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s consistently across different animals and passages. Differentially regulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s in the stroma clustered into six signatures, which included both known and previously unappreciated contributors to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> invasion and colonization. Stromal proteomes were coordinately regulated; however, the sets of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s altered by each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> were highly distinct. Integrated analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> and stromal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, a comparison made possible in these xenograft models, indicated that the known hallmarks of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> contribute pleiotropically to establishing and maintaining the microenvironmental niche of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>. Education of the stroma by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> is therefore an intrinsic property of breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s that is highly individualized, yet proceeds by consistent, nonrandom, and defined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-promoting molecular alterations.</p>

Risk of Cerebrovascular Events in 178 962 Five-Year Survivors of Cancer Diagnosed at 15 to 39 Years of Age
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Survivors of teenage and young adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> are at risk of cerebrovascular events, but the magnitude of and extent to which this risk varies by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> type, decade of diagnosis, age at diagnosis, and attained age remains uncertain. This is the largest-ever cohort study to evaluate the risks of hospitalization for a cerebrovascular event among long-term survivors of teenage and young adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The population-based TYACSS (Teenage and Young Adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> Survivor Study) (N=178,962) was linked to Hospital Episode Statistics data for England to investigate the risks of hospitalization for a cerebrovascular event among 5-year survivors of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> diagnosed when 15 to 39 years of age. Observed numbers of first hospitalizations for cerebrovascular events were compared with that expected from the general population using standardized hospitalization ratios (SHRs) and absolute excess risks per 10 000 person-years. Cumulative incidence was calculated with death considered a competing risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, 2782 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> survivors were hospitalized for a cerebrovascular event—40% higher than expected (SHR=1.4, 95% confidence interval, 1.3–1.4). Survivors of central nervous system (CNS) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s (SHR=4.6, 95% confidence interval, 4.3–5.0), head and neck <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s (SHR=2.6, 95% confidence interval, 2.2–3.1), and leukemia (SHR=2.5, 95% confidence interval, 1.9–3.1) were at greatest risk. Males had significantly higher absolute excess risks than females (absolute excess risks =7 versus 3), especially among head and neck <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> survivors (absolute excess risks =30 versus 11).

Truncation- and motif-based pan-cancer analysis reveals tumor-suppressing kinases
<p>A major challenge in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> genomics is identifying “driver” mutations from the many neutral “passenger” mutations within a given <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>. To identify driver mutations that would otherwise be lost within mutational noise, we filtered genomic data by motifs that are critical for kinase activity. In the first step of our screen, we used data from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> Cell Line Encyclopedia and The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> Genome Atlas to identify kinases with truncation mutations occurring within or before the kinase domain. The top 30 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-suppressing kinases were aligned, and hotspots for loss-of-function (LOF) mutations were identified on the basis of amino acid conservation and mutational frequency. The functional consequences of new LOF mutations were biochemically validated, and the top 15 hotspot LOF residues were used in a pan-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> analysis to define the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-suppressing kinome. A ranked list revealed MAP2K7, an essential mediator of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, as a candidate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> suppressor in gastric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>, despite its mutational frequency falling within the mutational noise for this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> type. The majority of mutations in MAP2K7 abolished its catalytic activity, and reactivation of the JNK pathway in gastric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells harboring LOF mutations in MAP2K7 or the downstream kinase JNK suppressed clonogenicity and growth in soft agar, demonstrating the functional relevance of inactivating the JNK pathway in gastric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>. Together, our data highlight a broadly applicable strategy to identify functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> driver mutations and define the JNK pathway as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-suppressive in gastric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>.</p>

Generation of specific inhibitors of SUMO-1– and SUMO-2/3–mediated protein-protein interactions using Affimer (Adhiron) technology
<p>Because <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interactions underpin most biological processes, developing tools that target them to understand their function or to inform the development of therapeutics is an important task. SUMOylation is the posttranslational covalent attachment of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s in the SUMO family (SUMO-1, SUMO-2, or SUMO-3), and it regulates numerous cellular pathways. SUMOylated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are recognized by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s with SUMO-interaction motifs (SIMs) that facilitate noncovalent interactions with SUMO. We describe the use of the Affimer system of peptide display for the rapid isolation of synthetic binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that inhibit SUMO-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interactions mediated by SIMs both in vitro and in cells. Crucially, these synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s did not prevent SUMO conjugation either in vitro or in cell-based systems, enabling the specific analysis of SUMO-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interactions. Furthermore, through structural analysis and molecular modeling, we explored the molecular mechanisms that may underlie their specificity in interfering with either SUMO-1–mediated interactions or interactions mediated by either SUMO-2 or SUMO-3. Not only will these reagents enable investigation of the biological roles of SUMOylation, but the Affimer technology used to generate these synthetic binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s could also be exploited to design or validate reagents or therapeutics that target other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interactions.</p>

Genomics and evolution of protein phosphatases
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatases are the essential opposite to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> kinases; together, these enzymes regulate all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphorylation and most cellular processes. To better understand the global roles of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphorylation, we cataloged the human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatome, composed of 189 known and predicted human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatase genes. We also identified 79 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatase pseudogenes or retrogenes, some of which may have residual function. We traced the origin and diversity of phosphatases by building <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatomes for eight other eukaryotes, from the protist <i>Dictyostelium</i> to the sea urchin. We classified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatases from all nine species into a hierarchy of 10 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> folds, 21 families, and 178 subfamilies. We found that >80% of the 101 human subfamilies were conserved across the animal kingdom, but show substantial differences in evolution, including losses and expansions of individual subfamilies and changes in accessory domains. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatases show similar evolutionary dynamics to those of kinases, with substantial losses in major model organisms. Sequence analysis predicts that 26 human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatase domains are catalytically disabled and that this disability is mostly conserved across orthologs. This genomic and evolutionary perspective on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatases provides a framework for global analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphorylation throughout the animal kingdom.</p>

Intercellular transmission of the unfolded protein response promotes survival and drug resistance in cancer cells
<p>Increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> translation in cells and various factors in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> microenvironment can induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which initiates the unfolded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> response (UPR). We have previously reported that factors released from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells mounting a UPR induce a de novo UPR in bone marrow–derived myeloid cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells that facilitates pro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>igenic characteristics in culture and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> growth in vivo. We investigated whether this intercellular signaling, which we have termed transmissible ER stress (TERS), also operates between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells and what its functional consequences were within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>. We found that TERS signaling induced a UPR in recipient human prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells that included the cell surface expression of the chaperone GRP78. TERS also activated Wnt signaling in recipient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells and enhanced resistance to nutrient starvation and common chemotherapies such as the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib and the microtubule inhibitor paclitaxel. TERS-induced activation of Wnt signaling required the UPR kinase and endonuclease IRE1. However, TERS-induced enhancement of cell survival was predominantly mediated by the UPR kinase PERK and a reduction in the abundance of the transcription factor ATF4, which prevented the activation of the transcription factor CHOP and, consequently, the induction of apoptosis. When implanted in mice, TERS-primed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells gave rise to faster growing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s than did vehicle-primed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells. Collectively, our data demonstrate that TERS is a mechanism of intercellular communication through which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells can adapt to stressful environments.</p>

The G Protein <i>β</i>-Subunit, AGB1, Interacts with FERONIA in RALF1-Regulated Stomatal Movement
<p>Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding (G) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are composed of Gα, G<i>β</i>, and Gγ subunits and function as molecular switches in signal transduction. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), there are one canonical Gα (GPA1), three extra-large Gα (XLG1, XLG2, and XLG3), one G<i>β</i> (AGB1), and three Gγ (AGG1, AGG2, and AGG3) subunits. To elucidate AGB1 molecular signaling, we performed immunoprecipitation using plasma membrane-enriched <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s followed by mass spectrometry to identify the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interactors of AGB1. After eliminating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s present in the control immunoprecipitation, commonly identified contaminants, and organellar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, a total of 103 candidate AGB1-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s were confidently identified. We identified all of the G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> subunits except XLG1, receptor-like kinases, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, and 14-3-3-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, all of which may couple with or modulate G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> signaling. We confirmed physical interaction between AGB1 and the receptor-like kinase FERONIA (FER) using bimolecular fluorescence complementation. The Rapid Alkalinization Factor (RALF) family of polypeptides have been shown to be ligands of FER. In this study, we demonstrate that RALF1 regulates stomatal apertures and does so in a G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-dependent manner, inhibiting stomatal opening and promoting stomatal closure in Columbia but not in <i>agb1</i> mutants. We further show that AGGs and XLGs, but not GPA1, participate in RALF1-mediated stomatal signaling. Our results suggest that FER acts as a G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-coupled receptor for plant heterotrimeric G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s.</p>

Tandem Fluorescent Protein Timers for Noninvasive Relative Protein Lifetime Measurement in Plants
<p>Targeted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> degradation is an important and pervasive regulatory mechanism in plants, required for perception and response to the environment as well as developmental signaling. Despite the significance of this process, relatively few studies have assessed plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> turnover in a quantitative fashion. Tandem fluorescent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> timers (tFTs) offer a powerful approach for the assessment of in vivo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> turnover in distinct subcellular compartments of single or multiple cells. A tFT is a fusion of two different fluorescent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s with distinct fluorophore maturation kinetics, which enable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> age to be estimated from the ratio of fluorescence intensities of the two fluorescent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s. Here, we used short-lived auxin signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s and model N-end rule (N-recognin) pathway reporters to demonstrate the utility of tFTs for studying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> turnover in living plant cells of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. We present transient expression of tFTs as an efficient screen for relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> lifetime, useful for testing the effects of mutations and different genetic backgrounds on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> stability. This work demonstrates the potential for using stably expressed tFTs to study native <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> dynamics with high temporal resolution in response to exogenous or endogenous stimuli.</p>

Identification and Characterization of Arabidopsis Seed Coat Mucilage Proteins
<p>Plant cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are important regulators of cell wall architecture and function. However, because cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are difficult to extract and analyze, they are generally poorly understood. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s integral to the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed coat mucilage, a specialized layer of the extracellular matrix composed of plant cell wall carbohydrates that is used as a model for cell wall research. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s identified in mucilage include those previously identified by genetic analysis, and several mucilage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are reduced in mucilage-deficient mutant seeds, suggesting that these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are genuinely associated with the mucilage. Arabidopsis mucilage has both nonadherent and adherent layers. Both layers have similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> profiles except for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s involved in lipid metabolism, which are present exclusively in the adherent mucilage. The most abundant mucilage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s include a family of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s named TESTA ABUNDANT1 (TBA1) to TBA3; a less abundant fourth homolog was named TBA-LIKE (TBAL). <i>TBA</i> and <i>TBAL</i> transcripts and promoter activities were detected in developing seed coats, and their expression requires seed coat differentiation regulators. TBA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are secreted to the mucilage pocket during differentiation. Although reverse genetics failed to identify a function for TBAs/TBAL, the <i>TBA</i> promoters are highly expressed and cell type specific and so should be very useful tools for targeting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s to the seed coat epidermis. Altogether, these results highlight the mucilage proteome as a model for cell walls in general, as it shares similarities with other cell wall proteomes while also containing mucilage-specific features.</p>

Proximity biotinylation identifies a set of conformation-specific interactions between Merlin and cell junction proteins
<p>Neurofibromatosis type 2 is an inherited, neoplastic disease associated with schwannomas, meningiomas, and ependymomas and that is caused by inactivation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> suppressor gen</span></strong>e <i>NF2</i>. The <i>NF2</i> gene product, Merlin, has no intrinsic catalytic activity; its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> suppressor function is mediated through the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s with which it interacts. We used proximity biotinylation followed by mass spectrometry and direct binding assays to identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that associated with wild-type and various mutant forms of Merlin in immortalized Schwann cells. We defined a set of 52 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s in close proximity to wild-type Merlin. Most of the Merlin-proximal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s were components of cell junctional signaling complexes, suggesting that additional potential interaction partners may exist in adherens junctions, tight junctions, and focal adhesions. With mutant forms of Merlin that cannot bind to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) or that constitutively adopt a closed conformation, we confirmed a critical role for PIP<sub>2</sub> binding in Merlin function and identified a large cohort of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that specifically interacted with Merlin in the closed conformation. Among these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, we identified a previously unreported Merlin-binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>, apoptosis-stimulated p53 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> 2 (ASPP2, also called Tp53bp2), that bound to closed-conformation Merlin predominately through the FERM domain. Our results demonstrate that Merlin is a component of cell junctional mechanosensing complexes and defines a specific set of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s through which it acts.</p>

Blockade of surface-bound TGF-β on regulatory T cells abrogates suppression of effector T cell function in the tumor microenvironment
<p>Regulatory T cells (T<sub>regs</sub>) suppress anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> immunity by inhibiting the killing of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells by antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. To better understand the mechanisms involved, we used ex vivo three-dimensional collagen-fibrin gel cultures of dissociated B16 melanoma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s. This system recapitulated the in vivo suppression of antimelanoma immunity, rendering the dissociated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells resistant to killing by cocultured activated, antigen-specific T cells. Immunosuppression was not observed when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s excised from T<sub>reg</sub>-depleted mice were cultured in this system. Experiments with neutralizing antibodies showed that blocking transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) also prevented immunosuppression. Immunosuppression depended on cell-cell contact or cellular proximity because soluble factors from the collagen-fibrin gel cultures did not inhibit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cell killing by T cells. Moreover, intravital, two-photon microscopy showed that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-specific Pmel-1 effector T cells physically interacted with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-resident T<sub>regs</sub> in mice. T<sub>regs</sub> isolated from B16 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s alone were sufficient to suppress CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell–mediated killing, which depended on surface-bound TGF-β on the T<sub>regs</sub>. Immunosuppression of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells correlated with a decrease in the abundance of the cytolytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> granzyme B and an increase in the cell surface amount of the immune checkpoint receptor programmed cell death <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> 1 (PD-1). These findings suggest that contact between T<sub>regs</sub> and anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> T cells in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> microenvironment inhibits antimelanoma immunity in a TGF-β–dependent manner and highlight potential ways to inhibit intra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>al T<sub>regs</sub> therapeutically.</p>

<p>Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) targeting the androgen receptor (AR) is a standard therapeutic regimen for treating prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>. However, most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s progress to metastatic castration-resistant prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> after ADT. We identified the type 1, 2, and 4 collagen–binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> transforming growth factor–β (TGFβ)–induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> (TGFBI) as an important factor in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and malignant progression of prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>. In prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cell lines, AR signaling stimulated the activity of the transcription factor SPDEF, which repressed the expression of <i>TGFBI</i>. ADT, AR antagonism, or overexpression of TGFBI inhibited the activity of SPDEF and enhanced the proliferation rates of prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells. Knockdown of TGFBI suppressed migration and proliferation in cultured cells and reduced prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> growth and brain and bone metastasis in xenograft models, extending the survival of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-bearing mice. Analysis of prostate tissue samples collected before and after ADT from the same patients showed that ADT reduced the nuclear abundance of SPDEF and increased the production of TGFBI. Our findings suggest that induction of TGFBI promotes prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> growth and metastasis and can be caused by dysregulation or therapeutic inhibition of AR signaling.</p>

Targeting TNFR2 with antagonistic antibodies inhibits proliferation of ovarian cancer cells and tumor-associated T<sub>regs</sub>
<p>Major barriers to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> therapy include the lack of selective inhibitors of regulatory T cells (T<sub>regs</sub>) and the lack of broadly applicable ways to directly target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s through frequently expressed surface oncogenes. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2) is an attractive target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> because of its restricted abundance to highly immunosuppressive T<sub>regs</sub> and oncogenic presence on human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s. We characterized the effect of TNFR2 inhibition using antagonistic antibodies. In culture-based assays, we found that two TNFR2 antagonists inhibited T<sub>reg</sub> proliferation, reduced soluble TNFR2 secretion from normal cells, and enabled T effector cell expansion. The antagonistic activity occurred in the presence of added TNF, a natural TNFR2 agonist. These TNFR2 antibodies killed T<sub>regs</sub> isolated from ovarian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> ascites more potently than it killed T<sub>regs</sub> from healthy donor samples, suggesting that these antibodies may have specificity for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> microenvironment. The TNFR2 antagonists also killed OVCAR3 ovarian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells, which have abundant surface TNFR2. The antibodies stabilized antiparallel dimers in cell surface TNFR2 that rendered the receptor unable to activate the nuclear factor κB pathway and trigger cell proliferation. Our data suggest that, by targeting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells and immunosuppressive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-associated T<sub>regs</sub>, antagonistic TNFR2 antibodies may be an effective treatment for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s positive for TNFR2.</p>

Potassium shapes antitumor immunity
<p>T cells protect us from infections and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s. Nonetheless, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s grow, persist, and metastasize, even in the presence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), which include T cells with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cell–killing capabilities. This lack of immune control stems from the functional exhaustion, or hyporesponsiveness, of TILs as a consequence of chronic antigen exposure, poor expression of rejection antigens by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells, hypoxia, lack of nutrients or substrates, and/or other suppressive mechanisms in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> microenvironment (TME). Despite these challenges, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> antigen–specific TILs with stem cell–like behavior can mediate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> destruction after successful immunotherapy, such as immune checkpoint blockade (<i>1</i>). Finding mechanisms that maintain the stemness of TILs may lead to improved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> immunotherapies. On page 1417 of this issue, Vodnala <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) identify the concentration of extracellular potassium in the TME as a determinant of the dysfunction and stemness of CD8<sup>+</sup> TILs. This helps explain how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s progress in the presence of T cells that could clear them and suggests new approaches to boost T cell stemness in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> immunotherapy.</p>

Bone voyage—Osteoblasts remotely control tumors
<p>Cancer is a systemic disease. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> growth and malignant progression rely not only on the intrinsic aberrant genetic and epigenetic makeup of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells but also on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-induced systemic factors that affect cells in the primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> as well as distant microenvironments (<i>1</i>). Notably, bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) have been shown to contribute to primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> progression by promoting hallmark processes such as inflammation, immunosuppression, vasculogenesis, and extracellular matrix remodeling. BMDCs are also involved in establishing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-permissive microenvironments that form before the arrival of disseminated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells at future metastatic sites (known as premetastatic niches) and promote metastatic outgrowth (<i>2</i>–<i>5</i>). In addition to the direct effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-secreted factors on BMDC recruitment to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s, on page eaal5081 of this issue Engblom <i>et al.</i> (<i>6</i>) report that osteoblasts, which reside in the bone, can be remotely activated by secreted factors from lung adenocarcinoma, which in turn mobilize a specific subset of BMDCs—neutrophils—to foster <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> growth.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Protein Carbonylation and Glycation in Legume Nodules
<p>Nitrogen fixation is an agronomically and environmentally important process catalyzed by bacterial nitrogenase within legume root nodules. These unique symbiotic organs have high metabolic rates and produce large amounts of reactive oxygen species that may modify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s irreversibly. Here, we examined two types of oxidative posttranslational modifications of nodule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s: carbonylation, which occurs by direct oxidation of certain amino acids or by interaction with reactive aldehydes arising from cell membrane lipid peroxides; and glycation, which results from the reaction of lysine and arginine residues with reducing sugars or their autooxidation products. We used a strategy based on the enrichment of carbonylated peptides by affinity chromatography followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify 369 oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s in bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) nodules. Of these, 238 corresponded to plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s and 131 to bacterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s. Lipid peroxidation products induced most carbonylation sites. This study also revealed that carbonylation has major effects on two key nodule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s. Metal-catalyzed oxidation caused the inactivation of malate dehydrogenase and the aggregation of leghemoglobin. In addition, numerous glycated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s were identified in vivo, including three key nodule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s: sucrose synthase, glutamine synthetase, and glutamate synthase. Label-free quantification identified 10 plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s and 18 bacterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s as age-specifically glycated. Overall, our results suggest that the selective carbonylation or glycation of crucial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s involved in nitrogen metabolism, transcriptional regulation, and signaling may constitute a mechanism to control cell metabolism and nodule senescence.</p>

Saltational evolution of the heterotrimeric G protein signaling mechanisms in the plant kingdom
<p>Signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s evolved diverse interactions to provide specificity for distinct stimuli. Signaling complexity in the G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> (heterotrimeric guanosine triphosphate–binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>) network was achieved in animals through subunit duplication and incremental evolution. By combining comprehensive and quantitative phenotypic profiles of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> evolution informatics, we found that plant heterotrimeric G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> machinery evolved by a saltational (jumping) process. Sequence similarity scores mapped onto tertiary structures, and biochemical validation showed that the extra-large Gα (XLG) subunit evolved extensively in the charophycean algae (an aquatic green plant) by gene duplication and gene fusion. In terrestrial plants, further evolution uncoupled XLG from its negative regulator, regulator of G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> signaling, but preserved an α-helix region that enables interaction with its partner Gβγ. The ancestral gene evolved slowly due to the molecular constraints imposed by the need for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> to maintain interactions with various partners, whereas the genes encoding XLG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s evolved rapidly to produce three highly divergent members. Analysis of <i>A. thaliana</i> mutants indicated that these Gα and XLG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s all function with Gβγ and evolved to operate both independently and cooperatively. The XLG-Gβγ machinery specialized in environmental stress responses, whereas the canonical Gα-Gβγ retained developmental roles. Some developmental processes, such as shoot development, involve both Gα and XLG acting cooperatively or antagonistically. These extensive and rapid evolutionary changes in XLG structure compared to those of the canonical Gα subunit contrast with the accepted notion of how pathway diversification occurs through gene duplication with subsequent incremental coevolution of residues among interacting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s.</p>

Blockade of TNFR2 signaling enhances the immunotherapeutic effect of CpG ODN in a mouse model of colon cancer
<p>Through the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> necrosis factor (TNF) receptor type II (TNFR2), TNF preferentially activates, expands, and promotes the phenotypic stability of CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T (T<sub>reg</sub>) cells. Those T<sub>reg</sub> cells that have a high abundance of TNFR2 have the maximal immunosuppressive capacity. We investigated whether targeting TNFR2 could effectively suppress the activity of T<sub>reg</sub> cells and consequently enhance the efficacy of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> immunotherapy. We found that, relative to a suboptimal dose of the immunostimulatory Toll-like receptor 9 ligand CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN), the combination of the suboptimal dose of CpG ODN with the TNFR2-blocking antibody M861 more markedly inhibited the growth of subcutaneously grafted mouse CT26 colon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells. This resulted in markedly fewer TNFR2<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells and more interferon-γ–positive (IFN-γ<sup>+</sup>) CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T lymphocytes infiltrating the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> and improved long-term <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-free survival in the mouse cohort. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-free mice were resistant to rechallenge by the same but not unrelated (4T1 breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>) cells. Treatment with the combination of TNFR2-blocking antibody and a CD25-targeted antibody also resulted in enhanced inhibition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> growth in a syngeneic 4T1 mouse model of breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>. Thus, the combination of a TNFR2 inhibitor and an immunotherapeutic stimulant may represent a more effective treatment strategy for various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s.</p>

The receptor tyrosine kinase EphA2 promotes glutamine metabolism in tumors by activating the transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ
<p>Malignant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s reprogram cellular metabolism to support <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cell proliferation and survival. Although most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s depend on a high rate of aerobic glycolysis, many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells also display addiction to glutamine. Glutamine transporters and glutaminase activity are critical for glutamine metabolism in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells. We found that the receptor tyrosine kinase EphA2 activated the TEAD family transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ (YAP/TAZ), likely in a ligand-independent manner, to promote glutamine metabolism in cells and mouse models of HER2-positive breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>. Overexpression of EphA2 induced the nuclear accumulation of YAP and TAZ and increased the expression of YAP/TAZ target genes. Inhibition of the GTPase Rho or the kinase ROCK abolished EphA2-dependent YAP/TAZ nuclear localization. Silencing <i>YAP</i> or <i>TAZ</i> substantially reduced the amount of intracellular glutamate through decreased expression of <i>SLC1A5</i> and <i>GLS</i>, respectively, genes that encode <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that promote glutamine uptake and metabolism. The regulatory DNA elements of both <i>SLC1A5</i> and <i>GLS</i> contain TEAD binding sites and were bound by TEAD4 in an EphA2-dependent manner. In patient breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> tissues, <i>EphA2</i> expression positively correlated with that of <i>YAP</i> and <i>TAZ</i>, as well as that of <i>GLS</i> and <i>SLC1A5</i>. Although high expression of <i>EphA2</i> predicted enhanced metastatic potential and poor patient survival, it also rendered HER2-positive breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells more sensitive to glutaminase inhibition. The findings define a previously unknown mechanism of EphA2-mediated glutaminolysis through YAP/TAZ activation in HER2-positive breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> and identify potential therapeutic targets in patients.</p>

NK cell–mediated cytotoxicity contributes to tumor control by a cytostatic drug combination
<p>Molecularly targeted therapies aim to obstruct cell autonomous programs required for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> growth.

The drug combination, but neither agent alone, promotes retinoblastoma (RB) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-mediated cellular senescence and activation of the immunomodulatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). SASP components <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> necrosis factor–α and intercellular adhesion molecule–1 are required for NK cell surveillance of drug-treated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells, which contributes to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> regressions and prolonged survival in a KRAS-mutant lung <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> mouse model.

The paradox of mutations and cancer
<p>The past decade has witnessed the cataloging of genetic mutations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> genomes, providing new insights into how and in what ways <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> can develop and spread (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). The focus has been on defining specific “driver” mutations, genetic errors in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells that reveal basic biological processes gone awry that are required for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> initiation and progression. These drivers are the target of new therapies—this concept is central to precision oncology efforts to treat patients according to the genetic changes that are present in their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s (<i>3</i>). Along the way, it has also become apparent that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> genomes harbor many additional “passenger” mutations (<i>4</i>). Patterns of driver and passenger DNA mutations derived from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> genomes have provided clues about the different ways that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> can manifest as a disease of genetic mutations (<i>5</i>, <i>6</i>). In some circumstances, they can be linked to strong environmental carcinogens (for example, mutation patterns caused by tobacco smoke, ultraviolet radiation, or the fungal toxin aflatoxin) (<i>7</i>). Moreover, these forensic mutational patterns can be used to estimate how long it has taken for a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> to develop (<i>5</i>). On page 911 of this issue, Martincorena <i>et al.</i> (<i>8</i>) turned their attention toward the detection of mutations in normal tissue, addressing a long-standing paradox that mutations arise in normal tissues but do not necessarily lead to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>.</p>

Multisite phosphorylation by MAPK
<p>Reversible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphorylation plays a fundamental role in signal transduction networks.

Over three-quarters of human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s may be phosphorylated, with many targeted at multiple sites. Such multisite phosphorylation substantially increases the scope for modulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> function—a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> with <i>n</i> phosphorylation sites has the potential to exist in 2<sup><i>n</i></sup> distinct phosphorylation states, each of which could, in theory, display modified functionality. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s can be substrates for several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> kinases, thereby integrating distinct signals to provide a coherent biological response. However, they can also be phosphorylated at multiple sites by a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> kinase to promote a specific functional output that can be reversed by dephosphorylation by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatases. On page 233 of this issue, Mylona <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) reveal an unexpected role for multisite phosphorylation, whereby a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> kinase progressively phosphorylates sites on a transcription factor to promote and then subsequently limit its activity independently of dephosphorylation.</p>

Tagged null mutants of <i>OHP1</i> and <i>OHP2</i> (<i>ohp1</i> and <i>ohp2</i>) showed stunted growth with pale-green leaves on agar plates, and these mutants were unable to grow on soil. Leaf chlorophyll fluorescence and the composition of thylakoid membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s revealed that <i>ohp1</i> deletion substantially affected photosystem II (PSII) core <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> function and led to reduced levels of photosystem I core <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s; however, it did not affect LHC accumulation. Transgenic <i>ohp1</i> plants rescued with OHP1-HA or OHP1-Myc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s developed a normal phenotype.

Prolines in Transit Peptides Are Crucial for Efficient Preprotein Translocation into Chloroplasts
<p>Chloroplasts import many pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that can be classified based on their physicochemical properties. The cleavable N-terminal transit peptide (TP) of chloroplast pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s contains all the information required for import into chloroplasts through Toc/Tic translocons. The question of whether and how the physicochemical properties of pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s affect TP-mediated import into chloroplasts has not been elucidated. Here, we present evidence that Pro residues in TP mediate efficient translocation through the chloroplast envelope membranes for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s containing transmembrane domains (TMDs) or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s prone to aggregation. By contrast, the translocation of soluble <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s through the chloroplast envelope membranes is less dependent on TP prolines. Proless TPs failed to mediate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> translocation into chloroplasts; instead, these mutant TPs led to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> mistargeting to the chloroplast envelope membranes or nonspecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> aggregation during import into chloroplasts. The mistargeting of TMD-containing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s caused by Pro-less TPs in wild-type protoplasts was mimicked by wild-type TPs in <i>hsp93-V</i> protoplasts, in which pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> translocation is compromised. We propose that the physicochemical properties of chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> translocation through the chloroplast envelope, and prolines in TP have a crucial role in the efficient translocation of TMD-containing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s.</p>

LIL3, a Light-Harvesting Complex Protein, Links Terpenoid and Tetrapyrrole Biosynthesis in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>The LIL3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) belongs to the light-harvesting complex (LHC) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> family, which also includes the light-harvesting chlorophyll-binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s of photosystems I and II, the early-light-inducible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, PsbS involved in nonphotochemical quenching, and the one-helix <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s and their cyanobacterial homologs designated high-light-inducible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s. Each member of this family is characterized by one or two LHC transmembrane domains (referred to as the LHC motif) to which potential functions such as chlorophyll binding, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interaction, and integration of interacting partners into the plastid membranes have been attributed. Initially, LIL3 was shown to interact with geranylgeranyl reductase (CHLP), an enzyme of terpene biosynthesis that supplies the hydrocarbon chain for chlorophyll and tocopherol. Here, we show another function of LIL3 for the stability of protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR). Multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interaction analyses suggest the direct physical interaction of LIL3 with POR but not with chlorophyll synthase. Consistently, LIL3-deficient plants exhibit substantial loss of POR as well as CHLP, which is not due to defective transcription of the POR and CHLP genes but to the posttranslational modification of their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> products. Interestingly, in vitro biochemical analyses provide novel evidence that LIL3 shows high binding affinity to protochlorophyllide, the substrate of POR. Taken together, this study suggests a critical role for LIL3 in the organization of later steps in chlorophyll biosynthesis. We suggest that LIL3 associates with POR and CHLP and thus contributes to the supply of the two metabolites, chlorophyllide and phytyl pyrophosphate, required for the final step in chlorophyll <i>a</i> synthesis.</p>

Functional Analysis of Cellulose Synthase (CESA) Protein Class Specificity
<p>The cellulose synthase complex (CSC) exhibits a 6-fold symmetry and is known as a “rosette.” Each CSC is believed to contain between 18 and 24 CESA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that each synthesize an individual glucan chain. These chains form the microfibrils that confer the remarkable structural properties of cellulose. At least three different classes of CESA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are essential to form the CSC. However, while organization of the CSC determines microfibril structure, how individual CESA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are organized within the CSC remains unclear. Parts of the plant CESA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s map sufficiently well onto the bacterial CESA (BcsA) structure, indicating that they are likely to share a common catalytic mechanism. However, plant CESA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are much larger than the bacterial BcsA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>, prompting the suggestion that these plant-specific regions are important for interactions between CESA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s and for conferring CESA class specificity. In this study, we have undertaken a comprehensive analysis of well-defined regions of secondary cell wall CESA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, with the aim of defining what distinguishes different CESA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s and hence what determines the specificity of each CESA class. Our results demonstrate that CESA class specificity extends throughout the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> and not just in the highly variable regions. Furthermore, we find that different CESA isoforms vary greatly in their levels of site specificity and this is likely to be determined by the constraints imposed by their position within the CSC rather than their primary structure.</p>

Improving Assessment of Drug Safety Through Proteomics
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Early detection of adverse effects of novel therapies and understanding of their mechanisms could improve the safety and efficiency of drug development. We have retrospectively applied large-scale proteomics to blood samples from ILLUMINATE (Investigation of Lipid Level Management to Understand its Impact in Atherosclerotic Events), a trial of torcetrapib (a cholesterol ester transfer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> inhibitor), that involved 15 067 participants at high cardiovascular risk. ILLUMINATE was terminated at a median of 550 days because of significant absolute increases of 1.2% in cardiovascular events and 0.4% in mortality with torcetrapib. The aims of our analysis were to determine whether a proteomic analysis might reveal biological mechanisms responsible for these harmful effects and whether harmful effects of torcetrapib could have been detected early in the ILLUMINATE trial with proteomics.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A nested case-control analysis of paired plasma samples at baseline and at 3 months was performed in 249 participants assigned to torcetrapib plus atorvastatin and 223 participants assigned to atorvastatin only. Within each treatment arm, cases with events were matched to controls 1:1. Main outcomes were a survey of 1129 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s for discovery of biological pathways altered by torcetrapib and a 9-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> risk score validated to predict myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, or death.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Plasma concentrations of 200 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s changed significantly with torcetrapib. Their pathway analysis revealed unexpected and widespread changes in immune and inflammatory functions, as well as changes in endocrine systems, including in aldosterone function and glycemic control. At baseline, 9-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> risk scores were similar in the 2 treatment arms and higher in participants with subsequent events. At 3 months, the absolute 9-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> derived risk increased in the torcetrapib plus atorvastatin arm compared with the atorvastatin-only arm by 1.08% (<i>P</i>=0.0004).

“Disruptor” residues in the regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) R12 subfamily attenuate the inactivation of Gα subunits
<p>Understanding the molecular basis of interaction specificity between RGS (regulator of G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> signaling) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s and heterotrimeric (αβγ) G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s would enable the manipulation of RGS-G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interactions, explore their functions, and effectively target them therapeutically. RGS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are classified into four subfamilies (R4, R7, RZ, and R12) and function as negative regulators of G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> signaling by inactivating Gα subunits. We found that the R12 subfamily members RGS10 and RGS14 had lower activity than most R4 subfamily members toward the G<sub>i</sub> subfamily member Gα<sub>o</sub>. Using structure-based energy calculations with multiple Gα-RGS complexes, we identified R12-specific residues in positions that are predicted to determine the divergent activity of this subfamily. This analysis predicted that these residues, which we call “disruptor residues,” interact with the Gα helical domain. We engineered the R12 disruptor residues into the RGS domains of the high-activity R4 subfamily and found that these altered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s exhibited reduced activity toward Gα<sub>o</sub>. Reciprocally, replacing the putative disruptor residues in RGS18 (a member of the R4 subfamily that exhibited low activity toward Gα<sub>o</sub>) with the corresponding residues from a high-activity R4 subfamily RGS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> increased its activity toward Gα<sub>o</sub>. Furthermore, the high activity of the R4 subfamily toward Gα<sub>o</sub> was independent of the residues in the homologous positions to the R12 subfamily and RGS18 disruptor residues. Thus, our results suggest that the identified RGS disruptor residues function as negative design elements that attenuate RGS activity for specific Gα <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s.</p>

Aurora B opposes PP1 function in mitosis by phosphorylating the conserved PP1-binding RVxF motif in PP1 regulatory proteins
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatase 1 (PP1) is a highly conserved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatase that performs most of the serine- and threonine-dephosphorylation reactions in eukaryotes and opposes the actions of a diverse set of serine and threonine (Ser-Thr) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> kinases. PP1 gains substrate specificity through binding to a large number (>200) of regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that control PP1 localization, activity, and interactions with substrates. PP1 recognizes the well-characterized RVxF binding motif that is present in many of these regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, thus generating a multitude of distinct PP1 holoenzymes. We showed that a subset of the RVxF binding motifs, in which x is a phosphorylatable amino acid (RV[S/T]F), was phosphorylated specifically during mitosis and that this phosphorylation event abrogated the interaction of PP1 with the regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>. We determined that this phosphorylation was primarily governed by the mitotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> kinase Aurora B and that high phosphorylation site stoichiometry of these sites maintained the phosphorylation of PP1 substrates during mitosis by disrupting the assembly of PP1 holoenzymes. We generated an antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated form of the RV[S/T]F motif (RVp[S/T]F) and used it to identify known PP1 regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s (KNL1, CDCA2, and RIF1) and multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that could potentially act as PP1 binding partners (UBR5, ASPM, SEH1, and ELYS) governed by this mechanism. Together, these data suggest a general regulatory mechanism by which the coordinated activities of Aurora B and PP1 control mitotic progression.</p>

VEGF–neuropilin-2 signaling promotes stem-like traits in breast cancer cells by TAZ-mediated repression of the Rac GAP β2-chimaerin
<p>The role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> is not only well known in the context of angiogenesis but also important in the functional regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells. Autocrine VEGF signaling mediated by its co-receptors called neuropilins (NRPs) appears to be essential for sustaining the proliferation and survival of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> stem cells (CSCs), which are implicated in mediating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> growth, progression, and drug resistance. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms involved in VEGF-mediated support of CSCs is critical to successfully treating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> patients. The expression of the Hippo effector TAZ is associated with breast CSCs and confers stem cell–like properties. We found that VEGF-NRP2 signaling contributed to the activation of TAZ in various breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells, which mediated a positive feedback loop that promoted mammosphere formation. VEGF-NRP2 signaling activated the GTPase Rac1, which inhibited the Hippo kinase LATS, thus leading to TAZ activity. In a complex with the transcription factor TEAD, TAZ then bound and repressed the promoter of the gene encoding the Rac GTPase-activating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> (Rac GAP) β2-chimaerin. By activating GTP hydrolysis, Rac GAPs effectively turn off Rac signaling; hence, the TAZ-mediated repression of β2-chimaerin resulted in sustained Rac1 activity in CSCs. Depletion of β2-chimaerin in non-CSCs increased Rac1 activity, TAZ abundance, and mammosphere formation. Analysis of a breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> patient database revealed an inverse correlation between β2-chimaerin and TAZ expression in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s. Our findings highlight an unexpected role for β2-chimaerin in a feed-forward loop of TAZ activation and the acquisition of CSC properties.</p>

Convergence of Wnt, growth factor, and heterotrimeric G protein signals on the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Daple
<p>Cellular proliferation, differentiation, and morphogenesis are shaped by multiple signaling cascades, and their dysregulation plays an integral role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> progression. Three cascades that contribute to oncogenic potential are those mediated by Wnt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s and the receptor Frizzled (FZD), growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), and heterotrimeric G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s and associated GPCRs. Daple is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> G<sub>αi</sub>. Daple also binds to FZD and the Wnt/FZD mediator Dishevelled (Dvl), and it enhances β-catenin–independent Wnt signaling in response to Wnt5a-FZD7 signaling. We identified Daple as a substrate of multiple RTKs and non-RTKs and, hence, as a point of convergence for the three cascades. We found that phosphorylation near the Dvl-binding motif in Daple by both RTKs and non-RTKs caused Daple/Dvl complex dissociation and augmented the ability of Daple to bind to and activate G<sub>αi</sub>, which potentiated β-catenin–independent Wnt signals and stimulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) similarly to Wnt5a/FZD7 signaling. Although Daple acts as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> suppressor in the healthy colon, the concurrent increased abundance of Daple and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in colorectal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s was associated with poor patient prognosis. Thus, the Daple-dependent activation of G<sub>αi</sub> and the Daple-dependent enhancement of β-catenin–independent Wnt signals are not only stimulated by Wnt5a/FZD7 to suppress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>igenesis but also hijacked by growth factor–activated RTKs to enhance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> progression. These findings identify a cross-talk paradigm among growth factor RTKs, heterotrimeric G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, and the Wnt/FZD pathway in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>.</p>

Dampening oncogenic RAS signaling
<p>The control of normal cellular homeostasis is a function of signaling by the RAS guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) KRAS, NRAS, and HRAS and their downstream signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, such as the RAF kinases (BRAF and CRAF), mitogen-activated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> kinase (MAPK) kinase (MEK), and extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK), which together constitute the RAS-MAPK pathway (<i>1</i>). This pathway is dysregulated in human diseases, particularly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>, in which mutations or other nongenetic events hyperactivate the pathway in more than 50% of cases (<i>1</i>). Activating mutations in RAS genes occur in more than 30% of all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s and seemingly lock RAS into a constitutively active, GTP-bound state to signal autonomously without the need for upstream input (<i>1</i>). Therapeutic suppression of pathogenic RASMAPK signaling to maximize disease control in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> patients remains an elusive goal. Multiple strategies targeting upstream [e.g., receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)] or downstream (e.g., MEK) RAS pathway <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s to limit RAS-GTP–mediated signaling in RAS-MAPK pathway–driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s are under evaluation (<i>1</i>–<i>3</i>). However, recent studies have extended our knowledge of how certain forms of oncogenic RAS and other oncogenic MAPK pathway <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s function not in an autonomous manner but instead semiautonomously, such that they still respond to upstream regulation (<i>4</i>–<i>8</i>). These findings reveal mechanisms by which RAS signaling is dysregulated in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> and highlight newly identified therapeutic strategies with the potential to target oncogenic RAS-MAPK signaling.</p>

Tumor metastasis to lymph nodes requires YAP-dependent metabolic adaptation
<p>In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> patients, metastasis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s to sentinel lymph nodes (LNs) predicts disease progression and often guides treatment decisions. The mechanisms underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> LN metastasis are poorly understood. By using comparative transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses of primary and LN-metastatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s in mice, we found that LN metastasis requires that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells undergo a metabolic shift toward fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Transcriptional coactivator yes-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> (YAP) is selectively activated in LN-metastatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s, leading to the up-regulation of genes in the FAO signaling pathway. Pharmacological inhibition of FAO or genetic ablation of YAP suppressed LN metastasis in mice. Several bioactive bile acids accumulated to high levels in the metastatic LNs, and these bile acids activated YAP in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> cells, likely through the nuclear vitamin D receptor. Inhibition of FAO or YAP may merit exploration as a potential therapeutic strategy for mitigating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> metastasis to LNs.</p>

Analysis of <i>Fusobacterium</i> persistence and antibiotic response in colorectal cancer

Global analysis of protein folding using massively parallel design, synthesis, and testing
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s fold into unique native structures stabilized by thousands of weak interactions that collectively overcome the entropic cost of folding.

We combined computational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> design, next-generation gene synthesis, and a high-throughput protease susceptibility assay to measure folding and stability for more than 15,000 de novo designed mini<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, 1000 natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, 10,000 point mutants, and 30,000 negative control sequences.

HCN Regulates Cellular Processes through Posttranslational Modification of Proteins by <i>S-</i>cyanylation
<p>Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) is coproduced with ethylene in plant cells and is primarily enzymatically detoxified by the mitochondrial β-CYANOALANINE SYNTHASE (CAS-C1). Permanent or transient depletion of CAS-C1 activity in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) results in physiological alterations in the plant that suggest that HCN acts as a gasotransmitter molecule. Label-free quantitative proteomic analysis of mitochondrially enriched samples isolated from the wild type and <i>cas-c1</i> mutant revealed significant changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> content, identifying 451 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that are absent or less abundant in <i>cas-c1</i> and 353 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that are only present or more abundant in <i>cas-c1</i>. Gene ontology classification of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s identified proteomic changes that explain the root hairless phenotype and the altered immune response observed in the <i>cas-c1</i> mutant. The mechanism of action of cyanide as a signaling molecule was addressed using two proteomic approaches aimed at identifying the <i>S-</i>cyanylation of Cys as a posttranslational modification of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s. Both the 2-imino-thiazolidine chemical method and the direct untargeted analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry identified a set of 163 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s susceptible to <i>S-</i>cyanylation that included SEDOHEPTULOSE 1,7-BISPHOSPHATASE (SBPase), the PEPTIDYL-PROLYL CIS-TRANS ISOMERASE 20-3 (CYP20-3), and ENOLASE2 (ENO2). In vitro analysis of these enzymes showed that <i>S-</i>cyanylation of SBPase Cys<sup>74</sup>, CYP20-3 Cys<sup>259</sup>, and ENO2 Cys<sup>346</sup> residues affected their enzymatic activity. Gene Ontology classification and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interaction cluster analysis showed that <i>S-</i>cyanylation is involved in the regulation of primary metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis, and the Calvin and <i>S</i>-adenosyl-Met cycles.</p>

Genetic Architecture of the Cardiovascular Risk Proteome
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>We recently identified 156 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s in human plasma that were each associated with the net Framingham Cardiovascular Disease Risk Score using an aptamer-based proteomic platform in Framingham Heart Study Offspring participants. Here we hypothesized that performing genome-wide association studies and exome array analyses on the levels of each of these 156 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s might identify genetic determinants of risk-associated circulating factors and provide insights into early cardiovascular pathophysiology.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied the association of genetic variants with the plasma levels of each of the 156 Framingham Cardiovascular Disease Risk Score–associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s using linear mixed-effects models in 2 population-based cohorts. We performed discovery analyses on plasma samples from 759 participants of the Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort, an observational study of the offspring of the original Framingham Heart Study and their spouses, and validated these findings in plasma samples from 1421 participants of the MDCS (Malmö Diet and Cancer Study). To evaluate the utility of this strategy in identifying new biological pathways relevant to cardiovascular disease pathophysiology, we performed studies in a cell-model system to experimentally validate the functional significance of an especially novel genetic association with circulating apolipo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> E levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified 120 locus-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> associations in genome-wide analyses and 41 associations in exome array analyses, the majority of which have not been described previously. These loci explained up to 66% of interindividual plasma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-level variation and, on average, accounted for 3 times the amount of variation explained by common clinical factors, such as age, sex, and diabetes mellitus status. We described overlap among many of these loci and cardiovascular disease genetic risk variants. Finally, we experimentally validated a novel association between circulating apolipo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> E levels and the transcription factor phosphatase 1G. Knockdown of phosphatase 1G in a human liver cell model resulted in decreased apolipo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> E transcription and apolipo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> E <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> levels in cultured supernatants.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We identified dozens of novel genetic determinants of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s associated with the Framingham Cardiovascular Disease Risk Score and experimentally validated a new role for phosphatase 1G in lipo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> biology. Further, genome-wide and exome array data for each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> have been made publicly available as a resource for cardiovascular disease research.</p></sec>

Opposing Roles of Wnt Inhibitors IGFBP-4 and Dkk1 in Cardiac Ischemia by Differential Targeting of LRP5/6 and β-catenin
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Myocardial infarction is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, triggering irreversible myocardial cell damage and heart failure. The role of low-density lipo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> receptor-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s 5 and 6 (LRP5/6) as coreceptors of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in the adult heart remain unknown. Insulin-like growth factor binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> 4 and dickkopf-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> 1 (Dkk1) are 2 secreted LRP5/6 binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that play a crucial role in heart development through preventing Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation. However, their roles in the adult heart remain unexplored.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To understand the role of LRP5/6 and β-catenin in the adult heart, we constructed conditional cardiomyocyte-specific LRP5/6 and β-catenin knockout mice and induced surgical myocardial infarction. We also directly injected recombinant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s of insulin-like growth factor binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> 4 and Dkk1 into the heart immediately following myocardial infarction to further examine the mechanisms through which these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s regulate LRP5/6 and β-catenin.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Deletion of LRP5/6 promoted cardiac ischemic insults. Conversely, deficiency of β-catenin, a downstream target of LRP5/6, was beneficial in ischemic injury. It is interesting to note that although both insulin-like growth factor binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> 4 and Dkk1 are secreted Wnt/β-catenin pathway inhibitors, insulin-like growth factor binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> 4 protected the ischemic heart by inhibiting β-catenin, whereas Dkk1 enhanced the injury response mainly through inducing LRP5/6 endocytosis and degradation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings reveal previously unidentified dual roles of LRP5/6 involved in the cardiomyocyte response to ischemic injury. These findings suggest new therapeutic strategies in ischemic heart disease by fine-tuning LRP5/6 and β-catenin signaling within the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.</p></sec>

Cancer origins—genetics rules the day
<p>A major goal of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> research is to identify central molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the development of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s and their response to treatment, with the aim of uncovering key vulnerabilities. Early events in the development of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> may inform such vulnerabilities (<i>1</i>), but early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s are much more difficult to observe and study in patients than established <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s. Indeed, one of the hardest issues to resolve in early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> development is the relative contributions of the oncogenic driver mutations and the nonpathogenic gene networks expressed in a pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>ous cell. On page 91 of this issue, Park <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) investigate the mechanisms of development of neuro endocrine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> in the lung and the prostate using human epithelial cells in culture. They find that these neuroendocrine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>s can arise from non-neuroendocrine epithelial cells, which converge upon reprogramming toward a neuroendocrine fate via a common and specific combination of genetic factors.</p>

Thermal proximity coaggregation for system-wide profiling of protein complex dynamics in cells
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s differentially interact with each other across cellular states and conditions, but an efficient proteome-wide strategy to monitor them is lacking. We report the application of thermal proximity coaggregation (TPCA) for high-throughput intracellular monitoring of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> complex dynamics. Significant TPCA signatures observed among well-validated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interactions correlate positively with interaction stoichiometry and are statistically observable in more than 350 annotated human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> complexes. Using TPCA, we identified many complexes without detectable differential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> expression, including chromatin-associated complexes, modulated in S phase of the cell cycle. Comparison of six cell lines by TPCA revealed cell-specific interactions even in fundamental cellular processes. TPCA constitutes an approach for system-wide studies of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> complexes in nonengineered cells and tissues and might be used to identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> complexes that are modulated in diseases.</p>

Use of CRISPR-modified human stem cell organoids to study the origin of mutational signatures in cancer
<p>Mutational processes underlie <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> initiation and progression. Signatures of these processes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> genomes may explain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> etiology and could hold diagnostic and prognostic value. We developed a strategy that can be used to explore the origin of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>-associated mutational signatures. We used CRISPR-Cas9 technology to delete key DNA repair genes in human colon organoids, followed by delayed subcloning and whole-genome sequencing. We found that mutation accumulation in organoids deficient in the mismatch repair gene <i>MLH1</i> is driven by replication errors and accurately models the mutation profiles observed in mismatch repair–deficient colorectal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s. Application of this strategy to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> predisposition gene <i>NTHL1</i>, which encodes a base excision repair <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>, revealed a mutational footprint (signature 30) previously observed in a breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cohort. We show that signature 30 can arise from germline <i>NTHL1</i> mutations.</p>

Cancer bypasses the lymph nodes
<p>“What did the lymph nodes show?” is the question whose answer is apprehensively awaited by every colon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> patient. Even in the age of molecular medicine, the absence or presence of colon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> spread to regional lymph nodes remains the strongest predictor of whether surgery has cured the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>, or whether an individual may harbor occult metastatic disease and thus require adjuvant chemotherapy to reduce the risk of lethal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> metastases recurring in distant organs (<i>1</i>–<i>3</i>). But is colon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> spread to lymph nodes a precursor of spread to another organ (e.g., the liver) or rather an indicator of colon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells' metastatic competence? On page 55 of this issue, Naxerova <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) provide molecular evidence that, in many instances, colon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> metastases in the liver (and possibly other distant organs), originate from distinct clone(s) that differ from the founder(s) of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> deposits in the lymph nodes.</p>

Landscape of immunogenic tumor antigens in successful immunotherapy of virally induced epithelial cancer
<p>Immunotherapy has clinical activity in certain virally associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s. However, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> antigens targeted in successful treatments remain poorly defined. We used a personalized immunogenomic approach to elucidate the global landscape of anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> T cell responses in complete regression of human papillomavirus–associated metastatic cervical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong>-infiltrating adoptive T cell therapy. Remarkably, immunodominant T cell reactivities were directed against mutated neoantigens or a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> germline antigen, rather than canonical viral antigens. T cells targeting viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> antigens did not display preferential in vivo expansion. Both viral and nonviral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> antigen–specific T cells resided predominantly in the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)–expressing T cell compartment, which suggests that PD-1 blockade may unleash diverse anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tumor</span></strong> T cell reactivities. These findings suggest a new paradigm of targeting nonviral antigens in immunotherapy of virally associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s.</p>

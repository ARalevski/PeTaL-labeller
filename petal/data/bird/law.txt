Is Permanent Parasitism Reversible?—Critical Evidence from Early Evolution of House Dust Mites
<p>Long-term specialization may limit the ability of a species to respond to new environmental conditions and lead to a higher likelihood of extinction. For permanent parasites and other symbionts, the most intriguing question is whether these organisms can return to a free-living lifestyle and, thus, escape an evolutionary “dead end.” This question is directly related to Dollo's <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">law</span></strong>, which stipulates that a complex trait (such as being free living vs. parasitic) cannot re-evolve again in the same form. Here, we present conclusive evidence that house dust mites, a group of medically important free-living organisms, evolved from permanent parasites of warm-blooded vertebrates. A robust, multigene topology (315 taxa, 8942 nt), ancestral character state reconstruction, and a test for irreversible evolution (Dollo's <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">law</span></strong>) demonstrate that house dust mites have abandoned a parasitic lifestyle, secondarily becoming free living, and then speciated in several habitats. Hence, as exemplified by this model system, highly specialized permanent parasites may drastically de-specialize to the extent of becoming free living and, thus escape from dead-end evolution. Our phylogenetic and historical ecological framework explains the limited cross-reactivity between allergens from the house dust mites and “storage” mites and the ability of the dust mites to inhibit host immune responses. It also provides insights into how ancestral features related to parasitism (frequent ancestral shifts to unrelated hosts, tolerance to lower humidity, and pre-existing enzymes targeting skin and keratinous materials) played a major role in reversal to the free-living state. We propose that parasitic ancestors of pyroglyphids shifted to nests of vertebrates. Later the nest-inhabiting pyroglyphids expanded into human dwellings to become a major source of allergens.

Efficient coding explains the universal law of generalization in human perception
<p>Perceptual generalization and discrimination are fundamental cognitive abilities. For example, if a bird eats a poisonous butterfly, it will learn to avoid preying on that species again by generalizing its past experience to new perceptual stimuli. In cognitive science, the “universal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">law</span></strong> of generalization” seeks to explain this ability and states that generalization between stimuli will follow an exponential function of their distance in “psychological space.” Here, I challenge existing theoretical explanations for the universal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">law</span></strong> and offer an alternative account based on the principle of efficient coding. I show that the universal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">law</span></strong> emerges inevitably from any information processing system (whether biological or artificial) that minimizes the cost of perceptual error subject to constraints on the ability to process or transmit information.</p>

Anomalously low electronic thermal conductivity in metallic vanadium dioxide
<p>In electrically conductive solids, the Wiedemann-Franz <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">law</span></strong> requires the electronic contribution to thermal conductivity to be proportional to electrical conductivity. Violations of the Wiedemann-Franz <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">law</span></strong> are typically an indication of unconventional quasiparticle dynamics, such as inelastic scattering, or hydrodynamic collective motion of charge carriers, typically pronounced only at cryogenic temperatures. We report an order-of-magnitude breakdown of the Wiedemann-Franz <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">law</span></strong> at high temperatures ranging from 240 to 340 kelvin in metallic vanadium dioxide in the vicinity of its metal-insulator transition. Different from previously established mechanisms, the unusually low electronic thermal conductivity is a signature of the absence of quasiparticles in a strongly correlated electron fluid where heat and charge diffuse independently.</p>

Evidence for a neural law of effect
<p>Thorndike’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">law</span></strong> of effect states that actions that lead to reinforcements tend to be repeated more often. Accordingly, neural activity patterns leading to reinforcement are also reentered more frequently. Reinforcement relies on dopaminergic activity in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), and animals shape their behavior to receive dopaminergic stimulation. Seeking evidence for a neural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">law</span></strong> of effect, we found that mice learn to reenter more frequently motor cortical activity patterns that trigger optogenetic VTA self-stimulation. Learning was accompanied by gradual shaping of these patterns, with participating neurons progressively increasing and aligning their covariance to that of the target pattern. Motor cortex patterns that lead to phasic dopaminergic VTA activity are progressively reinforced and shaped, suggesting a mechanism by which animals select and shape actions to reliably achieve reinforcement.</p>

Cuban panel claims stress caused mystery illnesses
<p>After a 9-month probe hampered by lack of access to medical records, a panel of Cuban scientists this week declared that U.S. diplomats here likely suffered a "collective psychogenic disorder" earlier this year, not the deliberate "health attack" that the U.S. Department of State has <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">claim</span></strong>ed. Based on media reports about the mysterious symptoms, including hearing loss, nausea, vertigo, and memory lapses, some U.S. scientists had already reached similar conclusions. That a panel appointed by the Cuban government dismisses the U.S. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">claim</span></strong>s may not be surprising, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation is still leading what State Department officials have described as a "vigorous" multiagency investigation. But the Cuban report summary, obtained by <i>Science</i>, reveals intriguing details. For instance, a high-frequency noise that some had identified as a possible "sonic weapon" may have been crickets chirping.</p>

Experimental measurement of binding energy, selectivity, and allostery using fluctuation theorems
<p>Thermodynamic bulk measurements of binding reactions rely on the validity of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">law</span></strong> of mass action and the assumption of a dilute solution. Yet, important biological systems such as allosteric ligand-receptor binding, macromolecular crowding, or misfolded molecules may not follow these assumptions and may require a particular reaction model. Here we introduce a fluctuation theorem for ligand binding and an experimental approach using single-molecule force spectroscopy to determine binding energies, selectivity, and allostery of nucleic acids and peptides in a model-independent fashion. A similar approach could be used for proteins. This work extends the use of fluctuation theorems beyond unimolecular folding reactions, bridging the thermodynamics of small systems and the basic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">law</span></strong>s of chemical equilibrium.</p>

Quantifying the ‘law of diminishing returns’ in magnetically controlled growing rods
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Magnetically controlled growing rods (MCGRs) allow non-invasive   correction of the spinal deformity in the treatment of early-onset   scoliosis.

Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 9 Inhibitor Therapy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors (PCSK9i) are a novel class of medications for patients with familial hypercholesterolemia or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease requiring additional lipid lowering beyond dietary measures and statin use. Because of the drugs’ high cost, rates of prescription approval by payers may be low.

Adult neurogenesis in mammals
<p>The first <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">claim</span></strong>, in the early 1960s, that neurons could be generated in the postnatal mammalian brain was met with considerable skepticism and controversy (<i>1</i>). Over the next 20 years, each subsequent study reporting adult neurogenesis in the mammalian brain was greeted similarly (<i>2</i>, <i>3</i>). A dogma had been established and accepted by the scientific community: After birth, no new neurons could be generated. Conceptually, it was thought that the structural composition of the neurons within the brain remained unchangeable after birth. However, the detection of adult neurogenesis in certain regions of the brain suggested that the adult brain exhibits more plasticity than previously thought, and this has implications for concepts of self, memory, and the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

Searching for hidden earthquakes in Southern California
<p>Earthquakes follow a well-known power-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">law</span></strong> size relation, with smaller events occurring much more often than larger events. Earthquake catalogs are thus dominated by small earthquakes yet are still missing a much larger number of even smaller events because of signal fidelity issues. To overcome these limitations, we applied a template-matching detection technique to the entire waveform archive of the regional seismic network in Southern California. This effort resulted in a catalog with 1.81 million earthquakes, a 10-fold increase, which provides important insights into the geometry of fault zones at depth, foreshock behavior and nucleation processes, and earthquake-triggering mechanisms. The rich detail resolved in this type of catalog will facilitate the next generation of analyses of earthquakes and faults.</p>

Identity inference of genomic data using long-range familial searches
<p>Consumer genomics databases have reached the scale of millions of individuals. Recently, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">law</span></strong> enforcement authorities have exploited some of these databases to identify suspects via distant familial relatives. Using genomic data of 1.28 million individuals tested with consumer genomics, we investigated the power of this technique. We project that about 60% of the searches for individuals of European descent will result in a third-cousin or closer match, which theoretically allows their identification using demographic identifiers. Moreover, the technique could implicate nearly any U.S. individual of European descent in the near future. We demonstrate that the technique can also identify research participants of a public sequencing project. On the basis of these results, we propose a potential mitigation strategy and policy implications for human subject research.</p>

The council ruled that parents could still have their children vaccinated, given the need to protect public health.

The spatial footprint of injection wells in a global compilation of induced earthquake sequences
<p>Fluid injection can cause extensive earthquake activity, sometimes at unexpectedly large distances. Appropriately mitigating associated seismic hazards requires a better understanding of the zone of influence of injection. We analyze spatial seismicity decay in a global dataset of 18 induced cases with clear association between isolated wells and earthquakes. We distinguish two populations. The first is characterized by near-well seismicity density plateaus and abrupt decay, dominated by square-root space-time migration and pressure diffusion. Injection at these sites occurs within the crystalline basement. The second population exhibits larger spatial footprints and magnitudes, as well as a power <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">law</span></strong>–like, steady spatial decay over more than 10 kilometers, potentially caused by poroelastic effects. Far-reaching spatial effects during injection may increase event magnitudes and seismic hazard beyond expectations based on purely pressure-driven seismicity.</p>

Predictive modeling of U.S. health care spending in late life
<p>That one-quarter of Medicare spending in the United States occurs in the last year of life is commonly interpreted as waste. But this interpretation presumes knowledge of who will die and when. Here we analyze how spending is distributed by predicted mortality, based on a machine-learning model of annual mortality risk built using Medicare <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">claim</span></strong>s. Death is highly unpredictable. Less than 5% of spending is accounted for by individuals with predicted mortality above 50%. The simple fact that we spend more on the sick—both on those who recover and those who die—accounts for 30 to 50% of the concentration of spending on the dead. Our results suggest that spending on the ex post dead does not necessarily mean that we spend on the ex ante “hopeless.”</p>

German law allows use of DNA to predict suspects' looks

The controversial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">law</span></strong>, which passed the Landtag, the state parliament in Munich, on 15 May, is the first in Germany to allow what has been dubbed DNA phenotyping, and it has sparked renewed debate here and in other countries about the advantages—and risks—of the technology. German federal authorities, and police in the country's 15 other states, are only allowed to perform DNA fingerprinting, in which they look for an exact match between crime scene DNA and samples in a database of known criminals or from a suspect. DNA phenotyping and ancestry prediction, however, have been used in the Netherlands, France, the United Kingdom, Canada, and several U.S. states. Some critics caution that although the underlying science connecting genetic markers to certain physical features is solid, DNA phenotyping and ancestry prediction still come with significant uncertainties that can be easily misunderstood by police and the public.</p>

An excess of massive stars in the local 30 Doradus starburst

The main episode of massive star formation began about 8 million years (My) ago, and the star-formation rate seems to have declined in the last 1 My. The IMF is densely sampled up to 200 [Formula] and contains 32 ± 12% more stars above 30 [Formula] than predicted by a standard Salpeter IMF.

Chaos-assisted broadband momentum transformation in optical microresonators
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">law</span></strong> of momentum conservation rules out many desired processes in optical microresonators.

Assisted by chaotic motions, broadband light can travel between optical modes with different angular momenta within a few picoseconds. Efficient coupling from visible to near-infrared bands is demonstrated between a nanowaveguide and whispering gallery modes with quality factors exceeding 10 million. The broadband momentum transformation enhances the device conversion efficiency of the third-harmonic generation by greater than three orders of magnitude over the conventional evanescent-wave coupling. The observed broadband and fast momentum transformation could promote applications such as multicolor lasers, broadband memories, and multiwavelength optical networks.</p>

Protecting unauthorized immigrant mothers improves their children’s mental health
<p>The United States is embroiled in a debate about whether to protect or deport its estimated 11 million unauthorized immigrants, but the fact that these immigrants are also parents to more than 4 million U.S.-born children is often overlooked. We provide causal evidence of the impact of parents’ unauthorized immigration status on the health of their U.S. citizen children. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program granted temporary protection from deportation to more than 780,000 unauthorized immigrants. We used Medicaid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">claim</span></strong>s data from Oregon and exploited the quasi-random assignment of DACA eligibility among mothers with birthdates close to the DACA age qualification cutoff. Mothers’ DACA eligibility significantly decreased adjustment and anxiety disorder diagnoses among their children. Parents’ unauthorized status is thus a substantial barrier to normal child development and perpetuates health inequalities through the intergenerational transmission of disadvantage.</p>

Breaking Lorentz reciprocity to overcome the time-bandwidth limit in physics and engineering
<p>A century-old tenet in physics and engineering asserts that any type of system, having bandwidth Δω, can interact with a wave over only a constrained time period Δ<i>t</i> inversely proportional to the bandwidth (Δ<i>t</i>·Δω ~ 2π). This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">law</span></strong> severely limits the generic capabilities of all types of resonant and wave-guiding systems in photonics, cavity quantum electrodynamics and optomechanics, acoustics, continuum mechanics, and atomic and optical physics but is thought to be completely fundamental, arising from basic Fourier reciprocity. We propose that this “fundamental” limit can be overcome in systems where Lorentz reciprocity is broken. As a system becomes more asymmetric in its transport properties, the degree to which the limit can be surpassed becomes greater. By way of example, we theoretically demonstrate how, in an astutely designed magnetized semiconductor heterostructure, the above limit can be exceeded by orders of magnitude by using realistic material parameters. Our findings revise prevailing paradigms for linear, time-invariant resonant systems, challenging the doctrine that high-quality resonances must invariably be narrowband and providing the possibility of developing devices with unprecedentedly high time-bandwidth performance.</p>

We examine the universal scaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">law</span></strong>s exhibited by the system and, through real-time imaging, address a long-standing question of whether the solitons in trains are created with effectively repulsive nearest-neighbor interactions or rather evolve into such a structure.</p>

Quantized thermal transport in single-atom junctions
<p>Thermal transport in individual atomic junctions and chains is of great fundamental interest because of the distinctive quantum effects expected to arise in them. By using novel, custom-fabricated, picowatt-resolution calorimetric scanning probes, we measured the thermal conductance of gold and platinum metallic wires down to single-atom junctions. Our work reveals that the thermal conductance of gold single-atom junctions is quantized at room temperature and shows that the Wiedemann-Franz <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">law</span></strong> relating thermal and electrical conductance is satisfied even in single-atom contacts. Furthermore, we quantitatively explain our experimental results within the Landauer framework for quantum thermal transport. The experimental techniques reported here will enable thermal transport studies in atomic and molecular chains, which will be key to investigating numerous fundamental issues that thus far have remained experimentally inaccessible.</p>

How economic, humanitarian, and religious concerns shape European attitudes toward asylum seekers
<p>What types of asylum seekers are Europeans willing to accept? We conducted a conjoint experiment asking 18,000 eligible voters in 15 European countries to evaluate 180,000 profiles of asylum seekers that randomly varied on nine attributes. Asylum seekers who have higher employability, have more consistent asylum testimonies and severe vulnerabilities, and are Christian rather than Muslim received the greatest public support. These results suggest that public preferences over asylum seekers are shaped by sociotropic evaluations of their potential economic contributions, humanitarian concerns about the deservingness of their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">claim</span></strong>s, and anti-Muslim bias. These preferences are similar across respondents of different ages, education levels, incomes, and political ideologies, as well as across the surveyed countries. This public consensus on what types of asylum seekers to accept has important implications for theory and policy.</p>

Electron optics with p-n junctions in ballistic graphene
<p>Electrons transmitted across a ballistic semiconductor junction are expected to undergo refraction, analogous to light rays across an optical boundary. In graphene, the linear dispersion and zero-gap band structure admit highly transparent p-n junctions by simple electrostatic gating. Here, we employ transverse magnetic focusing to probe the propagation of carriers across an electrostatically defined graphene junction. We find agreement with the predicted Snell’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">law</span></strong> for electrons, including the observation of both positive and negative refraction. Resonant transmission across the p-n junction provides a direct measurement of the angle-dependent transmission coefficient. Comparing experimental data with simulations reveals the crucial role played by the effective junction width, providing guidance for future device design. Our results pave the way for realizing electron optics based on graphene p-n junctions.</p>

Holographic description of a quantum black hole on a computer
<p>Black holes have been predicted to radiate particles and eventually evaporate, which has led to the information loss paradox and implies that the fundamental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">law</span></strong>s of quantum mechanics may be violated. Superstring theory, a consistent theory of quantum gravity, provides a possible solution to the paradox if evaporating black holes can actually be described in terms of standard quantum mechanical systems, as conjectured from the theory. Here, we test this conjecture by calculating the mass of a black hole in the corresponding quantum mechanical system numerically. Our results agree well with the prediction from gravity theory, including the leading quantum gravity correction. Our ability to simulate black holes offers the potential to further explore the yet mysterious nature of quantum gravity through well-established quantum mechanics.</p>

Opportunities and Challenges in Next Generation Standards
<p>Imagine that politicians and the people they represent understood how human activity impacts Earth, including climate. And imagine that they had learned how to evaluate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">claim</span></strong>s, argue from evidence, and understand models. These understandings and practices are prominent in the U.S. National Research Council (NRC) framework to guide the next iteration of standards for U.S. elementary and secondary school students (<i>1</i>). We discuss how aspects such as authorship, coordination among subject areas, and broader goals of college and career readiness give reason to believe that this effort will be more successful than previous attempts to use standards to improve science education (<i>2</i>).</p>

Validating Genome-Wide Association Candidates Controlling Quantitative Variation in Nodulation
<p>Genome-wide association (GWA) studies offer the opportunity to identify genes that contribute to naturally occurring variation in quantitative traits. However, GWA relies exclusively on statistical association, so functional validation is necessary to make strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">claim</span></strong>s about gene function. We used a combination of gene-disruption platforms (Tnt1 retrotransposons, hairpin RNA-interference constructs, and CRISPR/Cas9 nucleases) together with randomized, well-replicated experiments to evaluate the function of genes that an earlier GWA study in <i>Medicago truncatula</i> had identified as candidates contributing to variation in the symbiosis between legumes and rhizobia. We evaluated ten candidate genes found in six clusters of strongly associated single nucleotide polymorphisms, selected on the basis of their strength of statistical association, proximity to annotated gene models, and root or nodule expression. We found statistically significant effects on nodule production for three candidate genes, each validated in two independent mutants. Annotated functions of these three genes suggest their contributions to quantitative variation in nodule production occur through processes not previously connected to nodulation, including phosphorous supply and salicylic acid-related defense response. These results demonstrate the utility of GWA combined with reverse mutagenesis technologies to discover and validate genes contributing to naturally occurring variation in quantitative traits. The results highlight the potential for GWA to complement forward genetics in identifying the genetic basis of ecologically and economically important traits.</p>

Trends and risk factors for prolonged opioid use after unicompartmental knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate trends in opioid use   after unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA), to identify predictors   of prolonged use and to compare the rates of opioid use after UKA,   total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total hip arthroplasty (THA).</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We identified 4205 patients who had undergone UKA between 2007   and 2015 from the Humana Inc. administrative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">claim</span></strong>s database. Post-operative   opioid use for one year post-operatively was assessed using the   rates of monthly repeat prescription. These were then compared between   patients with and without a specific variable of interest and with   those of patients who had undergone TKA and THA.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 4205 UKA patients were analysed. Of these, 1362 patients   (32.4%) were users of opioids. Pre-operative opioid use was the   strongest predictor of prolonged opioid use after UKA. Opioid users   were 1.4 (81.6% <i>versus</i> 57.7%), 3.7 (49.5% <i>versus</i> 13.3%)   and 5.5    (35.8% <i>versus</i> 6.5%) times more likely to be taking   opioids at one, two and three months post-operatively, respectively   (p < 0.05 for all). Younger age and specific comorbidities such   as anxiety/depression, smoking, back pain and substance abuse were   found to significantly increase the rate of repeat prescription   for opioids after UKA. Overall, UKA patients required significantly   less opioid prescriptions than patients who had undergone THA and TKA.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>One-third of patients who undergo UKA are given opioids in the   three months pre-operatively. Pre-operative opioid use is the best   predictor of increased repeat prescriptions after UKA. However,   other intrinsic patient characteristics are also predictive.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B(1   Supple A):62–7.</p></sec>

Prospective Countywide Surveillance and Autopsy Characterization of Sudden Cardiac Death
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Studies of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death (SCD) use emergency medical services records, death certificates, or definitions that infer cause of death; thus, the true incidence of SCD is unknown. Over 90% of SCDs occur out-of-hospital; nonforensic autopsies are rarely performed, and therefore causes of death are presumed. We conducted a medical examiner–based investigation to determine the precise incidence and autopsy-defined causes of all SCDs in an entire metropolitan area. We hypothesized that postmortem investigation would identify actual sudden arrhythmic deaths among presumed SCDs.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Between February 1, 2011, and March 1, 2014, we prospectively identified all incident deaths attributed to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (emergency medical services primary impression, cardiac arrest) between 18 to 90 years of age in San Francisco County for autopsy, toxicology, and histology via medical examiner surveillance of consecutive out-of-hospital deaths, all reported by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">law</span></strong>. We obtained comprehensive records to determine whether out-of-hospital cardiac arrest deaths met World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for SCD. We reviewed death certificates filed quarterly for missed SCDs. Autopsy-defined sudden arrhythmic deaths had no extracardiac cause of death or acute heart failure. A multidisciplinary committee adjudicated final cause.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>All 20 440 deaths were reviewed; 12 671 were unattended and reported to the medical examiner. From these, we identified 912 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest deaths; 541 (59%) met WHO SCD criteria (mean 62.8 years, 69% male) and 525 (97%) were autopsied. Eighty-nine additional WHO-defined SCDs occurred within 3 weeks of active medical care with the death certificate signed by the attending physician, ineligible for autopsy but included in the countywide WHO-defined SCD incidence of 29.6/100 000 person-years, highest in black men (<i>P</i><0.0001). Of 525 WHO-defined SCDs, 301 (57%) had no cardiac history. Leading causes of death were coronary disease (32%), occult overdose (13.5%), cardiomyopathy (10%), cardiac hypertrophy (8%), and neurological (5.5%). Autopsy-defined sudden arrhythmic deaths were 55.8% (293/525) of overall, 65% (78/120) of witnessed, and 53% (215/405) of unwitnessed WHO-defined SCDs (<i>P</i>=0.024); 286 of 293 (98%) had structural cardiac disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Forty percent of deaths attributed to stated cardiac arrest were not sudden or unexpected, and nearly half of presumed SCDs were not arrhythmic. These findings have implications for the accuracy of SCDs as defined by WHO criteria or emergency medical services records in aggregate mortality data, clinical trials, and cohort studies.</p></sec>

Lower Risk of Heart Failure and Death in Patients Initiated on Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter-2 Inhibitors Versus Other Glucose-Lowering Drugs
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Reduction in cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) was recently reported with the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT-2i) empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. We compared HHF and death in patients newly initiated on any SGLT-2i versus other glucose-lowering drugs in 6 countries to determine if these benefits are seen in real-world practice and across SGLT-2i class.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data were collected via medical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">claim</span></strong>s, primary care/hospital records, and national registries from the United States, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Propensity score for SGLT-2i initiation was used to match treatment groups. Hazard ratios for HHF, death, and their combination were estimated by country and pooled to determine weighted effect size. Death data were not available for Germany.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>After propensity matching, there were 309 056 patients newly initiated on either SGLT-2i or other glucose-lowering drugs (154 528 patients in each treatment group). Canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin accounted for 53%, 42%, and 5% of the total exposure time in the SGLT-2i class, respectively. Baseline characteristics were balanced between the 2 groups. There were 961 HHF cases during 190 164 person-years follow-up (incidence rate, 0.51/100 person-years). Of 215 622 patients in the United States, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, death occurred in 1334 (incidence rate, 0.87/100 person-years), and HHF or death in 1983 (incidence rate, 1.38/100 person-years). Use of SGLT-2i, versus other glucose-lowering drugs, was associated with lower rates of HHF (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% confidence interval, 0.51–0.73; <i>P</i><0.001); death (hazard ratio, 0.49; 95% confidence interval, 0.41–0.57; <i>P</i><0.001); and HHF or death (hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% confidence interval, 0.48–0.60; <i>P</i><0.001) with no significant heterogeneity by country.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In this large multinational study, treatment with SGLT-2i versus other glucose-lowering drugs was associated with a lower risk of HHF and death, suggesting that the benefits seen with empagliflozin in a randomized trial may be a class effect applicable to a broad population of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in real-world practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Association Between a Prolonged PR Interval and Outcomes of Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>A prolonged PR interval is common among cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) candidates; however, the association between PR interval and outcomes is unclear, and the data are conflicting.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted inverse probability weighted analyses of 26 451 CRT-eligible (ejection fraction ≤35, QRS ≥120 ms) patients from the National Cardiovascular Data Registry ICD Registry to assess the association between a prolonged PR interval (≥230 ms), receipt of CRT with defibrillator (CRT-D) versus implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), and outcomes. We first tested the association between a prolonged PR interval and outcomes among patients stratified by device type. Next, we performed a comparative effectiveness analysis of CRT-D versus ICD among patients when stratified by PR interval. Using Medicare <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">claim</span></strong>s data, we followed up with patients up to 5 years for incident heart failure hospitalization or death.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Patients with a PR≥230 ms (15%; n=4035) were older and had more comorbidities, including coronary artery disease, atrial arrhythmias, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. After risk adjustment, a PR≥230 ms (versus PR<230 ms) was associated with increased risk of heart failure hospitalization or death among CRT-D (hazard ratio, 1.23; 95% confidence interval, 1.14–1.31; <i>P</i><0.001) but not ICD recipients (hazard ratio, 1.08; 95% confidence interval, 0.97–1.20; <i>P</i>=0.17) (<i>P</i><sub>interaction</sub>=0.043).

Repeat Coronary Revascularization After Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery in Older Adults
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>A major advantage of coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) relative to percutaneous coronary intervention is its durability, yet there is a paucity of information on rates and predictors of repeat coronary revascularization after CABG in the modern era.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We included patients ≥65 years from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons’ National Adult Cardiac Surgery Database who were undergoing first-time isolated CABG from 1991 to 2007 (n=723 134, median age 73 years). After linking to Medicare <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">claim</span></strong>s data, long-term outcomes of CABG (up to 18 years after surgery) were examined by use of cumulative incidence curves. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard analysis was used to identify factors associated with 1- and 5-year repeat revascularization trends and variability. We found that the overall 18-year survival rate was 20%. Cumulative incidences of any repeat revascularization (percutaneous coronary intervention or CABG, yet most often percutaneous coronary intervention) were 2%, 7%, 13%, and 16% at 1, 5, 10, and 18 years after surgery, respectively. The rates of repeat CABG procedures were quite low for all time points (0.1%, 0.6%, 1.3%, and 1.7%, respectively). Female sex, disease severity represented by a history of percutaneous coronary intervention, preoperative dialysis, and partial revascularization were strongly associated with a higher revascularization rate, whereas advanced age, left main disease, and smoking were associated with a lower rate. There was approximately a 2-fold variation in repeat revascularization rates across centers at 1 year (interquartile range 1.7–3.6%) and 5 years (interquartile range 6.7–12.0%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Repeat revascularization is performed infrequently among older patients who undergo CABG; however, these rates vary substantially by patient subgroups and among providers.</p></sec>

Long-Term Safety and Effectiveness of Mechanical Versus Biologic Aortic Valve Prostheses in Older Patients
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>There is a paucity of long-term data comparing biological versus mechanical aortic valve prostheses in older individuals.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We performed follow-up of patients aged 65 to 80 years undergoing aortic valve replacement with a biological (n=24 410) or mechanical (n=14 789) prosthesis from 1991 to 1999 at 605 centers within the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database using Medicare inpatient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">claim</span></strong>s (mean, 12.6 years; maximum, 17 years; minimum, 8 years), and outcomes were compared by propensity methods. Among Medicare-linked patients undergoing aortic valve replacement (mean age, 73 years), both reoperation (4.0%) and endocarditis (1.9%) were uncommon to 12 years; however, the risk for other adverse outcomes was high, including death (66.5%), stroke (14.1%), and bleeding (17.9%). Compared with those receiving a mechanical valve, patients given a bioprosthesis had a similar adjusted risk for death (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.01–1.07), higher risks for reoperation (hazard ratio, 2.55; 95% confidence interval, 2.14–3.03) and endocarditis (hazard ratio, 1.60; 95% confidence interval, 1.31–1.94), and lower risks for stroke (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.82–0.93) and bleeding (hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.62–0.70).

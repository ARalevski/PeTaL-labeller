[C <sc>ii</sc>] 158-μm emission from the host galaxies of damped Lyman-alpha systems
<p>Gas surrounding high-redshift galaxies has been studied through observations of absorption line systems toward background quasars for decades. However, it has proven difficult to identify and characterize the galaxies associated with these absorbers due to the intrinsic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">faint</span></strong>ness of the galaxies compared with the quasars at optical wavelengths. Using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array, we report on detections of [C <sc>ii</sc>] 158-μm line and dust-continuum emission from two galaxies associated with two such absorbers at a redshift of <i>z</i> ~ 4. Our results indicate that the hosts of these high-metallicity absorbers have physical properties similar to massive star-forming galaxies and are embedded in enriched neutral hydrogen gas reservoirs that extend well beyond the star-forming interstellar medium of these galaxies.</p>

Selective modulation of cortical state during spatial attention
<p>Neocortical activity is permeated with endogenously generated fluctuations, but how these dynamics affect goal-directed behavior remains a mystery. We found that ensemble neural activity in primate visual cortex spontaneously fluctuated between phases of vigorous (On) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">faint</span></strong> (Off) spiking synchronously across cortical layers. These On-Off dynamics, reflecting global changes in cortical state, were also modulated at a local scale during selective attention. Moreover, the momentary phase of local ensemble activity predicted behavioral performance. Our results show that cortical state is controlled locally within a cortical map according to cognitive demands and reveal the impact of these local changes in cortical state on goal-directed behavior.</p>

Faithful mRNA splicing depends on the Prp19 complex subunit <i>faint sausage</i> and is required for tracheal branching morphogenesis in <i>Drosophila</i>
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> <i>Drosophila <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">faint</span></strong> sausage</i> (<i>fas</i>) encodes a subunit of the spliceosome activating Prp19 complex, which is essential for efficient pre-mRNA splicing.</p>

“Disruptor” residues in the regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) R12 subfamily attenuate the inactivation of Gα subunits
<p>Understanding the molecular basis of interaction specificity between RGS (regulator of G protein signaling) proteins and heterotrimeric (αβγ) G proteins would enable the manipulation of RGS-G protein interactions, explore their functions, and effectively target them therapeutically. RGS proteins are classified into four subfamilies (R4, R7, RZ, and R12) and function as negative regulators of G protein signaling by inactivating Gα subunits. We found that the R12 subfamily members RGS10 and RGS14 had lower activity than most R4 subfamily members toward the G<sub>i</sub> subfamily member Gα<sub>o</sub>. Using structure-based energy calculations with multiple Gα-RGS complexes, we identified R12-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">residu</span></strong>es in positions that are predicted to determine the divergent activity of this subfamily. This analysis predicted that these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">residu</span></strong>es, which we call “disruptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">residu</span></strong>es,” interact with the Gα helical domain. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eered the R12 disruptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">residu</span></strong>es into the RGS domains of the high-activity R4 subfamily and found that these altered proteins exhibited reduced activity toward Gα<sub>o</sub>. Reciprocally, replacing the putative disruptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">residu</span></strong>es in RGS18 (a member of the R4 subfamily that exhibited low activity toward Gα<sub>o</sub>) with the corresponding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">residu</span></strong>es from a high-activity R4 subfamily RGS protein increased its activity toward Gα<sub>o</sub>. Furthermore, the high activity of the R4 subfamily toward Gα<sub>o</sub> was independent of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">residu</span></strong>es in the homologous positions to the R12 subfamily and RGS18 disruptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">residu</span></strong>es. Thus, our results suggest that the identified RGS disruptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">residu</span></strong>es function as negative design elements that attenuate RGS activity for specific Gα proteins.</p>

Signal Dynamics and Interactions during Flooding Stress
<p>Flooding is detrimental for nearly all higher plants, including crops. The compound stress elicited by slow gas exchange and low light levels under water is responsible for both a carbon and an energy crisis ultimately leading to plant death. The endogenous concentrations of four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gase</span></strong>ous compounds, oxygen, carbon dioxide, ethylene, and nitric oxide, change during the submergence of plant organs in water. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gase</span></strong>s play a pivotal role in signal transduction cascades, leading to adaptive processes such as metabolic adjustments and anatomical features. Of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gase</span></strong>s, ethylene is seen as the most consistent, pervasive, and reliable signal of early flooding stress, most likely in tight interaction with the other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gase</span></strong>s. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in plant cells during flooding and directly after subsidence, during which the plant is confronted with high light and oxygen levels, is characteristic for this abiotic stress. Low, well-controlled levels of ROS are essential for adaptive signaling pathways, in interaction with the other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gase</span></strong>ous flooding signals. On the other hand, excessive uncontrolled bursts of ROS can be highly damaging for plants. Therefore, a fine-tuned balance is important, with a major role for ROS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion and scav<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>g. Our understanding of the temporal dynamics of the four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gase</span></strong>s and ROS is basal, whereas it is likely that they form a signature readout of prevailing flooding conditions and subsequent adaptive responses.</p>

Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Phosphatases Affect UV-B-Induced Stomatal Closure via Controlling NO in Guard Cells
<p>Ultraviolet B (UV-B) radiation induces the activation of MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE PHOSPHATASE1 (MKP1) and its targets MPK3 and MPK6, but whether they participate in UV-B guard cell signaling is not clear. Here, evidence shows that UV-B-induced stomatal closure in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) is antagonistically regulated by MKP1 and MPK6 via modulating hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)-induced nitric oxide (NO) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion in guard cells. The <i>mkp1</i> mutant was hypersensitive to UV-B-induced stomatal closure and NO <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion in guard cells but not to UV-B-induced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion, suggesting that MKP1 negatively regulates UV-B-induced stomatal closure via inhibiting NO generation in guard cells. Moreover, MPK3 and MPK6 were activated by UV-B in leaves of the wild type and hyperactivated in the <i>mkp1</i> mutant, but the UV-B-induced activation of MPK3 and MPK6 was largely inhibited in mutants for <i>ATRBOHD</i> and <i>ATRBOHF</i> but not in mutants for <i>NIA1</i> and <i>NIA2</i>. <i>mpk6</i> mutants showed defects of UV-B-induced NO <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion and stomatal closure but were normal in UV-B-induced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion, while stomata of <i>mpk3</i> mutants responded to UV-B just like those of the wild type. The defect of UV-B-induced stomatal closure in <i>mpk6</i> mutants was rescued by exogenous NO but not by exogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Furthermore, double mutant <i>mkp1</i>/<i>mpk6</i> and the single mutant <i>mpk6</i> showed the same responses to UV-B in terms of either stomatal movement or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and NO <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion. These data indicate that MPK6, but not MPK3, positively regulates UV-B-induced stomatal closure via acting downstream of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and upstream of NO, while MKP1 functions negatively in UV-B guard cell signaling via down-regulation of MPK6.</p>

Endocrine regulation of carbonate precipitate formation in marine fish intestine by stanniocalcin and PTHrP
<p>In marine fish, high epithelial bicarbonate secretion by the intestine generates luminal carbonate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precipit</span></strong>ates of divalent cations that play a key role in water and ion homeostasis. <i>In vitro</i> studies highlight the involvement of the calciotropic hormones PTHrP (parathyroid hormone-related protein) and stanniocalcin (STC) in the regulation of epithelial bicarbonate transport. The present study tested the hypothesis that calciotropic hormones have a regulatory role in carbonate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precipit</span></strong>ate formation <i>in vivo</i>. Sea bream (<i>Sparus aurata</i>) juveniles received single intraperitoneal injections of piscine PTHrP(1–34), the PTH/PTHrP receptor antagonist PTHrP(7–34) or purified sea bream STC, or were passively immunized with polyclonal rabbit antisera raised against sea bream STC (STC-Ab). Endocrine effects on the expression of the basolateral sodium bicarbonate co-transporter (Slc4a4.A), the apical anion exchangers Slc26a6.A and Slc26a3.B, and the V-type proton pump β-subunit (Atp6v1b) in the anterior intestine were evaluated. In keeping with their calciotropic nature, the hypocalcaemic factors PTHrP(7–34) and STC up-regulated gene expression of all transporters. In contrast, the hypercalcaemic factor PTHrP(1–34) and STC antibodies down-regulated transporters involved in the bicarbonate secretion cascade. Changes in intestine luminal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precipit</span></strong>ate contents provoked by calcaemic endocrine factors validated these results: 24 h post-injection either PTHrP(1–34) or immunization with STC-Ab reduced the carbonate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precipit</span></strong>ate content in the sea bream intestine. In contrast, the PTH/PTHrP receptor antagonist PTHrP(7–34) increased not only the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precipit</span></strong>ated fraction but also the concentration of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> equivalents in the intestinal fluid. These results confirm the hypothesis that calciotropic hormones have a regulatory role in carbonate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precipit</span></strong>ate formation <i>in vivo</i> in the intestine of marine fish. Furthermore, they illustrate for the first time in fish the counteracting effect of PTHrP and STC, and reveal an unexpected contribution of calcaemic factors to acid–base balance.</p>

Ecophysiological variables influencing Aleppo pine seed and cone production: a review
<p>The most interesting factors associated with seed and cone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of Aleppo pine were largely reviewed to identify broad patterns and potential effectiveness of reforestation efforts and planning. Aleppo pine cone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion and seed yields are relatively variable, with differences between spatial and temporal influences. These differences are considered, mainly between (i) year, (ii) stand characteristics and (iii) individual tree measurements. Annual variability among populations was recorded for cone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion per tree, based on influencing factors such as genetic characteristics, wetness, nutrient availability, insect pests and disease. In addition, some factors may affect Aleppo pine tree growth directly but may be affecting seed and cone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion indirectly. Therefore, reduced stand density results in less competition among Aleppo pine trees and accompanying understory flora, which subsequently increases the stem diameter and other tree dimensions, including seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion. This review suggests that reforestation planning, particularly thinning, will result in improved tree morphology that will increase Aleppo pine seed and cone crops. Wildfire intensity and stand conditions such as light and soil nutrient status are also examined.</p>

Structural basis for the preference of the <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> phosphatase RLPH2 for tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates
<p>Despite belonging to the phosphoserine- and phosphothreonine-specific phosphoprotein phosphatase (PPP) family, <i>Arabidopsis thaliana Rhizobiales</i>-like phosphatase 2 (RLPH2) strongly prefers substrates bearing phosphorylated tyrosine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">residu</span></strong>es. We solved the structures of RLPH2 crystallized in the presence or absence of sodium tungstate. These structures revealed the presence of a central domain that forms a binding site for two divalent metal ions that closely resembles that of other PPP-family enzymes. Unique structural elements from two flanking domains suggest a mechanism for the selective dephosphorylation of phosphotyrosine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">residu</span></strong>es. Cocrystallization with the phosphate mimetic tungstate also suggests how positively charged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">residu</span></strong>es that are highly conserved in the RLPH2 class form an additional pocket that is specific for a phosphothreonine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">residu</span></strong>e located near the phosphotyrosine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">residu</span></strong>e that is bound to the active site.

The host microRNA miR-301a blocks the IRF1-mediated neuronal innate immune response to Japanese encephalitis virus infection
<p>Effective recognition of viral components and the subsequent stimulation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of type I interferons (IFNs) is crucial for the induction of host antiviral immunity. The failure of the host to efficiently produce type I IFNs in response to infection by the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is linked with an increased probability for the disease to become lethal. JEV is a neurotropic virus of the <i>Flaviviridae</i> family that causes encephalitis in humans. JEV infection is regulated by several host factors, including microRNAs, which are conserved noncoding RNAs that participate in various physiological and pathological processes. We showed that the JEV-induced expression of <i>miR-301a</i> led to inhibition of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of type I IFN by reducing the abundances of the transcription factor IFN regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) and the signaling protein suppressor of cytokine signaling 5 (SOCS5). Mechanistically, induction of <i>miR-301a</i> expression during JEV infection required the transcription factor nuclear factor κB. In mouse neurons, neutralization of miR-301a restored the host innate immune response by enabling IFN-β <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion, thereby restricting viral propagation. Inhibition of miR-301a in mouse brain rescued the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of IRF1 and SOCS5, increased the generation of IFN-β, and reduced the extent of JEV replication, thus improving mouse survival. Thus, our study suggests that the JEV-induced expression of <i>miR-301a</i> assists viral pathogenesis by suppressing IFN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion, which might be targeted by antiviral therapies.</p>

Differential IL-2 expression defines developmental fates of follicular versus nonfollicular helper T cells

Interleukin-2 (IL-2), the major cytokine produced by naive T cells, plays an important role in the developmental divergence of these populations.

A Palmitic Acid Elongase Affects Eicosapentaenoic Acid and Plastidial Monogalactosyldiacylglycerol Levels in Nannochloropsis
<p><i>Nannochloropsis</i> species are oleaginous eukaryotes containing a plastid limited by four membranes, deriving from a secondary endosymbiosis. In <i>Nannochloropsis</i>, thylakoid lipids, including monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG), are enriched in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). The need for EPA in MGDG is not understood. Fatty acids are de novo synthesized in the stroma, then converted into very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (FAs) at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of MGDG relies therefore on an EPA supply from the ER to the plastid, following an unknown process. We identified seven elon<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gase</span></strong>s and five desaturases possibly involved in EPA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion in <i>Nannochloropsis gaditana</i>. Among the six heterokont-specific saturated FA elon<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gase</span></strong>s possibly acting upstream in this pathway, we characterized the highly expressed isoform <i>Δ0-ELO1</i>. Heterologous expression in yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) showed that NgΔ0-ELO1 could elongate palmitic acid. <i>Nannochloropsis</i> Δ0-elo1 mutants exhibited a reduced EPA level and a specific decrease in MGDG. In NgΔ0-elo1 lines, the impairment of photosynthesis is consistent with a role of EPA-rich MGDG in nonphotochemical quenching control, possibly providing an appropriate MGDG platform for the xanthophyll cycle. Concomitantly with MGDG decrease, the level of triacylglycerol (TAG) containing medium chain FAs increased. In <i>Nannochloropsis</i>, part of EPA used for MGDG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion is therefore biosynthesized by a channeled process initiated at the elongation step of palmitic acid by Δ0-ELO1, thus acting as a committing enzyme for galactolipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion. Based on the MGDG/TAG balance controlled by Δ0-ELO1, this study also provides novel prospects for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering of oleaginous microalgae for biotechnological applications.</p>

mTORC1 amplifies the ATF4-dependent de novo serine-glycine pathway to supply glycine during TGF-β<sub>1</sub>–induced collagen biosynthesis
<p>The differentiation of fibroblasts into a transient population of highly activated, extracellular matrix (ECM)–producing myofibroblasts at sites of tissue injury is critical for normal tissue repair. Excessive myofibroblast accumulation and persistence, often as a result of a failure to undergo apoptosis when tissue repair is complete, lead to pathological fibrosis and are also features of the stromal response in cancer. Myofibroblast differentiation is accompanied by changes in cellular metabolism, including increased glycolysis, to meet the biosynthetic demands of enhanced ECM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion. Here, we showed that transforming growth factor–β<sub>1</sub> (TGF-β<sub>1</sub>), the key pro-fibrotic cytokine implicated in multiple fibrotic conditions, increased the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), the transcriptional master regulator of amino acid metabolism, to supply glucose-derived glycine to meet the amino acid requirements associated with enhanced collagen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion in response to myofibroblast differentiation. We further delineated the signaling pathways involved and showed that TGF-β<sub>1</sub>–induced ATF4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion depended on cooperation between canonical TGF-β<sub>1</sub> signaling through Smad3 and activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and its downstream target eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1). ATF4, in turn, promoted the transcription of genes encoding enzymes of the de novo serine-glycine biosynthetic pathway and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1). Our findings suggest that targeting the TGF-β<sub>1</sub>–mTORC1–ATF4 axis may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for interfering with myofibroblast function in fibrosis and potentially in other conditions, including cancer.</p>

Pivotal role of STIM2, but not STIM1, in IL-4 production by IL-3–stimulated murine basophils
<p>Basophils have nonredundant roles in various immune responses that require Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Here, we examined the role of two Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors, stromal interaction molecule 1 and 2 (STIM1 and STIM2), in basophil activation. We found that loss of STIM1, but not STIM2, impaired basophil IL-4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion after stimulation with immunoglobulin E (IgE)–containing immune complexes. In contrast, when basophils were stimulated with IL-3, loss of STIM2, but not STIM1, reduced basophil IL-4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion. This difference in STIM proteins was associated with distinct time courses of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and transcription of the <i>Il4</i> gene that were elicited by each stimulus. Similarly, basophil-specific STIM1 expression was required for IgE-driven chronic allergic inflammation in vivo, whereas STIM2 was required for IL-4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion after combined IL-3 and IL-33 treatment in mice. These data indicate that STIM1 and STIM2 have differential roles in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of IL-4, which are stimulus dependent. Furthermore, these results illustrate the vital role of STIM2 in basophils, which is often considered to be less important than STIM1.</p>

HIPK2 is necessary for type I interferon–mediated antiviral immunity
<p>Precise control of interferons (IFNs) is crucial to maintain immune homeostasis. Here, we demonstrated that homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) was required for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of type I IFNs in response to RNA virus infection. HIPK2 deficiency markedly impaired IFN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion in macrophages after vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection, and HIPK2-deficient mice were more susceptible to lethal VSV disease than were wild-type mice. After VSV infection, HIPK2 was cleaved by active caspases, which released a hyperactive, N-terminal fragment that translocated to the nucleus and further augmented antiviral responses. In part, HIPK2 interacted with ELF4 and promoted its phosphorylation at Ser<sup>369</sup>, which enabled <i>Ifn-</i>b transcription.

Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate is a major source of GPCR-stimulated phosphoinositide production
<p>Phospholipase C (PLC) enzymes hydrolyze the plasma membrane (PM) lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI4,5P<sub>2</sub>) to generate the second messengers inositol trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) and diacylglycerol (DAG) in response to receptor activation in almost all mammalian cells. We previously found that stimulation of G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) in cardiac cells leads to the PLC-dependent hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) at the Golgi, a process required for the activation of nuclear protein kinase D (PKD) during cardiac hypertrophy. We hypothesized that GPCR-stimulated PLC activation leading to direct PI4P hydrolysis may be a general mechanism for DAG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion. We measured GPCR activation–dependent changes in PM and Golgi PI4P pools in various cells using GFP-based detection of PI4P. Stimulation with various agonists caused a time-dependent reduction in PI4P-associated, but not PI4,5P<sub>2</sub>-associated, fluorescence at the Golgi and PM. Targeted depletion of PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> from the PM before GPCR stimulation had no effect on the depletion of PM or Golgi PI4P, total inositol phosphate (IP) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion, or PKD activation. In contrast, acute depletion of PI4P specifically at the PM completely blocked the GPCR-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of IPs and activation of PKD but did not change the abundance of PI4,5P<sub>2</sub>. Acute depletion of Golgi PI4P had no effect on these processes. These data suggest that most of the PM PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> pool is not involved in GPCR-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis and that PI4P at the PM is responsible for the bulk of receptor-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis and DAG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion.</p>

The interaction between IKKα and LC3 promotes type I interferon production through the TLR9-containing LAPosome
<p>Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) recognizes DNA in endosomes and activates distinct signaling pathways to stimulate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of proinflammatory cytokines and type I interferons (IFNs). The assembly of signaling platforms on microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B–light chain 3 (LC3)–decorated endosomal vesicles is required to transduce TLR9 signals that stimulate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of IFN but not interleukin-12 p40 (IL-12p40). LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP), a form of noncanonical autophagy, is critical for the activation of interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) and for IFN synthesis. We showed that after the stimulation of TLR9 by CpG oligonucleotides, the autophagy protein LC3 and the kinase IKKα were recruited to endosomes that contained TLR9. The recruitment of IKKα and LC3 to such signaling endosomes was not stimulated by catalysts of classical autophagosome formation but involved LAP formation, which required ATG5 but not FIP200. In addition, we found that the LC3-IKKα complex further associated with both TRAF3 and IRF7. We identified three putative LC3-interacting regions (LIRs) in IKKα, and mutagenesis suggested that two of these were critical for direct binding to LC3. Moreover, mutation of the same LIR sequences failed to rescue type I IFN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion in IKKα-deficient dendritic cells upon reconstitution. Together, these data suggest a direct link between LAP formation and IKKα recruitment downstream of TLR9 activation that is necessary to facilitate type I IFN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion.</p>

Nuclear PTEN enhances the maturation of a microRNA regulon to limit MyD88-dependent susceptibility to sepsis
<p>Sepsis-induced organ damage is caused by systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), which results in substantial comorbidities. Therefore, it is of medical importance to identify molecular brakes that can be exploited to dampen inflammation and prevent the development of SIRS. We investigated the role of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) in suppressing SIRS, increasing microbial clearance, and preventing lung damage. Septic patients and mice with sepsis exhibited increased <i>PTEN</i> expression in leukocytes. Myeloid-specific <i>Pten</i> deletion in an animal model of sepsis increased bacterial loads and cytokine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion, which depended on enhanced myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) abundance and resulted in mortality. PTEN-mediated induction of the microRNAs (miRNAs) miR125b and miR203b reduced the abundance of MyD88. Loss- and gain-of-function assays demonstrated that PTEN induced miRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion by associating with and facilitating the nuclear localization of Drosha-Dgcr8, part of the miRNA-processing complex. Reconstitution of PTEN-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts with a mutant form of PTEN that does not localize to the nucleus resulted in retention of Drosha-Dgcr8 in the cytoplasm and impaired <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of mature miRNAs. Thus, we identified a regulatory pathway involving nuclear PTEN–mediated miRNA generation that limits the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of MyD88 and thereby limits sepsis-associated mortality.</p>

Climate model shows large-scale wind and solar farms in the Sahara increase rain and vegetation
<p>Wind and solar farms offer a major pathway to clean, renewable energies. However, these farms would significantly change land surface properties, and, if sufficiently large, the farms may lead to unintended climate consequences. In this study, we used a climate model with dynamic vegetation to show that large-scale installations of wind and solar farms covering the Sahara lead to a local temperature increase and more than a twofold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precipit</span></strong>ation increase, especially in the Sahel, through increased surface friction and reduced albedo. The resulting increase in vegetation further enhances <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precipit</span></strong>ation, creating a positive albedo–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precipit</span></strong>ation–vegetation feedback that contributes ~80% of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precipit</span></strong>ation increase for wind farms. This local enhancement is scale dependent and is particular to the Sahara, with small impacts in other deserts.</p>

Selective targeting of engineered T cells using orthogonal IL-2 cytokine-receptor complexes
<p>Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a cytokine required for effector T cell expansion, survival, and function, especially for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eered T cells in adoptive cell immunotherapy, but its pleiotropy leads to simultaneous stimulation and suppression of immune responses as well as systemic toxicity, limiting its therapeutic use.

Metabolic recycling of ammonia via glutamate dehydrogenase supports breast cancer biomass
<p>Ammonia is a ubiquitous by-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong> of cellular metabolism; however, the biological consequences of ammonia <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion are not fully understood, especially in cancer. We found that ammonia is not merely a toxic waste <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong> but is recycled into central amino acid metabolism to maximize nitrogen utilization. In our experiments, human breast cancer cells primarily assimilated ammonia through reductive amination catalyzed by glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH); secondary reactions enabled other amino acids, such as proline and aspartate, to directly acquire this nitrogen. Metabolic recycling of ammonia accelerated proliferation of breast cancer. In mice, ammonia accumulated in the tumor microenvironment and was used directly to generate amino acids through GDH activity. These data show that ammonia is not only a secreted waste <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong> but also a fundamental nitrogen source that can support tumor biomass.</p>

Eutrophication will increase during the 21st century as a result of precipitation changes
<p>Eutrophication, or excessive nutrient enrichment, threatens water resources across the globe.

Super-dry reforming of methane intensifies CO<sub>2</sub> utilization via Le Chatelier’s principle
<p>Efficient CO<sub>2</sub> transformation from a waste <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong> to a carbon source for chemicals and fuels will require reaction conditions that effect its reduction. We developed a “super-dry” CH<sub>4</sub> reforming reaction for enhanced CO <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion from CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>. We used Ni/MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> as a CH<sub>4</sub>-reforming catalyst, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> as a solid oxygen carrier, and CaO/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> as a CO<sub>2</sub> sorbent. The isothermal coupling of these three different processes resulted in higher CO <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion as compared with that of conventional dry reforming, by avoiding back reactions with water. The reduction of iron oxide was intensified through CH<sub>4</sub> conversion to syngas over Ni and CO<sub>2</sub> extraction and storage as CaCO<sub>3</sub>. CO<sub>2</sub> is then used for iron reoxidation and CO <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion, exploiting equilibrium shifts effected with inert gas sweeping (Le Chatelier’s principle). Super-dry reforming uses up to three CO<sub>2</sub> molecules per CH<sub>4</sub> and offers a high CO space-time yield of 7.5 millimole CO per second per kilogram of iron at 1023 kelvin.</p>

ABC Transporter-Mediated Transport of Glutathione Conjugates Enhances Seed Yield and Quality in Chickpea
<p>The identification of functionally relevant molecular tags is vital for genomics-assisted crop improvement and enhancement of seed yield, quality, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ivity in chickpea (<i>Cicer arietinum</i>). The simultaneous improvement of yield/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ivity as well as quality traits often requires pyramiding of multiple genes, which remains a major hurdle given various associated epistatic and pleotropic effects. Unfortunately, no single gene that can improve yield/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ivity along with quality and other desirable agromorphological traits is known, hampering the genetic enhancement of chickpea. Using a combinatorial genomics-assisted breeding and functional genomics strategy, this study identified natural alleles and haplotypes of an <i>ABCC3</i>-type transporter gene that regulates seed weight, an important domestication trait, by transcriptional regulation and modulation of the transport of glutathione conjugates in seeds of <i>desi</i> and <i>kabuli</i> chickpea. The superior allele/haplotype of this gene introgressed in <i>desi</i> and <i>kabuli</i> near-isogenic lines enhances the seed weight, yield, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ivity, and multiple desirable plant architecture and seed-quality traits without compromising agronomic performance. These salient findings can expedite crop improvement endeavors and the development of nutritionally enriched high-yielding cultivars in chickpea.</p>

Chloroplast Accumulation Response Enhances Leaf Photosynthesis and Plant Biomass Production
<p>Under high light intensity, chloroplasts avoid absorbing excess light by moving to anticlinal cell walls (avoidance response), but under low light intensity, chloroplasts accumulate along periclinal cell walls (accumulation response). In most plant species, these responses are induced by blue light and are mediated by the blue light photoreceptor, phototropin, which also regulates phototropism, leaf flattening, and stomatal opening. These phototropin-mediated responses could enhance photosynthesis and biomass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion. Here, using various Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants deficient in chloroplast movement, we demonstrated that the accumulation response enhances leaf photosynthesis and plant biomass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion. Conspicuously, <i>phototropin2</i> mutant plants specifically defective in the avoidance response but not in other phototropin-mediated responses displayed a constitutive accumulation response irrespective of light intensities, enhanced leaf photosynthesis, and increased plant biomass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion. Therefore, our findings provide clear experimental evidence of the importance of the chloroplast accumulation response in leaf photosynthesis and biomass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion.</p>

The Ubiquitin E3 Ligase RHA2b Promotes Degradation of MYB30 in Abscisic Acid Signaling
<p>The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) is critical for plants encountering abiotic stress. We reported previously that the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) transcription factor MYB30 participates in ABA responses via SUMO li<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gase</span></strong> SAP-MIZ Domain-Containing SIZ1-mediated sumoylation. Here, we show that the RING-type ubiquitin E3 li<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gase</span></strong> RHA2b, which positively regulates ABA signaling, interacted with and ubiquitinated MYB30 to modulate MYB30 stability through the 26S proteasome pathway. The degradation rate of MYB30 was repressed significantly in the <i>rha2b-1</i> mutant. Phenotypic analyses showed that <i>MYB30</i> acts genetically downstream of <i>RHA2b</i> in ABA signaling. Substitutions of lysine-283 (K283) and K165 blocked ubiquitination, suggesting that these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">residu</span></strong>es are sites of ubiquitination. K283 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">residu</span></strong>e substitution significantly inhibited the degradation of MYB30 induced by ABA. The K165 site functioned additively with K283 in ABA-induced MYB30 degradation and ABA responses. At the same time, sumoylation protected MYB30 from degradation under cycloheximide and ABA treatment. Compared with MYB30, overexpression of MYB30-SUMO1 partially recovered the ABA sensitivity of <i>siz1-2</i>. But MYB30-SUMO1 exhibited similar localization with MYB30 in nuclei. Overall, our results suggest that RHA2b targets MYB30 for degradation to modulate ABA signaling. Considering that the K283 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">residu</span></strong>e also is the major site for sumoylation, we propose that sumoylation and ubiquitination act antagonistically in the ABA response to regulate the stability of MYB30 by occupying the same <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">residu</span></strong>e.</p>

Biochemical and Structural Analysis of Substrate Specificity of a Phenylalanine Ammonia-Lyase
<p>Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) is the first enzyme of the general phenylpropanoid pathway catalyzing the nonoxidative elimination of ammonia from <sc>l</sc>-phenylalanine to give <i>trans</i>-cinnamate. In monocots, PAL also displays tyrosine ammonia lyase (TAL) activity, leading to the formation of <i>p</i>-coumaric acid. The catalytic mechanism and substrate specificity of a major PAL from sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>; SbPAL1), a strategic plant for bioenergy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion, were deduced from crystal structures, molecular docking, site-directed mutagenesis, and kinetic and thermodynamic analyses. This first crystal structure of a monocotyledonous PAL displayed a unique conformation in its flexible inner loop of the 4-methylidene-imidazole-5-one (MIO) domain compared with that of dicotyledonous plants. The side chain of histidine-123 in the MIO domain dictated the distance between the catalytic MIO prosthetic group created from <sup>189</sup>Ala-Ser-Gly<sup>191</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">residu</span></strong>es and the bound <sc>l</sc>-phenylalanine and <sc>l</sc>-tyrosine, conferring the deamination reaction through either the Friedel-Crafts or E<sub>2</sub> reaction mechanism. Several recombinant mutant SbPAL1 enzymes were generated via structure-guided mutagenesis, one of which, H123F-SbPAL1, has 6.2 times greater PAL activity without significant TAL activity. Additional PAL isozymes of sorghum were characterized and categorized into three groups. Taken together, this approach identified critical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">residu</span></strong>es and explained substrate preferences among PAL isozymes in sorghum and other monocots, which can serve as the basis for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering of plants with enhanced biomass conversion properties, disease resistance, or nutritional quality.</p>

Dynamics of Ethylene Production in Response to Compatible Nod Factor
<p>Establishment of symbiotic nitrogen-fixation in legumes is regulated by the plant hormone ethylene, but it has remained unclear whether and how its biosynthesis is regulated by the symbiotic pathway. We established a sensitive ethylene detection system for <i>Lotus japonicus</i> and found that ethylene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion increased as early as 6 hours after inoculation with <i>Mesorhizobium loti</i>. This ethylene response was dependent on Nod factor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion by compatible rhizobia. Analyses of nodulation mutants showed that perception of Nod factor was required for ethylene emission, while downstream transcription factors including CYCLOPS, NIN, and ERN1 were not required for this response. Activation of the nodulation signaling pathway in spontaneously nodulating mutants was also sufficient to elevate ethylene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion. Ethylene signaling is controlled by EIN2, which is duplicated in <i>L. japonicus</i>. We obtained a <i>L. japonicus Ljein2a Ljein2b</i> double mutant that exhibits complete ethylene insensitivity and confirms that these two genes act redundantly in ethylene signaling. Consistent with this redundancy, both <i>LjEin2a</i> and <i>LjEin2b</i> are required for negative regulation of nodulation and <i>Ljein2a Ljein2b</i> double mutants are hypernodulating and hyperinfected. We also identified an unexpected role for ethylene in the onset of nitrogen fixation, with the <i>Ljein2a Ljein2b</i> double mutant showing severely reduced nitrogen fixation. These results demonstrate that ethylene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion is an early and sustained nodulation response that acts at multiple stages to regulate infection, nodule organogenesis, and nitrogen fixation in <i>L. japonicus</i>.</p>

Different Routes for Conifer- and Sinapaldehyde and Higher Saccharification upon Deficiency in the Dehydrogenase CAD1
<p>In the search for renewable energy sources, genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering is a promising strategy to improve plant cell wall composition for biofuel and bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>s generation. Lignin is a major factor determining saccharification efficiency and, therefore, is a prime target to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eer. Here, lignin content and composition were modified in poplar (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus alba</i>) by specifically down-regulating <i>CINNAMYL ALCOHOL DEHYDROGENASE1</i> (<i>CAD1</i>) by a hairpin-RNA-mediated silencing approach, which resulted in only 5% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">residu</span></strong>al <i>CAD1</i> transcript abundance. These transgenic lines showed no biomass penalty despite a 10% reduction in Klason lignin content and severe shifts in lignin composition. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and thioacidolysis revealed a strong increase (up to 20-fold) in sinapaldehyde incorporation into lignin, whereas coniferaldehyde was not increased markedly. Accordingly, ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based phenolic profiling revealed a more than 24,000-fold accumulation of a newly identified compound made from 8-8 coupling of two sinapaldehyde radicals. However, no additional cinnamaldehyde coupling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>s could be detected in the CAD1-deficient poplars. Instead, the transgenic lines accumulated a range of hydroxycinnamate-derived metabolites, of which the most prominent accumulation (over 8,500-fold) was observed for a compound that was identified by purification and nuclear magnetic resonance as syringyl lactic acid hexoside. Our data suggest that, upon down-regulation of <i>CAD1</i>, coniferaldehyde is converted into ferulic acid and derivatives, whereas sinapaldehyde is either oxidatively coupled into S′(8-8)S′ and lignin or converted to sinapic acid and derivatives. The most prominent sink of the increased flux to hydroxycinnamates is syringyl lactic acid hexoside. Furthermore, low-extent saccharification assays, under different pretreatment conditions, showed strongly increased glucose (up to +81%) and xylose (up to +153%) release, suggesting that down-regulating <i>CAD1</i> is a promising strategy for improving lignocellulosic biomass for the sugar platform industry.</p>

Stearoyl-Acyl Carrier Protein Desaturase Mutations Uncover an Impact of Stearic Acid in Leaf and Nodule Structure
<p>Stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturase (SACPD-C) has been reported to control the accumulation of seed stearic acid; however, no study has previously reported its involvement in leaf stearic acid content and impact on leaf structure and morphology. A subset of an ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenized population of soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) ‘Forrest’ was screened to identify mutants within the <i>GmSACPD-C</i> gene. Using a forward genetics approach, one nonsense and four missense <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutants were identified to have high levels of seed, nodule, and leaf stearic acid content. Homology modeling and in silico analysis of the GmSACPD-C enzyme revealed that most of these mutations were localized near or at conserved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">residu</span></strong>es essential for diiron ion coordination. Soybeans carrying <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutations at conserved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">residu</span></strong>es showed the highest stearic acid content, and these mutations were found to have deleterious effects on nodule development and function. Interestingly, mutations at nonconserved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">residu</span></strong>es show an increase in stearic acid content yet retain healthy nodules. Thus, random mutagenesis and mutational analysis allows for the achievement of high seed stearic acid content with no associated negative agronomic characteristics. Additionally, expression analysis demonstrates that nodule leghemoglobin transcripts were significantly more abundant in soybeans with deleterious mutations at conserved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">residu</span></strong>es of GmSACPD-C. Finally, we report that <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutations cause an increase in leaf stearic acid content and an alteration of leaf structure and morphology in addition to differences in nitrogen-fixing nodule structure.</p>

Salicylic Acid-Dependent Plant Stress Signaling via Mitochondrial Succinate Dehydrogenase
<p>Mitochondria are known for their role in ATP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion and generation of reactive oxygen species, but little is known about the mechanism of their early involvement in plant stress signaling. The role of mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) in salicylic acid (SA) signaling was analyzed using two mutants: <i>disrupted in stress response1</i> (<i>dsr1</i>), which is a point mutation in SDH1 identified in a loss of SA signaling screen, and a knockdown mutant (<i>sdhaf2</i>) for SDH assembly factor 2 that is required for FAD insertion into SDH1. Both mutants showed strongly decreased SA-inducible stress promoter responses and low SDH maximum capacity compared to wild type, while <i>dsr1</i> also showed low succinate affinity, low catalytic efficiency, and increased resistance to SDH competitive inhibitors. The SA-induced promoter responses could be partially rescued in <i>sdhaf2</i>, but not in <i>dsr1</i>, by supplementing the plant growth media with succinate. Kinetic characterization showed that low concentrations of either SA or ubiquinone binding site inhibitors increased SDH activity and induced mitochondrial H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion. Both <i>dsr1</i> and <i>sdhaf2</i> showed lower rates of SA-dependent H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion in vitro in line with their low SA-dependent stress signaling responses in vivo. This provides quantitative and kinetic evidence that SA acts at or near the ubiquinone binding site of SDH to stimulate activity and contributes to plant stress signaling by increased rates of mitochondrial H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion, leading to part of the SA-dependent transcriptional response in plant cells.</p>

The metabolic cost of communicative sound production in bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>)
<p>Bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>) produce various communicative sounds that are important for social behavior, maintaining group cohesion and coordinating foraging. For example, whistle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion increases during disturbances, such as separations of mother–calf pairs and vessel approaches. It is clear that acoustic communication is important to the survival of these marine mammals, yet the metabolic cost of producing whistles and other socials sounds and the energetic consequences of modifying these sounds in response to both natural and anthropogenic disturbance are unknown. We used flow-through respirometry to determine whether the metabolic cost of sound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion could be quantified in two captive dolphins producing social sounds (whistles and squawks). On average, we found that metabolic rates measured during 2 min periods of sound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion were 1.2 times resting values. Up to 7 min were required for metabolism to return to resting values following vocal periods. The total metabolic cost (over resting values) of the 2 min vocal period plus the required recovery period (163.3 to 2995.9 ml O<sub>2</sub> or 3279.6 to 60,166.7 J) varied by individual as well as by mean duration of sounds produced within the vocal period. Observed variation in received cumulative sound energy levels of vocalizations was not related to total metabolic costs. Furthermore, our empirical findings did not agree with previous theoretical estimates of the metabolic cost of whistles. This study provides the first empirical data on the metabolic cost of sound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion in dolphins, which can be used to estimate metabolic costs of vocal responses to environmental perturbations in wild dolphins.</p>

Snap deconvolution: An informatics approach to high-throughput discovery of catalytic reactions
<p>We present an approach to multidimensional high-throughput discovery of catalytic coupling reactions that integrates molecular design with automated analysis and interpretation of mass spectral data. We simultaneously assessed the reactivity of three pools of compounds that shared the same functional groups (halides, boronic acids, alkenes, and alkynes, among other groups) but carried inactive substituents having specifically designed differences in masses. The substituents were chosen such that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>s from any class of reaction in multiple reaction sets would have unique differences in masses, thus allowing simultaneous identification of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>s of all transformations in a set of reactants. In this way, we easily distinguished the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>s of new reactions from noise and known couplings. Using this method, we discovered an alkyne hydroallylation and a nickel-catalyzed variant of alkyne diarylation.</p>

An N-end rule pathway that recognizes proline and destroys gluconeogenic enzymes
<p>Cells synthesize glucose if deprived of it, and destroy gluconeogenic enzymes upon return to glucose-replete conditions. We found that the Gid4 subunit of the ubiquitin li<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gase</span></strong> GID in the yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> targeted the gluconeogenic enzymes Fbp1, Icl1, and Mdh2 for degradation. Gid4 recognized the N-terminal proline (Pro) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">residu</span></strong>e and the ~5-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">residu</span></strong>e-long adjacent sequence motifs. Pck1, the fourth gluconeogenic enzyme, contains Pro at position 2; Gid4 directly or indirectly recognized Pro at position 2 of Pck1, contributing to its targeting. These and related results identified Gid4 as the recognition component of the GID-based proteolytic system termed the Pro/N-end rule pathway. Substrates of this pathway include gluconeogenic enzymes that bear either the N-terminal Pro <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">residu</span></strong>e or a Pro at position 2, together with adjacent sequence motifs.</p>

Understanding BPR is critical for the accurate valuation and effective conservation of biodiversity.

Biosynthesis of 2-Phenylethanol in Rose Petals Is Linked to the Expression of One Allele of <i>RhPAAS</i>
<p>Floral scent is one of the most important characters in horticultural plants. Roses (<i>Rosa</i> spp.) have been cultivated for their scent since antiquity. However, probably by selecting for cultivars with long vase life, breeders have lost the fragrant character in many modern roses, especially the ones bred for the cut flower market. The genetic inheritance of scent characters has remained elusive so far. In-depth knowledge of this quantitative trait is thus very much needed to breed more fragrant commercial cultivars. Furthermore, rose hybrids harbor a composite genomic structure, which complexifies quantitative trait studies. To understand rose scent inheritance, we characterized a segregating population from two diploid cultivars, <i>Rosa</i> × <i>hybrida</i> cv H190 and <i>Rosa wichurana</i>, which have contrasting scent profiles. Several quantitative trait loci for the major volatile compounds in this progeny were identified. One among these loci contributing to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of 2-phenylethanol, responsible for the characteristic odor of rose, was found to be colocalized with a candidate gene belonging to the 2-phenylethanol biosynthesis pathway: the <i>PHENYLACETALDEHYDE SYNTHASE</i> gene <i>RhPAAS</i>. An in-depth allele-specific expression analysis in the progeny demonstrated that only one allele was highly expressed and was responsible for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of 2-phenylethanol. Unexpectedly, its expression was found to start early during flower development, before the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of the volatile 2-phenylethanol, leading to the accumulation of glycosylated compounds in petals.</p>

MoChlo: A Versatile, Modular Cloning Toolbox for Chloroplast Biotechnology
<p>Plant synthetic biology is a rapidly evolving field with new tools constantly emerging to drive innovation. Of particular interest is the application of synthetic biology to chloroplast biotechnology to generate plants capable of producing new metabolites, vaccines, biofuels, and high-value chemicals. Progress made in the assembly of large DNA molecules, composing multiple transcriptional units, has significantly aided in the ability to rapidly construct novel vectors for genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering. In particular, Golden Gate assembly has provided a facile molecular tool for standardized assembly of synthetic genetic elements into larger DNA constructs. In this work, a complete modular chloroplast cloning system, MoChlo, was developed and validated for fast and flexible chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering in plants. A library of 128 standardized chloroplast-specific parts (47 promoters, 38 5′ untranslated regions [5′UTRs], nine promoter:5′UTR fusions, 10 3′UTRs, 14 genes of interest, and 10 chloroplast-specific destination vectors) were mined from the literature and modified for use in MoChlo assembly, along with chloroplast-specific destination vectors. The strategy was validated by assembling synthetic operons of various sizes and determining the efficiency of assembly. This method was successfully used to generate chloroplast transformation vectors containing up to seven transcriptional units in a single vector (∼10.6-kb synthetic operon). To enable researchers with limited resources to engage in chloroplast biotechnology, and to accelerate progress in the field, the entire kit, as described, is available through Addgene at minimal cost. Thus, the MoChlo kit represents a valuable tool for fast and flexible design of heterologous metabolic pathways for plastid metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering.</p>

Non-Enzymatic Synthesis of Bioactive Isoprostanoids in the Diatom <i>Phaeodactylum</i> following Oxidative Stress
<p>The ecological success of diatoms requires a remarkable ability to survive many types of stress, including variations in temperature, light, salinity, and nutrient availability. On exposure to these stresses, diatoms exhibit common responses, including growth arrest, impairment of photosynthesis, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of reactive oxygen species, and accumulation of triacylglycerol (TAG). We studied the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of cyclopentane oxylipins derived from fatty acids in the diatom <i>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</i> in response to oxidative stress. <i>P. tricornutum</i> lacks the enzymatic pathway for producing cyclopentane-oxylipins, such as jasmonate, prostaglandins, or thromboxanes. In cells subjected to increasing doses of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), we detected nonenzymatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of isoprostanoids, including six phytoprostanes, three F<sub>2t</sub>-isoprostanes, two F<sub>3t</sub>-isoprostanes, and three F<sub>4t</sub>-neuroprostanes, by radical peroxidation of α-linolenic, arachidonic, eicosapentaenoic, and docosahexanoic acids, respectively. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> also triggered photosynthesis impairment and TAG accumulation. F<sub>1t</sub>-phytoprostanes constitute the major class detected (300 pmol per 1 million cells; intracellular concentration, ∼4 µ<sc>m</sc>). Only two glycerolipids, phosphatidylcholine and diacylglycerylhydroxymethyl-trimethyl-alanine, could provide all substrates for these isoprostanoids. Treatment of <i>P. tricornutum</i> with nine synthetic isoprostanoids produced an effect in the micromolar range, marked by the accumulation of TAG and reduced growth, without affecting photosynthesis. Therefore, the emission of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and free radicals upon exposure to stresses can lead to glycerolipid peroxidation and nonenzymatic synthesis of isoprostanoids, inhibiting growth and contributing to the induction of TAG accumulation via unknown processes. This characterization of nonenzymatic oxylipins in <i>P. tricornutum</i> opens a field of research on the study of processes controlled by isoprostanoid signaling in various physiological and environmental contexts in diatoms.</p>

Early Senescence in Older Leaves of Low Nitrate-Grown <i>Atxdh1</i> Uncovers a Role for Purine Catabolism in N Supply
<p>The nitrogen (N)-rich ureides allantoin and allantoate, which are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>s of purine catabolism, play a role in N delivery in Leguminosae. Here, we examined their role as an N source in nonlegume plants using Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants mutated in XANTHINE DEHYDROGENASE1 (AtXDH1), a catalytic bottleneck in purine catabolism. Older leaves of the <i>Atxdh1</i> mutant exhibited early senescence, lower soluble protein, and lower organic N levels as compared with wild-type older leaves when grown with 1 m<sc>m</sc> nitrate but were comparable to the wild type under 5 m<sc>m</sc> nitrate. Similar nitrate-dependent senescence phenotypes were evident in the older leaves of <i>allantoinase</i> (<i>Ataln</i>) and <i>allantoate amidohydrolase</i> (<i>Ataah</i>) mutants, which also are impaired in purine catabolism. Under low-nitrate conditions, xanthine accumulated in older leaves of <i>Atxdh1</i>, whereas allantoin accumulated in both older and younger leaves of <i>Ataln</i> but not in wild-type leaves, indicating the remobilization of xanthine-degraded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>s from older to younger leaves. Supporting this notion, ureide transporter expression was enhanced in older leaves of the wild type in low-nitrate as compared with high-nitrate conditions. Elevated transcripts and proteins of AtXDH and AtAAH were detected in low-nitrate-grown wild-type plants, indicating regulation at protein and transcript levels. The higher nitrate reductase activity in <i>Atxdh1</i> leaves compared with wild-type leaves indicated a need for nitrate assimilation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>s. Together, these results indicate that the absence of remobilized purine-degraded N from older leaves of <i>Atxdh1</i> caused senescence symptoms, a result of higher chloroplastic protein degradation in older leaves of low-nitrate-grown plants.</p>

The Patterned Structure of Galactoglucomannan Suggests It May Bind to Cellulose in Seed Mucilage
<p>The interaction between mannan polysaccharides and cellulose microfibrils contributes to cell wall properties in some vascular plants, but the molecular arrangement of mannan in the cell wall and the nature of the molecular bonding between mannan and cellulose remain unknown. Previous studies have shown that mannan is important in maintaining Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed mucilage architecture, and that Cellulose Synthase-Like A2 (CSLA2) synthesizes a glucomannan backbone, which Mannan α-Galactosyl Transferase1 (MAGT1/GlycosylTransferase-Like6/Mucilage Related10) might decorate with single α-Gal branches. Here, we investigated the ratio and sequence of Man and Glc and the arrangement of Gal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">residu</span></strong>es in Arabidopsis mucilage mannan using enzyme sequential digestion, carbohydrate gel electrophoresis, and mass spectrometry. We found that seed mucilage galactoglucomannan has a backbone consisting of the repeating disaccharide [4)-β-Glc-(1,4)-β-Man-(1,], and most of the Man <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">residu</span></strong>es in the backbone are substituted by single α-1,6-Gal. CSLA2 is responsible for the synthesis of this patterned glucomannan backbone and MAGT1 catalyses the addition of α-Gal. In vitro activity assays revealed that MAGT1 transferred α-Gal from UDP-Gal only to Man <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">residu</span></strong>es within the CSLA2 patterned glucomannan backbone acceptor. These results indicate that CSLAs and galactosyltransferases are able to make precisely defined galactoglucomannan structures. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested this patterned galactoglucomannan is able to bind stably to some hydrophilic faces and to hydrophobic faces of cellulose microfibrils. A specialization of the biosynthetic machinery to make galactoglucomannan with a patterned structure may therefore regulate the mode of binding of this hemicellulose to cellulose fibrils.</p>

Protein Carbonylation and Glycation in Legume Nodules
<p>Nitrogen fixation is an agronomically and environmentally important process catalyzed by bacterial nitrogenase within legume root nodules. These unique symbiotic organs have high metabolic rates and produce large amounts of reactive oxygen species that may modify proteins irreversibly. Here, we examined two types of oxidative posttranslational modifications of nodule proteins: carbonylation, which occurs by direct oxidation of certain amino acids or by interaction with reactive aldehydes arising from cell membrane lipid peroxides; and glycation, which results from the reaction of lysine and arginine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">residu</span></strong>es with reducing sugars or their autooxidation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>s. We used a strategy based on the enrichment of carbonylated peptides by affinity chromatography followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify 369 oxidized proteins in bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) nodules. Of these, 238 corresponded to plant proteins and 131 to bacterial proteins. Lipid peroxidation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>s induced most carbonylation sites. This study also revealed that carbonylation has major effects on two key nodule proteins. Metal-catalyzed oxidation caused the inactivation of malate dehydrogenase and the aggregation of leghemoglobin. In addition, numerous glycated proteins were identified in vivo, including three key nodule proteins: sucrose synthase, glutamine synthetase, and glutamate synthase. Label-free quantification identified 10 plant proteins and 18 bacterial proteins as age-specifically glycated. Overall, our results suggest that the selective carbonylation or glycation of crucial proteins involved in nitrogen metabolism, transcriptional regulation, and signaling may constitute a mechanism to control cell metabolism and nodule senescence.</p>

Arabidopsis <i>VAC14</i> Is Critical for Pollen Development through Mediating Vacuolar Organization
<p>Pollen viability depends on dynamic vacuolar changes during pollen development involving increases and decreases of vacuolar volume through water and osmolite accumulation and vacuolar fission. Mutations in <i>FAB1A</i> to <i>FAB1D</i>, the genes encoding phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate [PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>]-converting kinases, are male gametophyte lethal in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) due to defective vacuolar fission after pollen mitosis I, suggesting a key role of the phospholipid in dynamic vacuolar organization. However, other genetic components that regulate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> and its involvement in pollen germination and tube growth are unknown. Here, we identified and characterized Arabidopsis VAC14, a homolog of the yeast and metazoan VAC14s that are crucial for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>. <i>VAC14</i> is constitutively expressed and highly present in developing pollen. Loss of function of <i>VAC14</i> was male gametophyte lethal due to defective pollen development. Ultrastructural studies showed that vacuolar fission after pollen mitosis I was compromised in <i>vac14</i> mutant microspores, which led to pollen abortion. We further showed that inhibiting the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> or exogenous application of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> mimicked or rescued the pollen developmental defect of the <i>vac14</i> mutant, respectively.

Our results provide insights into the function of VAC14 and, by inference, that of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> in plant cells.</p>

DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE and DIACYLGLYCEROL KINASE Modulate Triacylglycerol and Phosphatidic Acid Production in the Plant Response to Freezing Stress
<p>Plants accumulate the lipids phosphatidic acid (PA), diacylglycerol (DAG), and triacylglycerol (TAG) during cold stress, but how plants balance the levels of these lipids to mediate cold responses remains unknown. The enzymes ACYL-COENZYME A:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE (DGAT) and DIACYLGLYCEROL KINASE (DGK) catalyze the conversion of DAG to TAG and PA, respectively. Here, we show that DGAT1, DGK2, DGK3, and DGK5 contribute to the response to cold in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). With or without cold acclimation, the <i>dgat1</i> mutants exhibited higher sensitivity upon freezing exposure compared with the wild type. Under cold conditions, the <i>dgat1</i> mutants showed reduced expression of <i>C-REPEAT/DRE BINDING FACTOR2</i> and its regulons, which are essential for the acquisition of cold tolerance. Lipid profiling revealed that freezing significantly increased the levels of PA and DAG while decreasing TAG in the rosettes of <i>dgat1</i> mutant plants. During freezing stress, the accumulation of PA in <i>dgat1</i> plants stimulated NADPH oxidase activity and enhanced RbohD-dependent hydrogen peroxide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion compared with the wild type. Moreover, the cold-inducible transcripts of <i>DGK2</i>, <i>DGK3</i>, and <i>DGK5</i> were significantly more up-regulated in the <i>dgat1</i> mutants than in the wild type during cold stress. Consistent with this observation, <i>dgk2</i>, <i>dgk3</i>, and <i>dgk5</i> knockout mutants showed improved tolerance and attenuated PA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion in response to freezing temperatures. Our findings demonstrate that the conversion of DAG to TAG by <i>DGAT1</i> is critical for plant freezing tolerance, acting by balancing TAG and PA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion in Arabidopsis.</p>

Oxidation of Translation Factor EF-Tu Inhibits the Repair of Photosystem II<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The repair of photosystem II (PSII) is particularly sensitive to oxidative stress and the inhibition of repair is associated with oxidative damage to the translational elongation system in the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this inhibition are unknown. We previously demonstrated in vitro that EF-Tu, a translation factor that delivers aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosome, is inactivated by reactive oxygen species via oxidation of the Cys <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">residu</span></strong>e Cys-82. In this study, we examined the physiological role of the oxidation of EF-Tu in <i>Synechocystis</i>. Under strong light, EF-Tu was rapidly oxidized to yield oxidized monomers in vivo. We generated a <i>Synechocystis</i> transformant that expressed mutated EF-Tu in which Cys-82 had been replaced with a Ser <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">residu</span></strong>e. Under strong light, the de novo synthesis of proteins that are required for PSII repair, such as D1, was enhanced in the transformant and photoinhibition of PSII was alleviated. However, photodamage to PSII, measured in the presence of lincomycin, was similar between the transformant and wild-type cells, suggesting that expression of mutated EF-Tu might enhance the repair of PSII. Alleviating photoinhibition through mutation of EF-Tu did not alter cell growth under strong light, perhaps due to the enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of reactive oxygen species. These observations suggest that the oxidation of EF-Tu under strong light inhibits PSII repair, resulting in the stimulation of photoinhibition.</p>

We combined pharmacological and genetic approaches to elucidate the involvement of H<sub>2</sub>S in stomatal closure and the interplay between H<sub>2</sub>S and other second messengers of the guard cell signaling network, such as hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and phospholipase D (PLD)-derived phosphatidic acid in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Both NADPH oxidase isoforms, respiratory burst oxidase homolog (RBOH)D and RBOHF, were required for H<sub>2</sub>S-induced stomatal closure. In vivo imaging using the cytosolic ratiometric fluorescent biosensor roGFP2-Orp1 revealed that H<sub>2</sub>S stimulates H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion in Arabidopsis guard cells.

A Connection between Lysine and Serotonin Metabolism in Rice Endosperm
<p>Cereal endosperms produce a vast array of metabolites, including the essential amino acid lysine (Lys). Enhanced accumulation of Lys has been achieved via metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering in cereals, but the potential connection between metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering and Lys fortification is unclear. In mature seeds of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eered High Free Lysine (HFL) rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), the endosperm takes on a characteristic dark-brown appearance. In this study, we use an integrated metabolomic and transcriptomic approach combined with functional validation to elucidate the key metabolites responsible for the dark-brown phenotype. Importantly, we found that serotonin biosynthesis was elevated dramatically and closely linked with dark-brown endosperm color in HFL rice. A functional connection between serotonin and endosperm color was confirmed via overexpression of TDC3, a key enzyme of serotonin biosynthesis. Furthermore, we show that both the jasmonate signaling pathway and <i>TDC</i> expression were strongly induced in the late stage of endosperm development of HFL rice, coinciding with serotonin accumulation and dark-brown pigmentation. We propose a model for the metabolic connection between Lys and serotonin metabolism in which elevated 2-aminoadipate from Lys catabolism may play a key role in the connection between the jasmonate signaling pathway, serotonin accumulation, and the brown phenotype in rice endosperm. Our data provide a deeper understanding of amino acid metabolism in rice. In addition, the finding that both Lys and serotonin accumulate in HFL rice grains should promote efforts to create a nutritionally favorable crop.</p>

Revisiting the Algal “Chloroplast Lipid Droplet”: The Absence of an Entity That Is Unlikely to Exist

Several studies have reported detecting lipid droplets within the chloroplast of the microalga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, which accumulates considerable amounts of triacylglycerol and starch within the cell under nitrogen deprivation or high-light stress conditions. Starch undoubtedly accumulates within the chloroplast, but there have been debates on the localization of the lipid droplets, which are cytosolic organelles in other organisms. Although it is impossible to prove an absence, we tried to repeat experiments that previously indicated the presence of lipid droplets in chloroplasts. Here, we present microscopic results showing no evidence for the presence of lipid droplets within the chloroplast stroma, even though some lipid droplets existed in close association with the chloroplast or were largely engulfed by the chloroplasts. These lipid droplets are cytosolic structures, distinct from the plastoglobules present in the chloroplast stroma. These results not only contrast with the old ideas but also point out that what were previously thought to be chloroplast lipid droplets are likely to be embedded within chloroplast invaginations in association with the outer envelope of the chloroplast without intervention of the endoplasmic reticulum. These findings point to the intriguing possibility of a tight metabolic flow from the chloroplast to the lipid droplet through a close association rather than direct contact of both organelles.</p>

Suboptimal Acclimation of Photosynthesis to Light in Wheat Canopies<sup>[CC-BY]</sup>
<p>Photosynthetic acclimation (photoacclimation) is the process whereby leaves alter their morphology and/or biochemistry to optimize photosynthetic efficiency and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ivity according to long-term changes in the light environment. The three-dimensional architecture of plant canopies imposes complex light dynamics, but the drivers for photoacclimation in such fluctuating environments are poorly understood. A technique for high-resolution three-dimensional reconstruction was combined with ray tracing to simulate a daily time course of radiation profiles for architecturally contrasting field-grown wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) canopies. An empirical model of photoacclimation was adapted to predict the optimal distribution of photosynthesis according to the fluctuating light patterns throughout the canopies. While the photoacclimation model output showed good correlation with field-measured gas-exchange data at the top of the canopy, it predicted a lower optimal light-saturated rate of photosynthesis at the base. Leaf Rubisco and protein contents were consistent with the measured optimal light-saturated rate of photosynthesis. We conclude that, although the photosynthetic capacity of leaves is high enough to exploit brief periods of high light within the canopy (particularly toward the base), the frequency and duration of such sunflecks are too small to make acclimation a viable strategy in terms of carbon gain. This suboptimal acclimation renders a large portion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">residu</span></strong>al photosynthetic capacity unused and reduces photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency at the canopy level, with further implications for photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ivity. It is argued that (1) this represents an untapped source of photosynthetic potential and (2) canopy nitrogen could be lowered with no detriment to carbon gain or grain protein content.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Coexpression Analysis Identifies Two Oxidoreductases Involved in the Biosynthesis of the Monoterpene Acid Moiety of Natural Pyrethrin Insecticides in <i>Tanacetum cinerariifolium</i>
<p>Flowers of <i>Tanacetum cinerariifolium</i> produce a set of compounds known collectively as pyrethrins, which are commercially important pesticides that are strongly toxic to flying insects but not to most vertebrates. A pyrethrin molecule is an ester consisting of either trans-chrysanthemic acid or its modified form, pyrethric acid, and one of three alcohols, jasmolone, pyrethrolone, and cinerolone, that appear to be derived from jasmonic acid. Chrysanthemyl diphosphate synthase (CDS), the first enzyme involved in the synthesis of trans-chrysanthemic acid, was characterized previously and its gene isolated. <i>TcCDS</i> produces free trans-chrysanthemol in addition to trans-chrysanthemyl diphosphate, but the enzymes responsible for the conversion of trans-chrysanthemol to the corresponding aldehyde and then to the acid have not been reported. We used an RNA sequencing-based approach and coexpression correlation analysis to identify several candidate genes encoding putative trans-chrysanthemol and trans-chrysanthemal dehydrogenases. We functionally characterized the proteins encoded by these genes using a combination of in vitro biochemical assays and heterologous expression in planta to demonstrate that <i>TcADH2</i> encodes an enzyme that oxidizes trans-chrysanthemol to trans-chrysanthemal, while <i>TcALDH1</i> encodes an enzyme that oxidizes trans-chrysanthemal into trans-chrysanthemic acid. Transient coexpression of <i>TcADH2</i> and <i>TcALDH1</i> together with <i>TcCDS</i> in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaves results in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>ion of trans-chrysanthemic acid as well as several other side <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">product</span></strong>s. The majority (58%) of trans-chrysanthemic acid was glycosylated or otherwise modified. Overall, these data identify key steps in the biosynthesis of pyrethrins and demonstrate the feasibility of metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering to produce components of these defense compounds in a heterologous host.</p>

Mode of action of a <i>Drosophila</i> FMRFamide in inducing muscle contraction
<p><i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> is a model system for examining the mechanisms of action of neuropeptides. DPKQDFMRFamide was previously shown to induce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ions in <i>Drosophila</i> body wall muscle fibres in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner. The present study examined the possible involvement of a G-protein-coupled receptor and second messengers in mediating this myotropic effect after removal of the central nervous system. DPKQDFMRFamide-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ions were reduced by 70% and 90%, respectively, in larvae with reduced expression of the <i>Drosophila Fmrf</i> receptor (FR) either ubiquitously or specifically in muscle tissue, compared with the response in control larvae in which expression was not manipulated. No such effect occurred in larvae with reduced expression of this gene only in neurons. The myogenic effects of DPKQDFMRFamide do not appear to be mediated through either of the two <i>Drosophila</i> myosuppressin receptors (<i>DmsR-1</i> and <i>DmsR-2</i>). DPKQDFMRFamide-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ions were not reduced in Ala1 transgenic flies lacking activity of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CamKII), and were not affected by the CaMKII inhibitor KN-93. Peptide-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ions in the mutants of the phospholipase C-β (<i>PLC</i>β) gene (<i>norpA</i> larvae) and in IP<sub>3</sub> receptor mutants were similar to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ions elicited in control larvae. The peptide failed to increase cAMP and cGMP levels in <i>Drosophila</i> body wall muscles. Peptide-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ions were not potentiated by 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, and were not antagonized by inhibitors of cAMP-dependent or cGMP-dependent protein kinases. Additionally, exogenous application of arachidonic acid failed to induce myogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ions. Thus, DPKQDFMRFamide induces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ions via a G-protein coupled FMRFamide receptor in muscle cells but does not appear to act via cAMP, cGMP, IP<sub>3</sub>, PLC, CaMKII or arachidonic acid.</p>

Endogenous retinoid X receptor ligands in mouse hematopoietic cells
<p>The retinoid X receptor α (RXRA) has been implicated in diverse hematological processes. To identify natural ligands of RXRA that are present in hematopoietic cells, we adapted an upstream activation sequence–green fluorescent protein (UAS-GFP) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>er mouse to detect natural RXRA ligands in vivo. We observed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>er activity in diverse types of hematopoietic cells in vivo. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>er activity increased during granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)–induced granulopoiesis and after phenylhydrazine (PHZ)–induced anemia, suggesting the presence of dynamically regulated natural RXRA ligands in hematopoietic cells. Mouse plasma activated Gal4-UAS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>er cells in vitro, and plasma from mice treated with G-CSF or PHZ recapitulated the patterns of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>er activation that we observed in vivo. Plasma from mice with dietary vitamin A deficiency only mildly reduced RXRA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>er activity, whereas plasma from mice on a fatty acid restriction diet reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>er activity, implicating fatty acids as plasma RXRA ligands. Through differential extraction coupled with mass spectrometry, we identified the long-chain fatty acid C24:5 as a natural RXRA ligand that was greatly increased in abundance in response to hematopoietic stress. Together, these data suggest that natural RXRA ligands are present and dynamically increased in abundance in mouse hematopoietic cells in vivo.</p>

Quality of Care at Hospitals Identified as Outliers in Publicly Reported Mortality Statistics for Percutaneous Coronary Intervention
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Public <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ing of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) outcomes may create disincentives for physicians to provide care for critically ill patients, particularly at institutions with worse clinical outcomes. We thus sought to evaluate the procedural management and in-hospital outcomes of patients treated for acute myocardial infarction before and after a hospital had been publicly identified as a negative outlier.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using state <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>s, we identified hospitals that were recognized as negative PCI outliers in 2 states (Massachusetts and New York) from 2002 to 2012. State hospitalization files were used to identify all patients with an acute myocardial infarction within these states. Procedural management and in-hospital outcomes were compared among patients treated at outlier hospitals before and after public <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong> of outlier status. Patients at nonoutlier institutions were used to control for temporal trends.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 86 hospitals, 31 were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed as outliers for excess mortality. Outlier facilities were larger, treating more patients with acute myocardial infarction and performing more PCIs than nonoutlier hospitals (<i>P</i><0.05 for each). Among 507 672 patients with acute myocardial infarction hospitalized at these institutions, 108 428 (21%) were treated at an outlier hospital after public <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>. The likelihood of PCI at outlier (relative risk [RR], 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12–1.15) and nonoutlier institutions (RR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.11–1.14) increased in a similar fashion (interaction <i>P</i>=0.50) after public <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong> of outlier status. The likelihood of in-hospital mortality decreased at outlier institutions (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.81–0.85) after public <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>, and to a lesser degree at nonoutlier institutions (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.87–0.92; interaction <i>P</i><0.001). Among patients that underwent PCI, in-hospital mortality decreased at outlier institutions after public recognition of outlier status in comparison with prior (RR, 0.72; 9% CI, 0.66–0.79), a decline that exceeded the reduction at nonoutlier institutions (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.80–0.96; interaction <i>P</i><0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Large hospitals with higher clinical volume are more likely to be designated as negative outliers. The rates of percutaneous revascularization increased similarly at outlier and nonoutlier institutions after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong> of outlier status. After outlier designation, in-hospital mortality declined at outlier institutions to a greater extent than was observed at nonoutlier facilities.</p></sec>

Wide Variation in Reported Rates of Stroke Across Cohorts of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Oral anticoagulants decrease ischemic stroke rates in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) but increase the risk of bleeding. For the average patient with AF, the threshold of annual ischemic stroke rate where the benefit of anticoagulation outweighs the bleeding risk (net clinical benefit) has been shown to be ≈1% to 2%. Guideline recommendations for oral anticoagulants in AF are based on the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc stroke risk point scores, assuming that those scores translate to fixed stroke rates. However, the relationship between stroke point scores and annual stroke rates may vary substantially across populations. We sought to comprehensively assess the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed rates of stroke in patients with AF and the relationship of stroke rates to stroke risk point scores.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A systematic review of cohort studies and randomized controlled trials enrolled patients with nonvalvular AF not treated with oral anticoagulants.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of the 3552 studies screened, we identified 34 studies eligible for analysis. Overall stroke rates in cohort studies were highly heterogeneous (Q=5706.54, <i>P</i><0.001; I<sup>2</sup> = 99.6%) and ranged from 0.45% to 9.28% per year, despite being of similar objective study quality. The mean North American stroke rate was less than one-third that of the mean European stroke rate (<i>P</i><0.0001). However, a random effects regression indicated that between-study variability was not significantly accounted for by cohort region, prospective versus retrospective design, calendar year of study, or outcome event cluster. At a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score of 1, 76% of cohorts <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed ischemic stroke rates <1% per year and only 18% of cohorts <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed a stroke rate >2% per year. At a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score of 2, 27% of cohorts <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed stroke rates below 1% per year, 40% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed stroke rates between 1 and 2% per year, and 33% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed stroke rates >2% per year.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Substantial variation exists across cohorts in overall stroke rates and rates corresponding to CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc point scores. These variations can affect the point score threshold for recommending oral anticoagulants in AF. The majority of cohorts did not observe stroke rates that would indicate a clear expected net clinical benefit for anticoagulating AF patients with CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc scores of 1 or 2.</p></sec>

Zika rewrites maternal immunization ethics
<p>Pregnant women long have been excluded from vaccine studies because researchers are wary of causing unintended harm to the highly vulnerable developing fetus. But a new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong> from a group that represents many disciplines contends that ethics demand pregnant women be included in the trial of experimental Zika vaccines, which are designed to protect babies from brain damage and other maladies caused by that mosquito-borne virus. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong> is careful to point out that risk/benefit ratios must be weighed for each vaccine and each trial on a case-by-case basis—and indeed the Zika vaccine that has moved furthest in human studies rightly excludes pregnant women, says a co-author of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>. Other experimental maternal immunizations designed to protect babies are also being tested now, and one trial, for a respiratory syncytial virus vaccine, includes pregnant women. A vaccine against group B streptococcus has also moved along the development pipeline and may soon enter trials with pregnant women, too. A second new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong> on maternal immunizations issued last week explores the challenges of doing safety studies in these women and their babies.</p>

Aperture effects in squid jet propulsion
<p>Squid are the largest jet propellers in nature as adults, but as paralarvae they are some of the smallest, faced with the inherent inefficiency of jet propulsion at a low Reynolds number. In this study we describe the behavior and kinematics of locomotion in 1 mm paralarvae of <i>Dosidicus gigas</i>, the smallest squid yet studied. They swim with hop-and-sink behavior and can engage in fast jets by reducing the size of the mantle aperture during the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ion phase of a jetting cycle. We go on to explore the general effects of a variable mantle and funnel aperture in a theoretical model of jet propulsion scaled from the smallest (1 mm mantle length) to the largest (3 m) squid. Aperture reduction during mantle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ion increases propulsive efficiency at all squid sizes, although 1 mm squid still suffer from low efficiency (20%) because of a limited speed of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ion. Efficiency increases to a peak of 40% for 1 cm squid, then slowly declines. Squid larger than 6 cm must either reduce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ion speed or increase aperture size to maintain stress within maximal muscle tolerance. Ecological pressure to maintain maximum velocity may lead them to increase aperture size, which reduces efficiency. This effect might be ameliorated by nonaxial flow during the refill phase of the cycle. Our model's predictions highlight areas for future empirical work, and emphasize the existence of complex behavioral options for maximizing efficiency at both very small and large sizes.</p>

Impact of Combat Deployment and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder on Newly Reported Coronary Heart Disease Among US Active Duty and Reserve Forces
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>The recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have exposed thousands of service members to intense stress, and as a result, many have developed posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The role of military deployment experiences and PTSD in coronary heart disease (CHD) is not well defined, especially in young US service members with recent combat exposure.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We conducted a prospective cohort study to investigate the relationships between wartime experiences, PTSD, and CHD. Current and former US military personnel from all service branches participating in the Millennium Cohort Study during 2001 to 2008 (n=60 025) were evaluated for newly self-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed CHD. Electronic medical record review for <i>International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification</i> codes for CHD was conducted among a subpopulation of active duty members (n=23 794).

The apo-structure of the leucine sensor Sestrin2 is still elusive
<p>Sestrin2 is a GATOR2-interacting protein that directly binds leucine and is required for the inhibition of mTORC1 under leucine deprivation, indicating that it is a leucine sensor for the mTORC1 pathway. We recently <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed the structure of Sestrin2 in complex with leucine [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID, 5DJ4] and demonstrated that mutations in the leucine-binding pocket that alter the affinity of Sestrin2 for leucine result in a corresponding change in the leucine sensitivity of mTORC1 in cells. A lower resolution structure of human Sestrin2 (PDB ID, 5CUF), which was crystallized in the absence of exogenous leucine, showed Sestrin2 to be in a nearly identical conformation as the leucine-bound structure. On the basis of this observation, it has been argued that leucine binding does not affect the conformation of Sestrin2 and that Sestrin2 may not be a sensor for leucine. We show that simple analysis of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed “apo”-Sestrin2 structure reveals the clear presence of prominent, unmodeled electron density in the leucine-binding pocket that exactly accommodates the leucine observed in the higher resolution structure. Refining the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed apo-structure with leucine eliminated the large <i>F</i><sub>obs</sub>-<i>F</i><sub>calc</sub> difference density at this position and improved the working and free R factors of the model. Consistent with this result, our own structure of Sestrin2 crystallized in the absence of exogenous leucine also contained electron density that is best explained by leucine. Thus, the structure of apo-Sestrin2 remains elusive.</p>

Unusual transcription factor protects against heart failure
<p>The heart pumps blood to the rest of the body in a coordinated and steadfast manner. This pumping function is achieved through synchronous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ion of billions of cardiomyocytes (heart muscle cells), which is governed by phasic increases in intracellular calcium. As such, cardiomyocytes have evolved intricate cellular structures that tightly couple external electrical impulses to the triggering of calcium ion release from intracellular stores and subsequent activation of force-producing proteins, a process termed excitation-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ion (E-C) coupling. A key component of this molecular ultrastructure is the cardiac dyad, a microdomain that juxtaposes the plasma membrane L-type calcium channel with the calcium-sensitive ryanodine receptor (RyR) channel complex, the molecular gatekeeper for the release of calcium ions from sarcoplasmic reticulum stores in cardiomyocytes. The cardiac dyad is physically stabilized by a membrane-associated scaffold protein called junctophilin-2 (JP2), which facilitates physiologic calcium release during E-C coupling. Excessive stress or injury to cardiomyocytes results in defective E-C coupling, reduced pumping capacity, and the clinical syndrome of heart failure, a leading cause of death worldwide. On page 1375 of this issue, Guo <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong> the surprising discovery that during cardiac stress, a proteolytically cleaved fragment of JP2 can translocate to the cardiomyocyte nucleus and function as a transcription factor that can protect against heart failure pathogenesis. Thus, in addition to its “day job” as a structural protein, this suggest that JP2 can “moonlight” in the nucleus as part of a homeostatic feedback response to cardiac stress.</p>

The threshold for conscious report: Signal loss and response bias in visual and frontal cortex

We investigated the fate of weak visual stimuli in the visual and frontal cortex of awake monkeys trained to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong> stimulus presence. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed stimuli were associated with strong sustained activity in the frontal cortex, and frontal activity was weaker and quickly decayed for un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed stimuli. Information about weak stimuli could be lost at successive stages en route from the visual to the frontal cortex, and these propagation failures were confirmed through microstimulation of area V1. Fluctuations in response bias and sensitivity during perception of identical stimuli were traced back to prestimulus brain-state markers. A model in which stimuli become consciously <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>able when they elicit a nonlinear ignition process in higher cortical areas explained our results.</p>

Anatomy of STEM teaching in North American universities
<p>A large body of evidence demonstrates that strategies that promote student interactions and cognitively engage students with content (<i>1</i>) lead to gains in learning and attitudinal outcomes for students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). Many educational and governmental bodies have called for and supported adoption of these student-centered strategies throughout the undergraduate STEM curriculum. But to the extent that we have pictures of the STEM undergraduate instructional landscape, it has mostly been provided through self-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong> surveys of faculty members, within a particular STEM discipline [e.g., (<i>3</i>–<i>6</i>)].

Reflecting the limited state of these data, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong> from the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine called for improved data collection to understand the use of evidence-based instructional practices (<i>8</i>).

Disruption of <i>AtCstF77</i> reduced auxin sensitivity and decreased the expression of the auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>er <i>DR5</i>-<i>GFP</i>. Null mutations of <i>cstf77</i> caused severe developmental defects, but were not lethal as previously <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed. <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> genetically interacted with <i>transport inhibitor response 1 auxin signaling f</i>-<i>box 2</i> auxin receptor double mutants, further supporting that polyadenylation affects auxin signaling. <i>AtCstF77</i> was ubiquitously expressed in embryos, seedlings, and adult plants. The AtCstF77 protein was localized in the nucleus, which is consistent with its function in pre-mRNA processing. We observed that PASs in transcripts from approximately 2,400 genes were shifted in the <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> mutant. Moreover, most of the PAS shifts were from proximal to distal sites. Auxin treatment also caused PAS shifts in transcripts from a small number of genes. Several auxin signaling or homeostasis genes had different PASs in their transcripts in the <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> mutant. The expression levels of <i>AUXIN RESISTANT 2</i>/<i>INDOLE</i>-<i>3</i>-<i>ACETIC ACID 7</i> were significantly increased in the <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> mutant, which can partially account for the auxin resistance phenotype of this mutant. Our results demonstrate that AtCstF77 plays pleiotropic and critical roles in Arabidopsis development. Moreover, disruption of AtCstF64, another component of the polyadenylation machinery, led to developmental defects and reduced auxin response, similar to those of the <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> mutant. We conclude that AtCstF77 affects auxin responses, likely by controlling PAS selection of transcripts of some auxin signaling components.</p>

The <i>6xABRE</i> Synthetic Promoter Enables the Spatiotemporal Analysis of ABA-Mediated Transcriptional Regulation
<p>The water stress-associated hormone abscisic acid (ABA) acts through a well-defined signal transduction cascade to mediate downstream transcriptional events important for acclimation to stress. Although ABA signaling is known to function in specific tissues to regulate root growth, little is understood regarding the spatial pattern of ABA-mediated transcriptional regulation. Here, we describe the construction and evaluation of an ABSCISIC ACID RESPONSIVE ELEMENT (ABRE)-based synthetic promoter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>er that reveals the transcriptional response of tissues to different levels of exogenous ABA and stresses. Genome-scale yeast one-hybrid screens complemented these approaches and revealed how promoter sequence and architecture affect the recruitment of diverse transcription factors (TFs) to the ABRE. Our analysis also revealed ABA-independent activity of the ABRE-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>er under nonstress conditions, with expression being enriched at the quiescent center and stem cell niche. We show that the WUSCHEL RELATED HOMEOBOX5 and NAC DOMAIN PROTEIN13 TFs regulate QC/SCN expression of the ABRE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>er, which highlights the convergence of developmental and DNA-damage signaling pathways onto this cis-element in the absence of water stress. This work establishes a tool to study the spatial pattern of ABA-mediated transcriptional regulation and a repertoire of TF-ABRE interactions that contribute to the developmental and environmental control of gene expression in roots.</p>

Gene Duplication and Aneuploidy Trigger Rapid Evolution of Herbicide Resistance in Common Waterhemp<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>An increase in gene copy number is often associated with changes in the number and structure of chromosomes, as has been widely observed in yeast and eukaryotic tumors, yet little is known about stress-induced chromosomal changes in plants. Previously, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed that the <i>EPSPS</i> (5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase) gene, the molecular target of glyphosate, was amplified at the native locus and on an extra chromosome in glyphosate-resistant <i>Amaranthus tuberculatus</i>. Here, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong> that the extra chromosome is a ring chromosome termed extra circular chromosome carrying amplified <i>EPSPS</i> (ECCAE). The ECCAE is heterochromatic, harbors four major <i>EPSPS</i> amplified foci, and is sexually transmitted to 35% of the progeny. Two highly glyphosate resistant (HGR) <i>A. tuberculatus</i> plants with a chromosome constitution of 2n = 32+1 ECCAE displayed soma cell heterogeneity. Some cells had secondary ECCAEs, which displayed size polymorphisms and produced novel chromosomal variants with multiple gene amplification foci. We hypothesize that the ECCAE in the soma cells of HGR <i>A. tuberculatus</i> plants underwent breakage-fusion-bridge cycles to generate the observed soma cell heterogeneity, including de novo <i>EPSPS</i> gene integration into chromosomes. Resistant soma cells with stable <i>EPSPS</i> amplification events as de novo insertions into chromosomes may survive glyphosate selection pressure during the sporophytic phase and are plausibly transmitted to germ cells leading to durable glyphosate resistance in <i>A. tuberculatus</i>. This is the first <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong> of early events in aneuploidy-triggered de novo chromosome integration by an as yet unknown mechanism, which may drive rapid adaptive evolution of herbicide resistance in common waterhemp.</p>

NTL8 Regulates Trichome Formation in Arabidopsis by Directly Activating R3 MYB Genes <i>TRY</i> and <i>TCL1</i>
<p>The NAM, ATAF1/2, and CUC (NAC) are plant-specific transcription factors that regulate multiple aspects of plant growth and development and plant response to environmental stimuli. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong> here the identification of NTM1-LIKE8 (NTL8), a membrane-associated NAC transcription factor, as a novel regulator of trichome formation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). From an activation-tagged Arabidopsis population, we identified a dominant, gain-of-function mutant with glabrous inflorescence stem. By using plasmid rescue and RT-PCR analyses, we found that <i>NTL8</i> was tagged; thus, the mutant was named <i>ntl8-1 Dominant</i> (<i>ntl8-1D</i>). Recapitulation experiment further confirmed that the phenotype observed in the <i>ntl8-1D</i> mutant was caused by elevated expression of <i>NTL8</i>. Quantitative RT-PCR results showed that the expression level of the single-repeat R3 MYB genes <i>TRIPTYCHON</i> (<i>TRY</i>) and <i>TRICHOMELESS1</i> (<i>TCL1</i>) was elevated in the <i>ntl8-1D</i> mutant. Genetic analyses demonstrated that NTL8 acts upstream of TRY and TCL1 in the regulation of trichome formation. When recruited to the promoter region of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>er gene <i>Gal4:GUS</i> by a fused GAL4 DNA-binding domain, NTL8 activated the expression of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>er gene. Chromatin immunoprecipitation results indicated that <i>TRY</i> and <i>TCL1</i> are direct targets of NTL8. However, NTL8 did not interact with SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN LIKE9, another transcription factor that regulates the expression of <i>TRY</i> and <i>TCL1</i>, in yeast and plant cells. Taken together, our results suggest that NTL8 negatively regulates trichome formation in Arabidopsis by directly activating the expression of <i>TRY</i> and <i>TCL1</i>.</p>

Stearoyl-Acyl Carrier Protein Desaturase Mutations Uncover an Impact of Stearic Acid in Leaf and Nodule Structure
<p>Stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturase (SACPD-C) has been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed to control the accumulation of seed stearic acid; however, no study has previously <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed its involvement in leaf stearic acid content and impact on leaf structure and morphology. A subset of an ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenized population of soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) ‘Forrest’ was screened to identify mutants within the <i>GmSACPD-C</i> gene. Using a forward genetics approach, one nonsense and four missense <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutants were identified to have high levels of seed, nodule, and leaf stearic acid content. Homology modeling and in silico analysis of the GmSACPD-C enzyme revealed that most of these mutations were localized near or at conserved residues essential for diiron ion coordination. Soybeans carrying <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutations at conserved residues showed the highest stearic acid content, and these mutations were found to have deleterious effects on nodule development and function. Interestingly, mutations at nonconserved residues show an increase in stearic acid content yet retain healthy nodules. Thus, random mutagenesis and mutational analysis allows for the achievement of high seed stearic acid content with no associated negative agronomic characteristics. Additionally, expression analysis demonstrates that nodule leghemoglobin transcripts were significantly more abundant in soybeans with deleterious mutations at conserved residues of GmSACPD-C. Finally, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong> that <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutations cause an increase in leaf stearic acid content and an alteration of leaf structure and morphology in addition to differences in nitrogen-fixing nodule structure.</p>

The Plastid Genome of <i>Polytoma uvella</i> Is the Largest Known among Colorless Algae and Plants and Reflects Contrasting Evolutionary Paths to Nonphotosynthetic Lifestyles
<p>The loss of photosynthesis is frequently associated with parasitic or pathogenic lifestyles, but it also can occur in free-living, plastid-bearing lineages. A common consequence of becoming nonphotosynthetic is the reduction in size and gene content of the plastid genome. In exceptional circumstances, it can even result in the complete loss of the plastid DNA (ptDNA) and its associated gene expression system, as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed recently in several lineages, including the nonphotosynthetic green algal genus <i>Polytomella</i>. Closely related to <i>Polytomella</i> is the polyphyletic genus <i>Polytoma</i>, the members of which lost photosynthesis independently of <i>Polytomella</i>. Species from both genera are free-living organisms that contain nonphotosynthetic plastids, but unlike <i>Polytomella</i>, <i>Polytoma</i> members have retained a genome in their colorless plastid. Here, we present the plastid genome of <i>Polytoma uvella</i>: to our knowledge, the first <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong> of ptDNA from a nonphotosynthetic chlamydomonadalean alga. The <i>P. uvella</i> ptDNA contains 25 protein-coding genes, most of which are related to gene expression and none are connected to photosynthesis. However, despite its reduced coding capacity, the <i>P. uvella</i> ptDNA is inflated with short repeats and is tens of kilobases larger than the ptDNAs of its closest known photosynthetic relatives, <i>Chlamydomonas leiostraca</i> and <i>Chlamydomonas applanata</i>. In fact, at approximately 230 kb, the ptDNA of <i>P. uvella</i> represents the largest plastid genome currently <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed from a nonphotosynthetic alga or plant. Overall, the <i>P. uvella</i> and <i>Polytomella</i> plastid genomes reveal two very different evolutionary paths following the loss of photosynthesis: expansion and complete deletion, respectively. We hypothesize that recombination-based DNA-repair mechanisms are at least partially responsible for the different evolutionary outcomes observed in such closely related nonphotosynthetic algae.</p>

The Genomes of Two Bat Species with Long Constant Frequency Echolocation Calls
<p>Bats can perceive the world by using a wide range of sensory systems, and some of the systems have become highly specialized, such as auditory sensory perception. Among bat species, the Old World leaf-nosed bats and horseshoe bats (rhinolophoid bats) possess the most sophisticated echolocation systems. Here, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed the whole-genome sequencing and <i>de novo</i> assembles of two rhinolophoid bats—the great leaf-nosed bat (<i>Hipposideros armiger</i>) and the Chinese rufous horseshoe bat (<i>Rhinolophus sinicus</i>). Comparative genomic analyses revealed the adaptation of auditory sensory perception in the rhinolophoid bat lineages, probably resulting from the extreme selectivity used in the auditory processing by these bats. Pseudogenization of some vision-related genes in rhinolophoid bats was observed, suggesting that these genes have undergone relaxed natural selection. An extensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ion of olfactory receptor gene repertoires was observed in the lineage leading to the common ancestor of bats. Further extensive gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ions can be observed in the branch leading to the rhinolophoid bats. Such concordance suggested that molecular changes at one sensory gene might have direct consequences for genes controlling for other sensory modalities. To characterize the population genetic structure and patterns of evolution, we re-sequenced the genome of 20 great leaf-nosed bats from four different geographical locations of China. The result showed similar sequence diversity values and little differentiation among populations. Moreover, evidence of genetic adaptations to high altitudes in the great leaf-nosed bats was observed. Taken together, our work provided a useful resource for future research on the evolution of bats.</p>

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) may reprogram cells by altering the gene expression pattern.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Multidimensional genomic profiling was performed in human aortic valves to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong> the expression of lncRNAs and the DNA methylation pattern in calcific aortic valve disease. In-depth functional assays were carried out to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong> the impact of lncRNA on the mineralization of the aortic valve.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong>ed that lncRNA <i>H19 (H19</i>) was increased in calcific aortic valve disease. Hypomethylation of the promoter region was observed in mineralized aortic valves and was inversely associated with <i>H19</i> expression. Knockdown and overexpression experiments showed that <i>H19</i> induces a strong osteogenic phenotype by altering the NOTCH1 pathway. Gene promoter analyses showed that <i>H19</i> silenced <i>NOTCH1</i> by preventing the recruitment of p53 to its promoter. A knockdown of <i>H19</i> in valve interstitial cells (VICs) increased the expression of <i>NOTCH1</i> and decreased the level of <i>RUNX2</i> and <i>BMP2</i>, 2 downstream targets repressed by <i>NOTCH1</i>. In rescue experiments, the transfection of a vector encoding for the active Notch intracellular domain prevented <i>H19</i>-induced mineralization of valve interstitial cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These findings indicate that a dysregulation of DNA methylation in the promoter of <i>H19</i> during calcific aortic valve disease is associated with a higher expression of this lncRNA, which promotes an osteogenic program by interfering with the expression of <i>NOTCH1.</i></p></sec>

Cardiovascular Health Promotion in Children: Challenges and Opportunities for 2020 and Beyond: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association
<p>This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong> provides a pediatric-focused companion to “Defining and Setting National Goals for Cardiovascular Health Promotion and Disease Reduction: The American Heart Association’s Strategic Impact Goal Through 2020 and Beyond,” focused on cardiovascular health promotion and disease reduction in adults and children. The principles detailed in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong> reflect the American Heart Association’s new dynamic and proactive goal to promote cardiovascular health throughout the life course. The primary focus is on adult cardiovascular health and disease prevention, but critical to achievement of this goal is maintenance of ideal cardiovascular health from birth through childhood to young adulthood and beyond. Emphasis is placed on the fundamental principles and metrics that define cardiovascular health in children for the clinical or research setting, and a balanced and critical appraisal of the strengths and weaknesses of the cardiovascular health construct in children and adolescents is provided. Specifically, this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong> discusses 2 important factors: the promotion of ideal cardiovascular health in all children and the improvement of cardiovascular health metric scores in children currently classified as having poor or intermediate cardiovascular health. Other topics include the current status of cardiovascular health in US children, opportunities for the refinement of health metrics, improvement of health metric scores, and possibilities for promoting ideal cardiovascular health. Importantly, concerns about the suitability of using single thresholds to identify elevated cardiovascular risk throughout the childhood years and the limits of our current knowledge are noted, and suggestions for future directions and research are provided.</p>

Clinical Usefulness, Angiographic Characteristics, and Safety Evaluation of Intracoronary Acetylcholine Provocation Testing Among 921 Consecutive White Patients With Unobstructed Coronary Arteries
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Coronary spasm can cause myocardial ischemia and angina in patients with and those without obstructive coronary artery disease. However, provocation tests using intracoronary acetylcholine administration are rarely performed in clinical routine in the United States and Europe. Thus, we assessed the clinical usefulness, angiographic characteristics, and safety of intracoronary acetylcholine provocation testing in white patients with unobstructed coronary arteries.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>From September 2007 to June 2010, a total of 921 consecutive patients (362 men, mean age 62±12years) who underwent diagnostic angiography for suspected myocardial ischemia and were found to have unobstructed coronary arteries (no stenosis ≥50%) were enrolled. The intracoronary acetylcholine provocation testing was performed directly after angiography according to a standardized protocol. Three hundred forty-six patients (35%) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed chest pain at rest, 222 (22%) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed chest pain on exertion, 238 (24%) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed a combination of effort and resting chest pain, and 41 (4%) presented with troponin-positive acute coronary syndrome. The overall frequency of epicardial spasm (>75% diameter reduction with angina and ischemic ECG shifts) was 33.4%, and the overall frequency of microvascular spasm (angina and ischemic ECG shifts without epicardial spasm) was 24.2%. Epicardial spasm was most often diffuse and located in the distal coronary segments (<i>P</i><0.01). No fatal or irreversible nonfatal complications occurred. However, 9 patients (1%) had minor complications (nonsustained ventricular tachycardia [n=1], fast paroxysmal atrial fibrillation [n=1], symptomatic bradycardia [n=6], and catheter-induced spasm [n=1]).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Epicardial and microvascular spasm are frequently found in white patients with unobstructed coronary arteries.

Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in skeletally immature patients
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Different methods of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction   have been described for skeletally immature patients before closure   of the growth plates. However, the outcome and complications following   this treatment remain unclear. The aim of this systematic review   was to analyse the outcome and complications of different techniques   which may be used for reconstruction of the ACL in these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We performed a systematic review of the literature according   to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses   guidelines. This involved a comprehensive search of PubMed, Medline,   CINAHL, Cochrane, Embase and Google Scholar databases using the   following combinations of keywords, “knee”, “anterior cruciate ligament”,   “reconstruction”, “injury”, “children”, “adolescent”, “skeletally   immature”, “open physis” and “surgery”.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 53 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included   for analysis. The overall rate of disturbance of growth after ACL   reconstruction was 2.6%, with no statistical difference between   transphyseal and physeal-sparing techniques. Physeal-sparing techniques   had a lower rate of post-operative complications compared with transphyseal techniques   (p = 0.0045). Outcomes assessed were Lysholm score, International   Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, the IKDC grade, the Tegner   score and the KT-1000. Both techniques had similar clinical outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This review reveals low rates of disturbance of growth after   ACL reconstruction in skeletally immature patients. Although limited,   the available evidence did not support any particular surgical technique   when considering disturbance of growth or clinical outcome.

Ceramic-on-ceramic bearing fractures in total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Ceramic-on-ceramic (CoC) bearings in total hip arthroplasty (THA)   are commonly used, but concerns exist regarding ceramic fracture.   This study aims to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong> the risk of revision for fracture of modern   CoC bearings and identify factors that might influence this risk,   using data from the National Joint Registry (NJR) for England, Wales, Northern   Ireland and the Isle of Man.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We analysed data on 223 362 bearings from 111 681 primary CoC   THAs and 182 linked revisions for bearing fracture recorded in the   NJR. We used implant codes to identify ceramic bearing composition   and generated Kaplan-Meier estimates for implant survivorship. Logistic   regression analyses were performed for implant size and patient specific   variables to determine any associated risks for revision.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 222 852 bearings (99.8%) were CeramTec Biolox products.   Revisions for fracture were linked to seven of 79 442 (0.009%) Biolox   Delta heads, 38 of 31 982 (0.119%) Biolox Forte heads, 101 of 80   170 (0.126%) Biolox Delta liners and 35 of 31 258 (0.112%) Biolox   Forte liners. Regression analysis of implant size revealed smaller   heads had significantly higher odds of fracture (chi-squared 68.0,   p < 0.001). The highest fracture risk was observed in the 28 mm   Biolox Forte subgroup (0.382%). There were no fractures in the 40   mm head group for either ceramic type. Liner thickness was not predictive   of fracture (p = 0.67). Body mass index (BMI) was independently   associated with revision for both head fractures (odds ratio (OR)   1.09 per unit increase, p = 0.031) and liner fractures (OR 1.06   per unit increase, p = 0.006). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong> the largest independent study of CoC bearing fractures   to date. The risk of revision for CoC bearing fracture is very low   but previous studies have underestimated this risk. There is good   evidence that the latest generation of ceramic has greatly reduced   the odds of head fracture but not of liner fracture. Small head   size and high patient BMI are associated with an increased risk   of ceramic bearing fracture.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1012–19.</p></sec>

Quality of life after resection of a chordoma of the mobile spine
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of the study was to compare measures of the quality of   life (QOL) after resection of a chordoma of the mobile spine with   the national averages in the United States and to assess which factors   influenced the QOL, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and coping   with pain post-operatively in these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 48 consecutive patients who underwent resection of   a primary or recurrent chordoma of the mobile spine between 2000   and 2015 were included. A total of 34 patients completed a survey   at least 12 months post-operatively. The primary outcome was the   EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D-3L) questionnaire. Secondary outcomes were   the Patient-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS)   anxiety, depression and pain interference questionnaires. Data which   were recorded included the indication for surgery, the region of   the tumour, the number of levels resected, the status of the surgical   margins, re-operations, complications, neurological deficit, length   of stay in hospital and rate of re-admission.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The median EQ-5D-3L score was 0.71 (interquartile range (IQR)   0.44 to 0.79) which is worse than the national average in the United   States of 0.85 (p < 0.001). Anxiety (median: 55 (IQR 49 to 61),   p = 0.031) and pain (median: 61 (IQR 56 to 68), p < 0.001) were   also worse than the national average in the United States (50),   while depression was not (median: 52 (IQR 38 to 57), p = 0.513).

The use of femoral stems with exchangeable necks in primary total hip arthroplasty increases the rate of revision
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Femoral stems with exchangeable (modular) necks were introduced   to offer surgeons an increased choice when determining the version,   offset and length of the femoral neck during total hip arthroplasty   (THA). It was hoped that this would improve outcomes and reduce   complications, particularly dislocation. In 2010, the Australian Orthopaedic   Association National Joint Replacement Registry (AOANJRR) first   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed an increased rate of revision after primary THA using femoral   stems with an exchangeable neck. The aim of this study was to provide   a more comprehensive up-to-date analysis of primary THA using femoral   stems with exchangeable and fixed necks.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The data included all primary THA procedures performed for osteoarthritis   (OA), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed to the AOANJRR between 01 September 1999 and 31 December   2014. There were 9289 femoral stems with an exchangeable neck and   253 165 femoral stems with a fixed neck.

Anterior knee pain and evidence of osteoarthritis of the patellofemoral joint should not be considered contraindications to mobile-bearing unicompartmental knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>It is not clear whether anterior knee pain and osteoarthritis   (OA) of the patellofemoral joint (PFJ) are contraindications to   medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA). Our aim was to   investigate the long-term outcome of a consecutive series of patients,   some of whom had anterior knee pain and PFJ OA managed with UKA.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We assessed the ten-year functional outcomes and 15-year implant   survival of 805 knees (677 patients) following medial mobile-bearing   UKA. The intra-operative status of the PFJ was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong>ed and, with   the exception of bone loss with grooving to the lateral side, neither   the clinical or radiological state of the PFJ nor the presence of   anterior knee pain were considered a contraindication. The impact   of radiographic findings and anterior knee pain was studied in a   subgroup of 100 knees (91 patients).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was no relationship between functional outcomes, at a mean   of ten years, or 15-year implant survival, and pre-operative anterior   knee pain, or the presence or degree of cartilage loss <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong>ed   intra-operatively at the medial patella or trochlea, or radiographic   evidence of OA in the medial side of the PFJ. In 6% of cases there   was full thickness cartilage loss on the lateral side of the patella.   In these cases, the overall ten-year function and 15-year survival   was similar to those without cartilage loss; however they had slightly   more difficulty with descending stairs.

Less   severe damage to the lateral side of the PFJ and damage to the medial   side, however severe, does not compromise the overall function or   survival, so should not be considered to be a contraindication. However,   if a patient does have full thickness cartilage loss on the lateral   side of the PFJ they may have a slight compromise in their ability   to descend stairs. Pre-operative anterior knee pain also does not   compromise the functional outcome or survival and should not be   considered to be a contraindication.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:632–9</p></sec>

Correcting severe valgus deformity
<p>Valgus knee deformity can present a number of   unique surgical challenges for the total knee arthroplasty (TKA)   surgeon. Understanding the typical patterns of bone and soft-tissue pathology   in the valgus arthritic knee is critical for appropriate surgical   planning. This review aims to provide the knee arthroplasty surgeon   with an understanding of surgical management strategies for the   treatment of valgus knee arthritis.</p><p>Lateral femoral and tibial deficiencies, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ed lateral soft   tissues, attenuated medial soft tissues, and multiplanar deformities   may all be present in the valgus arthritic knee. A number of classifications   have been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed in order to guide surgical management, and a variety   of surgical strategies have been described with satisfactory clinical   results.

Dislocation following total hip arthroplasty using dual mobility acetabular components
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this systematic review was to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong> the rate of dislocation   following the use of dual mobility (DM) acetabular components in   primary and revision total hip arthroplasty (THA).</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A systematic review of the literature according to the Preferred   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ing Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines   was performed. A comprehensive search of Pubmed/Medline, Cochrane   Library and Embase (Scopus) was conducted for English articles between   January 1974 and March 2016 using various combinations of the keywords “dual   mobility”, “dual-mobility”, “tripolar”, “double-mobility”, “double   mobility”, “hip”, “cup”, “socket”. The following data were extracted   by two investigators independently: demographics, whether the operation   was a primary or revision THA, length of follow-up, the design of   the components, diameter of the femoral head, and type of fixation   of the acetabular component.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In all, 59 articles met our inclusion criteria. These included   a total of 17 908 THAs which were divided into two groups: studies   dealing with DM components in primary THA and those dealing with   these components in revision THA. The mean rate of dislocation was   0.9% in the primary THA group, and 3.0% in the revision THA group.   The mean rate of intraprosthetic dislocation was 0.7% in primary   and 1.3% in revision THAs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Based on the current data, the use of DM acetabular components   are effective in minimising the risk of instability after both primary   and revision THA. This benefit must be balanced against continuing   concerns about the additional modularity, and the new mode of failure   of intraprosthetic dislocation. Longer term studies are needed to   assess the function of these newer materials compared with previous   generations. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B(1   Supple A):18–24.</p></sec>

Complications following arthroscopic surgery of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The number of patients undergoing arthroscopic surgery of the   hip has increased significantly during the past decade. It has now   become an established technique for the treatment of many intra-   and extra-articular conditions affecting the hip. However, it has   a steep learning curve and is not without the risk of complications.   The purpose of this systematic review was to determine the prevalence   of complications during and following this procedure.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Preferred <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ing Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses   guidelines were used in designing this study. Two reviewers systematically   searched the literature for complications related to arthroscopy   of the hip. The research question and eligibility criteria were   established <i>a priori</i>. Pertinent data were abstracted   and analysed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We found 276 relevant studies with a total of 36 761 arthroscopies   that met the inclusion criteria. The mean age of the patients was   36.7 years (1.7 to 70) and the mean body mass index was 25.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (20.2   to 29.2). Femoroacetabular impingement and labral tears were the   most common indications for the procedure. The total number of complications   was 1222 (3.3%). Nerve injury (0.9%), mainly involving the pudendal   and lateral femoral cutaneous nerves, and iatrogenic chondral and   labral injury (0.7%), were the two most common complications. There   were 58 major complications (0.2%), the most common being intra-abdominal   extravasation of fluid, which was found in 13 cases (0.04%). There   were three deaths (0.008%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Arthroscopic surgery of the hip is a procedure with a relatively   low rate of complications, although some may be significant in this   young cohort of patients. This study relied on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed complications   only and the results should be interpreted with caution.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1577–83.</p></sec>

The levels of vancomycin in the blood and the wound after the local treatment of bone and soft-tissue infection with antibiotic-loaded calcium sulphate as carrier material
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Calcium sulphate (CaSO<sub>4</sub>) is a resorbable material   that can be used simultaneously as filler of a dead space and as   a carrier for the local application of antibiotics. Our aim was   to describe the systemic exposure and the wound fluid concentrations   of vancomycin in patients treated with vancomycin-loaded CaSO<sub>4</sub> as   an adjunct to the routine therapy of bone and joint infections.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 680 post-operative blood and 233 wound fluid samples   were available for analysis from 94 implantations performed in 87   patients for various infective indications. Up to 6 g of vancomycin   were used. Non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis was performed   on the data from 37 patients treated for an infection of the hip.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The overall systemic exposure remained within a safe range, even   in patients with post-operative renal failure, none requiring removal   of the pellets. Local concentrations were approximately ten times   higher than with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) as a carrier, but   remained below <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed cell toxicity thresholds. Decreasing concentrations   in wound fluid were observed over several weeks, but remained above   the common minimum inhibitory concentrations for <i>Staphylococcus</i> up   to three months post-operatively. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study provides the first pharmacokinetic description of   the local application of vancomycin with CaSO<sub>4</sub> as a carrier,   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong>ing slow release, systemic safety and a release profile   far more interesting than from PMMA.

Revision total knee arthroplasty for failed high tibial osteotomy and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty have similar patient-reported outcome measures in a two-year follow-up study
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Little is known about the relative outcomes of revision of unicompartmental   knee arthroplasty (UKA) and high tibial osteotomy (HTO) to total   knee arthroplasty (TKA). The aim of this study is to compare the   outcomes of revision surgery for the two procedures in terms of   complications, re-revision and patient-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed outcome measures (PROMs)   at a minimum of two years follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This study was a retrospective review of data from an institutional   arthroplasty registry for cases performed between 2001 and 2014.   A total of 292 patients were identified, of which 217 had a revision   of HTO to TKA, and 75 had revision of UKA to TKA. While mean follow-up   was longer for the HTO group compared with the UKA group, patient   demographics (age, body mass index and Charlson co-morbidity index)   and PROMs (Short Form-36, Oxford Knee Score, Knee Society Score,   both objective and functional) were similar in the two groups prior   to revision surgery. Outcomes included the rate of complications   and    re-operation, PROMS and patient-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed satisfaction at six months   and two years post-operatively. We also compared the duration of   surgery and the need for revision implants in the two groups. </p></sec><sec><title>Results </title><p>At two-year follow-up, both groups of patients had made significant   improvement in terms of PROMs compared with pre-operative scores.   PROMs and satisfaction rates were similar in the two groups. Complications   requiring re-operation were significantly more frequent in the HTO   group whilst more revision implants were used in the UKA group,   resulting in a longer operative duration. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Revision of HTO and UKA achieve similar post-operative PROMs   and satisfaction. Revision of UKA more frequently requires revision   components with increased operation duration but fewer complications   requiring re-operation compared with revision of HTO. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1329–34.</p></sec>

Medium-term outcomes of the Universal-2 total wrist arthroplasty in patients with rheumatoid arthritis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of this study were to evaluate the clinical and radiological   outcomes of the Universal-2 total wrist arthroplasty (TWA) in patients   with rheumatoid arthritis.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This was a retrospective review of all 95 Universal-2 TWAs which   were performed in our institution between 2003 to 2012 in patients   with rheumatoid arthritis. A total of six patients were lost to   follow-up and two died of unrelated causes. A total of ten patients   had bilateral procedures. Accordingly, 75 patients (85 TWAs) were   included in the study. There were 59 women and 16 men with a mean   age of 59 years (26 to 86). The mean follow-up was 53 months (24   to 120). Clinical assessment involved recording pain on a visual   analogue score, range of movement, grip strength, the Quick Disabilities   of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) and Wrightington wrist scores.   Any adverse effects were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong>ed with particular emphasis on   residual pain, limitation of movement, infection, dislocation and   the need for revision surgery.</p><p>Radiographic assessment was performed pre-operatively and at   three, six and 12 months post-operatively, and annually thereafter.   Arthroplasties were assessed for distal row intercarpal fusion and   loosening. Radiolucent zones around the components were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">document</span></strong>ed   according to a system developed at our institution.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean worst pain was 8.1 (3 to 10) pre-operatively and 5.4   (0 to 10) at latest follow-up (p < 0.001). Movements were preserved   with mean dorsiflexion of 29<sup>o </sup>(0<sup> o</sup> to 70<sup> o</sup>)   and palmar flexion of 21<sup>o</sup> (0<sup>o</sup> to 50<sup>o</sup>).   The mean grip strength was 4.8 kg (1.7 to 11.5) pre-operatively   and 10 kg (0 to 28) at final follow-up (p < 0.001). The mean   QuickDASH and Wrightington wrist scores improved from 61 (16 to   91) to 46 (0 to 89) and 7.9 (1.8 to 10) to 5.7 (0 to 7.8) (p < 0.001).   A total of six patients (7%) had major complications; three required   revision arthroplasty and three an arthrodesis.

Proximal femoral resection without post-operative traction for the painful dislocated hip in young patients with cerebral palsy
<p>Proximal femoral resection (PFR) is a proven   pain-relieving procedure for the management of patients with severe cerebral   palsy and a painful displaced hip. Previous authors have recommended   post-operative traction or immobilisation to prevent a recurrence   of pain due to proximal migration of the femoral stump. We present   a series of 79 PFRs in 63 patients, age 14.7 years (10 to 26; 35   male, 28 female), none of whom had post-operative traction or immobilisation.</p><p>A total of 71 hips (89.6%) were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed to be pain free or to   have mild pain following surgery. Four children underwent further   resection for persistent pain; of these, three had successful resolution   of pain and one had no benefit. A total of 16 hips (20.2%) showed   radiographic evidence of heterotopic ossification, all of which   had formed within one year of surgery. Four patients had a wound   infection, one of which needed debridement; all recovered fully.   A total of 59 patients (94%) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed improvements in seating and   hygiene.</p><p>The results are as good as or better than the historical results   of using traction or immobilisation. We recommend that following   PFR, children can be managed without traction or immobilisation,   and can be discharged earlier and with fewer complications. However,   care should be taken with severely dystonic patients, in whom more   extensive femoral resection should be considered in combination   with management of the increased tone.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014; 96-B:701–6.</p>

Synovasure ‘quick test’ is not as accurate as the laboratory-based α-defensin immunoassay
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>α-defensin is a biomarker which has been described as having   a high degree of accuracy in the diagnosis of periprosthetic joint   infection (PJI). Current meta-analyses are based on the α-defensin   laboratory-based immunoassay rather than the quick on-table lateral   flow test kit. This study is the first meta-analysis to compare the   accuracy of the α-defensin laboratory-based immunoassay and the   lateral flow test kit for the diagnosis of PJI.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A systematic review was performed according to the Preferred   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ing Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.   Inclusion criteria were all clinical studies where the diagnosis   of PJI was uncertain. All studies selected used the Musculoskeletal   Infection Society (MSIS) or modified MSIS criteria. Two independent   reviewers reviewed the studies and extracted data.

A pilot randomized trial of meniscal allograft transplantation versus personalized physiotherapy for patients with a symptomatic meniscal deficient knee compartment
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Meniscal allograft transplantation is undertaken to improve pain   and function in patients with a symptomatic meniscal deficient knee   compartment. While case series have shown improvements in patient   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>ed outcome measures (PROMs), its efficacy has not been rigorously   evaluated. This study aimed to compare PROMs in patients having   meniscal transplantation with those having personalized physiotherapy   at 12 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A single-centre assessor-blinded, comprehensive cohort study,   incorporating a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) was performed   on patients with a symptomatic compartment of the knee in which   a (sub)total meniscectomy had previously been performed. They were   randomized to be treated either with a meniscal allograft transplantation   or personalized physiotherapy, and stratified for malalignment of   the limb. They entered the preference groups if they were not willing   to be randomized. The Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS),   International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score and Lysholm   score and complications were collected at baseline and at four,   eight and 12 months following the interventions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 36 patients entered the study; 21 were randomized   and 15 chose their treatments. Their mean age was 28 years (range   17 to 46). The outcomes were similar in the randomized and preference   groups, allowing pooling of data. At 12 months, the KOOS<sub>4</sub> composite   score (mean difference 12, p = 0.03) and KOOS subscales of pain   (mean difference 15, p = 0.02) and activities of daily living (mean   difference 18, p = 0.005) were significantly superior in the meniscal   transplantation group. Other PROMs also favoured this group without   reaching statistical significance. There were five complications   in the meniscal transplantation and one in the physiotherapy groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This is the first study to compare meniscal allograft transplantation   to non-operative treatment.

Metal-on-metal total hip arthroplasty is not associated with cardiac disease
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Many case <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">report</span></strong>s and small studies have suggested that cobalt   ions are a potential cause of cardiac complications, specifically   cardiomyopathy, after metal-on-metal (MoM) total hip arthroplasty   (THA). The impact of metal ions on the incidence of cardiac disease   after MoM THA has not been evaluated in large studies. The aim of   this study was to compare the rate of onset of new cardiac symptoms   in patients who have undergone MoM THA with those who have undergone   metal-on-polyethylene (MoP) THA.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Data were extracted from the Standard Analytics Files database   for patients who underwent MoM THA between 2005 and 2012. Bearing   surface was selected using International Classification of Diseases   ninth revision codes. Patients with a minimum five-year follow-up   were selected. An age and gender-matched cohort of patients who underwent   MoP THA served as a comparison group. New diagnoses of cardiac disease   were collected during the follow-up period. Comorbidities and demographics   were identified and routine descriptive statistics were used.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We identified 29 483 patients who underwent MoM THA and 24 175   matched patients who underwent MoP THA. Both groups had a mean Charlson   comorbidity index score of 4. There were no statistically significant   differences in 30 of 31 pre-existing comorbidities. Patients undergoing   MoM THA had a slightly lower incidence of cardiac failure compared   with those undergoing MoP THA at three years (6.60% <i>versus</i> 7.06%,   odds ratio (OR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 to 0.99)   and four years (8.73% <i>versus</i> 9.49%, OR 0.91, 95%   CI 0.86 to 0.97) postoperatively, with no difference in the incidence   of new cardiac failure in between the groups at five years. There   was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of   arrhythmia, myocardial infarction and cardiomyopathy at any time   between the two groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>MoM THA is not associated with cardiac complications.

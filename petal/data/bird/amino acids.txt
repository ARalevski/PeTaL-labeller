Carnosic Acid and Carnosol, Two Major Antioxidants of Rosemary, Act through Different Mechanisms
<p>Carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, a phenolic diterpene specific to the Lamiaceae family, is highly abundant in rosemary (<i>Rosmarinus officinalis</i>). Despite numerous industrial and medicinal/pharmaceutical applications of its antioxidative features, this compound in planta and its antioxidant mechanism have received little attention, except a few studies of rosemary plants under natural conditions. In vitro analyses, using high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet and luminescence imaging, revealed that carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> and its major oxidized derivative, carnosol, protect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s from oxidation. Both compounds preserved linolenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> and monogalactosyldiacylglycerol from singlet oxygen and from hydroxyl radical. When applied exogenously, they were both able to protect thylakoid membranes prepared from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves against <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> peroxidation. Different levels of carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> and carnosol in two contrasting rosemary varieties correlated with tolerance to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> peroxidation. Upon reactive oxygen species (ROS) oxidation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> was consumed and oxidized into various derivatives, including into carnosol, while carnosol resisted, suggesting that carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> is a chemical quencher of ROS. The antioxidative function of carnosol relies on another mechanism, occurring directly in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> oxidation process. Under oxidative conditions that did not involve ROS generation, carnosol inhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> peroxidation, contrary to carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>. Using spin probes and electron paramagnetic resonance detection, we confirmed that carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, rather than carnosol, is a ROS quencher. Various oxidized derivatives of carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> were detected in rosemary leaves in low light, indicating chronic oxidation of this compound, and accumulated in plants exposed to stress conditions, in parallel with a loss of carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, confirming that chemical quenching of ROS by carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> takes place in planta.</p>

The apo-structure of the leucine sensor Sestrin2 is still elusive
<p>Sestrin2 is a GATOR2-interacting protein that directly binds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leucin</span></strong>e and is required for the inhibition of mTORC1 under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leucin</span></strong>e deprivation, indicating that it is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leucin</span></strong>e sensor for the mTORC1 pathway. We recently reported the structure of Sestrin2 in complex with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leucin</span></strong>e [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID, 5DJ4] and demonstrated that mutations in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leucin</span></strong>e-binding pocket that alter the affinity of Sestrin2 for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leucin</span></strong>e result in a corresponding change in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leucin</span></strong>e sensitivity of mTORC1 in cells. A lower resolution structure of human Sestrin2 (PDB ID, 5CUF), which was crystallized in the absence of exogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leucin</span></strong>e, showed Sestrin2 to be in a nearly identical conformation as the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leucin</span></strong>e-bound structure. On the basis of this observation, it has been argued that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leucin</span></strong>e binding does not affect the conformation of Sestrin2 and that Sestrin2 may not be a sensor for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leucin</span></strong>e. We show that simple analysis of the reported “apo”-Sestrin2 structure reveals the clear presence of prominent, unmodeled electron density in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leucin</span></strong>e-binding pocket that exactly accommodates the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leucin</span></strong>e observed in the higher resolution structure. Refining the reported apo-structure with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leucin</span></strong>e eliminated the large <i>F</i><sub>obs</sub>-<i>F</i><sub>calc</sub> difference density at this position and improved the working and free R factors of the model. Consistent with this result, our own structure of Sestrin2 crystallized in the absence of exogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leucin</span></strong>e also contained electron density that is best explained by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leucin</span></strong>e. Thus, the structure of apo-Sestrin2 remains elusive.</p>

Oncogenic PI3K promotes methionine dependency in breast cancer cells through the cystine-glutamate antiporter xCT
<p>The precursor homo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cystein</span></strong>e is metabolized either through the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methionin</span></strong>e cycle to produce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methionin</span></strong>e or through the transsulfuration pathway to synthesize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cystein</span></strong>e. Alternatively, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cystein</span></strong>e can be obtained through uptake of its oxidized form, cystine. Many cancer cells exhibit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methionin</span></strong>e dependency such that their proliferation is impaired in growth media in which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methionin</span></strong>e is replaced by homo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cystein</span></strong>e. We showed that oncogenic <i>PIK3CA</i> and decreased expression of <i>SLC7A11</i>, a gene that encodes a cystine transporter also known as xCT, correlated with increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methionin</span></strong>e dependency in breast cancer cells. Oncogenic <i>PIK3CA</i> was sufficient to confer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methionin</span></strong>e dependency to mammary epithelial cells, partly by decreasing cystine uptake through the transcriptional and posttranslational inhibition of xCT. Manipulation of xCT activity altered the proliferation of breast cancer cells in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methionin</span></strong>e-deficient, homo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cystein</span></strong>e-containing media, suggesting that it functionally contributed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methionin</span></strong>e dependency. We propose that concurrent with decreased cystine uptake through xCT, <i>PIK3CA</i> mutant cells use homo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cystein</span></strong>e through the transsulfuration pathway to synthesize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cystein</span></strong>e. Consequently, less homo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cystein</span></strong>e is available to produce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methionin</span></strong>e, contributing to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methionin</span></strong>e dependency. These results indicate that oncogenic <i>PIK3CA</i> alters <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methionin</span></strong>e and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cystein</span></strong>e utilization, partly by inhibiting xCT to contribute to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methionin</span></strong>e dependency phenotype in breast cancer cells.</p>

Development Defects of Hydroxy-Fatty Acid-Accumulating Seeds Are Reduced by Castor Acyltransferases
<p>Researchers have long endeavored to produce modified fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s in easily managed crop plants where they are not natively found. An important step toward this goal has been the biosynthesis of these valuable products in model oilseeds. The successful production of such fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s has revealed barriers to the broad application of this technology, including low seed oil and low proportion of the introduced fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> and reduced seed vigor. Here, we analyze the impact of producing hydroxy-fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s on seedling development. We show that germinating seeds of a hydroxy-fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>-accumulating Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) line produce chlorotic cotyledons and suffer reduced photosynthetic capacity. These seedlings retain hydroxy-fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s in polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, including chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, and exhibit decreased fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthesis. Triacylglycerol mobilization in seedling development also is reduced, especially for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s that include hydroxy-fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> moieties. These developmental defects are ameliorated by increased flux of hydroxy-fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s into seed triacylglycerol created through the expression of either castor (<i>Ricinus communis</i>) acyltransferase enzyme ACYL-COA:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE2 or PHOSPHO<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1A. Such expression increases both the level of total stored triacylglycerol and the rate at which it is mobilized, fueling fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthesis and restoring photosynthetic capacity. Our results suggest that further improvements in seedling development may require the specific mobilization of triacylglycerol-containing hydroxy-fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s. Understanding the defects in early development caused by the accumulation of modified fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s and providing mechanisms to circumvent these defects are vital steps in the development of tailored oil crops.</p>

Starch Deficiency Enhances Lipid Biosynthesis and Turnover in Leaves
<p>Starch and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s represent two major forms of carbon and energy storage in plants and play central roles in diverse cellular processes. However, whether and how starch and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> metabolic pathways interact to regulate metabolism and growth are poorly understood. Here, we show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s can partially compensate for the lack of function of transient starch during normal growth and development in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Disruption of starch synthesis resulted in a significant increase in fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthesis via posttranslational regulation of the plastidic acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase and a concurrent increase in the synthesis and turnover of membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s and triacylglycerol. Genetic analysis showed that blocking fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> peroxisomal β-oxidation, the sole pathway for metabolic breakdown of fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s in plants, significantly compromised or stunted the growth and development of mutants defective in starch synthesis under long days or short days, respectively. We also found that the combined disruption of starch synthesis and fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> turnover resulted in increased accumulation of membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, triacylglycerol, and soluble sugars and altered fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> flux between the two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> biosynthetic pathways compartmentalized in either the chloroplast or the endoplasmic reticulum. Collectively, our findings provide insight into the role of fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> β-oxidation and the regulatory network controlling fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthesis, and they reveal the mechanistic basis by which starch and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> metabolic pathways interact and undergo cross talk to modulate carbon allocation, energy homeostasis, and plant growth.</p>

A Central Role for Triacylglycerol in Membrane Lipid Breakdown, Fatty Acid <i>β</i>-Oxidation, and Plant Survival under Extended Darkness
<p>Neutral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> metabolism is a key aspect of intracellular homeostasis and energy balance and plays a vital role in cell survival under adverse conditions, including nutrient deprivation in yeast and mammals, but the role of triacylglycerol (TAG) metabolism in plant stress response remains largely unknown. By thoroughly characterizing mutants defective in SUGAR-DEPENDENT1 (SDP1) triacylglycerol lipase or PEROXISOMAL ABC TRANSPORTER 1 (PXA1), here we show that TAG is a key intermediate in the mobilization of fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s from membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s for peroxisomal β-oxidation under prolonged dark treatment. Disruption of SDP1 increased TAG accumulation in cytosolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets and markedly enhanced plant tolerance to extended darkness. We demonstrate that blocking TAG hydrolysis enhances plant tolerance to dark treatment via two distinct mechanisms. In <i>pxa1</i> mutants, in which free fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s accumulated rapidly under extended darkness, SDP1 disruption resulted in a marked decrease in levels of cytotoxic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> intermediates such as free fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s and phosphatidic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, suggesting a buffer function of TAG accumulation against lipotoxicity under fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> overload. In the wild type, in which free fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s remained low and unchanged under dark treatment, disruption of SDP1 caused a decrease in reactive oxygen species production and hence the level of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> peroxidation, indicating a role of TAG in protection against oxidative damage. Overall, our findings reveal a crucial role for TAG metabolism in membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> breakdown, fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> turnover, and plant survival under extended darkness.</p>

Gene expression kinetics governs stimulus-specific decoration of the <i>Salmonella</i> outer membrane
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A is the innermost component of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecules that occupy the outer leaflet of the outer membrane in Gram-negative bacteria. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A is recognized by the host immune system and targeted by cationic antimicrobial compounds. In <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhimurium, the phosphates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A are chemically modified by enzymes encoded by targets of the transcriptional regulator PmrA. These modifications increase resistance to the cationic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e antibiotic polymyxin B by reducing the negative charge of the LPS. We report the mechanism by which <i>Salmonella</i> produces different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A profiles when PmrA is activated by low Mg<sup>2+</sup> versus a mildly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>ic pH. Low Mg<sup>2+</sup> favored modification of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A phosphates with 4-amino-4-deoxy-<sc>l</sc>-aminoarabinose (<sc>l</sc>-Ara4N) by activating the regulatory protein PhoP, which initially increased the LPS negative charge by promoting transcription of <i>lpxT</i>, encoding an enzyme that adds an additional phosphate group to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A. Later, PhoP activated PmrA posttranslationally, resulting in expression of PmrA-activated genes, including those encoding the LpxT inhibitor PmrR and enzymes responsible for the incorporation of <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N. By contrast, a mildly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>ic pH favored modification of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A phosphates with a mixture of <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N and phosphoethanolamine (pEtN) by simultaneously inducing the PhoP-activated <i>lpxT</i> and PmrA-activated <i>pmrR</i> genes. Although <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N reduces the LPS negative charge more than does pEtN, modification of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A phosphates solely with <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N required a prior transient increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A negative charge. Our findings demonstrate how bacteria tailor their cell surface to different stresses, such as those faced inside phagocytes.</p>

Structure Annotation and Quantification of Wheat Seed Oxidized Lipids by High-Resolution LC-MS/MS
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> oxidation is a process ubiquitous in life, but the direct and comprehensive analysis of oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s has been limited by available analytical methods. We applied high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to quantify oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s (glycerides, fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s, phospho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, lysophospho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, and galacto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s) and implemented a platform-independent high-throughput-amenable analysis pipeline for the high-confidence annotation and acyl composition analysis of oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> contents of 90 different naturally aged wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) seed stocks were quantified in an untargeted high-resolution LC-MS experiment, resulting in 18,556 quantitative mass-to-charge ratio features. In a posthoc liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry experiment, high-resolution MS/MS spectra (5 mD accuracy) were recorded for 8,957 out of 12,080 putatively monoisotopic features of the LC-MS data set. A total of 353 nonoxidized and 559 oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s with up to four additional oxygen atoms were annotated based on the accurate mass recordings (1.5 ppm tolerance) of the LC-MS data set and filtering procedures. MS/MS spectra available for 828 of these annotations were analyzed by translating experimentally known fragmentation rules of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s into the fragmentation of oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s. This led to the identification of 259 nonoxidized and 365 oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s by both accurate mass and MS/MS spectra and to the determination of acyl compositions for 221 nonoxidized and 295 oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s.

Glycerolipid Characterization and Nutrient Deprivation-Associated Changes in the Green Picoalga <i>Ostreococcus tauri</i>
<p>The picoalga <i>Ostreococcus tauri</i> is a minimal photosynthetic eukaryote that has been used as a model system. <i>O. tauri</i> is known to efficiently produce docosahexaenoic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> (DHA). We provide a comprehensive study of the glycero<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>ome of <i>O. tauri</i> and validate this species as model for related picoeukaryotes. <i>O. tauri</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s displayed unique features that combined traits from the green and the chromalveolate lineages. The betaine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> diacylglyceryl-hydroxymethyl-trimethyl-β-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alanin</span></strong>e and phosphatidyldimethylpropanethiol, both hallmarks of chromalveolates, were identified as presumed extraplastidial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s. DHA was confined to these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, while plastidial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s of prokaryotic type were characterized by the overwhelming presence of ω-3 C18 polyunsaturated fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s (FAs), 18:5 being restricted to galacto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s. C16:4, an FA typical of green microalgae galacto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, also was a major component of <i>O. tauri</i> extraplastidial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, while the 16:4-coenzyme A (CoA) species was not detected. Triacylglycerols (TAGs) displayed the complete panel of FAs, and many species exhibited combinations of FAs diagnostic for plastidial and extraplastidial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s. Importantly, under nutrient deprivation, 16:4 and ω-3 C18 polyunsaturated FAs accumulated into de novo synthesized TAGs while DHA-TAG species remained rather stable, indicating an increased contribution of FAs of plastidial origin to TAG synthesis. Nutrient deprivation further severely down-regulated the conversion of 18:3 to 18:4, resulting in obvious inversion of the 18:3/18:4 ratio in plastidial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, TAGs, as well as acyl-CoAs. The fine-tuned and dynamic regulation of the 18:3/18:4 ratio suggested an important physiological role of these FAs in photosynthetic membranes. Acyl position in structural and storage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s together with acyl-CoA analysis further help to determine mechanisms possibly involved in glycero<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> synthesis.</p>

An Aromatic Farnesyltransferase Functions in Biosynthesis of the Anti-HIV Meroterpenoid Daurichromenic Acid
<p><i>Rhododendron dauricum</i> produces daurichromenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, an anti-HIV meroterpenoid, via oxidative cyclization of the farnesyl group of grifolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>. The prenyltransferase (PT) that synthesizes grifolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> is a farnesyltransferase in plant specialized metabolism. In this study, we demonstrated that the isoprenoid moiety of grifolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> is derived from the 2-<i>C</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-erythritol-4-phosphate pathway that takes place in plastids. We explored candidate sequences of plastid-localized PT homologs and identified a cDNA for this PT, RdPT1, which shares moderate sequence similarity with known aromatic PTs. RdPT1 is expressed exclusively in the glandular scales, where daurichromenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> accumulates. In addition, the gene product was targeted to plastids in plant cells. The recombinant RdPT1 regiospecifically synthesized grifolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> from orsellinic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> and farnesyl diphosphate, demonstrating that RdPT1 is the farnesyltransferase involved in daurichromenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> biosynthesis. This enzyme strictly preferred orsellinic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> as a prenyl acceptor, whereas it had a relaxed specificity for prenyl donor structures, also accepting geranyl and geranylgeranyl diphosphates with modest efficiency to synthesize prenyl chain analogs of grifolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>. Such a broad specificity is a unique catalytic feature of RdPT1 that is not shared among secondary metabolic aromatic PTs in plants. We discuss the unusual substrate preference of RdPT1 using a molecular modeling approach. The biochemical properties as well as the localization of RdPT1 suggest that this enzyme produces meroterpenoids in glandular scales cooperatively with previously identified daurichromenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthase, probably for chemical defense on the surface of <i>R. dauricum</i> plants.</p>

Spatial and Temporal Mapping of Key Lipid Species in <i>Brassica napus</i> Seeds
<p>The regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> synthesis in oil seeds is still not fully understood. Oilseed rape (<i>Brassica napus</i>) is the third most productive vegetable oil crop on the global market; therefore, increasing our understanding of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> accumulation in oilseed rape seeds is of great economic, as well as intellectual, importance. Matrix-assisted laser/desorption ionization-mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) is a technique that allows the mapping of metabolites directly onto intact biological tissues, giving a spatial context to metabolism. We have used MALDI-MSI to study the spatial distribution of two major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> species, triacylglycerols and phosphatidylcholines. A dramatic, heterogenous landscape of molecular species was revealed, demonstrating significantly different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> compositions between the various tissue types within the seed. The embryonic axis was found to be particularly enriched in palmitic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, while the seed coat/aleurone layer accumulated vaccenic, linoleic, and α-linoleic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s. Furthermore, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> composition of the inner and outer cotyledons differed from each other, a remarkable discovery given the supposed identical functionality of these two tissues. Triacylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine molecular species distribution was analyzed through a developmental time series covering early seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> accumulation to seed maturity. The spatial patterning of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> molecular species did not vary significantly during seed development. Data gathered using MALDI-MSI was verified through gas chromatography analysis of dissected seeds. The distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> distribution profiles observed imply differential regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> metabolism between the different tissue types of the seed. Further understanding of this differential regulation will enhance efforts to improve oilseed rape productivity and quality.</p>

Bioenergetics through thick and thin
<p>The cells in all biological systems are composed of a limited number of molecular constituents, mainly proteins, nucleic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s, carbohydrates, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s. Of these, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s tend to receive the shortest shrift, as they are typically considered to be merely the building blocks of membranes that provide a scaffold in which the “important” molecules, such as enzymes or signaling proteins, reside. In recent years, and with the advent of advanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>omics techniques, we have learned that “a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>” is simply not true, and that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> composition of membranes can have profound effects on the behavior and activity of its resident macromolecules. For example, some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, such as members of the phosphatidylinositol family, are important signaling molecules. However, what is less appreciated is that the physical composition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> membranes can have profound effects on cellular behavior as well. On page 1186 of this issue, Budin <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) use the Gram-negative bacterium <i>Escherichia coli</i> and the budding yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> as model systems to show that the fluidity of a membrane, as determined by its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> composition, can have huge effects on the efficiency of aerobic energy production (respiration) by the highly hydrophobic, membrane-embedded, oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) system.</p>

The pseudokinase domains of guanylyl cyclase–A and –B allosterically increase the affinity of their catalytic domains for substrate
<p>Natriuretic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>es regulate multiple physiologic systems by activating transmembrane receptors containing intracellular guanylyl cyclase domains, such as GC-A and GC-B, also known as Npr1 and Npr2, respectively. Both enzymes contain an intracellular, phosphorylated pseudokinase domain (PKD) critical for activation of the C-terminal cGMP-synthesizing guanylyl cyclase domain. Because ATP allosterically activates GC-A and GC-B, we investigated how ATP binding to the PKD influenced guanylyl cyclase activity. Molecular modeling indicated that all the residues of the ATP-binding site of the prototypical kinase PKA, except the catalytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aspart</span></strong>ate, are conserved in the PKDs of GC-A and GC-B. Kinase-inactivating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alanin</span></strong>e substitutions for the invariant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lysin</span></strong>e in subdomain II or the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aspart</span></strong>ate in the DYG-loop of GC-A and GC-B failed to decrease enzyme phosphate content, consistent with the PKDs lacking kinase activity. In contrast, both mutations reduced enzyme activation by blocking the ability of ATP to decrease the Michaelis constant without affecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e-dependent activation. The analogous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lysin</span></strong>e-to-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alanin</span></strong>e substitution in a glutamate-substituted phosphomimetic mutant form of GC-B also reduced enzyme activity, consistent with ATP stimulating guanylyl cyclase activity through an allosteric, phosphorylation-independent mechanism. Mutations designed to rigidify the conserved regulatory or catalytic spines within the PKDs increased guanylyl cyclase activity, increased sensitivity to natriuretic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e, or reduced the Michaelis constant in the absence of ATP, consistent with ATP binding stabilizing the PKD in a conformation analogous to that of catalytically active kinases. We conclude that allosteric mechanisms evolutionarily conserved in the PKDs promote the catalytic activation of transmembrane guanylyl cyclases.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Chloroplast Damage Induced by the Inhibition of Fatty Acid Synthesis Triggers Autophagy in Chlamydomonas
<p>Fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s are synthesized in the stroma of plant and algal chloroplasts by the fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthase complex. Newly synthesized fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s are then used to generate plastidial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s that are essential for chloroplast structure and function. Here, we show that inhibition of fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthesis in the model alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> activates autophagy, a highly conserved catabolic process by which cells degrade intracellular material under adverse conditions to maintain cell homeostasis. Treatment of <i>Chlamydomonas</i> cells with cerulenin, a specific fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthase inhibitor, stimulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>ation of the autophagosome protein ATG8 and enhanced autophagic flux. We found that inhibition of fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthesis decreased monogalactosyldiacylglycerol abundance, increased lutein content, down-regulated photosynthesis, and increased the production of reactive oxygen species. Electron microscopy revealed a high degree of thylakoid membrane stacking in cerulenin-treated cells. Moreover, global transcriptomic analysis of these cells showed an up-regulation of genes encoding chloroplast proteins involved in protein folding and oxidative stress and the induction of major catabolic processes, including autophagy and proteasome pathways. Thus, our results uncovered a link between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> metabolism, chloroplast integrity, and autophagy through a mechanism that involves the activation of a chloroplast quality control system.</p>

The Ancient Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase Signaling System Is a Master Regulator of Energy and Carbon Metabolism in Algae
<p>Algae undergo a complete metabolic transformation under stress by arresting cell growth, inducing autophagy and hyper-accumulating biofuel precursors such as triacylglycerols and starch. However, the regulatory mechanisms behind this stress-induced transformation are still unclear. Here, we use biochemical, mutational, and “omics” approaches to demonstrate that PI3K signaling mediates the homeostasis of energy molecules and influences carbon metabolism in algae. In <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, the inhibition and knockdown (KD) of algal class III PI3K led to significantly decreased cell growth, altered cell morphology, and higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> and starch contents. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> profiling of wild-type and PI3K KD lines showed significantly reduced membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> breakdown under nitrogen starvation (−N) in the KD. RNA-seq and network analyses showed that under −N conditions, the KD line carried out lipogenesis rather than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> hydrolysis by initiating de novo fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> biosynthesis, which was supported by tricarboxylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> cycle down-regulation and via acetyl-CoA synthesis from glycolysis. Remarkably, autophagic responses did not have primacy over inositide signaling in algae, unlike in mammals and vascular plants. The mutant displayed a fundamental shift in intracellular energy flux, analogous to that in tumor cells. The high free fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> levels and reduced mitochondrial ATP generation led to decreased cell viability. These results indicate that the PI3K signal transduction pathway is the metabolic gatekeeper restraining biofuel yields, thus maintaining fitness and viability under stress in algae. This study demonstrates the existence of homeostasis between starch and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> synthesis controlled by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> signaling in algae and expands our understanding of such processes, with biotechnological and evolutionary implications.</p>

Revisiting the Algal “Chloroplast Lipid Droplet”: The Absence of an Entity That Is Unlikely to Exist
<p>The precise localization of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets and the metabolic pathways associated with oil production are crucial to the engineering of microalgae for biofuel production. Several studies have reported detecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets within the chloroplast of the microalga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, which accumulates considerable amounts of triacylglycerol and starch within the cell under nitrogen deprivation or high-light stress conditions. Starch undoubtedly accumulates within the chloroplast, but there have been debates on the localization of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets, which are cytosolic organelles in other organisms. Although it is impossible to prove an absence, we tried to repeat experiments that previously indicated the presence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets in chloroplasts. Here, we present microscopic results showing no evidence for the presence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets within the chloroplast stroma, even though some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets existed in close association with the chloroplast or were largely engulfed by the chloroplasts. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets are cytosolic structures, distinct from the plastoglobules present in the chloroplast stroma. These results not only contrast with the old ideas but also point out that what were previously thought to be chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets are likely to be embedded within chloroplast invaginations in association with the outer envelope of the chloroplast without intervention of the endoplasmic reticulum. These findings point to the intriguing possibility of a tight metabolic flow from the chloroplast to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplet through a close association rather than direct contact of both organelles.</p>

The Nonspecific Lipid Transfer Protein AtLtpI-4 Is Involved in Suberin Formation of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> Crown Galls
<p>Nonspecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> transfer proteins reversibly bind different types of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> molecules in a hydrophobic cavity. They facilitate phospho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> transfer between membranes in vitro, play a role in cuticle and possibly in suberin formation, and might be involved in plant pathogen defense signaling. This study focuses on the role of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> transfer protein <i>AtLTPI-4</i> in crown gall development. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) crown gall tumors, which develop upon infection with the virulent <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i> strain C58, highly expressed <i>AtLTPI-4</i>. Crown galls of the <i>atltpI-4</i> loss-of-function mutant were much smaller compared with those of wild-type plants. The gene expression pattern and localization of the protein to the plasma membrane pointed to a function of AtLTPI-4 in cell wall suberization. Since Arabidopsis crown galls are covered by a suberin-containing periderm instead of a cuticle, we analyzed the suberin composition of crown galls and found a reduction in the amounts of long-chain fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s (C<sub>18:0</sub>) in the <i>atltpI-4</i> mutant. To demonstrate the impact of AtLtpI-4 on extracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> composition, we expressed the protein in Arabidopsis epidermis cells. This led to a significant increase in the very-long-chain fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s C<sub>24</sub> and C<sub>26</sub> in the cuticular wax fraction. Homology modeling and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>-protein-overlay assays showed that AtLtpI-4 protein can bind these very-long-chain fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s. Thus, AtLtpI-4 protein may facilitate the transfer of long-chain as well as very-long-chain fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s into the apoplast, depending on the cell type in which it is expressed. In crown galls, which endogenously express AtLtpI-4, it is involved in suberin formation.</p>

Inhibition of Endothelial Notch Signaling Impairs Fatty Acid Transport and Leads to Metabolic and Vascular Remodeling of the Adult Heart
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Nutrients are transported through endothelial cells before being metabolized in muscle cells. However, little is known about the regulation of endothelial transport processes. Notch signaling is a critical regulator of metabolism and angiogenesis during development. Here, we studied how genetic and pharmacological manipulation of endothelial Notch signaling in adult mice affects endothelial fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> transport, cardiac angiogenesis, and heart function.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Endothelial-specific Notch inhibition was achieved by conditional genetic inactivation of Rbp-jκ in adult mice to analyze fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> metabolism and heart function. Wild-type mice were treated with neutralizing antibodies against the Notch ligand Delta-like 4. Fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> transport was studied in cultured endothelial cells and transgenic mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Treatment of wild-type mice with Delta-like 4 neutralizing antibodies for 8 weeks impaired fractional shortening and ejection fraction in the majority of mice. Inhibition of Notch signaling specifically in the endothelium of adult mice by genetic ablation of Rbp-jκ caused heart hypertrophy and failure. Impaired heart function was preceded by alterations in fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> metabolism and an increase in cardiac blood vessel density. Endothelial Notch signaling controlled the expression of endothelial lipase, Angptl4, CD36, and Fabp4, which are all needed for fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> transport across the vessel wall. In endothelial-specific Rbp-jκ–mutant mice, lipase activity and transendothelial transport of long-chain fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s to muscle cells were impaired. In turn, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s accumulated in the plasma and liver. The attenuated supply of cardiomyocytes with long-chain fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s was accompanied by higher glucose uptake, increased concentration of glycolysis intermediates, and mTOR-S6K signaling.

Crystal structure of a TAPBPR–MHC I complex reveals the mechanism of peptide editing in antigen presentation
<p>Central to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell–mediated immunity is the recognition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e–major histocompatibility complex class I (p–MHC I) proteins displayed by antigen-presenting cells. Chaperone-mediated loading of high-affinity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>es onto MHC I is a key step in the MHC I antigen presentation pathway. However, the structure of MHC I with a chaperone that facilitates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e loading has not been determined. We report the crystal structure of MHC I in complex with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e editor TAPBPR (TAP-binding protein–related), a tapasin homolog. TAPBPR remodels the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e-binding groove of MHC I, resulting in the release of low-affinity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e. Changes include groove relaxation, modifications of key binding pockets, and domain adjustments. This structure captures a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e-receptive state of MHC I and provides insights into the mechanism of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e editing by TAPBPR and, by analogy, tapasin.</p>

Coexpression Analysis Identifies Two Oxidoreductases Involved in the Biosynthesis of the Monoterpene Acid Moiety of Natural Pyrethrin Insecticides in <i>Tanacetum cinerariifolium</i>
<p>Flowers of <i>Tanacetum cinerariifolium</i> produce a set of compounds known collectively as pyrethrins, which are commercially important pesticides that are strongly toxic to flying insects but not to most vertebrates. A pyrethrin molecule is an ester consisting of either trans-chrysanthemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> or its modified form, pyrethric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, and one of three alcohols, jasmolone, pyrethrolone, and cinerolone, that appear to be derived from jasmonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>. Chrysanthemyl diphosphate synthase (CDS), the first enzyme involved in the synthesis of trans-chrysanthemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, was characterized previously and its gene isolated. <i>TcCDS</i> produces free trans-chrysanthemol in addition to trans-chrysanthemyl diphosphate, but the enzymes responsible for the conversion of trans-chrysanthemol to the corresponding aldehyde and then to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> have not been reported. We used an RNA sequencing-based approach and coexpression correlation analysis to identify several candidate genes encoding putative trans-chrysanthemol and trans-chrysanthemal dehydrogenases. We functionally characterized the proteins encoded by these genes using a combination of in vitro biochemical assays and heterologous expression in planta to demonstrate that <i>TcADH2</i> encodes an enzyme that oxidizes trans-chrysanthemol to trans-chrysanthemal, while <i>TcALDH1</i> encodes an enzyme that oxidizes trans-chrysanthemal into trans-chrysanthemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>. Transient coexpression of <i>TcADH2</i> and <i>TcALDH1</i> together with <i>TcCDS</i> in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaves results in the production of trans-chrysanthemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> as well as several other side products. The majority (58%) of trans-chrysanthemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> was glycosylated or otherwise modified. Overall, these data identify key steps in the biosynthesis of pyrethrins and demonstrate the feasibility of metabolic engineering to produce components of these defense compounds in a heterologous host.</p>

Identification and Characterization of Daurichromenic Acid Synthase Active in Anti-HIV Biosynthesis
<p>Daurichromenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> (DCA) synthase catalyzes the oxidative cyclization of grifolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> to produce DCA, an anti-HIV meroterpenoid isolated from <i>Rhododendron dauricum</i>. We identified a novel cDNA encoding DCA synthase by transcriptome-based screening from young leaves of <i>R. dauricum</i>. The gene coded for a 533-amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> poly<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e with moderate homologies to flavin adenine dinucleotide oxidases from other plants. The primary structure contained an amino-terminal signal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e and conserved amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> residues to form bicovalent linkage to the flavin adenine dinucleotide isoalloxazine ring at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">histidin</span></strong>e-112 and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cystein</span></strong>e-175. In addition, the recombinant DCA synthase, purified from the culture supernatant of transgenic <i>Pichia pastoris</i>, exhibited structural and functional properties as a flavoprotein. The reaction mechanism of DCA synthase characterized herein partly shares a similarity with those of cannabinoid synthases from <i>Cannabis sativa</i>, whereas DCA synthase catalyzes a novel cyclization reaction of the farnesyl moiety of a meroterpenoid natural product of plant origin. Moreover, in this study, we present evidence that DCA is biosynthesized and accumulated specifically in the glandular scales, on the surface of <i>R. dauricum</i> plants, based on various analytical studies at the chemical, biochemical, and molecular levels. The extracellular localization of DCA also was confirmed by a confocal microscopic analysis of its autofluorescence. These data highlight the unique feature of DCA: the final step of biosynthesis is completed in apoplastic space, and it is highly accumulated outside the scale cells.</p>

Stearoyl-Acyl Carrier Protein Desaturase Mutations Uncover an Impact of Stearic Acid in Leaf and Nodule Structure
<p>Stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturase (SACPD-C) has been reported to control the accumulation of seed stearic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>; however, no study has previously reported its involvement in leaf stearic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> content and impact on leaf structure and morphology. A subset of an ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenized population of soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) ‘Forrest’ was screened to identify mutants within the <i>GmSACPD-C</i> gene. Using a forward genetics approach, one nonsense and four missense <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutants were identified to have high levels of seed, nodule, and leaf stearic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> content. Homology modeling and in silico analysis of the GmSACPD-C enzyme revealed that most of these mutations were localized near or at conserved residues essential for diiron ion coordination. Soybeans carrying <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutations at conserved residues showed the highest stearic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> content, and these mutations were found to have deleterious effects on nodule development and function. Interestingly, mutations at nonconserved residues show an increase in stearic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> content yet retain healthy nodules. Thus, random mutagenesis and mutational analysis allows for the achievement of high seed stearic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> content with no associated negative agronomic characteristics. Additionally, expression analysis demonstrates that nodule leghemoglobin transcripts were significantly more abundant in soybeans with deleterious mutations at conserved residues of GmSACPD-C. Finally, we report that <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutations cause an increase in leaf stearic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> content and an alteration of leaf structure and morphology in addition to differences in nitrogen-fixing nodule structure.</p>

Network-Guided GWAS Improves Identification of Genes Affecting Free Amino Acids
<p>Amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s are essential for proper growth and development in plants. Amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s serve as building blocks for proteins but also are important for responses to stress and the biosynthesis of numerous essential compounds. In seed, the pool of free amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s (FAAs) also contributes to alternative energy, desiccation, and seed vigor; thus, manipulating FAA levels can significantly impact a seed’s nutritional qualities. While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on branched-chain amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s have identified some regulatory genes controlling seed FAAs, the genetic regulation of FAA levels, composition, and homeostasis in seeds remains mostly unresolved. Hence, we performed GWAS on 18 FAAs from a 313-ecotype Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) association panel. Specifically, GWAS was performed on 98 traits derived from known amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> metabolic pathways (approach 1) and then on 92 traits generated from an unbiased correlation-based metabolic network analysis (approach 2), and the results were compared. The latter approach facilitated the discovery of additional novel metabolic interactions and single-nucleotide polymorphism-trait associations not identified by the former approach. The most prominent network-guided GWAS signal was for a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">histidin</span></strong>e (His)-related trait in a region containing two genes: a cationic amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> transporter (CAT4) and a polynucleotide phosphorylase resistant to inhibition with fosmidomycin. A reverse genetics approach confirmed CAT4 to be responsible for the natural variation of His-related traits across the association panel. Given that His is a semiessential amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> and a potent metal chelator, CAT4 orthologs could be considered as candidate genes for seed quality biofortification in crop plants.</p>

Bacterial <sc>d</sc>-amino acids suppress sinonasal innate immunity through sweet taste receptors in solitary chemosensory cells
<p>In the upper respiratory epithelium, bitter and sweet taste receptors present in solitary chemosensory cells influence antimicrobial innate immune defense responses. Whereas activation of bitter taste receptors (T2Rs) stimulates surrounding epithelial cells to release antimicrobial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>es, activation of the sweet taste receptor (T1R) in the same cells inhibits this response. This mechanism is thought to control the magnitude of antimicrobial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e release based on the sugar content of airway surface liquid. We hypothesized that <sc>d</sc>-amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s, which are produced by various bacteria and activate T1R in taste receptor cells in the mouth, may also activate T1R in the airway. We showed that both the T1R2 and T1R3 subunits of the sweet taste receptor (T1R2/3) were present in the same chemosensory cells of primary human sinonasal epithelial cultures. Respiratory isolates of <i>Staphylococcus</i> species, but not <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, produced at least two <sc>d</sc>-amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s that activate the sweet taste receptor. In addition to inhibiting <i>P. aeruginosa</i> biofilm formation, <sc>d</sc>-amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s derived from <i>Staphylococcus</i> inhibited T2R-mediated signaling and defensin secretion in sinonasal cells by activating T1R2/3. <sc>d</sc>-Amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>–mediated activation of T1R2/3 also enhanced epithelial cell death during challenge with <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> in the presence of the bitter receptor–activating compound denatonium benzoate. These data establish a potential mechanism for interkingdom signaling in the airway mediated by bacterial <sc>d</sc>-amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s and the mammalian sweet taste receptor in airway chemosensory cells.</p>

Activation of master virulence regulator PhoP in acidic pH requires the <i>Salmonella</i>-specific protein UgtL
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>ic conditions, such as those inside phagosomes, stimulate the intracellular pathogen <i>Salmonella enterica</i> to activate virulence genes. The sensor PhoQ responds to a mildly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>ic pH by phosphorylating, and thereby activating, the virulence regulator PhoP. This PhoP/PhoQ two-component system is conserved in a subset of Gram-negative bacteria. PhoQ is thought to be sufficient to activate PhoP in mildly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>ic pH. However, we found that the <i>Salmonella</i>-specific protein UgtL, which was horizontally acquired by <i>Salmonella</i> before the divergence of <i>S. enterica</i> and <i>Salmonella bongori</i>, was also necessary for PhoQ to activate PhoP under mildly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>ic pH conditions but not for PhoQ to activate PhoP in response to low Mg<sup>2+</sup> or the antimicrobial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e C18G. UgtL increased the abundance of phosphorylated PhoP by stimulating autophosphorylation of PhoQ, thereby increasing the amount of the phosphodonor for PhoP. Deletion of <i>ugtL</i> attenuated <i>Salmonella</i> virulence and further reduced PhoP activation in a strain bearing a form of PhoQ that is not responsive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>ic pH. These data suggest that when <i>Salmonella</i> experiences mildly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>ic pH, PhoP activation requires PhoQ to detect pH and UgtL to amplify the PhoQ response. Our findings reveal how acquisition of a foreign gene can strengthen signal responsiveness in an ancestral regulatory system.</p>

Discovery and inhibition of an interspecies gut bacterial pathway for Levodopa metabolism

Comprehensive computational design of ordered peptide macrocycles
<p>Mixed-chirality <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e macrocycles such as cyclosporine are among the most potent therapeutics identified to date, but there is currently no way to systematically search the structural space spanned by such compounds. Natural proteins do not provide a useful guide: <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e macrocycles lack regular secondary structures and hydrophobic cores, and can contain local structures not accessible with <sc>l</sc>-amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s.

Nuclear magnetic resonance structures of 9 of 12 designed 7- to 10-residue macrocycles, and three 11- to 14-residue bicyclic designs, are close to the computational models.

Identification of Genes Encoding Enzymes Catalyzing the Early Steps of Carrot Polyacetylene Biosynthesis
<p>Polyacetylenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s accumulate in various Apiaceae species after pathogen attack, suggesting that these compounds are naturally occurring pesticides and potentially valuable resources for crop improvement. These compounds also promote human health and slow tumor growth. Even though polyacetylenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s were discovered decades ago, the biosynthetic pathway underlying their production is largely unknown. To begin filling this gap and ultimately enable polyacetylene engineering, we studied polyacetylenes and their biosynthesis in the major Apiaceae crop carrot (<i>Daucus carota</i> subsp. <i>sativus</i>). Using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, we identified three known polyacetylenes and assigned provisional structures to two novel polyacetylenes. We also quantified these compounds in carrot leaf, petiole, root xylem, root phloem, and root periderm extracts. Falcarindiol and falcarinol predominated and accumulated primarily in the root periderm. Since the multiple double and triple carbon-carbon bonds that distinguish polyacetylenes from ubiquitous fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s are often introduced by Δ12 oleic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> desaturase (FAD2)-type enzymes, we mined the carrot genome for <i>FAD2</i> genes. We identified a <i>FAD2</i> family with an unprecedented 24 members and analyzed public, tissue-specific carrot RNA-Seq data to identify coexpressed members with root periderm-enhanced expression. Six candidate genes were heterologously expressed individually and in combination in yeast and Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), resulting in the identification of one canonical FAD2 that converts oleic to linoleic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, three divergent FAD2-like acetylenases that convert linoleic into crepenynic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, and two bifunctional FAD2s with Δ12 and Δ14 desaturase activity that convert crepenynic into the further desaturated dehydrocrepenynic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, a polyacetylene pathway intermediate. These genes can now be used as a basis for discovering other steps of falcarin-type polyacetylene biosynthesis, to modulate polyacetylene levels in plants, and to test the in planta function of these molecules.</p>

Network Analysis Reveals a Role for Salicylic Acid Pathway Components in Shade Avoidance
<p>Plants have sophisticated mechanisms for sensing neighbor shade. To maximize their ability to compete for light, plants respond to shade through enhanced elongation and physiological changes. The shade avoidance response affects many different organs and growth stages, yet the signaling pathways underlying this response have mostly been studied in seedlings. We assayed transcriptome changes in response to shade across a 2-d time course in the wild type and 12 Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants. The resulting temporal map of transcriptional responses to shade defines early and late responses in adult plants, enabling us to determine connections between key signaling genes and downstream responses. We found a pervasive and unexpectedly strong connection between shade avoidance and genes related to salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, suggesting salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> signaling to be an important shade avoidance growth regulator. We tested this connection and found that several mutants disrupting salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> levels or signaling were defective in shade avoidance. The effect of these mutations on shade avoidance was specific to petiole elongation; neither hypocotyl nor flowering time responses were altered, thereby defining important stage-specific differences in the downstream shade avoidance signaling pathway. Shade treatment did not change salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> levels, indicating that the mediation of shade avoidance by salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> is not dependent on the modulation of salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> levels. These results demonstrate that salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> pathway genes also are key components of petiole shade avoidance.</p>

Alternative Oxidase Isoforms Are Differentially Activated by Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle Intermediates
<p>The cyanide-insensitive alternative oxidase (AOX) is a non-proton-pumping ubiquinol oxidase that catalyzes the reduction of oxygen to water and is posttranslationally regulated by redox mechanisms and 2-oxo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) possesses five AOX isoforms (AOX1A–AOX1D and AOX2). AOX1D expression is increased in <i>aox1a</i> knockout mutants from Arabidopsis (especially after restriction of the cytochrome <i>c</i> pathway) but cannot compensate for the lack of AOX1A, suggesting a difference in the regulation of these isoforms. Therefore, we analyzed the different AOX isoenzymes with the aim to identify differences in their posttranslational regulation. Seven tricarboxylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> cycle intermediates (citrate, isocitrate, 2-oxoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, malate, and oxaloacetate) were tested for their influence on AOX1A, AOX1C, and AOX1D wild-type protein activity using a refined in vitro system. AOX1C is insensitive to all seven organic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s, AOX1A and AOX1D are both activated by 2-oxoglutarate, but only AOX1A is additionally activated by oxaloacetate. Furthermore, AOX isoforms cannot be transformed to mimic one another by substituting the variable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cystein</span></strong>e residues at position III in the protein. In summary, we show that AOX isoforms from Arabidopsis are differentially fine-regulated by tricarboxylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> cycle metabolites (most likely depending on the amino-terminal region around the highly conserved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cystein</span></strong>e residues known to be involved in regulation by the 2-oxo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s pyruvate and glyoxylate) and propose that this is the main reason why they cannot functionally compensate for each other.</p>

Identification of Novel Growth Regulators in Plant Populations Expressing Random Peptides
<p>The use of chemical genomics approaches allows the identification of small molecules that integrate into biological systems, thereby changing discrete processes that influence growth, development, or metabolism. Libraries of chemicals are applied to living systems, and changes in phenotype are observed, potentially leading to the identification of new growth regulators. This work describes an approach that is the nexus of chemical genomics and synthetic biology. Here, each plant in an extensive population synthesizes a unique small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e arising from a transgene composed of a randomized nucleic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> sequence core flanked by translational start, stop, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cystein</span></strong>e-encoding (for disulfide cyclization) sequences. Ten and 16 amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> sequences, bearing a core of six and 12 random amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s, have been synthesized in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants. Populations were screened for phenotypes from the seedling stage through senescence. Dozens of phenotypes were observed in over 2,000 plants analyzed. Ten conspicuous phenotypes were verified through separate transformation and analysis of multiple independent lines. The results indicate that these populations contain sequences that often influence discrete aspects of plant biology. Novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>es that affect photosynthesis, flowering, and red light response are described. The challenge now is to identify the mechanistic integrations of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>es into biochemical processes. These populations serve as a new tool to identify small molecules that modulate discrete plant functions that could be produced later in transgenic plants or potentially applied exogenously to impart their effects. These findings could usher in a new generation of agricultural growth regulators, herbicides, or defense compounds.</p>

Biochemical Principles and Functional Aspects of Pipecolic Acid Biosynthesis in Plant Immunity
<p>The nonprotein amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> pipecolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> (Pip) regulates plant systemic acquired resistance and basal immunity to bacterial pathogen infection. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lysin</span></strong>e (Lys) aminotransferase AGD2-LIKE DEFENSE RESPONSE PROTEIN1 (ALD1) mediates the pathogen-induced accumulation of Pip in inoculated and distal leaf tissue. Here, we show that ALD1 transfers the α-amino group of <sc>l</sc>-Lys to acceptor oxo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s. Combined mass spectrometric and infrared spectroscopic analyses of in vitro assays and plant extracts indicate that the final product of the ALD1-catalyzed reaction is enaminic 2,3-dehydropipecolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> (DP), whose formation involves consecutive transamination, cyclization, and isomerization steps. Besides <sc>l</sc>-Lys, recombinant ALD1 transaminates <sc>l</sc>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methionin</span></strong>e, <sc>l</sc>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leucin</span></strong>e, diaminopimelate, and several other amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s to generate oxo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s or derived products in vitro. However, detailed in planta analyses suggest that the biosynthesis of 2,3-DP from <sc>l</sc>-Lys is the major in vivo function of ALD1. Since <i>ald1</i> mutant plants are able to convert exogenous 2,3-DP into Pip, their Pip deficiency relies on the inability to form the 2,3-DP intermediate. The Arabidopsis reductase ornithine cyclodeaminase/μ-crystallin, alias SYSTEMIC ACQUIRED RESISTANCE-DEFICIENT4 (SARD4), converts ALD1-generated 2,3-DP into Pip in vitro. SARD4 significantly contributes to the production of Pip in pathogen-inoculated leaves but is not the exclusive reducing enzyme involved in Pip biosynthesis. Functional <i>SARD4</i> is required for proper basal immunity to the bacterial pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i>. Although <i>SARD4</i> knockout plants show greatly reduced accumulation of Pip in leaves distal to <i>P. syringae</i> inoculation, they display a considerable systemic acquired resistance response. This suggests a triggering function of locally accumulating Pip for systemic resistance induction.</p>

Viscous control of cellular respiration by membrane lipid composition

Structural basis for recognition of frizzled proteins by <i>Clostridium difficile</i> toxin B
<p><i>Clostridium difficile</i> infection is the most common cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in developed countries. The major virulence factor, <i>C. difficile</i> toxin B (TcdB), targets colonic epithelia by binding to the frizzled (FZD) family of Wnt receptors, but how TcdB recognizes FZDs is unclear. Here, we present the crystal structure of a TcdB fragment in complex with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cystein</span></strong>e-rich domain of human FZD2 at 2.5-angstrom resolution, which reveals an endogenous FZD-bound fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> acting as a co-receptor for TcdB binding.

CAT-tailing as a fail-safe mechanism for efficient degradation of stalled nascent polypeptides
<p>Ribosome stalling leads to recruitment of the ribosome quality control complex (RQC), which targets the partially synthesized poly<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e for proteasomal degradation through the action of the ubiquitin ligase Ltn1p. A second core RQC component, Rqc2p, modifies the nascent poly<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e by adding a carboxyl-terminal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alanin</span></strong>e and threonine (CAT) tail through a noncanonical elongation reaction.

For substrates without Ltn1p-accessible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lysin</span></strong>es, CAT-tailing enabled degradation by exposing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lysin</span></strong>es sequestered in the ribosome exit tunnel.

Fatty acids in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are synthesized by the host plant
<p>Plants form beneficial associations with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, which facilitate nutrient acquisition from the soil. In return, the fungi receive organic carbon from the plants.

Decarboxylative borylation
<p>The widespread use of alkyl boronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s and esters is frequently hampered by the challenges associated with their preparation. We describe a simple and practical method to rapidly access densely functionalized alkyl boronate esters from abundant carboxylic substituents. This broad-scope nickel-catalyzed reaction uses the same activating principle as amide bond formation to replace a carboxylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> moiety with a boronate ester. Application to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>es allowed expedient preparations of α-amino boronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s, often with high stereoselectivity, thereby facilitating synthesis of the alkyl boronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> drugs Velcade and Ninlaro as well as a boronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> version of the iconic antibiotic vancomycin. The reaction also enabled the discovery and extensive biological characterization of potent human neutrophil elastase inhibitors, which offer reversible covalent binding properties.</p>

Giberellic Acid-Stimulated Transcript Proteins Evolved through Successive Conjugation of Novel Motifs and Their Subfunctionalization
<p><i>Gibberellic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> Stimulated Transcript</i> (<i>GAST</i>)-like genes encode small poly<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>es, some of which have been implicated in diverse biological processes regulating plant growth and development. However, the occurrence of GASTs among plants, their protein structures, and the mechanisms by which they evolved remain elusive. Here, using a customized workflow, we report genes encoding GAST proteins, identify novel motifs and evolutionary patterns contributing to the subfunctionalization of GAST domains, and explore functional conservation across diverse plant groups. We show that <i>GAST</i>-like sequences evolved initially in the vascular plant <i>Selaginella moellendorffii</i>, after the divergence from bryophytes, and later emerged in gymnosperms and angiosperms. GASTs in angiosperms are characterized by four conserved novel motifs; however, relatively fewer conserved motifs exist in pteridophytes and gymnosperms. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the GAST-Cysteine Rich1 motif evolved early in the <i>S. moellendorffii</i> GAST, which further acquired subfunctionalization through successive conjugation of other motifs and remained conserved across plants, as supported by their collinearity. Functional characterization of two orthologs from the dicot Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>; <i>Gibberellic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>-Stimulated Arabidopsis 10</i>) and the monocot rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>; <i>Gibberellic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> Stimulated Transcript-Related 9</i>) suggests hormonal regulation, novel roles in seed germination, and functional conservation among diverse plant groups. Computational modeling predicts that these <i>GAST</i> genes are regulated by several factors, including the phytohormones gibberellin and abscisic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, through conserved cis-motifs present in their promoters, and that they might act as signaling molecules in a complex feedback loop. Thus, our study identifies <i>GAST</i>s and their encoded proteins, uncovers their structure, novel motifs, and evolutionary pattern among plants, and suggests their functional conservation.</p>

Tri-Hydroxy-Triacylglycerol Is Efficiently Produced by Position-Specific Castor Acyltransferases
<p>Understanding the biochemistry of triacylglycerol (TAG) assembly is critical in tailoring seed oils to produce high-value products. Hydroxy-fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> (HFA) is one such valuable modified fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, which can be produced at low levels in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed through transgenic expression of the castor (<i>Ricinus communis</i>) hydroxylase. The resulting plants have low seed oil content and poor seedling establishment, indicating that Arabidopsis lacks efficient metabolic networks for biosynthesis and catabolism of hydroxy-containing TAG. To improve utilization of such substrates, we expressed three castor acyltransferase enzymes that incorporate HFA at each stereochemical position during TAG synthesis. This produced abundant tri-HFA TAG and concentrated 44% of seed HFA moieties into this one TAG species. Ricinoleic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> was more abundant than any other fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> in these seeds, which had 3-fold more HFA by weight than that in seeds following simple hydroxylase expression, the highest yet measured in a nonnative plant. Efficient utilization of hydroxy-containing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> substrates increased the rate of TAG synthesis 2-fold, leading to complete relief of the low-oil phenotype. Partition of HFA into specific TAG molecules increased the storage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> available for mobilization during seedling development, resulting in a 1.9-fold increase in seedling establishment. Expression of a complete acyltransferase pathway to efficiently process HFA establishes a benchmark in the quest to successfully produce modified oils in plants.</p>

Evidence for Exaptation of the <i>Marchantia polymorpha</i> M20D Peptidase MpILR1 into the Tracheophyte Auxin Regulatory Pathway
<p>Auxin homeostasis is tightly regulated by several mechanisms, including conjugation of the hormone to specific moieties, such as amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s or sugar. The inactive phytohormone conjugate is stored in large pools in plants and hydrolyzed to regain full activity. Many conjugate hydrolases (M20D metallo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>ases) have been identified and characterized throughout the plant kingdom. We have traced this regulatory gene family back to liverwort (<i>Marchantia polymorpha</i>), a member of the most ancient extant land plant lineage, which emerged approximately 475 million years ago. We have isolated and characterized a single hydrolase homologue, dubbed <i>M. polymorpha</i> IAA-Leucine Resistant1 (MpILR1), from liverwort. MpILR1 can hydrolyze two auxin (indole acetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> [IAA]) substrates (IAA-Leucine and IPA-Alanine) at very low levels of activity, but it cannot hydrolyze the two native auxin conjugates of liverwort (IAA-Glycine and IAA-Valine). We conclude from these results that liverwort likely does not employ active auxin conjugate hydrolysis as a regulatory mechanism and that conjugate homeostasis likely takes place in liverwort by passive background degradation. Furthermore, we present evidence that MpILR1 was probably exapted by tracheophytes over evolutionary time into the auxin regulatory pathway.</p>

Protein Carbonylation and Glycation in Legume Nodules
<p>Nitrogen fixation is an agronomically and environmentally important process catalyzed by bacterial nitrogenase within legume root nodules. These unique symbiotic organs have high metabolic rates and produce large amounts of reactive oxygen species that may modify proteins irreversibly. Here, we examined two types of oxidative posttranslational modifications of nodule proteins: carbonylation, which occurs by direct oxidation of certain amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s or by interaction with reactive aldehydes arising from cell membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> peroxides; and glycation, which results from the reaction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lysin</span></strong>e and arginine residues with reducing sugars or their autooxidation products. We used a strategy based on the enrichment of carbonylated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>es by affinity chromatography followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify 369 oxidized proteins in bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) nodules. Of these, 238 corresponded to plant proteins and 131 to bacterial proteins. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> peroxidation products induced most carbonylation sites. This study also revealed that carbonylation has major effects on two key nodule proteins. Metal-catalyzed oxidation caused the inactivation of malate dehydrogenase and the aggregation of leghemoglobin. In addition, numerous glycated proteins were identified in vivo, including three key nodule proteins: sucrose synthase, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutamin</span></strong>e synthetase, and glutamate synthase. Label-free quantification identified 10 plant proteins and 18 bacterial proteins as age-specifically glycated. Overall, our results suggest that the selective carbonylation or glycation of crucial proteins involved in nitrogen metabolism, transcriptional regulation, and signaling may constitute a mechanism to control cell metabolism and nodule senescence.</p>

FLOURY SHRUNKEN ENDOSPERM1 Connects Phospholipid Metabolism and Amyloplast Development in Rice
<p>Starch synthesized and stored in amyloplasts serves as the major energy storage molecule in cereal endosperm. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying amyloplast development and starch synthesis, we isolated a series of floury endosperm mutants in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). We identified the rice mutant <i>floury shrunken endosperm1</i> (<i>fse1</i>), which exhibited obvious defects in the development of compound starch grains, decreased starch content, and altered starch physicochemical features. Map-based cloning showed that <i>FSE1</i> encodes a phospholipase-like protein homologous to phosphatidic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>-preferring phospholipase A<sub>1</sub>. <i>FSE1</i> was expressed ubiquitously with abundant levels observed in developing seeds and roots. FSE1 was localized to both the cytosol and intracellular membranes. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> profiling indicated that total extra-plastidic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s and phosphatidic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> were increased in <i>fse1</i> plants, suggesting that FSE1 may exhibit in vivo phospholipase A<sub>1</sub> activity on phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidyl-Ser, phosphatidylethanolamine, and, in particular, phosphatidic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>. Additionally, the total galacto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> content in developing <i>fse1</i> endosperm was significantly reduced, which may cause abnormal amyloplast development. Our results identify FSE1 as a phospholipase-like protein that controls the synthesis of galacto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s in rice endosperm and provide a novel connection between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> metabolism and starch synthesis in rice grains during endosperm development.</p>

Screening for Biologically Annotated Drugs That Trigger Triacylglycerol Accumulation in the Diatom <i>Phaeodactylum</i>
<p>Microalgae are a promising feedstock for the production of triacylglycerol (TAG) for a variety of potential applications, ranging from food and human health to biofuels and green chemistry. However, obtaining high TAG yields is challenging. A phenotypic assay for the accumulation of oil droplets was developed to screen a library of 1,200 drugs, annotated with pharmacology information, to select compounds that trigger TAG accumulation in the diatom <i>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</i>. Using this screen, we identified 34 molecules acting in a dose-dependent manner. Previously characterized targets of these compounds include cell division and cell signaling effectors, membrane receptors and transporters, and sterol metabolism. Among the five compounds possibly acting on sterol metabolism, we focused our study on ethynylestradiol, a synthetic form of estrogen that is used in contraceptive pills and known for its ecological impact as an endocrine disruptor. Ethynylestradiol impaired the production of very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s, destabilized the galacto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> versus phospho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> balance, and triggered the recycling of fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s from membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s to TAG. The <i>P. tricornutum</i> transcriptomic response to treatment with ethynylestradiol was consistent with the reallocation of carbon from sterols to acetyl-coenzyme A and TAG. The mode of action and catabolism of ethynylestradiol are unknown but might involve several up-regulated cytochrome P450 proteins. A fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> elongase, Δ6-ELO-B1, might be involved in the impairment of very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s and fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> turnover. This phenotypic screen opens new perspectives for the exploration of novel bioactive molecules, potential target genes, and pathways controlling TAG biosynthesis. It also unraveled the sensitivity of diatoms to endocrine disruptors, highlighting an impact of anthropogenic pollution on phytoplankton.</p>

Mechanisms of Phosphorus Acquisition and Lipid Class Remodeling under P Limitation in a Marine Microalga
<p>Molecular mechanisms of phosphorus (P) limitation are of great interest for understanding algal production in aquatic ecosystems. Previous studies point to P limitation-induced changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> composition. As, in microalgae, the molecular mechanisms of this specific P stress adaptation remain unresolved, we reveal a detailed phospho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>-recycling scheme in <i>Nannochloropsis oceanica</i> and describe important P acquisition genes based on highly corresponding transcriptome and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>ome data. Initial responses to P limitation showed increased expression of genes involved in P uptake and an expansion of the P substrate spectrum based on purple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> phosphatases. Increase in P trafficking displayed a rearrangement between compartments by supplying P to the chloroplast and carbon to the cytosol for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> synthesis. We propose a novel phospho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>-recycling scheme for algae that leads to the rapid reduction of phospho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s and synthesis of the P-free <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> classes. P mobilization through membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> degradation is mediated mainly by two glycerophosphoryldiester phosphodiesterases and three patatin-like phospholipases A on the transcriptome level. To compensate for low phospho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s in exponential growth, <i>N. oceanica</i> synthesized sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol and diacylglyceroltrimethylhomoserine. In this study, it was shown that an <i>N. oceanica</i> strain has a unique repertoire of genes that facilitate P acquisition and the degradation of phospho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s compared with other stramenopiles. The novel phospho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>-recycling scheme opens new avenues for metabolic engineering of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> composition in algae.</p>

Protoplast Swelling and Hypocotyl Growth Depend on Different Auxin Signaling Pathways
<p>Members of the TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE1/AUXIN SIGNALING F-BOX PROTEIN (TIR1/AFB) family are known auxin receptors. To analyze the possible receptor function of AUXIN BINDING PROTEIN1 (ABP1), an auxin receptor currently under debate, we performed different approaches. We performed a pharmacological approach using α-(2,4-dimethylphenylethyl-2-oxo)-indole-3-acetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> (auxinole), α-(phenylethyl-2-oxo)-indole-3-acetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> (PEO-IAA), and 5-fluoroindole-3-acetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> (5-F-IAA) to discriminate between ABP1- and TIR1/AFB-mediated processes in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We used a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e of the carboxyl-terminal region of AtABP1 as a tool. We performed mutant analysis with the null alleles of <i>ABP1</i>, <i>abp1-c1</i> and <i>abp1-TD1</i>, and the TILLING mutant <i>abp1-5</i>. We employed Coimbra, an accession that exhibits an amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> exchange in the auxin-binding domain of ABP1. We measured either volume changes of single hypocotyl protoplasts or hypocotyl growth, both at high temporal resolution. 5-F-IAA selectively activated the TIR1/AFB pathway but did not induce protoplast swelling; instead, it showed auxin activity in the hypocotyl growth test. In contrast, PEO-IAA induced an auxin-like swelling response but no hypocotyl growth. The carboxyl-terminal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e of AtABP1 induced an auxin-like swelling response. In the <i>ABP1</i>-related mutants and Coimbra, no auxin-induced protoplast swelling occurred. ABP1 seems to be involved in mediating rapid auxin-induced protoplast swelling, but it is not involved in the control of rapid auxin-induced growth.</p>

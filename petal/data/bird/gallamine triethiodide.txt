A general catalytic β-C–H carbonylation of aliphatic amines to β-lactams
<p>Methods for the synthesis and functionalization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>es are intrinsically important to a variety of chemical applications. We present a general carbon-hydrogen bond activation process that combines readily available aliphatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>es and the feedstock gas carbon monoxide to form synthetically versatile value-added amide products. The operationally straightforward palladium-catalyzed process exploits a distinct reaction pathway, wherein a sterically hindered carboxylate ligand orchestrates an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>e attack on a palladium anhydride to transform aliphatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>es into β-lactams. The reaction is successful with a wide range of secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>es and can be used as a late-stage functionalization tactic to deliver advanced, highly functionalized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>e products of utility for pharmaceutical research and other areas.</p>

Catalytic intermolecular hydroaminations of unactivated olefins with secondary alkyl amines
<p>The intermolecular hydro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>ation of unactivated alkenes with simple dialkyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>es remains an unsolved problem in organic synthesis. We report a catalytic protocol for efficient additions of cyclic and acyclic secondary alkyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>es to a wide range of alkyl olefins with complete anti-Markovnikov regioselectivity. In this process, carbon-nitrogen bond formation proceeds through a key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>ium radical cation intermediate that is generated via electron transfer between an excited-state iridium photocatalyst and an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>e substrate. These reactions are redox-neutral and completely atom-economical, exhibit broad functional group tolerance, and occur readily at room temperature under visible light irradiation. Certain tertiary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>e products generated through this method are formally endergonic relative to their constituent olefin and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>e starting materials and thus are not accessible via direct coupling with conventional ground-state catalysts.</p>

Photocatalytic decarboxylative alkylations mediated by triphenylphosphine and sodium iodide
<p>Most photoredox catalysts in current use are precious metal complexes or synthetically elaborate organic dyes, the cost of which can impede their application for large-scale industrial processes. We found that a combination of triphenylphosphine and sodium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">iodid</span></strong>e under 456-nanometer irradiation by blue light–emitting diodes can catalyze the alkylation of silyl enol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ether</span></strong>s by decarboxylative coupling with redox-active esters in the absence of transition metals. De<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>ative alkylation using Katritzky’s N-alkylpyridinium salts and trifluoromethylation using Togni’s reagent are also demonstrated. Moreover, the phosphine/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">iodid</span></strong>e-based photoredox system catalyzes Minisci-type alkylation of N-heterocycles and can operate in tandem with chiral phosphoric acids to achieve high enantioselectivity in this reaction.</p>

Ketyl radical reactivity via atom transfer catalysis
<p>Single-electron reduction of a carbonyl to a ketyl enables access to a polarity-reversed platform of reactivity for this cornerstone functional group. However, the synthetic utility of the ketyl radical is hindered by the strong reductants necessary for its generation, which also limit its reactivity to net reductive mechanisms. We report a strategy for net redox-neutral generation and reaction of ketyl radicals. The in situ conversion of aldehydes to α-acetoxy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">iodid</span></strong>es lowers their reduction potential by more than 1 volt, allowing for milder access to the corresponding ketyl radicals and an oxidative termination event. Upon subjecting these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">iodid</span></strong>es to a dimanganese decacarbonyl precatalyst and visible light irradiation, an atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) mechanism affords a broad scope of vinyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">iodid</span></strong>e products with high <i>Z</i>-selectivity.</p>

Neurohormonal changes associated with ritualized combat and the formation of a reproductive hierarchy in the ant <i>Harpegnathos saltator</i>
<p>Dominance rank in animal societies is correlated with changes in both reproductive physiology and behavior. In some social insects, dominance status is used to determine a reproductive division of labor, where a few colony members reproduce while most remain functionally sterile. Changes in reproduction and behavior in this context must be coordinated through crosstalk between the brain and the reproductive system. We investigated a role for biogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>es in forming this connection in the ant <i>Harpegnathos saltator</i>. In this species, workers engage in an elaborate dominance tournament to establish a group of reproductive workers termed gamergates. We analyzed biogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>e content in the brains of gamergates, inside-workers and foragers under stable colony conditions and found that gamergates had the highest levels of dop<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>e. Dop<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>e levels were also positively correlated with increased ovarian activity among gamergates. Next, we experimentally induced workers to compete in a reproductive tournament to determine how dop<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>e may be involved in the establishment of a new hierarchy. Dop<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>e levels rose in aggressive workers at the start of a tournament, while workers that were policed by their nestmates (a behavior that inhibits ovarian activity) showed a rapid decline in dop<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>e. In addition to dop<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>e, levels of serotonin and tyr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>e differed among castes, and these changes could contribute to differences in caste-specific behavioral patterns observed among non-reproductive workers. Overall, these results provide support that biogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>es link changes in behavior and dominance with reproductive activity in <i>H. saltator</i> as well as drive differences in worker task performance.</p>

Delayed catalyst function enables direct enantioselective conversion of nitriles to NH<sub>2</sub>-amines
<p>Accessing enantiomerically enriched <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>es often demands oxidation-state adjustments, protection and deprotection processes, and purification procedures that increase cost and waste, limiting applicability. When diastereomers can be formed, one isomer is attainable. Here, we show that nitriles, largely viewed as insufficiently reactive, can be transformed directly to multifunctional unprotected homoallylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>es by enantioselective addition of a carbon-based nucleophile and diastereodivergent reduction of the resulting ketimine. Successful implementation requires that competing copper-based catalysts be present simultaneously and that the slower-forming and less reactive one engages first. This challenge was addressed by incorporation of a nonproductive side cycle, fueled selectively by inexpensive additives, to delay the function of the more active catalyst. The utility of this approach is highlighted by its application to the efficient preparation of the anticancer agent (+)-tangutorine.</p>

Catalyst-controlled stereoselective cationic polymerization of vinyl ethers
<p>The tacticity of vinyl polymers has a profound effect on their physical properties. Despite the well-developed stereoselective methods for the polymerization of propylene and other nonpolar α-olefins, stereoselective polymerization of polar vinyl monomers has proven more challenging. We have designed chiral counterions that systematically bias the reactivity and chain-end stereochemical environment during cationic polymerization. This approach overrides conventional chain-end stereochemical bias to achieve catalyst-controlled stereoselective polymerization. We demonstrate that this method is general to vinyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ether</span></strong> substrates, providing access to a range of isotactic poly(vinyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ether</span></strong>)s with high degrees of isotacticity. The obtained materials display the tensile properties of commercial polyolefins but adhere more strongly to polar substrates by an order of magnitude, indicating their promise for next-generation engineering applications.</p>

Homogenized halides and alkali cation segregation in alloyed organic-inorganic perovskites
<p>The role of the alkali metal cations in halide perovskite solar cells is not well understood.

Halide homogenization coincides with long-lived charge carrier decays, spatially homogeneous carrier dynamics (as visualized by ultrafast microscopy), and improved photovoltaic device performance. We found that rubidium and potassium phase-segregate in highly concentrated clusters. Alkali metals are beneficial at low concentrations, where they homogenize the halide distribution, but at higher concentrations, they form recombination-active second-phase clusters.</p>

Carbonyl catalysis enables a biomimetic asymmetric Mannich reaction
<p>Chiral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>es are widely used as catalysts in asymmetric synthesis to activate carbonyl groups for α-functionalization. Carbonyl catalysis reverses that strategy by using a carbonyl group to activate a primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>e. Inspired by biological carbonyl catalysis, which is exemplified by reactions of pyridoxal-dependent enzymes, we developed an N-quaternized pyridoxal catalyst for the asymmetric Mannich reaction of glycinate with aryl <i>N</i>-diphenylphosphinyl imines. The catalyst exhibits high activity and stereoselectivity, likely enabled by enzyme-like cooperative bifunctional activation of the substrates. Our work demonstrates the catalytic utility of the pyridoxal moiety in asymmetric catalysis.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Hydroxystilbenes Are Monomers in Palm Fruit Endocarp Lignins
<p>Lignin, the plant cell wall polymer that binds fibers tog<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ether</span></strong> but makes processing difficult, is traditionally formed from three monomers, the so-called monolignols (<i>p</i>-coumaryl, coniferyl, and sinapyl alcohols). Recently, we discovered, in grass lignins, a phenolic monomer that falls outside the canonical lignin biosynthetic pathway, the flavone tricin. As we show here, palm fruit (macaéíéííéíúba [<i>Acrocomia aculeata</i>], carnauba [<i>Copernicia prunifera</i>], and coconut [<i>Cocos nucifera</i>]) endocarps contain lignin polymers derived in part from a previously unconsidered class of lignin monomers, the hydroxystilbenes, including the valuable compounds piceatannol and resveratrol. Piceatannol could be released from these lignins upon derivatization followed by reductive cleavage, a degradative method that cleaves β-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ether</span></strong> bonds, indicating that at least a fraction is incorporated through labile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ether</span></strong> bonds. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of products from the copolymerization of piceatannol and monolignols confirms the structures in the natural polymer and demonstrates that piceatannol acts as an authentic monomer participating in coupling and cross-coupling reactions during lignification. Therefore, palm fruit endocarps contain a new class of stilbenolignin polymers, further expanding the definition of lignin and implying that compounds such as piceatannol and resveratrol are potentially available in what is now essentially a waste product.</p>

Drug Screening Using a Library of Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell–Derived Cardiomyocytes Reveals Disease-Specific Patterns of Cardiotoxicity
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Cardiotoxicity is a leading cause for drug attrition during pharmaceutical development and has resulted in numerous preventable patient deaths. Incidents of adverse cardiac drug reactions are more common in patients with preexisting heart disease than the general population. Here we generated a library of human induced pluripotent stem cell–derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) from patients with various hereditary cardiac disorders to model differences in cardiac drug toxicity susceptibility for patients of different genetic backgrounds.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Action potential duration and drug-induced arrhythmia were measured at the single cell level in hiPSC-CMs derived from healthy subjects and patients with hereditary long QT syndrome, familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and familial dilated cardiomyopathy.

Human embryonic stem cell–derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) and the human <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ether</span></strong>-a-go-go</i>–related gene expressing human embryonic kidney cells were used as controls. Single cell PCR confirmed expression of all cardiac ion channels in patient-specific hiPSC-CMs as well as hESC-CMs, but not in human embryonic kidney cells.

The conformational state of hERG1 channels determines integrin association, downstream signaling, and cancer progression
<p>Ion channels regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration in normal and neoplastic cells through cell-cell and cell–extracellular matrix (ECM) transmembrane receptors called integrins. K<sup>+</sup> flux through the human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ether</span></strong>-à-go-go–related gene 1 (hERG1) channel shapes action potential firing in excitable cells such as cardiomyocytes. Its abundance is often aberrantly high in tumors, where it modulates integrin-mediated signaling. We found that hERG1 interacted with the β<sub>1</sub> integrin subunit at the plasma membrane of human cancer cells. This interaction was not detected in cardiomyocytes because of the presence of the hERG1 auxiliary subunit KCNE1 (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily E regulatory subunit 1), which blocked the β<sub>1</sub> integrin–hERG1 interaction. Although open hERG1 channels did not interact as strongly with β<sub>1</sub> integrins as did closed channels, current flow through hERG1 channels was necessary to activate the integrin-dependent phosphorylation of Tyr<sup>397</sup> in focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in both normal and cancer cells. In immunodeficient mice, proliferation was inhibited in breast cancer cells expressing forms of hERG1 with impaired K<sup>+</sup> flow, whereas metastasis of breast cancer cells was reduced when the hERG1/β<sub>1</sub> integrin interaction was disrupted. We conclude that the interaction of β<sub>1</sub> integrins with hERG1 channels in cancer cells stimulated distinct signaling pathways that depended on the conformational state of hERG1 and affected different aspects of tumor progression.</p>

Probing magnetism in 2D materials at the nanoscale with single-spin microscopy
<p>The discovery of ferromagnetism in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) crystals has generated widespread interest. Making further progress in this area requires quantitative knowledge of the magnetic properties of vdW magnets at the nanoscale.

We determined the magnetization of CrI<sub>3</sub> monolayers to be ≈16 Bohr magnetons per square nanometer, with comparable values in samples with odd numbers of layers; however, the magnetization vanishes when the number of layers is even. We also found that structural modifications can induce switching between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interlayer ordering. These results demonstrate the benefit of using single-spin scanning magnetometry to study the magnetism of 2D vdW magnets.</p>

Spin coating epitaxial films
<p>Spin-coated films, such as photoresists for lithography or perovskite films for solar cells, are either amorphous or polycrystalline. We show that epitaxial films of inorganic materials such as cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr<sub>3</sub>), lead(II) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">iodid</span></strong>e (PbI<sub>2</sub>), zinc oxide (ZnO), and sodium chloride (NaCl) can be deposited onto a variety of single-crystal and single-crystal–like substrates by simply spin coating either solutions of the material or precursors to the material. The out-of-plane and in-plane orientations of the spin-coated films are determined by the substrate. The thin stagnant layer of supersaturated solution produced during spin coating promotes heterogeneous nucleation of the material onto the single-crystal substrate over homogeneous nucleation in the bulk solution, and ordered anion adlayers may lower the activation energy for nucleation on the surface. The method can be used to produce functional materials such as inorganic semiconductors or to deposit water-soluble materials such as NaCl that can serve as growth templates.</p>

Metabolic recycling of ammonia via glutamate dehydrogenase supports breast cancer biomass
<p>Ammonia is a ubiquitous by-product of cellular metabolism; however, the biological consequences of ammonia production are not fully understood, especially in cancer. We found that ammonia is not merely a toxic waste product but is recycled into central <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>o acid metabolism to maximize nitrogen utilization. In our experiments, human breast cancer cells primarily assimilated ammonia through reductive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>ation catalyzed by glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH); secondary reactions enabled other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>o acids, such as proline and aspartate, to directly acquire this nitrogen. Metabolic recycling of ammonia accelerated proliferation of breast cancer. In mice, ammonia accumulated in the tumor microenvironment and was used directly to generate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>o acids through GDH activity. These data show that ammonia is not only a secreted waste product but also a fundamental nitrogen source that can support tumor biomass.</p>

The changes simultaneously switch the binding site affinities and the labilities of barriers on the track, creating an energy ratchet.

The concentration of defect states, which reduce a cell’s performance by decreasing the open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current density, needs to be as low as possible. We show that the introduction of additional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">iodid</span></strong>e ions into the organic cation solution, which are used to form the perovskite layers through an intramolecular exchanging process, decreases the concentration of deep-level defects. The defect-engineered thin perovskite layers enable the fabrication of PSCs with a certified power conversion efficiency of 22.1% in small cells and 19.7% in 1-square-centimeter cells.</p>

Colloidally prepared La-doped BaSnO<sub>3</sub> electrodes for efficient, photostable perovskite solar cells
<p>Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) exceeding a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20% have mainly been demonstrated by using mesoporous titanium dioxide (mp-TiO<sub>2</sub>) as an electron-transporting layer. However, TiO<sub>2</sub> can reduce the stability of PSCs under illumination (including ultraviolet light). Lanthanum (La)–doped BaSnO<sub>3</sub> (LBSO) perovskite would be an ideal replacement given its electron mobility and electronic structure, but LBSO cannot be synthesized as well-dispersible fine particles or crystallized below 500°C. We report a superoxide colloidal solution route for preparing a LBSO electrode under very mild conditions (below 300°C). The PSCs fabricated with LBSO and methylammonium lead <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">iodid</span></strong>e (MAPbI<sub>3</sub>) show a steady-state power conversion efficiency of 21.2%, versus 19.7% for a mp-TiO<sub>2</sub> device. The LBSO-based PSCs could retain 93% of their initial performance after 1000 hours of full-Sun illumination.</p>

Long-range hot-carrier transport in hybrid perovskites visualized by ultrafast microscopy
<p>The Shockley-Queisser limit for solar cell efficiency can be overcome if hot carriers can be harvested before they thermalize. Recently, carrier cooling time up to 100 picoseconds was observed in hybrid perovskites, but it is unclear wh<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ether</span></strong> these long-lived hot carriers can migrate long distance for efficient collection. We report direct visualization of hot-carrier migration in methylammonium lead <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">iodid</span></strong>e (CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub>) thin films by ultrafast transient absorption microscopy, demonstrating three distinct transport regimes. Quasiballistic transport was observed to correlate with excess kinetic energy, resulting in up to 230 nanometers transport distance that could overcome grain boundaries. The nonequilibrium transport persisted over tens of picoseconds and ~600 nanometers before reaching the diffusive transport limit. These results suggest potential applications of hot-carrier devices based on hybrid perovskites.</p>

A chemical biology route to site-specific authentic protein modifications
<p>Many essential biological processes are controlled by posttranslational protein modifications. The inability to synthetically attain the diversity enabled by these modifications limits functional studies of many proteins. We designed a three-step approach for installing authentic posttranslational modifications in recombinant proteins. We first use the established <i>O</i>-phosphoserine (Sep) orthogonal translation system to create a Sep-containing recombinant protein. The Sep residue is then dephosphorylated to dehydroalanine (Dha). Last, conjugate addition of alkyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">iodid</span></strong>es to Dha, promoted by zinc and copper, enables chemoselective carbon-carbon bond formation. To validate our approach, we produced histone H3, ubiquitin, and green fluorescent protein variants with site-specific modifications, including different methylations of H3K79. The methylated histones stimulate transcription through histone acetylation. This approach offers a powerful tool to engineer diverse designer proteins.</p>

Singlet Oxygen Plays an Essential Role in the Root’s Response to Osmotic Stress
<p>The high osmotic potentials in plants subjected to drought stress can be mimicked by the application of high molecular weight polyethylene glycol. Here, we quantified the effects of exposure to polyethylene glycol on the growth of the main and lateral roots of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings. The effects on root growth were highly correlated with the appearance of singlet oxygen, as visualized using the singlet oxygen-specific probe singlet oxygen sensor green. The production of singlet oxygen was followed by cell death, as indicated by the intracellular accumulation of propidium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">iodid</span></strong>e due to the loss of membrane integrity. Cell death began in the epidermal region of the root tip and spread in a dynamic manner to meristematic sections. In parallel, gene expression changes specific to the presence of singlet oxygen were observed. The accumulation of other reactive oxygen species, namely hydrogen, peroxide, nitric oxide, and superoxide, did not correlate with cell death. In addition, both the singlet oxygen scavenger His and the lipoxygenase inhibitor salicylhydroxamic acid specifically inhibited singlet oxygen accumulation and cell death. These results suggest a light-independent, type-I source of singlet oxygen production. Serpin-protease interactions were used as a model to assess the possibility of vacuolar-type cell death. Osmotic stress induced the accumulation of complexes between the cytoplasmic serpin AtSERPIN1 and its cognate vacuolar proteases, indicating that vacuolar integrity was compromised. These findings imply that singlet oxygen plays an essential role in conveying the root response to osmotic stress.</p>

Glutathione Transferase U13 Functions in Pathogen-Triggered Glucosinolate Metabolism<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Glutathione (GSH) and indole glucosinolates (IGs) exert key functions in the immune system of the model plant Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Appropriate GSH levels are important for execution of both pre- and postinvasive disease resistance mechanisms to invasive pathogens, whereas an intact PENETRATION2 (PEN2)-pathway for IG metabolism is essential for preinvasive resistance in this species. Earlier indirect evidence suggested that the latter pathway involves conjugation of GSH with unstable products of IG metabolism and further processing of the resulting adducts to biologically active molecules. Here we describe the identification of Glutathione-<i>S</i>-Transferase class-tau member 13 (GSTU13) as an indispensable component of the PEN2 immune pathway for IG metabolism. <i>gstu13</i> mutant plants are defective in the pathogen-triggered biosynthesis of end products of the PEN2 pathway, including 4-O-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosyl-indol-3-yl formamide, indole-3-ylmethyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>e, and raphanusamic acid. In line with this metabolic defect, lack of functional GSTU13 results in enhanced disease susceptibility toward several fungal pathogens including <i>Erysiphe pisi</i>, <i>Colletotrichum gloeosporioides</i>, and <i>Plectosphaerella cucumerina</i>. Seedlings of <i>gstu13</i> plants fail also to deposit the (1,3)-β-glucan cell wall polymer, callose, after recognition of the bacterial flg22 epitope. We show that GSTU13 mediates specifically the role of GSH in IG metabolism without noticeable impact on other immune functions of this tripeptide. We postulate that GSTU13 connects GSH with the pathogen-triggered PEN2 pathway for IG metabolism to deliver metabolites that may have numerous functions in the innate immune system of Arabidopsis.</p>

A Key Role for Apoplastic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in Norway Spruce Phenolic Metabolism
<p>Apoplastic events such as monolignol oxidation and lignin polymerization are difficult to study in intact trees. To investigate the role of apoplastic hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) in gymnosperm phenolic metabolism, an extracellular lignin-forming cell culture of Norway spruce (<i>Picea abies</i>) was used as a research model. Scavenging of apoplastic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by potassium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">iodid</span></strong>e repressed lignin formation, in line with peroxidases activating monolignols for lignin polymerization. Time-course analyses coupled to candidate substrate-product pair network propagation revealed differential accumulation of low-molecular-weight phenolics, including (glycosylated) oligolignols, (glycosylated) flavonoids, and proanthocyanidins, in lignin-forming and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-scavenging cultures and supported that monolignols are oxidatively coupled not only in the cell wall but also in the cytoplasm, where they are coupled to other monolignols and proanthocyanidins. Dilignol glycoconjugates with reduced structures were found in the culture medium, suggesting that cells are able to transport glycosylated dilignols to the apoplast. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that scavenging of apoplastic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> resulted in remodulation of the transcriptome, with reduced carbon flux into the shikimate pathway propagating down to monolignol biosynthesis. Aggregated coexpression network analysis identified candidate enzymes and transcription factors for monolignol oxidation and apoplastic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production in addition to potential H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> receptors. The results presented indicate that the redox state of the apoplast has a profound influence on cellular metabolism.</p>

Acyl-CoA:Lysophosphatidylethanolamine Acyltransferase Activity Regulates Growth of Arabidopsis
<p>Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) contains two enzymes (encoded by the <i>At1g80950</i> and <i>At2g45670</i> genes) preferentially acylating lysophosphatidylethanol<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>e (LPE) with acyl-coenzyme A (CoA), designated LYSOPHOSPHATIDYLETHANOL<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>E ACYLTRANSFERASE1 (LPEAT1) and LPEAT2. The transfer DNA insertion mutant lpeat2 and the double mutant lpeat1 lpeat2 showed impaired growth, smaller leaves, shorter roots, less seed setting, and reduced lipid content per fresh weight in roots and seeds and large increases in LPE and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) contents in leaves. Microsomal preparations from leaves of these mutants showed around 70% decrease in acylation activity of LPE with 16:0-CoA compared with wild-type membranes, whereas the acylation with 18:1-CoA was much less affected, demonstrating that other lysophospholipid acyltransferases than the two LPEATs could acylate LPE. The above-mentioned effects were less pronounced in the single lpeat1 mutant. Overexpression of either LPEAT1 or LPEAT2 under the control of the 35S promotor led to morphological changes opposite to what was seen in the transfer DNA mutants. Acyl specificity studies showed that LPEAT1 utilized 16:0-CoA at the highest rate of 11 tested acyl-CoAs, whereas LPEAT2 utilized 20:0-CoA as the best acyl donor. Both LPEATs could acylate either <i>sn</i> position of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ether</span></strong> analogs of LPC. The data show that the activities of LPEAT1 and LPEAT2 are, in a complementary way, involved in growth regulation in Arabidopsis. It is shown that LPEAT activity (especially LPEAT2) is essential for maintaining adequate levels of phosphatidylethanol<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>e, LPE, and LPC in the cells.</p>

Nitrite and <i>S</i>-Nitrosohemoglobin Exchange Across the Human Cerebral and Femoral Circulation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The mechanisms underlying red blood cell (RBC)–mediated hypoxic vasodilation remain controversial, with separate roles for nitrite ([Formula]) and <i>S</i>-nitrosohemoglobin (SNO-Hb) widely contested given their ability to transduce nitric oxide bioactivity within the microcirculation. To establish their relative contribution in vivo, we quantified arterial-venous concentration gradients across the human cerebral and femoral circulation at rest and during exercise, an ideal model system characterized by physiological extremes of O<sub>2</sub> tension and blood flow.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Ten healthy participants (5 men, 5 women) aged 24±4 (mean±SD) years old were randomly assigned to a normoxic (21% O<sub>2</sub>) and hypoxic (10% O<sub>2</sub>) trial with measurements performed at rest and after 30 minutes of cycling at 70% of maximal power output in hypoxia and equivalent relative and absolute intensities in normoxia. Blood was sampled simultaneously from the brachial artery and internal jugular and femoral veins with plasma and RBC nitric oxide metabolites measured by tri-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">iodid</span></strong>e reductive chemiluminescence. Blood flow was determined by transcranial Doppler ultrasound (cerebral blood flow) and constant infusion thermodilution (femoral blood flow) with net exchange calculated via the Fick principle.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Hypoxia was associated with a mild increase in both cerebral blood flow and femoral blood flow (<i>P</i><0.05 versus normoxia) with further, more pronounced increases observed in femoral blood flow during exercise (<i>P</i><0.05 versus rest) in proportion to the reduction in RBC oxygenation (<i>r</i>=0.680–0.769, <i>P</i><0.001). Plasma [Formula] gradients reflecting consumption (arterial>venous; <i>P</i><0.05) were accompanied by RBC iron nitrosylhemoglobin formation (venous>arterial; <i>P</i><0.05) at rest in normoxia, during hypoxia (<i>P</i><0.05 versus normoxia), and especially during exercise (<i>P</i><0.05 versus rest), with the most pronounced gradients observed across the bioenergetically more active, hypoxemic, and acidotic femoral circulation (<i>P</i><0.05 versus cerebral).

Plasma Lipidomic Profiles Improve on Traditional Risk Factors for the Prediction of Cardiovascular Events in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Clinical lipid measurements do not show the full complexity of the altered lipid metabolism associated with diabetes mellitus or cardiovascular disease. Lipidomics enables the assessment of hundreds of lipid species as potential markers for disease risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Plasma lipid species (310) were measured by a targeted lipidomic analysis with liquid chromatography electrospray ionization–tandem mass spectrometry on a case-cohort (n=3779) subset from the ADVANCE trial (Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron-MR Controlled Evaluation). The case-cohort was 61% male with a mean age of 67 years. All participants had type 2 diabetes mellitus with ≥1 additional cardiovascular risk factors, and 35% had a history of macrovascular disease. Weighted Cox regression was used to identify lipid species associated with future cardiovascular events (nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and cardiovascular death) and cardiovascular death during a 5-year follow-up period. Multivariable models combining traditional risk factors with lipid species were optimized with the Akaike information criteria. C statistics and NRIs were calculated within a 5-fold cross-validation framework.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Sphingolipids, phospholipids (including lyso- and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ether</span></strong>- species), cholesteryl esters, and glycerolipids were associated with future cardiovascular events and cardiovascular death. The addition of 7 lipid species to a base model (14 traditional risk factors and medications) to predict cardiovascular events increased the C statistic from 0.680 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.678–0.682) to 0.700 (95% CI, 0.698–0.702; <i>P</i><0.0001) with a corresponding continuous NRI of 0.227 (95% CI, 0.219–0.235). The prediction of cardiovascular death was improved with the incorporation of 4 lipid species into the base model, showing an increase in the C statistic from 0.740 (95% CI, 0.738–0.742) to 0.760 (95% CI, 0.757–0.762; <i>P</i><0.0001) and a continuous net reclassification index of 0.328 (95% CI, 0.317–0.339).

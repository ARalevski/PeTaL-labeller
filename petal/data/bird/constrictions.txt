Partitioning of vessel resistivity in three liana species
<p>Vessels with simple perforation plates, found in the majority of angiosperms, are considered the evolutionarily most advanced conduits, least <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imped</span></strong>ing the xylem sap flow. Nevertheless, when measured, their hydraulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ivity (<i>R</i>, i.e., inverse value of hydraulic conductivity) is significantly higher than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ivity predicted using Hagen–Poiseuille equation (<i>R</i><sub>HP</sub>). In our study we aimed (i) to quantify two basic components of the total vessel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ivity – vessel lumen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ivity and end wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ivity, and (ii) to analyze how the variable inner diameter of the vessel along its longitudinal axis affects <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ivity. We measured flow rates through progressively shortened stems of hop (<i>Humulus lupulus</i> L.), grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i> L.), and clematis (<i>Clematis vitalba</i> L.) and used elastomer injection for identification of open vessels and for measurement of changing vessel inner diameters along its axis. The relative contribution of end wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ivity to total vessel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ivity was 0.46 for hop, 0.55 for grapevine, and 0.30 for clematis. Vessel lumen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ivity calculated from our measurements was substantially higher than theoretical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ivity – about 43% for hop, 58% for grapevine, and 52% for clematis. We identified variation in the vessel inner diameter as an important source of vessel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ivity. The coefficient of variation of vessel inner diameter was a good predictor for the increase of the ratio of integral <i>R</i><sub>HP</sub> to <i>R</i><sub>HP</sub> calculated from the mean value of inner vessel diameter. We discuss the fact that we dealt with the longest vessels in a given stem sample, which may lead to the overestimation of vessel lumen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ivity, which consequently precludes decision whether the variable vessel inner diameter explains fully the difference between vessel lumen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ivity and <i>R</i><sub>HP</sub> we observed.</p>

The Wheat <i>Lr67</i> Gene from the Sugar Transport Protein 13 Family Confers Multipathogen Resistance in Barley
<p>Fungal pathogens are a major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">constraint</span></strong> to global crop production; hence, plant genes encoding pathogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance are important tools for combating disease. A few <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance genes identified to date provide partial, durable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to multiple pathogens and the wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) Lr67 hexose transporter variant (Lr67res) fits into this category. Two amino acids differ between the wild-type and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant alleles – G144R and V387L. Exome sequence data from 267 barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) landraces and wild accessions was screened and neither of the Lr67res mutations was detected. The barley ortholog of Lr67, HvSTP13, was functionally characterized in yeast as a high affinity hexose transporter. The G144R mutation was introduced into HvSTP13 and abolished Glc uptake, whereas the V387L mutation reduced Glc uptake by ∼ 50%. Glc transport by HvSTP13 heterologously expressed in yeast was reduced when coexpressed with <i>Lr67res</i>. Stable transgenic <i>Lr67res</i> barley lines exhibited seedling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to the barley-specific pathogens <i>Puccinia hordei</i> and <i>Blumeria graminis</i> f. sp. <i>hordei</i>, which cause leaf rust and powdery mildew, respectively. Barley plants expressing <i>Lr67res</i> exhibited early senescence and higher pathogenesis-related (<i>PR</i>) gene expression. Unlike previous observations implicating flavonoids in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance of transgenic sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>) expressing <i>Lr34res</i>, another wheat multipathogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance gene, barley flavonoids are unlikely to have a role in Lr67res-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. Similar to observations made in yeast, Lr67res reduced Glc uptake <i>in planta</i>. These results confirm that the pathway by which <i>Lr67res</i> confers <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to fungal pathogens is conserved between wheat and barley.</p>

Systematic Mutagenesis of Serine Hydroxymethyltransferase Reveals an Essential Role in Nematode Resistance
<p><i>Rhg4</i> is a major genetic locus that contributes to soybean cyst nematode (SCN) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in the Peking-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance of soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>), which also requires the <i>rhg1</i> gene. By map-based cloning and functional genomic approaches, we previously showed that the <i>Rhg4</i> gene encodes a predicted cytosolic serine hydroxymethyltransferase (GmSHMT08); however, the novel gain of function of <i>GmSHMT08</i> in SCN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance remains to be characterized. Using a forward genetic screen, we identified an allelic series of <i>GmSHMT08</i> mutants that shed new light on the mechanistic aspects of <i>GmSHMT08</i>-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. The new mutants provide compelling genetic evidence that Peking-type <i>rhg1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in cv Forrest is fully dependent on the <i>GmSHMT08</i> gene and demonstrates that this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance is mechanistically different from the PI 88788-type of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance that only requires <i>rhg1</i>. We also demonstrated that <i>rhg1-a</i> from cv Forrest, although required, does not exert selection pressure on the nematode to shift from HG type 7, which further validates the bigenic nature of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. Mapping of the identified mutations onto the SHMT structural model uncovered key residues for structural stability, ligand binding, enzyme activity, and protein interactions, suggesting that GmSHMT08 has additional functions aside from its main enzymatic role in SCN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. Lastly, we demonstrate the functionality of the <i>GmSHMT08</i> SCN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance gene in a transgenic soybean plant.</p>

OsSYP121 Accumulates at Fungal Penetration Sites and Mediates Host Resistance to Rice Blast
<p><i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> is a fungal pathogen that causes rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) blast. SNAREs (soluble <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) are key components in vesicle trafficking in eukaryotic cells and are known to contribute to fungal pathogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. Syntaxin of Plants121 (SYP121), a Qa-SNARE, has been reported to function in nonhost <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). However, the functions of SYP121 in host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to rice blast are largely unknown. Here, we report that the rice SYP121 protein, OsSYP121, accumulates at fungal penetration sites and mediates host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to rice blast. OsSYP121 is plasma membrane localized and its expression was obviously induced by the rice blast in both the blast-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant rice landrace Heikezijing and the blast-susceptible landrace Suyunuo (Su). Overexpression of <i>OsSYP121</i> in Su resulted in enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to blast. Knockdown of <i>OsSYP121</i> expression in Su resulted in a more susceptible phenotype. However, knockdown of <i>OsSYP121</i> expression in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant landrace Heikezijing resulted in susceptibility to the blast fungus. The <i>P<sub>OsSYP121</sub></i>::GFP-OsSYP121 accumulated at rice blast penetration sites in transgenic rice, as observed by confocal microscopy. Yeast two-hybrid results showed that OsSYP121 can interact with OsSNAP32 (Synaptosome-associated protein of 32 kD) and Vesicle-associated membrane protein714/724. The interaction between OsSYP121 and OsSNAP32 may contribute to host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to rice blast. Our study reveals that OsSYP121 plays an important role in rice blast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance as it is a key component in vesicle trafficking.</p>

Sequence Exchange between Homologous NB-LRR Genes Converts Virus Resistance into Nematode Resistance, and Vice Versa
<p>Plants have evolved a limited repertoire of NB-LRR disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance (<i>R</i>) genes to protect themselves against myriad pathogens. This limitation is thought to be counterbalanced by the rapid evolution of NB-LRR proteins, as only a few sequence changes have been shown to be sufficient to alter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance specificities toward novel strains of a pathogen. However, little is known about the flexibility of NB-LRR <i>R</i> genes to switch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance specificities between phylogenetically unrelated pathogens. To investigate this, we created domain swaps between the close homologs <i>Gpa2</i> and <i>Rx1</i>, which confer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>) to the cyst nematode <i>Globodera pallida</i> and <i>Potato virus X</i>, respectively. The genetic fusion of the CC-NB-ARC of Gpa2 with the LRR of Rx1 (Gpa2<sub>CN</sub>/Rx1<sub>L</sub>) results in autoactivity, but lowering the protein levels restored its specific activation response, including extreme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to <i>Potato virus X</i> in potato shoots. The reciprocal chimera (Rx1<sub>CN</sub>/Gpa2<sub>L</sub>) shows a loss-of-function phenotype, but exchange of the first three LRRs of Gpa2 by the corresponding region of Rx1 was sufficient to regain a wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance response to <i>G. pallida</i> in the roots. These data demonstrate that exchanging the recognition moiety in the LRR is sufficient to convert extreme virus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in the leaves into mild nematode <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in the roots, and vice versa. In addition, we show that the CC-NB-ARC can operate independently of the recognition specificities defined by the LRR domain, either aboveground or belowground. These data show the versatility of NB-LRR genes to generate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to unrelated pathogens with completely different lifestyles and routes of invasion.</p>

Reversion of antibiotic resistance in <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> by spiroisoxazoline SMARt-420
<p>Antibiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance is one of the biggest threats to human health globally. Alarmingly, multidrug-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant and extensively drug-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> have now spread worldwide. Some key antituberculosis antibiotics are prodrugs, for which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance mechanisms are mainly driven by mutations in the bacterial enzymatic pathway required for their bioactivation. We have developed drug-like molecules that activate a cryptic alternative bioactivation pathway of ethionamide in <i>M. tuberculosis</i>, circumventing the classic activation pathway in which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance mutations have now been observed. The first-of-its-kind molecule, named SMARt-420 (Small Molecule Aborting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance), not only fully reverses ethionamide-acquired <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance and clears ethionamide-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant infection in mice, it also increases the basal sensitivity of bacteria to ethionamide.</p>

Epigenetic regulation of antagonistic receptors confers rice blast resistance with yield balance
<p>Crop breeding aims to balance disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance with yield; however, single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance (R) genes can lead to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance breakdown, and R gene pyramiding may affect growth fitness. Here we report that the rice <i>Pigm</i> locus contains a cluster of genes encoding nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptors that confer durable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to the fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> without yield penalty. Among these NLR receptors, PigmR confers broad-spectrum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance, whereas PigmS competitively attenuates PigmR homodimerization to suppress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. <i>PigmS</i> expression, and thus <i>PigmR</i>-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance, are subjected to tight epigenetic regulation. <i>PigmS</i> increases seed production to counteract the yield cost induced by <i>PigmR</i>. Therefore, our study reveals a mechanism balancing high disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance and yield through epigenetic regulation of paired antagonistic NLR receptors, providing a tool to develop elite crop varieties.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
A Cytosolic Triosephosphate Isomerase Is a Key Component in XA3/XA26-Mediated Resistance
<p>Bacterial blight caused by <i>Xanthomonas oryzae</i> pv <i>oryzae</i> (<i>Xoo</i>) causes severe damage to rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) production worldwide. The major disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance gene, <i>Xa3/Xa26</i>, confers broad-spectrum and durable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to <i>Xoo</i> at both seedling and adult stages. However, the molecular mechanism of the <i>Xa3/Xa26</i>-initiated defense pathway against <i>Xoo</i> is still largely unknown. Here, we show that a triosephosphate isomerase (TPI), OsTPI1.1, is a key component in XA3/XA26-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to <i>Xoo</i>. OsTPI1.1 is a glycolytic enzyme that catalyzes the reversible interconversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. Transcriptional suppression of <i>OsTPI1.1</i> in plants harboring <i>Xa3/Xa26</i> largely impaired the XA3/XA26-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to <i>Xoo</i>, and constitutive overexpression of <i>OsTPI1.1</i> in susceptible rice plants without <i>Xa3/Xa26</i> only slightly decreased the susceptibility to <i>Xoo</i>. Therefore, both XA3/XA26 and OsTPI1.1 are required in XA3/XA26-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. We show that OsTPI1.1 participates in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance through its enzymatic activity, which was enhanced significantly by its binding with XA3/XA26. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), especially hydrogen peroxide, accumulated in the OsTPI1.1-overexpressing plants, and suppression of <i>OsTPI1.1</i> decreased ROS accumulation. The changes in ROS are associated with the reduction of NADP<sup>+</sup> to NADPH, which may act as a redox cofactor to scavenge ROS, leading to reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to <i>Xoo</i>. These results suggest that OsTPI1.1 modulates ROS production as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance mechanism against <i>Xoo</i>.</p>

Abscisic Acid Induces Resistance against <i>Bamboo Mosaic Virus</i> through <i>Argonaute</i> <i>2</i> and <i>3</i>
<p>Plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to pathogens is tuned by defense-related hormones. Of these, abscisic acid (ABA) is well documented to moderate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance against fungi and bacteria. However, ABA’s contribution to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance against viruses is pleiotropic. ABA affects callose deposition at plasmodesmata (therefore hindering the viral cell-to-cell movement), but here, we show that when callose synthase is down-regulated, ABA still induces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance against infection with <i>Bamboo mosaic virus</i> (BaMV). By examining the potential connections between the ABA and RNA-silencing pathways in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), we showed that ABA regulates the expression of almost the whole ARGONAUTE (AGO) gene family, of which some are required for plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance against BaMV. Our data show that BaMV infection and ABA treatment regulate the same set of AGOs, with positive effects on <i>AGO1</i>, <i>AGO2</i>, and <i>AGO3</i>, no effect on <i>AGO7</i>, and negative effects on <i>AGO4</i> and <i>AGO10</i>. The BaMV-mediated regulation of <i>AGO1</i>, <i>AGO2</i>, and <i>AGO3</i> is ABA dependent, because the accumulation of these <i>AGOs</i> in BaMV-infected ABA mutants did not reach the levels observed in infected wild-type plants. In addition, the <i>AGO1</i>-<i>miR168a</i> complex is dispensable for BaMV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance, while <i>AGO2</i> and <i>AGO3</i> were important for ABA-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. While most <i>ago</i> mutants showed increased susceptibility to BaMV infection (except <i>ago10</i>), <i>ago1-27</i> showed reduced BaMV titers, which was attributed to the up-regulated levels of <i>AGO2</i>, <i>AGO3</i>, and <i>AGO4</i>. We have established that ABA regulates the expression of several members of the AGO family, and this regulation partially contributes to ABA-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance against BaMV. These findings reveal another role for ABA in plants.</p>

Mode of action of a <i>Drosophila</i> FMRFamide in inducing muscle contraction
<p><i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> is a model system for examining the mechanisms of action of neuropeptides. DPKQDFMRFamide was previously shown to induce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ions in <i>Drosophila</i> body wall muscle fibres in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner. The present study examined the possible involvement of a G-protein-coupled receptor and second messengers in mediating this myotropic effect after removal of the central nervous system. DPKQDFMRFamide-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ions were reduced by 70% and 90%, respectively, in larvae with reduced expression of the <i>Drosophila Fmrf</i> receptor (FR) either ubiquitously or specifically in muscle tissue, compared with the response in control larvae in which expression was not manipulated. No such effect occurred in larvae with reduced expression of this gene only in neurons. The myogenic effects of DPKQDFMRFamide do not appear to be mediated through either of the two <i>Drosophila</i> myosuppressin receptors (<i>DmsR-1</i> and <i>DmsR-2</i>). DPKQDFMRFamide-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ions were not reduced in Ala1 transgenic flies lacking activity of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CamKII), and were not affected by the CaMKII inhibitor KN-93. Peptide-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ions in the mutants of the phospholipase C-β (<i>PLC</i>β) gene (<i>norpA</i> larvae) and in IP<sub>3</sub> receptor mutants were similar to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ions elicited in control larvae. The peptide failed to increase cAMP and cGMP levels in <i>Drosophila</i> body wall muscles. Peptide-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ions were not potentiated by 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, and were not antagonized by inhibitors of cAMP-dependent or cGMP-dependent protein kinases. Additionally, exogenous application of arachidonic acid failed to induce myogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ions. Thus, DPKQDFMRFamide induces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ions via a G-protein coupled FMRFamide receptor in muscle cells but does not appear to act via cAMP, cGMP, IP<sub>3</sub>, PLC, CaMKII or arachidonic acid.</p>

Prospective Study of Adenosine on Atrioventricular Nodal Conduction in Pediatric and Young Adult Patients After Heart Transplantation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Supraventricular tachycardia is common after heart transplantation. Adenosine, the standard therapy for treating supraventricular tachycardia in children and adults without transplantation, is relatively contraindicated after transplantation because of a presumed risk of prolonged atrioventricular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">block</span></strong> in denervated hearts.

Developmental phosphoproteomics identifies the kinase CK2 as a driver of Hedgehog signaling and a therapeutic target in medulloblastoma
<p>A major limitation of targeted cancer therapy is the rapid emergence of drug <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance, which often arises through mutations at or downstream of the drug target or through intrinsic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance of subpopulations of tumor cells. Medulloblastoma (MB), the most common pediatric brain tumor, is no exception, and MBs that are driven by sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling are particularly aggressive and drug-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant. To find new drug targets and therapeutics for MB that may be less susceptible to common <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance mechanisms, we used a developmental phosphoproteomics approach in murine granule neuron precursors (GNPs), the developmental cell of origin of MB. The protein kinase CK2 emerged as a driver of hundreds of phosphorylation events during the proliferative, MB-like stage of GNP growth, including the phosphorylation of three of the eight proteins commonly amplified in MB. CK2 was critical to the stabilization and activity of the transcription factor GLI2, a late downstream effector in SHH signaling. CK2 inhibitors decreased the viability of primary SHH-type MB patient cells in culture and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">block</span></strong>ed the growth of murine MB tumors that were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant to currently available Hh inhibitors, thereby extending the survival of tumor-bearing mice. Because of structural interactions, one CK2 inhibitor (CX-4945) inhibited both wild-type and mutant CK2, indicating that this drug may avoid at least one common mode of acquired <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. These findings suggest that CK2 inhibitors may be effective for treating patients with MB and show how phosphoproteomics may be used to gain insight into developmental biology and pathology.</p>

Atmospheric blocking as a traffic jam in the jet stream
<p>Atmospheric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">block</span></strong>ing due to anomalous, persistent meandering of the jet stream often causes weather extremes in the mid-latitudes. Despite the ubiquity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">block</span></strong>ing, the onset mechanism is not well understood. Here we demonstrate a close analogy between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">block</span></strong>ing and traffic congestion on a highway by using meteorological data and show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">block</span></strong>ing and traffic congestion can be described by a common mathematical theory. The theory predicts that the jet stream has a capacity for the flux of wave activity (a measure of meandering), just as the highway has traffic capacity, and when the capacity is exceeded, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">block</span></strong>ing manifests as congestion. Stationary waves modulate the jet stream’s capacity for transient waves and localize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">block</span></strong> formation.

Antibiotic tolerance facilitates the evolution of resistance
<p>Controlled experimental evolution during antibiotic treatment can help to explain the processes leading to antibiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in bacteria. Recently, intermittent antibiotic exposures have been shown to lead rapidly to the evolution of tolerance—that is, the ability to survive under treatment without developing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. However, whether tolerance delays or promotes the eventual emergence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance is unclear. Here we used in vitro evolution experiments to explore this question. We found that in all cases, tolerance preceded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. A mathematical population-genetics model showed how tolerance boosts the chances for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance mutations to spread in the population. Thus, tolerance mutations pave the way for the rapid subsequent evolution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. Preventing the evolution of tolerance may offer a new strategy for delaying the emergence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance.</p>

12-Oxo-Phytodienoic Acid Acts as a Regulator of Maize Defense against Corn Leaf Aphid
<p>The corn leaf aphid (CLA; <i>Rhopalosiphum maidis</i>) is a phloem sap-sucking insect that attacks many cereal crops, including maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). We previously showed that the maize inbred line Mp708, which was developed by classical plant breeding, provides enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to CLA. Here, using electrophysiological monitoring of aphid feeding behavior, we demonstrate that Mp708 provides phloem-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to CLA. Furthermore, feeding by CLA on Mp708 plants enhanced callose deposition, a potential defense mechanism utilized by plants to limit aphid feeding and subsequent colonization. In maize, benzoxazinoids (BX) or BX-derived metabolites contribute to enhanced callose deposition by providing heightened <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to CLA. However, BX and BX-derived metabolites were not significantly altered in CLA-infested Mp708 plants, indicating BX-independent defense against CLA. Evidence presented here suggests that the constitutively higher levels of 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA) in Mp708 plants contributed to enhanced callose accumulation and heightened CLA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. OPDA enhanced the expression of ethylene biosynthesis and receptor genes, and the synergistic interactions of OPDA and CLA feeding significantly induced the expression of the transcripts encoding Maize insect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance1-Cysteine Protease, a key defensive protein against insect pests, in Mp708 plants. Furthermore, exogenous application of OPDA on maize jasmonic acid-deficient plants caused enhanced callose accumulation and heightened <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to CLA, suggesting that the OPDA-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to CLA is independent of the jasmonic acid pathway. We further demonstrate that the signaling function of OPDA, rather than a direct toxic effect, contributes to enhanced CLA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in Mp708.</p>

Two Chloroplast Proteins Suppress Drought Resistance by Affecting ROS Production in Guard Cells
<p>Chloroplast as the site for photosynthesis is an essential organelle in plants, but little is known about its role in stomatal regulation and drought <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. In this study, we show that two chloroplastic proteins essential for thylakoid formation negatively regulate drought <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). By screening a mutant pool with T-DNA insertions in nuclear genes encoding chloroplastic proteins, we identified an <i>HCF106</i> knockdown mutant exhibiting increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to drought stress. The <i>hcf106</i> mutant displayed elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in guard cells, improved stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e, and reduced water loss under drought conditions. The HCF106 protein was found to physically interact with THF1, a previously identified chloroplastic protein crucial for thylakoid formation. The <i>thf1</i> mutant phenotypically resembled the <i>hcf106</i> mutant and displayed more ROS accumulation in guard cells, increased stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e, reduced water loss, and drought <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant phenotypes compared to the wild type. The <i>hcf106thf1</i> double mutant behaved similarly as the <i>thf1</i> single mutant. These results suggest that HCF106 and THF1 form a complex to modulate chloroplast function and that the complex is important for ROS production in guard cells and stomatal control in response to environmental stresses. Our results also suggest that modulating chloroplastic proteins could be a way for improving drought <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in crops.</p>

SOCE mediated by STIM and Orai is essential for pacemaker activity in the interstitial cells of Cajal in the gastrointestinal tract
<p>Electrical pacemaker activity generates phasic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contract</span></strong>ions and motility patterns such as segmentation and peristalsis in the gastrointestinal tract. Pacemaker currents are generated in interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), which release Ca<sup>2+</sup> from intracellular stores that stimulates Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>−</sup> channels (CaCCs) in the plasma membrane. Thus, Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores must be maintained to sustain pacemaker activity. Store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (SOCE) facilitates the refilling of Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores by a mechanism dependent upon interactions between STIM and Orai proteins. We investigated the role of SOCE in ICC pacemaker activity. Reintroduction of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in store-depleted ICC resulted in CaCC activation. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">block</span></strong>ing CaCCs revealed an inwardly rectifying current with properties of a Ca<sup>2+</sup> release–activated current (<i>I</i><sub>CRAC</sub>).

Mapping the malaria parasite druggable genome by using in vitro evolution and chemogenomics
<p>Chemogenetic characterization through in vitro evolution combined with whole-genome analysis can identify antimalarial drug targets and drug-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance genes. We performed a genome analysis of 262 <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> parasites <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant to 37 diverse compounds. We found 159 gene amplifications and 148 nonsynonymous changes in 83 genes associated with drug-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance acquisition, where gene amplifications contributed to one-third of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance acquisition events.

Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Phosphatases Affect UV-B-Induced Stomatal Closure via Controlling NO in Guard Cells
<p>Ultraviolet B (UV-B) radiation induces the activation of MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE PHOSPHATASE1 (MKP1) and its targets MPK3 and MPK6, but whether they participate in UV-B guard cell signaling is not clear. Here, evidence shows that UV-B-induced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) is antagonistically regulated by MKP1 and MPK6 via modulating hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)-induced nitric oxide (NO) production in guard cells. The <i>mkp1</i> mutant was hypersensitive to UV-B-induced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e and NO production in guard cells but not to UV-B-induced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production, suggesting that MKP1 negatively regulates UV-B-induced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e via inhibiting NO generation in guard cells. Moreover, MPK3 and MPK6 were activated by UV-B in leaves of the wild type and hyperactivated in the <i>mkp1</i> mutant, but the UV-B-induced activation of MPK3 and MPK6 was largely inhibited in mutants for <i>ATRBOHD</i> and <i>ATRBOHF</i> but not in mutants for <i>NIA1</i> and <i>NIA2</i>. <i>mpk6</i> mutants showed defects of UV-B-induced NO production and stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e but were normal in UV-B-induced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production, while stomata of <i>mpk3</i> mutants responded to UV-B just like those of the wild type. The defect of UV-B-induced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e in <i>mpk6</i> mutants was rescued by exogenous NO but not by exogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Furthermore, double mutant <i>mkp1</i>/<i>mpk6</i> and the single mutant <i>mpk6</i> showed the same responses to UV-B in terms of either stomatal movement or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and NO production. These data indicate that MPK6, but not MPK3, positively regulates UV-B-induced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e via acting downstream of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and upstream of NO, while MKP1 functions negatively in UV-B guard cell signaling via down-regulation of MPK6.</p>

Evolutionary Dynamics of Abundant Stop Codon Readthrough
<p>Translational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stop</span></strong> codon readthrough emerged as a major regulatory mechanism affecting hundreds of genes in animal genomes, based on recent comparative genomics and ribosomal profiling evidence, but its evolutionary properties remain unknown. Here, we leverage comparative genomic evidence across 21 <i>Anopheles</i> mosquitoes to systematically annotate readthrough genes in the malaria vector <i>Anopheles gambiae</i>, and to provide the first study of abundant readthrough evolution, by comparison with 20 <i>Drosophila</i> species. Using improved comparative genomics methods for detecting readthrough, we identify evolutionary signatures of conserved, functional readthrough of 353 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stop</span></strong> codons in the malaria vector, <i>Anopheles gambiae</i>, and of 51 additional <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stop</span></strong> codons, including several cases of double and triple readthrough and of readthrough of two adjacent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stop</span></strong> codons. We find that most differences between the readthrough repertoires of the two species arose from readthrough gain or loss in existing genes, rather than birth of new genes or gene death; that readthrough-associated RNA structures are sometimes gained or lost while readthrough persists; that readthrough is more likely to be lost at TAA and TAG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stop</span></strong> codons; and that readthrough is under continued purifying evolutionary selection in mosquito, based on population genetic evidence. We also determine readthrough-associated gene properties that predate readthrough, and identify differences in the characteristic properties of readthrough genes between clades. We estimate more than 600 functional readthrough <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stop</span></strong> codons in mosquito and 900 in fruit fly, provide evidence of readthrough control of peroxisomal targeting, and refine the phylogenetic extent of abundant readthrough as following divergence from centipede.</p>

Recovery performance in xylem hydraulic conductivity is correlated with cavitation resistance for temperate deciduous tree species
<p>Woody species hydraulically vulnerable to xylem cavitation may experience daily xylem embolism. How such species cope with the possibility of accumulated embolism is unclear. In this study, we examined seven temperate woody species to assess the hypothesis that low cavitation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance (high vulnerability to cavitation) is compensated by high recovery performance via vessel refilling. We also evaluated leaf functional and xylem structural traits. The xylem recovery index (XRI), defined as the ratio of xylem hydraulic conductivity in plants rewatered after soil drought to that in plants under moist conditions, varied among species. The xylem water potential causing 50% loss of hydraulic conductivity (Ψ<sub>50</sub>) varied among the species studied, whereas only a slight difference was detected with respect to midday xylem water potential (Ψ<sub>min</sub>), indicating smaller hydraulic safety margins (Ψ<sub>min</sub> − Ψ<sub>50</sub>) for species more vulnerable to cavitation. Cavitation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance (|Ψ<sub>50</sub>|) was negatively correlated with XRI across species, with cavitation-vulnerable species showing a higher performance in xylem recovery. Wood density was positively correlated with cavitation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance and was negatively correlated with XRI. These novel results reveal that coordination exists between cavitation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance and xylem recovery performance, in association with wood functional traits such as denser wood for cavitation-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant xylem and less-dense but water-storable wood for refillable xylem. These findings provide insights into long-term maintenance of water transport in tree species growing under variable environmental conditions.</p>

Skp2-dependent reactivation of AKT drives resistance to PI3K inhibitors
<p>The PI3K-AKT kinase signaling pathway is frequently deregulated in human cancers, particularly breast cancer, where amplification and somatic mutations of <i>PIK3CA</i> occur with high frequency in patients. Numerous small-molecule inhibitors targeting both PI3K and AKT are under clinical evaluation, but dose-limiting toxicities and the emergence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance limit therapeutic efficacy. Various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance mechanisms to PI3K inhibitors have been identified, including de novo mutations, feedback activation of AKT, or cross-talk pathways. We found a previously unknown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance mechanism to PI3K pathway inhibition that results in AKT rebound activation. In a subset of triple-negative breast cancer cell lines, treatment with a PI3K inhibitor or depletion of <i>PIK3CA</i> expression ultimately promoted AKT reactivation in a manner dependent on the E3 ubiquitin ligase Skp2, the kinases IGF-1R (insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor) and PDK-1 (phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1), and the cell growth and metabolism-regulating complex mTORC2 (mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2), but was independent of PI3K activity or PIP<sub>3</sub> production. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to PI3K inhibitors correlated with the increased abundance of Skp2, ubiquitylation of AKT, cell proliferation in culture, and xenograft tumor growth in mice. These findings reveal a ubiquitin signaling feedback mechanism by which PI3K inhibitor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance may emerge in aggressive breast cancer cells.</p>

Gene expression profiles of brain endothelial cells during embryonic development at bulk and single-cell levels
<p>The blood-brain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barrier</span></strong> is a dynamic interface that separates the brain from the circulatory system, and it is formed by highly specialized endothelial cells. To explore the molecular mechanisms defining the unique nature of vascular development and differentiation in the brain, we generated high-resolution gene expression profiles of mouse embryonic brain endothelial cells using translating ribosome affinity purification and single-cell RNA sequencing. We compared the brain vascular translatome with the vascular translatomes of other organs and analyzed the vascular translatomes of the brain at different time points during embryonic development. Because canonical Wnt signaling is implicated in the formation of the blood-brain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barrier</span></strong>, we also compared the brain endothelial translatome of wild-type mice with that of mice lacking the transcriptional cofactor β-catenin (<i>Ctnnb1</i>). Our analysis revealed extensive molecular changes during the embryonic development of the brain endothelium. We identified genes encoding brain endothelium–specific transcription factors (<i>Foxf2</i>, <i>Foxl2</i>, <i>Foxq1</i>, <i>Lef1</i>, <i>Ppard</i>, <i>Zfp551</i>, and <i>Zic3</i>) that are associated with maturation of the blood-brain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barrier</span></strong> and act downstream of the Wnt–β-catenin signaling pathway. Profiling of individual brain endothelial cells revealed substantial heterogeneity in the population. Nevertheless, the high abundance of <i>Foxf2</i>, <i>Foxq1</i>, <i>Ppard</i>, or <i>Zic3</i> transcripts correlated with the increased expression of genes encoding markers of brain endothelial cell differentiation. Expression of <i>Foxf2</i> and <i>Zic3</i> in human umbilical vein endothelial cells induced the production of blood-brain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barrier</span></strong> differentiation markers. This comprehensive data set may help to improve the engineering of in vitro blood-brain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barrier</span></strong> models.</p>

The receptor tyrosine kinase AXL mediates nuclear translocation of the epidermal growth factor receptor
<p>The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a therapeutic target in patients with various cancers. Unfortunately, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to EGFR-targeted therapeutics is common. Previous studies identified two mechanisms of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to the EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab. Nuclear translocation of EGFR bypasses the inhibitory effects of cetuximab, and the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL mediates cetuximab <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance by maintaining EGFR activation and downstream signaling. Thus, we hypothesized that AXL mediated the nuclear translocation of EGFR in the setting of cetuximab <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. Cetuximab-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant clones of non–small cell lung cancer in culture and patient-derived xenografts in mice had increased abundance of AXL and nuclear EGFR (nEGFR). Cellular fractionation analysis, super-resolution microscopy, and electron microscopy revealed that genetic loss of AXL reduced the accumulation of nEGFR. SRC family kinases (SFKs) and HER family ligands promote the nuclear translocation of EGFR. We found that AXL knockdown reduced the expression of the genes encoding the SFK family members YES and LYN and the ligand neuregulin-1 (NRG1). AXL knockdown also decreased the interaction between EGFR and the related receptor HER3 and accumulation of HER3 in the nucleus. Overexpression of LYN and NRG1 in cells depleted of AXL resulted in accumulation of nEGFR, rescuing the deficit induced by lack of AXL. Collectively, these data uncover a previously unrecognized role for AXL in regulating the nuclear translocation of EGFR and suggest that AXL-mediated SFK and <i>NRG1</i> expression promote this process.</p>

Heterogeneity in efflux pump expression predisposes antibiotic-resistant cells to mutation

Recent studies have begun to elucidate the molecular genetic basis of plant-pathogen interactions using commonly measured traits, including lesion size and/or pathogen biomass. However, with the advent of digital imaging and high-throughput phenomics, there are a large number of additional traits available to study quantitative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. In this study, we used high-throughput digital imaging analysis to investigate previously poorly characterized visual traits of plant-pathogen interactions related to disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance using the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>)/<i>Botrytis</i> pathosystem. From a large collection of visual lesion trait measurements, we focused on color, shape, and size to test how these aspects of the Arabidopsis/<i>Botrytis</i> interaction are genetically related. Through genome-wide association mapping in Arabidopsis, we show that lesion color and shape are genetically separable traits associated with plant disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance.

Short-Term Exposure to Nitrogen Dioxide Provides Basal Pathogen Resistance
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) forms in plants under stress conditions, but little is known about its physiological functions. Here, we explored the physiological functions of NO<sub>2</sub> in plant cells using short-term fumigation of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) for 1 h with 10 µL L<sup>−1</sup> NO<sub>2.</sub> Although leaf symptoms were absent, the expression of genes related to pathogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance was induced. Fumigated plants developed basal disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance, or pattern-triggered immunity, against the necrotrophic fungus <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> and the hemibiotrophic bacterium <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i>. Functional salicylic acid and jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathways were both required for the full expression of NO<sub>2</sub>-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance against <i>B. cinerea</i>. An early peak of salicylic acid accumulation immediately after NO<sub>2</sub> exposure was followed by a transient accumulation of oxophytodienoic acid. The simultaneous NO<sub>2</sub>-induced expression of genes involved in jasmonate biosynthesis and jasmonate catabolism resulted in the complete suppression of JA and JA-isoleucine (JA-Ile) accumulation, which was accompanied by a rise in the levels of their catabolic intermediates 12-OH-JA, 12-OH-JA-Ile, and 12-COOH-JA-Ile. NO<sub>2</sub>-treated plants emitted the volatile monoterpene α-pinene and the sesquiterpene longifolene (syn. junipene), which could function in signaling or direct defense against pathogens. NO<sub>2</sub>-triggered <i>B. cinerea</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance was dependent on enhanced early callose deposition and <i>CYTOCHROME P450 79B2</i> (<i>CYP79B2</i>), <i>CYP79B3</i>, and <i>PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT3</i> gene functions but independent of camalexin, <i>CYP81F2</i>, and 4-OH-indol-3-ylmethylglucosinolate derivatives. In sum, exogenous NO<sub>2</sub> triggers basal pathogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance, pointing to a possible role for endogenous NO<sub>2</sub> in defense signaling. Additionally, this study revealed the involvement of jasmonate catabolism and volatiles in pathogen immunity.</p>

Gene Duplication and Aneuploidy Trigger Rapid Evolution of Herbicide Resistance in Common Waterhemp<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>An increase in gene copy number is often associated with changes in the number and structure of chromosomes, as has been widely observed in yeast and eukaryotic tumors, yet little is known about stress-induced chromosomal changes in plants. Previously, we reported that the <i>EPSPS</i> (5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase) gene, the molecular target of glyphosate, was amplified at the native locus and on an extra chromosome in glyphosate-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant <i>Amaranthus tuberculatus</i>. Here, we report that the extra chromosome is a ring chromosome termed extra circular chromosome carrying amplified <i>EPSPS</i> (ECCAE). The ECCAE is heterochromatic, harbors four major <i>EPSPS</i> amplified foci, and is sexually transmitted to 35% of the progeny. Two highly glyphosate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant (HGR) <i>A. tuberculatus</i> plants with a chromosome constitution of 2n = 32+1 ECCAE displayed soma cell heterogeneity. Some cells had secondary ECCAEs, which displayed size polymorphisms and produced novel chromosomal variants with multiple gene amplification foci. We hypothesize that the ECCAE in the soma cells of HGR <i>A. tuberculatus</i> plants underwent breakage-fusion-bridge cycles to generate the observed soma cell heterogeneity, including de novo <i>EPSPS</i> gene integration into chromosomes. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant soma cells with stable <i>EPSPS</i> amplification events as de novo insertions into chromosomes may survive glyphosate selection pressure during the sporophytic phase and are plausibly transmitted to germ cells leading to durable glyphosate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in <i>A. tuberculatus</i>. This is the first report of early events in aneuploidy-triggered de novo chromosome integration by an as yet unknown mechanism, which may drive rapid adaptive evolution of herbicide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in common waterhemp.</p>

Hydrogen Sulfide Increases Production of NADPH Oxidase-Dependent Hydrogen Peroxide and Phospholipase D-Derived Phosphatidic Acid in Guard Cell Signaling<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) is an important gaseous signaling molecule in plants that participates in stress responses and development. <sc>l</sc>-Cys desulfhydrase 1, one of the enzymatic sources of H<sub>2</sub>S in plants, participates in abscisic acid-induced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e. We combined pharmacological and genetic approaches to elucidate the involvement of H<sub>2</sub>S in stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e and the interplay between H<sub>2</sub>S and other second messengers of the guard cell signaling network, such as hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and phospholipase D (PLD)-derived phosphatidic acid in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Both NADPH oxidase isoforms, respiratory burst oxidase homolog (RBOH)D and RBOHF, were required for H<sub>2</sub>S-induced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e. In vivo imaging using the cytosolic ratiometric fluorescent biosensor roGFP2-Orp1 revealed that H<sub>2</sub>S stimulates H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production in Arabidopsis guard cells. Additionally, we observed an interplay between H<sub>2</sub>S and PLD activity in the regulation of reactive oxygen species production and stomatal movement.

Heat Shock Factor HsfA1a Is Essential for <i>R</i> Gene-Mediated Nematode Resistance and Triggers H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> Production<sup>1</sup>
<p>Plants generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the apoplast in response to pathogen attack, especially following <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance (<i>R</i>) gene-mediated pathogen recognition; however, the mechanisms activating ROS generation remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that RKN (<i>Meloidogyne incognita</i>) infection rapidly induces ROS accumulation in the roots of tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) plants that contain the <i>R</i> gene <i>Mi-1.2</i> but rarely induces ROS accumulation in the susceptible or <i>Mi-1.2</i>-silenced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant genotypes. RNK also induces the hypersensitive response, a form of programmed cell death, in <i>Mi-1.2</i> plants. RKN induces the expression of numerous class-A heat shock factor (HsfA) genes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant tomato plants. Silencing <i>HsfA1a</i> compromises <i>Mi-1.2</i>-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance, apoplastic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation, and the transcription of <i>whitefly induced 1</i> (<i>Wfi1</i>), which encodes a respiratory burst oxidase homolog. HsfA1a regulates <i>Wfi1</i> transcription by binding to the <i>Wfi1</i> promoter, and silencing of <i>Wfi1</i> compromises <i>Mi-1.2</i>-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. HsfA1a and Wfi1 are involved in Mi-1.2-triggered Hsp90 accumulation and basal defense in susceptible tomato. Thus, HsfA–1aWfi1-dependent ROS signaling functions as a crucial regulator of plant defense responses.</p>

Abscisic Acid-Induced Reactive Oxygen Species Are Modulated by Flavonols to Control Stomata Aperture
<p>Abscisic acid (ABA) increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) in guard cells to close Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) stomata. In tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>), we find that ABA-increased ROS is followed by stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e and that both responses are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">block</span></strong>ed by inhibitors of ROS-producing respiratory burst oxidase enzymes. ABA-induced ROS sensor fluorescence accumulates in the nucleus, chloroplasts, and endomembranes. The accumulation of flavonol antioxidants in guard cells, but not surrounding pavement cells, was visualized by confocal microscopy using a flavonol-specific fluorescent dye. Decreased flavonols in guard cells in the <i>anthocyanin reduced</i> (<i>are</i>) mutant and elevated levels in the <i>anthocyanin without</i> (<i>aw</i>) mutant were quantified by confocal microscopy and in leaf extracts by mass spectrometry. Consistent with flavonols acting as antioxidants, higher levels of ROS were detected in guard cells of the tomato <i>are</i> mutant and lower levels were detected in <i>aw</i> both at homeostasis and after treatment with ABA. These results demonstrate the inverse relationship between flavonols and ROS. Guard cells of <i>are</i> show greater ABA-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e than the wild type, reduced light-dependent guard cell opening, and reduced water loss, with <i>aw</i> having opposite responses. Ethylene treatment of wild-type tomato plants increased flavonol accumulation in guard cells; however, no flavonol increases were observed in <i>Neverripe</i> (<i>Nr</i>), an ethylene receptor mutant. Consistent with lower levels of ROS due to elevated flavonols, ethylene treatments decreased ABA-induced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e in the wild type, but not <i>Nr</i>, with ethylene responses attenuated in the <i>are</i> mutant. Together, these results are consistent with flavonols dampening the ABA-dependent ROS burst that drives stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e and facilitating stomatal opening to modulate leaf gas exchange.</p>

Drought-Enhanced Xylem Sap Sulfate Closes Stomata by Affecting ALMT12 and Guard Cell ABA Synthesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Water limitation of plants causes stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e to prevent water loss by transpiration. For this purpose, progressing soil water deficit is communicated from roots to shoots. Abscisic acid (ABA) is the key signal in stress-induced stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e, but ABA as an early xylem-delivered signal is still a matter of debate. In this study, poplar plants (<i>Populus × canescens</i>) were exposed to water stress to investigate xylem sap sulfate and ABA, stomatal conductance, and sulfate transporter (<i>SULTR</i>) expression. In addition, stomatal behavior and expression of ABA receptors, drought-responsive genes, transcription factors, and <i>NCED3</i> were studied after feeding sulfate and ABA to detached poplar leaves and epidermal peels of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The results show that increased xylem sap sulfate is achieved upon drought by reduced xylem unloading by PtaSULTR3;3a and PtaSULTR1;1, and by enhanced loading from parenchyma cells into the xylem via PtaALMT3b. Sulfate application caused stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e in excised leaves and peeled epidermis. In the loss of sulfate-channel function mutant, At<i>almt12</i>, sulfate-triggered stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e was impaired. The QUAC1/ALMT12 anion channel heterologous expressed in oocytes was gated open by extracellular sulfate. Sulfate up-regulated the expression of <i>NCED3</i>, a key step of ABA synthesis, in guard cells. In conclusion, xylem-derived sulfate seems to be a chemical signal of drought that induces stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">closur</span></strong>e via QUAC1/ALMT12 and/or guard cell ABA synthesis.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Homologues of the RPW8 Resistance Protein Are Localized to the Extrahaustorial Membrane that Is Likely Synthesized De Novo
<p>Upon penetration of the host cell wall, the powdery mildew fungus develops a feeding structure named the haustorium in the invaded host cell. Concomitant with haustorial biogenesis, the extrahaustorial membrane (EHM) is formed to separate the haustorium from the host cell cytoplasm. The Arabidopsis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance protein RPW8.2 is specifically targeted to the EHM where it activates haustorium-targeted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance against powdery mildew. RPW8.2 belongs to a small family with six members in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Whether Homologs of RPW8 (HR) 1 to HR4 are also localized to the EHM and contribute to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance has not been determined. Here, we report that overexpression of <i>HR1</i>, <i>HR2</i>, or <i>HR3</i> led to enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to powdery mildew, while genetic depletion of <i>HR2</i> or <i>HR3</i> resulted in enhanced susceptibility, indicating that these <i>RPW8</i> homologs contribute to basal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. Interestingly, we found that N-terminally YFP-tagged HR1 to HR3 are also EHM-localized. This suggests that EHM-targeting is an ancestral feature of the RPW8 family. Indeed, two RPW8 homologs from <i>Brassica oleracea</i> tested also exhibit EHM-localization. Domain swapping analysis between HR3 and RPW8.2 suggests that sequence diversification in the N-terminal 146 amino acids of RPW8.2 probably functionally distinguishes it from other family members. Moreover, we found that N-terminally YFP-tagged HR3 is also localized to the plasma membrane and the fungal penetration site (the papilla) in addition to the EHM. Using this unique feature of YFP-HR3, we obtained preliminary evidence to suggest that the EHM is unlikely derived from invagination of the plasma membrane, rather it may be mainly synthesized de novo.</p>

Phosphorylation of the exocyst protein Exo84 by TBK1 promotes insulin-stimulated GLUT4 trafficking
<p>Insulin stimulates glucose uptake through the translocation of the glucose transporter GLUT4 to the plasma membrane. The exocyst complex tethers GLUT4-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane, a process that requires the binding of the G protein (heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide–binding protein) RalA to the exocyst complex. We report that upon activation of RalA, the protein kinase TBK1 phosphorylated the exocyst subunit Exo84. Knockdown of TBK1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">block</span></strong>ed insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation; knockout of TBK1 in adipocytes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">block</span></strong>ed insulin-stimulated glucose uptake; and ectopic overexpression of a kinase-inactive mutant of TBK1 reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The phosphorylation of Exo84 by TBK1 reduced its affinity for RalA and enabled its release from the exocyst. Overexpression of a kinase-inactive mutant of TBK1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">block</span></strong>ed the dissociation of the TBK1/RalA/exocyst complex, and treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with specific inhibitors of TBK1 reduced the rate of complex dissociation.

Thus, these data indicate that TBK1 controls GLUT4 vesicle engagement and disengagement from the exocyst, suggesting that exocyst components not only constitute a tethering complex for the GLUT4 vesicle but also act as “gatekeepers” controlling vesicle fusion at the plasma membrane.</p>

Role of AcrAB-TolC multidrug efflux pump in drug-resistance acquisition by plasmid transfer
<p>Drug-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance dissemination by horizontal gene transfer remains poorly understood at the cellular scale. Using live-cell microscopy, we reveal the dynamics of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance acquisition by transfer of the <i>Escherichia coli</i> fertility factor–conjugation plasmid encoding the tetracycline-efflux pump TetA. The entry of the single-stranded DNA plasmid into the recipient cell is rapidly followed by complementary-strand synthesis, plasmid-gene expression, and production of TetA. In the presence of translation-inhibiting antibiotics, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance acquisition depends on the AcrAB-TolC multidrug efflux pump, because it reduces tetracycline concentrations in the cell. Protein synthesis can thus persist and TetA expression can be initiated immediately after plasmid acquisition. AcrAB-TolC efflux activity can also preserve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance acquisition by plasmid transfer in the presence of antibiotics with other modes of action.</p>

‘Frightening’ typhoid fever outbreak spreads in Pakistan
<p>A strain of the bacterium that causes typhoid fever has become <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant to most every drug and is spreading through Pakistan, causing at least 2000 confirmed cases. The so-called extensively drug <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant (XDR) strain of <i>Salmonella typhi</i> remains susceptible to one oral antibiotic, azithromycin, but the only other options are expensive intravenous drugs that most people in Pakistan and other resource-strapped countries cannot afford. The fear is that if <i>S. typhi</i> develops <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to azithromycin, many people will die from the disease, which leads to bowl perforation and other life-threatening complications in about 15% of untreated people. A new vaccine that for the first time works in young children and has long-lasting immunity is now being rolled out in Pakistan. But antibiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance and spread are a result of poor sanitation and contaminated water supplies, which reflect the serious infrastructure problems in Hyderabad and Karachi, the two main cities affected by XDR <i>S. typhi. </i>Public health officials worry that the XDR <i>S. typhi</i> will also jump borders and soon start spreading outside of Pakistan.</p>

Hyperglycemia drives intestinal barrier dysfunction and risk for enteric infection
<p>Obesity, diabetes, and related manifestations are associated with an enhanced, but poorly understood, risk for mucosal infection and systemic inflammation. Here, we show in mouse models of obesity and diabetes that hyperglycemia drives intestinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barrier</span></strong> permeability, through GLUT2-dependent transcriptional reprogramming of intestinal epithelial cells and alteration of tight and adherence junction integrity. Consequently, hyperglycemia-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barrier</span></strong> disruption leads to systemic influx of microbial products and enhanced dissemination of enteric infection. Treatment of hyperglycemia, intestinal epithelial–specific GLUT2 deletion, or inhibition of glucose metabolism restores <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barrier</span></strong> function and bacterial containment. In humans, systemic influx of intestinal microbiome products correlates with individualized glycemic control, indicated by glycated hemoglobin levels. Together, our results mechanistically link hyperglycemia and intestinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barrier</span></strong> function with systemic infectious and inflammatory consequences of obesity and diabetes.</p>

Bone-like crack resistance in hierarchical metastable nanolaminate steels

The Structural Integrity of Lignin Is Crucial for Resistance against <i>Striga hermonthica</i> Parasitism in Rice
<p><i>Striga</i> species are parasitic weeds that seriously constrain the productivity of food staples, including cereals and legumes, in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. In eastern and central Africa, <i>Striga</i> spp. infest as much as 40 million hectares of smallholder farmland causing total crop failure during severe infestation. As the molecular mechanisms underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance are yet to be elucidated, we undertook a comparative metabolome study using the <i>Striga</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) cultivar ‘Nipponbare’ and the susceptible cultivar ‘Koshihikari’. We found that a number of metabolites accumulated preferentially in the <i>Striga</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant cultivar upon <i>Striga hermonthica</i> infection. Most apparent was increased deposition of lignin, a phenylpropanoid polymer mainly composed of <i>p</i>-hydroxyphenyl (H), guaiacyl (G), and syringyl (S) aromatic units, around the site of interaction in Nipponbare. The increased deposition of lignin was accompanied by induction of the expression of corresponding enzyme-encoding genes in the phenylpropanoid pathway. In addition, perturbing normal lignin composition by knocking down or overexpressing the genes that regulate lignin composition, i.e. <i>p</i>-COUMARATE 3-HYDROXYLASE or FERULATE 5-HYDROXYLASE, enhanced susceptibility of Nipponbare to <i>S</i>. <i>hermonthica</i> infection. These results demonstrate that enhanced lignin deposition and maintenance of the structural integrity of lignin polymers deposited at the infection site are crucial for postattachment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance against <i>S</i>. <i>hermonthica</i>.</p>

The Coiled-Coil NLR <i>Rph1</i>, Confers Leaf Rust Resistance in Barley Cultivar Sudan
<p>Unraveling and exploiting mechanisms of disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in cereal crops is currently limited by their large repeat-rich genomes and the lack of genetic recombination or cultivar (cv)-specific sequence information. We cloned the first leaf rust <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance gene <i>Rph1</i> (<i>Rph1</i>.<i>a</i>) from cultivated barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) using “MutChromSeq,” a recently developed molecular genomics tool for the rapid cloning of genes in plants. Marker-trait association in the CI 9214/Stirling doubled haploid population mapped <i>Rph1</i> to the short arm of chromosome 2H in a physical region of 1.3 megabases relative to the barley cv Morex reference assembly. A sodium azide mutant population in cv Sudan was generated and 10 mutants were confirmed by progeny-testing. Flow-sorted 2H chromosomes from Sudan (wild type) and six of the mutants were sequenced and compared to identify candidate genes for the <i>Rph1</i> locus. MutChromSeq identified a single gene candidate encoding a coiled-coil nucleotide binding site Leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptor protein that was altered in three different mutants. Further Sanger sequencing confirmed all three mutations and identified an additional two independent mutations within the same candidate gene. Phylogenetic analysis determined that <i>Rph1</i> clustered separately from all previously cloned NLRs from the Triticeae and displayed highest sequence similarity (89%) with a homolog of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance protein 1 protein in <i>Triticum urartu</i>. In this study we determined the molecular basis for <i>Rph1</i>-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in cultivated barley enabling varietal improvement through diagnostic marker design, gene editing, and gene stacking technologies.</p>

Distinct Roles of Non-Overlapping Surface Regions of the Coiled-Coil Domain in the Potato Immune Receptor Rx1
<p>The intracellular immune receptor Rx1 of potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>), which confers effector-triggered immunity to <i>Potato virus X</i>, consists of a central nucleotide-binding domain (NB-ARC) flanked by a carboxyl-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain and an amino-terminal coiled-coil (CC) domain. Rx1 activity is strictly regulated by interdomain interactions between the NB-ARC and LRR, but the contribution of the CC domain in regulating Rx1 activity or immune signaling is not fully understood. Therefore, we used a structure-informed approach to investigate the role of the CC domain in Rx1 functionality. Targeted mutagenesis of CC surface residues revealed separate regions required for the intramolecular and intermolecular interaction of the CC with the NB-ARC-LRR and the cofactor Ran GTPase-activating protein2 (RanGAP2), respectively. None of the mutant Rx1 proteins was constitutively active, indicating that the CC does not contribute to the autoinhibition of Rx1 activity. Instead, the CC domain acted as a modulator of downstream responses involved in effector-triggered immunity. Systematic disruption of the hydrophobic interface between the four helices of the CC enabled the uncoupling of cell death and disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance responses. Moreover, a strong dominant negative effect on Rx1-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance and cell death was observed upon coexpression of the CC alone with full-length Rx1 protein, which depended on the RanGAP2-binding surface of the CC. Surprisingly, coexpression of the N-terminal half of the CC enhanced Rx1-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance, which further indicated that the CC functions as a scaffold for downstream components involved in the modulation of disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance or cell death signaling.</p>

<i>NLR</i> Mutations Suppressing Immune Hybrid Incompatibility and Their Effects on Disease Resistance
<p>Genetic divergence between populations can lead to reproductive isolation. Hybrid incompatibilities (HI) represent intermediate points along a continuum toward speciation. In plants, genetic variation in disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance (<i>R</i>) genes underlies several cases of HI. The progeny of a cross between Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) accessions Landsberg <i>erecta</i> (L<i>er</i>, Poland) and Kashmir2 (Kas2, central Asia) exhibits immune-related HI. This incompatibility is due to a genetic interaction between a cluster of eight <i>TNL (TOLL/INTERLEUKIN1 RECEPTOR-NUCLEOTIDE BINDING-LEU RICH REPEAT</i>) <i>RPP1</i> (<i>RECOGNITION OF PERONOSPORA PARASITICA1)</i>-<i>like</i> genes (<i>R1</i>–<i>R8</i>) from L<i>er</i> and central Asian alleles of a <i>Strubbelig</i>-family receptor-like kinase (<i>SRF3</i>) from Kas2. In characterizing mutants altered in L<i>er</i>/Kas2 HI, we mapped multiple mutations to the <i>RPP1</i>-like L<i>er</i> locus. Analysis of these <i>suppressor of Ler/Kas2 incompatibility</i> (<i>sulki</i>) mutants reveals complex, additive and epistatic interactions underlying <i>RPP1</i>-<i>like</i> L<i>er</i> locus activity. The effects of these mutations were measured on basal defense, global gene expression, primary metabolism, and disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to a local <i>Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis</i> isolate (<i>Hpa</i> Gw) collected from Gorzéáéáów (Gw), where the Landsberg accession originated. Gene expression sectors and metabolic hallmarks identified for HI are both dependent and independent of <i>RPP1</i>-<i>like</i> L<i>er</i> members. We establish that mutations suppressing immune-related L<i>er</i>/Kas2 HI do not compromise <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to <i>Hpa</i> Gw. QTL mapping analysis of <i>Hpa</i> Gw <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance point to <i>RPP7</i> as the causal locus. This work provides insight into the complex genetic architecture of the <i>RPP1</i>-<i>like</i> L<i>er</i> locus and immune-related HI in Arabidopsis and into the contributions of <i>RPP1</i>-<i>like</i> genes to HI and defense.</p>

Knockdown of Rice MicroRNA166 Confers Drought Resistance by Causing Leaf Rolling and Altering Stem Xylem Development
<p>MicroRNAs are 19- to 22-nucleotide small noncoding RNAs that have been implicated in abiotic stress responses. In this study, we found that knockdown of microRNA166, using the Short Tandem Target Mimic (STTM) system, resulted in morphological changes that confer drought <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). From a large-scale screen for miRNA knockdown lines in rice, we identified miR166 knockdown lines (STTM166); these plants exhibit a rolled-leaf phenotype, which is normally displayed by rice plants under drought stress. The leaves of STTM166 rice plants had smaller bulliform cells and abnormal sclerenchymatous cells, likely causing the rolled-leaf phenotype. The STTM166 plants had reduced stomatal conductance and showed decreased transpiration rates. The STTM166 lines also exhibited altered stem xylem and decreased hydraulic conductivity, likely due to the reduced diameter of the xylem vessels. Molecular analyses identified rice <i>HOMEODOMAIN CONTAINING PROTEIN4</i> (<i>OsHB4</i>), a member of HD-Zip III gene family, as a major target of miR166; moreover, rice plants overexpressing a miR166-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant form of <i>OsHB4</i> resembled the STTM166 plants, including leaf rolling and higher drought <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. The genes downstream of miR166-<i>OsHB4</i> consisted of polysaccharide synthesis-related genes that may contribute to cell wall formation and vascular development. Our results suggest that drought <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in rice can be increased by manipulating miRNAs, which leads to developmental changes, such as leaf rolling and reduced diameter of the xylem, that mimic plants’ natural responses to water-deficit stress.</p>

Host-Induced Gene Silencing of the MAPKK Gene <i>PsFUZ7</i> Confers Stable Resistance to Wheat Stripe Rust<sup><xref>1</xref></sup>
<p>RNA interference (RNAi) is a powerful genetic tool to accelerate research in plant biotechnology and control biotic stresses by manipulating target gene expression. However, the potential of RNAi in wheat to efficiently and durably control the devastating stripe rust fungus <i>Puccinia striiformis</i> f. sp. <i>tritici</i> (<i>Pst</i>) remained largely under explored so far. To address this issue, we generated transgenic wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) lines expressing dsRNA targeting <i>PsFUZ7</i> transcripts of <i>Pst</i>. We analyzed expression of <i>PsFUZ7</i> and related genes, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance traits of the transgenic wheat lines. We show that <i>PsFUZ7</i> is an important pathogenicity factor that regulates infection and development of <i>Pst</i>. A <i>PsFUZ7</i> RNAi construct stably expressed in two independent transgenic wheat lines confers strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to <i>Pst</i>. <i>Pst</i> hyphal development is strongly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">restrict</span></strong>ed, and necrosis of plant cells in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance responses was significantly induced. We conclude that trafficking of RNA molecules from wheat plants to <i>Pst</i> may lead to a complex molecular dialogue between wheat and the rust pathogen. Moreover, we confirm the RNAi-based crop protection approaches can be used, to our knowledge, as a novel control strategy against rust pathogens in wheat.</p>

BcXYG1, a Secreted Xyloglucanase from <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>, Triggers Both Cell Death and Plant Immune Responses
<p>In search of <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> cell death-inducing proteins, we found a xyloglucanase (BcXYG1) that induced strong necrosis and a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance response in dicot plants. Expression of the <i>BcXYG1</i> gene was strongly induced during the first 12 h post inoculation, and analysis of disease dynamics using PathTrack showed that a <i>B. cinerea</i> strain overexpressing <i>BcXYG1</i> produced early local necrosis, supporting a role of BcXYG1 as an early cell death-inducing factor. The xyloglucanase activity of BcXYG1 was not necessary for the induction of necrosis and plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance, as a mutant of BcXYG1 lacking the xyloglucanase enzymatic activity retained both functions. Residues in two exposed loops on the surface of BcXYG1 were found to be necessary for the induction of cell death but not to induce plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance. Further analyses showed that BcXYG1 is apoplastic and possibly interacts with the proteins of the plant cell membrane and also that the BcXYG1 cell death-promoting signal is mediated by the leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases BAK1 and SOBIR1. Our findings support the role of cell death-inducing proteins in establishing the infection of necrotrophic pathogens and highlight the recognition of fungal apoplastic proteins by the plant immune system as an important mechanism of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance against this class of pathogens.</p>

Biochemical Principles and Functional Aspects of Pipecolic Acid Biosynthesis in Plant Immunity
<p>The nonprotein amino acid pipecolic acid (Pip) regulates plant systemic acquired <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance and basal immunity to bacterial pathogen infection. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the lysine (Lys) aminotransferase AGD2-LIKE DEFENSE RESPONSE PROTEIN1 (ALD1) mediates the pathogen-induced accumulation of Pip in inoculated and distal leaf tissue. Here, we show that ALD1 transfers the α-amino group of <sc>l</sc>-Lys to acceptor oxoacids. Combined mass spectrometric and infrared spectroscopic analyses of in vitro assays and plant extracts indicate that the final product of the ALD1-catalyzed reaction is enaminic 2,3-dehydropipecolic acid (DP), whose formation involves consecutive transamination, cyclization, and isomerization steps. Besides <sc>l</sc>-Lys, recombinant ALD1 transaminates <sc>l</sc>-methionine, <sc>l</sc>-leucine, diaminopimelate, and several other amino acids to generate oxoacids or derived products in vitro. However, detailed in planta analyses suggest that the biosynthesis of 2,3-DP from <sc>l</sc>-Lys is the major in vivo function of ALD1. Since <i>ald1</i> mutant plants are able to convert exogenous 2,3-DP into Pip, their Pip deficiency relies on the inability to form the 2,3-DP intermediate. The Arabidopsis reductase ornithine cyclodeaminase/μ-crystallin, alias SYSTEMIC ACQUIRED <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ANCE-DEFICIENT4 (SARD4), converts ALD1-generated 2,3-DP into Pip in vitro. SARD4 significantly contributes to the production of Pip in pathogen-inoculated leaves but is not the exclusive reducing enzyme involved in Pip biosynthesis. Functional <i>SARD4</i> is required for proper basal immunity to the bacterial pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i>. Although <i>SARD4</i> knockout plants show greatly reduced accumulation of Pip in leaves distal to <i>P. syringae</i> inoculation, they display a considerable systemic acquired <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance response. This suggests a triggering function of locally accumulating Pip for systemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance induction.</p>

Antiviral Resistance Protein Tm-2<sup>2</sup> Functions on the Plasma Membrane
<p>The tomato <i>Tobacco mosaic virus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance-2<sup>2</sup></i> (<i>Tm-2<sup>2</sup></i>) gene encodes a coiled-coil-nucleotide binding site-Leu-rich repeat protein lacking a conventional plasma membrane (PM) localization motif. Tm-2<sup>2</sup> confers plant extreme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance against tobamoviruses including <i>Tobacco mosaic virus</i> (TMV) by recognizing the avirulence (Avr) viral movement protein (MP). However, the subcellular compartment where Tm-2<sup>2</sup> functions is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that Tm-2<sup>2</sup> interacts with TMV MP to form a protein complex at the PM. We show that both inactive and active Tm-2<sup>2</sup> proteins are localized to the PM. When <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">restrict</span></strong>ed to PM by fusing Tm-2<sup>2</sup> to the <i>S</i>-acylated PM association motif, the Tm-2<sup>2</sup> fusion protein can still induce a hypersensitive response cell death, consistent with its activation at the PM. Through analyses of viral MP mutants, we find that the plasmodesmata (PD) localization of the Avr protein MP is not required for Tm-2<sup>2</sup> function. These results suggest that Tm-2<sup>2</sup>-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance takes place on PM without requirement of its Avr protein to be located to PD.</p>

Physical Mapping of Amplified Copies of the 5-Enolpyruvylshikimate-3-Phosphate Synthase Gene in Glyphosate-Resistant <i>Amaranthus tuberculatus</i><xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Recent and rapid evolution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance to glyphosate, the most widely used herbicides, in several weed species, including common waterhemp (<i>Amaranthus tuberculatus</i>), poses a serious threat to sustained crop production. We report that glyphosate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ance in <i>A</i>. <i>tuberculatus</i> was due to amplification of the 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-P synthase (<i>EPSPS</i>) gene, which encodes the molecular target of glyphosate. There was a positive correlation between <i>EPSPS</i> gene copies and its transcript expression. We analyzed the distribution of <i>EPSPS</i> copies in the genome of <i>A</i>. <i>tuberculatus</i> using fluorescence in situ hybridization on mitotic metaphase chromosomes and interphase nuclei. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis mapped the <i>EPSPS</i> gene to pericentromeric regions of two homologous chromosomes in glyphosate sensitive <i>A</i>. <i>tuberculatus</i>. In glyphosate-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant plants, a cluster of <i>EPSPS</i> genes on the pericentromeric region on one pair of homologous chromosomes was detected. Intriguingly, two highly glyphosate-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resist</span></strong>ant plants harbored an additional chromosome with several <i>EPSPS</i> copies besides the native chromosome pair with <i>EPSPS</i> copies. These results suggest that the initial event of <i>EPSPS</i> gene duplication may have occurred because of unequal recombination mediated by repetitive DNA. Subsequently, gene amplification may have resulted via several other mechanisms, such as chromosomal rearrangements, deletion/insertion, transposon-mediated dispersion, or possibly by interspecific hybridization. This report illustrates the physical mapping of amplified <i>EPSPS</i> copies in <i>A</i>. <i>tuberculatus</i>.</p>

Carnosic Acid and Carnosol, Two Major Antioxidants of Rosemary, Act through Different Mechanisms
<p>Carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, a phenolic diterpene specific to the Lamiaceae family, is highly abundant in rosemary (<i>Rosmarinus officinalis</i>). Despite numerous industrial and medicinal/pharmaceutical applications of its anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative features, this compound in planta and its anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ant mechanism have received little attention, except a few studies of rosemary plants under natural conditions. In vitro analyses, using high-performance liquid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromat</span></strong>ography-ultraviolet and luminescence imaging, revealed that carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> and its major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized derivative, carnosol, protect lipids from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation. Both compounds preserved linolenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> and monogalactosyldiacylglycerol from singlet oxygen and from hydroxyl radical. When applied exogenously, they were both able to protect thylakoid membranes prepared from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves against lipid per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation. Different levels of carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> and carnosol in two contrasting rosemary varieties correlated with tolerance to lipid per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation. Upon reactive oxygen species (ROS) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation of lipids, carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> was consumed and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized into various derivatives, including into carnosol, while carnosol resisted, suggesting that carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> is a chemical quencher of ROS. The anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative function of carnosol relies on another mechanism, occurring directly in the lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation process. Under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative conditions that did not involve ROS generation, carnosol inhibited lipid per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation, contrary to carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>. Using spin probes and electron paramagnetic resonance detection, we confirmed that carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, rather than carnosol, is a ROS quencher. Various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized derivatives of carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> were detected in rosemary leaves in low light, indicating chronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation of this compound, and accumulated in plants exposed to stress conditions, in parallel with a loss of carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, confirming that chemical quenching of ROS by carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> takes place in planta.</p>

Cell structural changes in the mesophyll of Norway spruce needles by elevated ozone and elevated temperature in open-field exposure during cold acclimation
<p>The effects of elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ozon</span></strong>e (1.4× ambient) and temperature (ambient +1.3 °C) alone and in combination were studied on the needle cell structure of soil-grown Norway spruce seedlings in the late growing season and winter. Temperature treatment continued over winter and lengthened the snow-free period. Elevated temperature caused microscopic changes related to photosynthesis (decreased chloroplast size and increased number), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> storage (reduced starch and increased cytoplasmic lipids) and defence (decreased mitochondrial size and proportion per cytoplasm, increased peroxisomes and plastoglobuli, altered appearance of tannins). The results suggest increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress by elevated temperature and altered allocation of limited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> reserve to defence. The number of peroxisomes and plastoglobuli remained high in the outer cells of needles of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ozon</span></strong>e-exposed seedlings but decreased in the inner cells. This may indicate defence allocation to cells close to the stomata and surface, which are experiencing more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ozon</span></strong>e reduced winter hardiness based on seasonal changes in chloroplast shape and location in the cells. The effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ozon</span></strong>e became evident at the end of the growing season, indicating the effect of cumulative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ozon</span></strong>e dose or that the seedlings were vulnerable to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ozon</span></strong>e at the later phases of winter hardening. Elevated temperature increased cellular damage in early winter and visible damage in spring, and the damage was enhanced by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ozon</span></strong>e. In conclusion, the study suggests that modest air temperature elevation increases stress at the cell structural level in spruce seedlings and is enhanced by low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ozon</span></strong>e elevation. Future climatic conditions where snow cover is formed later or is lacking but temperatures are low can increase the risk of severe seedling damage, and current and future predicted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ozon</span></strong>e concentrations increase this risk.</p>

An Aromatic Farnesyltransferase Functions in Biosynthesis of the Anti-HIV Meroterpenoid Daurichromenic Acid
<p><i>Rhododendron dauricum</i> produces daurichromenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, an anti-HIV meroterpenoid, via <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative cyclization of the farnesyl group of grifolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>. The prenyltransferase (PT) that synthesizes grifolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> is a farnesyltransferase in plant specialized metabolism. In this study, we demonstrated that the isoprenoid moiety of grifolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> is derived from the 2-<i>C</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-erythritol-4-phosphate pathway that takes place in plastids. We explored candidate sequences of plastid-localized PT homologs and identified a cDNA for this PT, RdPT1, which shares moderate sequence similarity with known aromatic PTs. RdPT1 is expressed exclusively in the glandular scales, where daurichromenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> accumulates. In addition, the gene product was targeted to plastids in plant cells. The recombinant RdPT1 regiospecifically synthesized grifolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> from orsellinic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> and farnesyl diphosphate, demonstrating that RdPT1 is the farnesyltransferase involved in daurichromenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> biosynthesis. This enzyme strictly preferred orsellinic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> as a prenyl acceptor, whereas it had a relaxed specificity for prenyl donor structures, also accepting geranyl and geranylgeranyl diphosphates with modest efficiency to synthesize prenyl chain analogs of grifolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>. Such a broad specificity is a unique catalytic feature of RdPT1 that is not shared among secondary metabolic aromatic PTs in plants. We discuss the unusual substrate preference of RdPT1 using a molecular modeling approach. The biochemical properties as well as the localization of RdPT1 suggest that this enzyme produces meroterpenoids in glandular scales cooperatively with previously identified daurichromenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthase, probably for chemical defense on the surface of <i>R. dauricum</i> plants.</p>

Development Defects of Hydroxy-Fatty Acid-Accumulating Seeds Are Reduced by Castor Acyltransferases
<p>Researchers have long endeavored to produce modified fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s in easily managed crop plants where they are not natively found. An important step toward this goal has been the biosynthesis of these valuable products in model oilseeds. The successful production of such fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s has revealed barriers to the broad application of this technology, including low seed oil and low proportion of the introduced fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> and reduced seed vigor. Here, we analyze the impact of producing hydroxy-fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s on seedling development. We show that germinating seeds of a hydroxy-fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>-accumulating Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) line produce chlorotic cotyledons and suffer reduced photosynthetic capacity. These seedlings retain hydroxy-fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s in polar lipids, including chloroplast lipids, and exhibit decreased fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthesis. Triacylglycerol mobilization in seedling development also is reduced, especially for lipids that include hydroxy-fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> moieties. These developmental defects are ameliorated by increased flux of hydroxy-fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s into seed triacylglycerol created through the expression of either castor (<i>Ricinus communis</i>) acyltransferase enzyme ACYL-COA:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE2 or PHOSPHOLIPID:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1A. Such expression increases both the level of total stored triacylglycerol and the rate at which it is mobilized, fueling fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthesis and restoring photosynthetic capacity. Our results suggest that further improvements in seedling development may require the specific mobilization of triacylglycerol-containing hydroxy-fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s. Understanding the defects in early development caused by the accumulation of modified fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s and providing mechanisms to circumvent these defects are vital steps in the development of tailored oil crops.</p>

Proteome-Wide Analysis of Cysteine Reactivity during Effector-Triggered Immunity
<p>A surge in the accumulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ants generates shifts in the cellular redox potential during early stages of plant infection with pathogens and activation of effector-triggered immunity (ETI). The redoxome, defined as the proteome-wide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative modifications of proteins caused by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ants, has a well-known impact on stress responses in metazoans. However, the identity of proteins and the residues sensitive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation during the plant immune response remain largely unknown. Previous studies of the thimet oligopeptidases TOP1 and TOP2 placed them in the salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> dependent branch of ETI, with a current model wherein TOPs sustain interconnected organellar and cytosolic pathways that modulate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative burst and development of cell death. Herein, we characterized the ETI redoxomes in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) wild-type Col-0 and <i>top1top2</i> mutant plants using a differential alkylation-based enrichment technique coupled with label-free mass spectrometry-based quantification. We identified cysteines sensitive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation in a wide range of protein families at multiple time points after pathogen infection. Differences were detected between Col-0 and <i>top1top2</i> redoxomes regarding the identity and number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized cysteines, and the amplitude of time-dependent fluctuations in protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation. Our results support a determining role for TOPs in maintaining the proper level and dynamics of proteome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation during ETI. This study significantly expands the repertoire of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation-sensitive plant proteins and can guide future mechanistic studies.</p>

Starch Deficiency Enhances Lipid Biosynthesis and Turnover in Leaves
<p>Starch and lipids represent two major forms of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> and energy storage in plants and play central roles in diverse cellular processes. However, whether and how starch and lipid metabolic pathways interact to regulate metabolism and growth are poorly understood. Here, we show that lipids can partially compensate for the lack of function of transient starch during normal growth and development in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Disruption of starch synthesis resulted in a significant increase in fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthesis via posttranslational regulation of the plastidic acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase and a concurrent increase in the synthesis and turnover of membrane lipids and triacylglycerol. Genetic analysis showed that blocking fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> peroxisomal β-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation, the sole pathway for metabolic breakdown of fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s in plants, significantly compromised or stunted the growth and development of mutants defective in starch synthesis under long days or short days, respectively. We also found that the combined disruption of starch synthesis and fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> turnover resulted in increased accumulation of membrane lipids, triacylglycerol, and soluble sugars and altered fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> flux between the two lipid biosynthetic pathways compartmentalized in either the chloroplast or the endoplasmic reticulum. Collectively, our findings provide insight into the role of fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> β-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation and the regulatory network controlling fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthesis, and they reveal the mechanistic basis by which starch and lipid metabolic pathways interact and undergo cross talk to modulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> allocation, energy homeostasis, and plant growth.</p>

Coexpression Analysis Identifies Two Oxidoreductases Involved in the Biosynthesis of the Monoterpene Acid Moiety of Natural Pyrethrin Insecticides in <i>Tanacetum cinerariifolium</i>
<p>Flowers of <i>Tanacetum cinerariifolium</i> produce a set of compounds known collectively as pyrethrins, which are commercially important pesticides that are strongly toxic to flying insects but not to most vertebrates. A pyrethrin molecule is an ester consisting of either trans-chrysanthemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> or its modified form, pyrethric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, and one of three alcohols, jasmolone, pyrethrolone, and cinerolone, that appear to be derived from jasmonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>. Chrysanthemyl diphosphate synthase (CDS), the first enzyme involved in the synthesis of trans-chrysanthemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, was characterized previously and its gene isolated. <i>TcCDS</i> produces free trans-chrysanthemol in addition to trans-chrysanthemyl diphosphate, but the enzymes responsible for the conversion of trans-chrysanthemol to the corresponding aldehyde and then to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> have not been reported. We used an RNA sequencing-based approach and coexpression correlation analysis to identify several candidate genes encoding putative trans-chrysanthemol and trans-chrysanthemal dehydrogenases. We functionally characterized the proteins encoded by these genes using a combination of in vitro biochemical assays and heterologous expression in planta to demonstrate that <i>TcADH2</i> encodes an enzyme that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>izes trans-chrysanthemol to trans-chrysanthemal, while <i>TcALDH1</i> encodes an enzyme that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>izes trans-chrysanthemal into trans-chrysanthemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>. Transient coexpression of <i>TcADH2</i> and <i>TcALDH1</i> together with <i>TcCDS</i> in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaves results in the production of trans-chrysanthemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> as well as several other side products. The majority (58%) of trans-chrysanthemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> was glycosylated or otherwise modified. Overall, these data identify key steps in the biosynthesis of pyrethrins and demonstrate the feasibility of metabolic engineering to produce components of these defense compounds in a heterologous host.</p>

Structure Annotation and Quantification of Wheat Seed Oxidized Lipids by High-Resolution LC-MS/MS
<p>Lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation is a process ubiquitous in life, but the direct and comprehensive analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized lipids has been limited by available analytical methods. We applied high-resolution liquid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromat</span></strong>ography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to quantify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized lipids (glycerides, fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s, phospholipids, lysophospholipids, and galactolipids) and implemented a platform-independent high-throughput-amenable analysis pipeline for the high-confidence annotation and acyl composition analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized lipids. Lipid contents of 90 different naturally aged wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) seed stocks were quantified in an untargeted high-resolution LC-MS experiment, resulting in 18,556 quantitative mass-to-charge ratio features. In a posthoc liquid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromat</span></strong>ography-tandem mass spectrometry experiment, high-resolution MS/MS spectra (5 mD accuracy) were recorded for 8,957 out of 12,080 putatively monoisotopic features of the LC-MS data set. A total of 353 non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized and 559 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized lipids with up to four additional oxygen atoms were annotated based on the accurate mass recordings (1.5 ppm tolerance) of the LC-MS data set and filtering procedures. MS/MS spectra available for 828 of these annotations were analyzed by translating experimentally known fragmentation rules of lipids into the fragmentation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized lipids. This led to the identification of 259 non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized and 365 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized lipids by both accurate mass and MS/MS spectra and to the determination of acyl compositions for 221 non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized and 295 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized lipids. Analysis of 15-year aged wheat seeds revealed increased lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation and hydrolysis in seeds stored in ambient versus cold conditions.</p>

A Central Role for Triacylglycerol in Membrane Lipid Breakdown, Fatty Acid <i>β</i>-Oxidation, and Plant Survival under Extended Darkness
<p>Neutral lipid metabolism is a key aspect of intracellular homeostasis and energy balance and plays a vital role in cell survival under adverse conditions, including nutrient deprivation in yeast and mammals, but the role of triacylglycerol (TAG) metabolism in plant stress response remains largely unknown. By thoroughly characterizing mutants defective in SUGAR-DEPENDENT1 (SDP1) triacylglycerol lipase or PEROXISOMAL ABC TRANSPORTER 1 (PXA1), here we show that TAG is a key intermediate in the mobilization of fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s from membrane lipids for peroxisomal β-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation under prolonged dark treatment. Disruption of SDP1 increased TAG accumulation in cytosolic lipid droplets and markedly enhanced plant tolerance to extended darkness. We demonstrate that blocking TAG hydrolysis enhances plant tolerance to dark treatment via two distinct mechanisms. In <i>pxa1</i> mutants, in which free fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s accumulated rapidly under extended darkness, SDP1 disruption resulted in a marked decrease in levels of cytotoxic lipid intermediates such as free fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s and phosphatidic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, suggesting a buffer function of TAG accumulation against lipotoxicity under fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> overload. In the wild type, in which free fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s remained low and unchanged under dark treatment, disruption of SDP1 caused a decrease in reactive oxygen species production and hence the level of lipid per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation, indicating a role of TAG in protection against <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative damage. Overall, our findings reveal a crucial role for TAG metabolism in membrane lipid breakdown, fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> turnover, and plant survival under extended darkness.</p>

OsHAC1;1 and OsHAC1;2 Function as Arsenate Reductases and Regulate Arsenic Accumulation<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Rice is a major dietary source of the toxic metalloid arsenic (As). Reducing its accumulation in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) grain is of critical importance to food safety. Rice roots take up <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arsenat</span></strong>e and arsenite depending on the prevailing soil conditions. The first step of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arsenat</span></strong>e detoxification is its reduction to arsenite, but the enzyme(s) catalyzing this reaction in rice remains unknown. Here, we identify OsHAC1;1 and OsHAC1;2 as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arsenat</span></strong>e reductases in rice. <i>OsHAC1;1</i> and <i>OsHAC1;2</i> are able to complement an <i>Escherichia coli</i> mutant lacking the endogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arsenat</span></strong>e reductase and to reduce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arsenat</span></strong>e to arsenite. <i>OsHAC1:1</i> and <i>OsHAC1;2</i> are predominantly expressed in roots, with <i>OsHAC1;1</i> being abundant in the epidermis, root hairs, and pericycle cells while <i>OsHAC1;2</i> is abundant in the epidermis, outer layers of cortex, and endodermis cells. Expression of the two genes was induced by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arsenat</span></strong>e exposure. Knocking out <i>OsHAC1;1</i> or <i>OsHAC1;2</i> decreased the reduction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arsenat</span></strong>e to arsenite in roots, reducing arsenite efflux to the external medium. Loss of arsenite efflux was also associated with increased As accumulation in shoots. Greater effects were observed in a double mutant of the two genes. In contrast, overexpression of either <i>OsHAC1;1</i> or <i>OsHAC1;2</i> increased arsenite efflux, reduced As accumulation, and enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arsenat</span></strong>e tolerance. When grown under aerobic soil conditions, overexpression of either <i>OsHAC1;1</i> or <i>OsHAC1;2</i> also decreased As accumulation in rice grain, whereas grain As increased in the knockout mutants. We conclude that OsHAC1;1 and OsHAC1;2 are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arsenat</span></strong>e reductases that play an important role in restricting As accumulation in rice shoots and grain.</p>

Skeletal muscle fuel selection occurs at the mitochondrial level
<p>Mammals exponentially increase the rate of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbohydr</span></strong>ate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation as exercise intensity rises, while birds combust lipid almost exclusively while flying at high percentages of aerobic capacity. The fuel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized by contracting muscle depends on many factors: whole-body fuel storage mass, mobilization, blood transport, cellular uptake, and substrate selection at the level of the mitochondrion. We examined the fuel preferences of mitochondria isolated from mammalian and avian locomotory muscles using two approaches. First, the influence of substrates on the kinetics of respiration (<i>K</i><sub>m,ADP</sub> and <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>) was evaluated. For all substrates and combinations, <i>K</i><sub>m,ADP</sub> was generally twofold higher in avian mitochondria. Second, fuel competition between pyruvate, glutamate and/or palmitoyl-<sc>l</sc>-carnitine at three levels of ATP free energy was determined using the principle of mass balance and the measured rates of O<sub>2</sub> consumption and metabolite accumulation/utilization. Avian mitochondria strongly spared pyruvate from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation when another substrate was available and fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> was the dominant substrate, regardless of energy state. Mammalian mitochondria exhibited some preference for fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> over pyruvate at lower flux (higher energy state), but exhibited a much greater tendency to select pyruvate and glutamate when available. Studies in sonicated mitochondria revealed twofold higher electron transport chain electron conductance in avian mitochondria. We conclude that substantial fuel selection occurs at the level of the mitochondrial matrix and that avian flight muscle mitochondria are particularly biased toward the selection of fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, possibly by facilitating high β-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation flux by maintaining a more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized matrix.</p>

Major role of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria in dark ocean carbon fixation
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> fixation by chemoautotrophic microorganisms in the dark ocean has a major impact on global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> cycling and ecological relationships in the ocean’s interior, but the relevant taxa and energy sources remain enigmatic. We show evidence that nitrite-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>izing bacteria affiliated with the Nitrospinae phylum are important in dark ocean chemoautotrophy. Single-cell genomics and community metagenomics revealed that Nitrospinae are the most abundant and globally distributed nitrite-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>izing bacteria in the ocean. Metaproteomics and metatranscriptomics analyses suggest that nitrite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation is the main pathway of energy production in Nitrospinae. Microautoradiography, linked with catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization, indicated that Nitrospinae fix 15 to 45% of inorganic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> in the mesopelagic western North Atlantic. Nitrite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation may have a greater impact on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> cycle than previously assumed.</p>

Remobilization of crustal carbon may dominate volcanic arc emissions
<p>The flux of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> into and out of Earth’s surface environment has implications for Earth’s climate and habitability. We compiled a global data set for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> and helium isotopes from volcanic arcs and demonstrated that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> isotope composition of mean global volcanic gas is considerably heavier, at –3.8 to –4.6 per mil (‰), than the canonical mid-ocean ridge basalt value of –6.0‰.

Radiocarbon constraints imply reduced carbon uptake by soils during the 21st century
<p>Soil is the largest terrestrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> reservoir and may influence the sign and magnitude of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> cycle–climate feedbacks. Many Earth system models (ESMs) estimate a significant soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> sink by 2100, yet the underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> dynamics determining this response have not been systematically tested against observations. We used <sup>14</sup>C data from 157 globally distributed soil profiles sampled to 1-meter depth to show that ESMs underestimated the mean age of soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> by a factor of more than six (430 ± 50 years versus 3100 ± 1800 years). Consequently, ESMs overestimated the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> sequestration potential of soils by a factor of nearly two (40 ± 27%). These inconsistencies suggest that ESMs must better represent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> stabilization processes and the turnover time of slow and passive reservoirs when simulating future atmospheric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> di<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e dynamics.</p>

Autophagy Deficiency Compromises Alternative Pathways of Respiration following Energy Deprivation in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>Under heterotrophic conditions, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbohydr</span></strong>ate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation inside the mitochondrion is the primary energy source for cellular metabolism. However, during energy-limited conditions, alternative substrates are required to support respiration. Amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation in plant cells plays a key role in this by generating electrons that can be transferred to the mitochondrial electron transport chain via the electron transfer flavoprotein/ubiquinone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>oreductase system. Autophagy, a catabolic mechanism for macromolecule and protein recycling, allows the maintenance of amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> pools and nutrient remobilization. Although the association between autophagy and alternative respiratory substrates has been suggested, the extent to which autophagy and primary metabolism interact to support plant respiration remains unclear. To investigate the metabolic importance of autophagy during development and under extended darkness, Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants with disruption of autophagy (<i>atg</i> mutants) were used. Under normal growth conditions, <i>atg</i> mutants showed lower growth and seed production with no impact on photosynthesis. Following extended darkness, <i>atg</i> mutants were characterized by signatures of early senescence, including decreased chlorophyll content and maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II coupled with increases in dark respiration. Transcript levels of genes involved in alternative pathways of respiration and amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> catabolism were up-regulated in <i>atg</i> mutants. The metabolite profiles of dark-treated leaves revealed an extensive metabolic reprogramming in which increases in amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> levels were partially compromised in <i>atg</i> mutants. Although an enhanced respiration in <i>atg</i> mutants was observed during extended darkness, autophagy deficiency compromises protein degradation and the generation of amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s used as alternative substrates to the respiration.</p>

Inhibition of Endothelial Notch Signaling Impairs Fatty Acid Transport and Leads to Metabolic and Vascular Remodeling of the Adult Heart
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Nutrients are transported through endothelial cells before being metabolized in muscle cells. However, little is known about the regulation of endothelial transport processes. Notch signaling is a critical regulator of metabolism and angiogenesis during development. Here, we studied how genetic and pharmacological manipulation of endothelial Notch signaling in adult mice affects endothelial fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> transport, cardiac angiogenesis, and heart function.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Endothelial-specific Notch inhibition was achieved by conditional genetic inactivation of Rbp-jκ in adult mice to analyze fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> metabolism and heart function. Wild-type mice were treated with neutralizing antibodies against the Notch ligand Delta-like 4. Fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> transport was studied in cultured endothelial cells and transgenic mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Treatment of wild-type mice with Delta-like 4 neutralizing antibodies for 8 weeks impaired fractional shortening and ejection fraction in the majority of mice. Inhibition of Notch signaling specifically in the endothelium of adult mice by genetic ablation of Rbp-jκ caused heart hypertrophy and failure. Impaired heart function was preceded by alterations in fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> metabolism and an increase in cardiac blood vessel density. Endothelial Notch signaling controlled the expression of endothelial lipase, Angptl4, CD36, and Fabp4, which are all needed for fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> transport across the vessel wall. In endothelial-specific Rbp-jκ–mutant mice, lipase activity and transendothelial transport of long-chain fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s to muscle cells were impaired. In turn, lipids accumulated in the plasma and liver. The attenuated supply of cardiomyocytes with long-chain fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s was accompanied by higher glucose uptake, increased concentration of glycolysis intermediates, and mTOR-S6K signaling. Treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin or displacing glucose as cardiac substrate by feeding a ketogenic diet prolonged the survival of endothelial-specific Rbp-jκ–deficient mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This study identifies Notch signaling as a novel regulator of fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> transport across the endothelium and as an essential repressor of angiogenesis in the adult heart.

Effects of dormancy progression and low-temperature response on changes in the sorbitol concentration in xylem sap of Japanese pear during winter season
<p>In order to elucidate which physiological event(s) are involved in the seasonal changes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbohydr</span></strong>ate dynamics during winter, we examined the effects of different low temperatures on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbohydr</span></strong>ate concentrations of Japanese pear (<i>Pyrus pyrifolia</i> (Burm.) Nakai). For four winter seasons, large increases in the sorbitol concentration of shoot xylem sap occurred during mid- to late December, possibly due to the endodormancy completion and low-temperature responses. When trees were kept at 15 °C from 3 November to 3 December in order to postpone the initiation and completion of chilling accumulation that would break endodormancy, sorbitol accumulation in xylem sap was always higher from trees with sufficient chilling accumulation than from trees that received insufficient chilling. However, an additional increase in xylem sap sorbitol occurred around late December in trees regardless of whether their chilling accumulation naturally progressed or was postponed. To examine different temperature effects more closely, we compared the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbohydr</span></strong>ate concentrations of trees subjected to either 6 or 0 °C treatment. The sorbitol concentration in xylem sap tremendously increased at 0 °C treatment compared with 6 °C treatment. However, an additional increase in xylem sap sorbitol occurred at both the temperatures when sufficient chilling accumulated with a peak coinciding with the peak expression in shoots of the sorbitol transporter gene (<i>PpSOT2</i>). Interestingly, the total <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbohydr</span></strong>ate concentration of shoots tremendously increased with exposure to 0 °C compared with exposure to 6 °C, but was not affected by the amount of accumulated chilling. Instead, as chilling accumulated the ratio of sorbitol to total soluble sugars in shoots increased. We presumed that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbohydr</span></strong>ates in the shoot tissues may be converted to sorbitol and loaded into the xylem sap so that the sorbitol accumulation patterns were synchronized with the progression of dormancy, whereas the total <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbohydr</span></strong>ate transported into shoots from other storage organs may be related to freezing tolerance acquisition independent of dormancy progression. We thus propose that there are different effects of dormancy progression and low-temperature responses on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbohydr</span></strong>ate dynamics in Japanese pear.</p>

Microbial oxidation of lithospheric organic carbon in rapidly eroding tropical mountain soils
<p>Lithospheric organic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> (“petrogenic”; OC<sub>petro</sub>) is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized during exhumation and subsequent erosion of mountain ranges. This process is a considerable source of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> di<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e (CO<sub>2</sub>) to the atmosphere over geologic time scales, but the mechanisms that govern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation rates in mountain landscapes are poorly constrained. We demonstrate that, on average, 67 ± 11% of the OC<sub>petro</sub> initially present in bedrock exhumed from the tropical, rapidly eroding Central Range of Taiwan is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized in soils, leading to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of 6.1 to 18.6 metric tons of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> per square kilometer per year. The molecular and isotopic evolution of bulk OC and lipid biomarkers during soil formation reveals that OC<sub>petro</sub> remineralization is microbially mediated. Rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation in mountain soils drives CO<sub>2</sub> emission fluxes that increase with erosion rate, thereby counteracting CO<sub>2</sub> drawdown by silicate weathering and biospheric OC burial.</p>

Natural noncanonical protein splicing yields products with diverse β-amino acid residues
<p>Current textbook knowledge holds that the structural scope of ribosomal biosynthesis is based exclusively on α-amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> backbone topology. Here we report the genome-guided discovery of bacterial pathways that posttranslationally create β-amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>–containing products. The transformation is widespread in bacteria and is catalyzed by an enzyme belonging to a previously uncharacterized radical <i>S</i>-adenosylmethionine family. We show that the β-amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s result from an unusual protein splicing process involving backbone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> bond cleavage and net excision of tyramine.

In addition to enlarging the set of basic amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> components, the excision generates keto functions that are useful as orthogonal reaction sites for chemical diversification.</p>

Long-term pattern and magnitude of soil carbon feedback to the climate system in a warming world
<p>In a 26-year soil warming experiment in a mid-latitude hardwood forest, we documented changes in soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> cycling to investigate the potential consequences for the climate system. We found that soil warming results in a four-phase pattern of soil organic matter decay and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> di<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e fluxes to the atmosphere, with phases of substantial soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> loss alternating with phases of no detectable loss.

Genome-Scale Fluxome of <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973 Using Transient <sup>13</sup>C-Labeling Data
<p><i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973 (<i>Synechococcus</i> 2973) has the shortest reported doubling time (2.1 h) among cyanobacteria, making it a promising platform for the solar-based production of biochemicals. In this meta-analysis, its intracellular flux distribution was recomputed using genome-scale isotopic nonstationary <sup>13</sup>C-metabolic flux analysis given the labeling dynamics of 13 metabolites reported in an earlier study. To achieve this, a genome-scale mapping model, namely <i>i</i>mSyu593, was constructed using the <i>i</i>mSyn617 mapping model for <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 (<i>Synechocystis</i> 6803) as the starting point encompassing 593 reactions. The flux elucidation revealed nearly complete conversion (greater than 96%) of the assimilated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> into biomass in <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973. In contrast, <i>Synechocystis</i> 6803 achieves complete conversion of only 86% of the assimilated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>. This high biomass yield was enabled by the reincorporation of the fixed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>s lost in anabolic and photorespiratory pathways in conjunction with flux rerouting through a nondecarboxylating reaction such as phosphoketolase. This reincorporation of lost CO<sub>2</sub> sustains a higher flux through the photorespiratory C2 cycle that fully meets the glycine and serine demands for growth. In accordance with the high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> efficiency drive, acetyl-coenzyme A was entirely produced using the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>-efficient phosphoketolase pathway. Comparison of the <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973 flux map with that of <i>Synechocystis</i> 6803 revealed differences in the use of Calvin cycle and photorespiratory pathway reactions. The two species used different reactions for the synthesis of metabolites such as fructose-6-phosphate, glycine, sedoheptulose-7-phosphate, and Ser. These findings allude to a highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>-efficient metabolism alongside the fast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> uptake rate in <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973, which explains its faster growth rate.</p>

Identification of Genes Encoding Enzymes Catalyzing the Early Steps of Carrot Polyacetylene Biosynthesis
<p>Polyacetylenic lipids accumulate in various Apiaceae species after pathogen attack, suggesting that these compounds are naturally occurring pesticides and potentially valuable resources for crop improvement. These compounds also promote human health and slow tumor growth. Even though polyacetylenic lipids were discovered decades ago, the biosynthetic pathway underlying their production is largely unknown. To begin filling this gap and ultimately enable polyacetylene engineering, we studied polyacetylenes and their biosynthesis in the major Apiaceae crop carrot (<i>Daucus carota</i> subsp. <i>sativus</i>). Using gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromat</span></strong>ography and mass spectrometry, we identified three known polyacetylenes and assigned provisional structures to two novel polyacetylenes. We also quantified these compounds in carrot leaf, petiole, root xylem, root phloem, and root periderm extracts. Falcarindiol and falcarinol predominated and accumulated primarily in the root periderm. Since the multiple double and triple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> bonds that distinguish polyacetylenes from ubiquitous fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s are often introduced by Δ12 oleic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> desaturase (FAD2)-type enzymes, we mined the carrot genome for <i>FAD2</i> genes. We identified a <i>FAD2</i> family with an unprecedented 24 members and analyzed public, tissue-specific carrot RNA-Seq data to identify coexpressed members with root periderm-enhanced expression. Six candidate genes were heterologously expressed individually and in combination in yeast and Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), resulting in the identification of one canonical FAD2 that converts oleic to linoleic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, three divergent FAD2-like acetylenases that convert linoleic into crepenynic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, and two bifunctional FAD2s with Δ12 and Δ14 desaturase activity that convert crepenynic into the further desaturated dehydrocrepenynic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, a polyacetylene pathway intermediate. These genes can now be used as a basis for discovering other steps of falcarin-type polyacetylene biosynthesis, to modulate polyacetylene levels in plants, and to test the in planta function of these molecules.</p>

Network Analysis Reveals a Role for Salicylic Acid Pathway Components in Shade Avoidance
<p>Plants have sophisticated mechanisms for sensing neighbor shade. To maximize their ability to compete for light, plants respond to shade through enhanced elongation and physiological changes. The shade avoidance response affects many different organs and growth stages, yet the signaling pathways underlying this response have mostly been studied in seedlings. We assayed transcriptome changes in response to shade across a 2-d time course in the wild type and 12 Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants. The resulting temporal map of transcriptional responses to shade defines early and late responses in adult plants, enabling us to determine connections between key signaling genes and downstream responses. We found a pervasive and unexpectedly strong connection between shade avoidance and genes related to salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, suggesting salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> signaling to be an important shade avoidance growth regulator. We tested this connection and found that several mutants disrupting salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> levels or signaling were defective in shade avoidance. The effect of these mutations on shade avoidance was specific to petiole elongation; neither hypocotyl nor flowering time responses were altered, thereby defining important stage-specific differences in the downstream shade avoidance signaling pathway. Shade treatment did not change salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> levels, indicating that the mediation of shade avoidance by salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> is not dependent on the modulation of salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> levels. These results demonstrate that salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> pathway genes also are key components of petiole shade avoidance.</p>

Chloroplast Damage Induced by the Inhibition of Fatty Acid Synthesis Triggers Autophagy in Chlamydomonas
<p>Fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s are synthesized in the stroma of plant and algal chloroplasts by the fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthase complex. Newly synthesized fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s are then used to generate plastidial lipids that are essential for chloroplast structure and function. Here, we show that inhibition of fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthesis in the model alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> activates autophagy, a highly conserved catabolic process by which cells degrade intracellular material under adverse conditions to maintain cell homeostasis. Treatment of <i>Chlamydomonas</i> cells with cerulenin, a specific fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthase inhibitor, stimulated lipidation of the autophagosome protein ATG8 and enhanced autophagic flux. We found that inhibition of fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthesis decreased monogalactosyldiacylglycerol abundance, increased lutein content, down-regulated photosynthesis, and increased the production of reactive oxygen species. Electron microscopy revealed a high degree of thylakoid membrane stacking in cerulenin-treated cells. Moreover, global transcriptomic analysis of these cells showed an up-regulation of genes encoding chloroplast proteins involved in protein folding and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress and the induction of major catabolic processes, including autophagy and proteasome pathways. Thus, our results uncovered a link between lipid metabolism, chloroplast integrity, and autophagy through a mechanism that involves the activation of a chloroplast quality control system.</p>

Leaf Amino Acid Supply Affects Photosynthetic and Plant Nitrogen Use Efficiency under Nitrogen Stress
<p>The coordinated distribution of nitrogen to source leaves and sinks is essential for supporting leaf metabolism while also supplying sufficient nitrogen to seeds for development. This study aimed to understand how regulated amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> allocation to leaves affects photosynthesis and overall plant nitrogen use efficiency in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and how soil nitrogen availability influences these processes. Arabidopsis plants with a knockout of <i>AAP2</i>, encoding an amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> permease involved in xylem-to-phloem transfer of root-derived amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s, were grown in low-, moderate-, and high-nitrogen environments. We analyzed nitrogen allocation to shoot tissues, photosynthesis, and photosynthetic and plant nitrogen use efficiency in these knockout plants. Our results demonstrate that, independent of nitrogen conditions, <i>aap2</i> plants allocate more nitrogen to leaves than wild-type plants. Increased leaf nitrogen supply positively affected chlorophyll and Rubisco levels, photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> assimilation and transport to sinks. The <i>aap2</i> plants outperformed wild-type plants with respect to growth, seed yield and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> storage pools, and nitrogen use efficiency in both high and deficient nitrogen environments. Overall, this study demonstrates that increasing nitrogen allocation to leaves represents an effective strategy for improving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> fixation and photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency. The results indicate that an optimized coordination of nitrogen and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> partitioning processes is critical for high oilseed production in Arabidopsis, including in plants exposed to limiting nitrogen conditions.</p>

Oxidation of Translation Factor EF-Tu Inhibits the Repair of Photosystem II<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The repair of photosystem II (PSII) is particularly sensitive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress and the inhibition of repair is associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative damage to the translational elongation system in the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this inhibition are unknown. We previously demonstrated in vitro that EF-Tu, a translation factor that delivers aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosome, is inactivated by reactive oxygen species via <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation of the Cys residue Cys-82. In this study, we examined the physiological role of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation of EF-Tu in <i>Synechocystis</i>. Under strong light, EF-Tu was rapidly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized to yield <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized monomers in vivo. We generated a <i>Synechocystis</i> transformant that expressed mutated EF-Tu in which Cys-82 had been replaced with a Ser residue. Under strong light, the de novo synthesis of proteins that are required for PSII repair, such as D1, was enhanced in the transformant and photoinhibition of PSII was alleviated. However, photodamage to PSII, measured in the presence of lincomycin, was similar between the transformant and wild-type cells, suggesting that expression of mutated EF-Tu might enhance the repair of PSII.

Stearoyl-Acyl Carrier Protein Desaturase Mutations Uncover an Impact of Stearic Acid in Leaf and Nodule Structure
<p>Stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturase (SACPD-C) has been reported to control the accumulation of seed stearic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>; however, no study has previously reported its involvement in leaf stearic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> content and impact on leaf structure and morphology. A subset of an ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenized population of soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) ‘Forrest’ was screened to identify mutants within the <i>GmSACPD-C</i> gene. Using a forward genetics approach, one nonsense and four missense <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutants were identified to have high levels of seed, nodule, and leaf stearic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> content. Homology modeling and in silico analysis of the GmSACPD-C enzyme revealed that most of these mutations were localized near or at conserved residues essential for diiron ion coordination. Soybeans carrying <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutations at conserved residues showed the highest stearic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> content, and these mutations were found to have deleterious effects on nodule development and function. Interestingly, mutations at nonconserved residues show an increase in stearic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> content yet retain healthy nodules. Thus, random mutagenesis and mutational analysis allows for the achievement of high seed stearic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> content with no associated negative agronomic characteristics. Additionally, expression analysis demonstrates that nodule leghemoglobin transcripts were significantly more abundant in soybeans with deleterious mutations at conserved residues of GmSACPD-C. Finally, we report that <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutations cause an increase in leaf stearic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> content and an alteration of leaf structure and morphology in addition to differences in nitrogen-fixing nodule structure.</p>

Network-Guided GWAS Improves Identification of Genes Affecting Free Amino Acids
<p>Amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s are essential for proper growth and development in plants. Amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s serve as building blocks for proteins but also are important for responses to stress and the biosynthesis of numerous essential compounds. In seed, the pool of free amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s (FAAs) also contributes to alternative energy, desiccation, and seed vigor; thus, manipulating FAA levels can significantly impact a seed’s nutritional qualities. While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on branched-chain amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s have identified some regulatory genes controlling seed FAAs, the genetic regulation of FAA levels, composition, and homeostasis in seeds remains mostly unresolved. Hence, we performed GWAS on 18 FAAs from a 313-ecotype Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) association panel. Specifically, GWAS was performed on 98 traits derived from known amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> metabolic pathways (approach 1) and then on 92 traits generated from an unbiased correlation-based metabolic network analysis (approach 2), and the results were compared. The latter approach facilitated the discovery of additional novel metabolic interactions and single-nucleotide polymorphism-trait associations not identified by the former approach. The most prominent network-guided GWAS signal was for a histidine (His)-related trait in a region containing two genes: a cationic amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> transporter (CAT4) and a polynucleotide phosphorylase resistant to inhibition with fosmidomycin. A reverse genetics approach confirmed CAT4 to be responsible for the natural variation of His-related traits across the association panel. Given that His is a semiessential amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> and a potent metal chelator, CAT4 orthologs could be considered as candidate genes for seed quality biofortification in crop plants.</p>

An Oxalyl-CoA Synthetase Is Involved in Oxalate Degradation and Aluminum Tolerance
<p>Acyl Activating Enzyme3 (AAE3) was identified to be involved in the catabolism of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxal</span></strong>ate, which is critical for seed development and defense against fungal pathogens. However, the role of AAE3 protein in abiotic stress responses is unknown. Here, we investigated the role of rice bean (<i>Vigna umbellata</i>) VuAAE3 in Al tolerance. Recombinant VuAAE3 protein has specific activity against <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxal</span></strong>ate, with <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> = 121 ± 8.2 µ<sc>m</sc> and <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> of 7.7 ± 0.88 µmol min<sup>−1</sup> mg<sup>−1</sup> protein, indicating it functions as an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxal</span></strong>yl-CoA synthetase. VuAAE3-GFP localization suggested that this enzyme is a soluble protein with no specific subcellular localization. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and <i>VuAAE3</i> promoter-GUS reporter analysis showed that the expression induction of <i>VuAAE3</i> is mainly confined to rice bean root tips. Accumulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxal</span></strong>ate was induced rapidly by Al stress in rice bean root tips, and exogenous application of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxal</span></strong>ate resulted in the inhibition of root elongation and <i>VuAAE3</i> expression induction, suggesting that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxal</span></strong>ate accumulation is involved in Al-induced root growth inhibition. Furthermore, overexpression of VuAAE3 in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) resulted in the increase of Al tolerance, which was associated with the decrease of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxal</span></strong>ate accumulation. In addition, <i>NtMATE</i> and <i>NtALS3</i> expression showed no difference between transgenic lines and wild-type plants. Taken together, our results suggest that VuAAE3-dependent turnover of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxal</span></strong>ate plays a critical role in Al tolerance mechanisms.</p>

Combined effects of defoliation and water stress on pine growth and non-structural carbohydrates
<p>Climate change is expected to increase both pest insect damage and the occurrence of severe drought. There is therefore a need to better understand the combined effects of biotic and abiotic damage on tree growth in order to predict the multi-factorial effect of climate change on forest ecosystem productivity. Indeed, the effect of stress interactions on tree growth is an increasingly important topic that greatly lacks experiments and data, and it is unlikely that the impact of combined stresses can be extrapolated from the outcomes of studies that focused on a single stress. We developed an original manipulative study under real field conditions where we applied artificial defoliation and induced water stress on 10-year-old (∼10 m high) maritime pine trees (<i>Pinus pinaster</i> Ait.). Tree response to combined stresses was quantitatively assessed following tree secondary growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbohydr</span></strong>ate pools. Such a design allowed us to address the crucial question of combined stresses on trees under stand conditions, sharing soil supplies with neighboring trees. Our initial hypotheses were that (i) moderate defoliation can limit the impact of water stress on tree growth through reduced transpiration demand by a tree canopy partly defoliated and that (ii) defoliation results in reduced non-structural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbohydr</span></strong>ate (NSC) pools, affecting tree tolerance to drought. Our results showed additive effects of defoliation and water stress on tree growth and contradict our initial hypothesis. Indeed, under stand conditions, we found that partial defoliation does not limit the impact of water stress through reduced transpiration. Our study also highlighted that, even if NSC in all organs were affected by defoliation, tree response to water stress was not triggered. We found that stem NSC were maintained or increased during the entire growing season, supporting literature-based hypotheses such as an active maintenance of the hydraulic system or another limiting resource for tree growth under defoliation. We also observed a significant decrease in root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbohydr</span></strong>ates, which suggests a shift in the root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> balance under defoliation. The decrease in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbohydr</span></strong>ate supply under defoliation may not counterbalance the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> use for mineral and water uptakes or a translocation to other tissues.</p>

Activation of master virulence regulator PhoP in acidic pH requires the <i>Salmonella</i>-specific protein UgtL
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>ic conditions, such as those inside phagosomes, stimulate the intracellular pathogen <i>Salmonella enterica</i> to activate virulence genes. The sensor PhoQ responds to a mildly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>ic pH by phosphorylating, and thereby activating, the virulence regulator PhoP. This PhoP/PhoQ two-component system is conserved in a subset of Gram-negative bacteria. PhoQ is thought to be sufficient to activate PhoP in mildly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>ic pH. However, we found that the <i>Salmonella</i>-specific protein UgtL, which was horizontally acquired by <i>Salmonella</i> before the divergence of <i>S. enterica</i> and <i>Salmonella bongori</i>, was also necessary for PhoQ to activate PhoP under mildly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>ic pH conditions but not for PhoQ to activate PhoP in response to low Mg<sup>2+</sup> or the antimicrobial peptide C18G. UgtL increased the abundance of phosphorylated PhoP by stimulating autophosphorylation of PhoQ, thereby increasing the amount of the phosphodonor for PhoP. Deletion of <i>ugtL</i> attenuated <i>Salmonella</i> virulence and further reduced PhoP activation in a strain bearing a form of PhoQ that is not responsive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>ic pH. These data suggest that when <i>Salmonella</i> experiences mildly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>ic pH, PhoP activation requires PhoQ to detect pH and UgtL to amplify the PhoQ response. Our findings reveal how acquisition of a foreign gene can strengthen signal responsiveness in an ancestral regulatory system.</p>

Reversibility of citrate synthase allows autotrophic growth of a thermophilic bacterium
<p>Biological inorganic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> fixation proceeds through a number of fundamentally different autotrophic pathways that are defined by specific key enzymatic reactions. Detection of the enzymatic genes in (meta)genomes is widely used to estimate the contribution of individual organisms or communities to primary production. Here we show that the sulfur-reducing anaerobic deltaproteobacterium <i>Desulfurella acetivorans</i> is capable of both acetate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation and autotrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> fixation, with the tricarboxylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> cycle operating either in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative or reductive direction, respectively. Under autotrophic conditions, the enzyme citrate synthase cleaves citrate adenosine triphosphate independently into acetyl coenzyme A and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxal</span></strong>oacetate, a reaction that has been regarded as impossible under physiological conditions. Because this overlooked, energetically efficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> fixation pathway lacks key enzymes, it may function unnoticed in many organisms, making bioinformatical predictions difficult, if not impossible.</p>

Contrasting carbon cycle responses of the tropical continents to the 2015–2016 El Niño

What Quantity of Photosystem I Is Optimum for Safe Photosynthesis?
<p>PSI has the potential to generate reactive oxygen species and be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>atively inactivated by the reactive oxygen species. The photo-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative damage of PSI (also called PSI photoinhibition) causes the inhibition of the plant growth and is a lethal event for plants. It has been reported that PSI photoinhibition does not occur as long as the reaction-center chlorophyll (P700) remains <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized, even in excess light conditions. This process is termed P700 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation and is supported by various regulatory mechanisms and likely also by the stoichiometric quantities of photosynthetic apparatus. In this study, we assessed how decreased photochemically active PSI in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) affected a variety of photosynthetic parameters, including P700 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation. Inactivation of PSI was rapidly and selectively induced by repetitive short-pulse illumination. PSI photoinhibition correlated linearly with decreases in effective quantum yield of PSII and nonphotochemical quenching; however, the photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate was less affected, as exemplified by ∼50% of the normal CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate maintained with an 80% loss in PSI photochemical activity. In contrast, effective quantum yield of PSI was enhanced following PSI photoinhibition, mainly owing to a decrease in the electron donor-side limitation of PSI. Based on these results, we propose that the stoichiometric quantity of PSI is optimized to induce P700 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation for dissipating excess light energy in PSI, thus avoiding inhibition of photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation caused by PSI photoinhibition.</p>

ARSENATE INDUCED CHLOROSIS 1/ TRANSLOCON AT THE OUTER ENVOLOPE MEMBRANE OF CHLOROPLASTS 132 Protects Chloroplasts from Arsenic Toxicity
<p>Arsenic (As) is highly toxic to plants and detoxified primarily through complexation with phytochelatins (PCs) and other thiol compounds. To understand the mechanisms of As toxicity and detoxification beyond PCs, we isolated an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arsenat</span></strong>e-sensitive mutant of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arsenat</span></strong>e induced chlorosis1</i> (<i>aic1</i>), in the background of the PC synthase-defective mutant <i>cadmium-sensitive1-3</i> (<i>cad1-3</i>). Under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arsenat</span></strong>e stress, <i>aic1 cad1-3</i> showed larger decreases in chlorophyll content and the number and size of chloroplasts than <i>cad1-3</i> and a severely distorted chloroplast structure. The <i>aic1</i> single mutant also was more sensitive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arsenat</span></strong>e than the wild type (Columbia-0). As concentrations in the roots, shoots, and chloroplasts were similar between <i>aic1 cad1-3</i> and <i>cad1-3</i>. Using genome resequencing and complementation, <i>TRANSLOCON AT THE OUTER ENVOLOPE MEMBRANE OF CHLOROPLAST132</i> (<i>TOC132</i>) was identified as the mutant gene, which encodes a translocon protein involved in the import of preproteins from the cytoplasm into the chloroplasts. Proteomic analysis showed that the proteome of <i>aic1 cad1-3</i> chloroplasts was more affected by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arsenat</span></strong>e stress than that of <i>cad1-3</i>. A number of proteins related to chloroplast ribosomes, photosynthesis, compound synthesis, and thioredoxin systems were less abundant in <i>aic1 cad1-3</i> than in <i>cad1-3</i> under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arsenat</span></strong>e stress. Our results indicate that chloroplasts are a sensitive target of As toxicity and that AIC1/Toc132 plays an important role in protecting chloroplasts from As toxicity.</p>

Diurnal Variation in Nonstructural Carbohydrate Storage in Trees: Remobilization and Vertical Mixing
<p>Nonstructural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbohydr</span></strong>ate (NSC) storage plays a critical role in tree function and survival, but understanding and predicting local NSC storage dynamics is challenging because NSC storage pools are dispersed throughout the complex architecture of trees and continuously exchange <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> between source and sink organs at different time scales. To address these knowledge gaps, characterization and understanding of NSC diel variation are necessary. Here, we analyzed diurnal NSC dynamics in the overall architecture of almond (<i>Prunus dulcis</i>) trees. We also analyzed the allocation of newly assimilated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> using isotopic labeling. We show that both components of NSC (i.e. soluble <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbohydr</span></strong>ates and starch) are highly dynamic at the diurnal time scale and that these trends are influenced by tissue type, age, and/or position within the canopy. In leaves, starch reserves can be depleted completely during the night, while woody tissue starch levels may vary by more than 50% over a daily cycle. Recently assimilated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> showed a dispersed downward allocation across the entire tree. NSC diurnal fluctuations within the tree’s structure in combination with dispersed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> allocation patterns provide evidence for the presence of vertical mixing and suggest that the xylem acts as a secondary NSC redistribution pathway.</p>

Screening for Biologically Annotated Drugs That Trigger Triacylglycerol Accumulation in the Diatom <i>Phaeodactylum</i>
<p>Microalgae are a promising feedstock for the production of triacylglycerol (TAG) for a variety of potential applications, ranging from food and human health to biofuels and green chemistry. However, obtaining high TAG yields is challenging. A phenotypic assay for the accumulation of oil droplets was developed to screen a library of 1,200 drugs, annotated with pharmacology information, to select compounds that trigger TAG accumulation in the diatom <i>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</i>. Using this screen, we identified 34 molecules acting in a dose-dependent manner. Previously characterized targets of these compounds include cell division and cell signaling effectors, membrane receptors and transporters, and sterol metabolism. Among the five compounds possibly acting on sterol metabolism, we focused our study on ethynylestradiol, a synthetic form of estrogen that is used in contraceptive pills and known for its ecological impact as an endocrine disruptor. Ethynylestradiol impaired the production of very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s, destabilized the galactolipid versus phospholipid balance, and triggered the recycling of fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s from membrane lipids to TAG. The <i>P. tricornutum</i> transcriptomic response to treatment with ethynylestradiol was consistent with the reallocation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> from sterols to acetyl-coenzyme A and TAG. The mode of action and catabolism of ethynylestradiol are unknown but might involve several up-regulated cytochrome P450 proteins. A fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> elongase, Δ6-ELO-B1, might be involved in the impairment of very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s and fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> turnover. This phenotypic screen opens new perspectives for the exploration of novel bioactive molecules, potential target genes, and pathways controlling TAG biosynthesis. It also unraveled the sensitivity of diatoms to endocrine disruptors, highlighting an impact of anthropogenic pollution on phytoplankton.</p>

3-Hydroxyisobutyrate Dehydrogenase Is Involved in Both, Valine and Isoleucine Degradation in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>In plants, amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> catabolism is especially relevant in metabolic stress situations (e.g. limited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbohydr</span></strong>ate availability during extended darkness). Under these conditions, amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s are used as alternative substrates for respiration. Complete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation of the branched-chain amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s (BCAAs) leucine, isoleucine (Ile), and valine (Val) in the mitochondria efficiently allows the formation of ATP by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative phosphorylation. However, the metabolic pathways for BCAA breakdown are largely unknown so far in plants. A systematic search for Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) genes encoding proteins resembling enzymes involved in BCAA catabolism in animals, fungi, and bacteria as well as proteomic analyses of mitochondrial fractions from Arabidopsis allowed the identification of a putative 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase, AtHDH1 (At4g20930), involved in Val degradation. Systematic substrate screening analyses revealed that the protein uses 3-hydroxyisobutyrate but additionally 3-hydroxypropionate as substrates. This points to a role of the enzyme not only in Val but possibly also in Ile metabolism. At4g20930 knockdown plants were characterized to test this conclusion. Root toxicity assays revealed increased root growth inhibition of the mutants if cultivated in the presence of Val or Ile but not in the presence of leucine. We conclude that AtHDH1 has a dual role in BCAA metabolism in plants.</p>

Variation in Leaf Respiration Rates at Night Correlates with Carbohydrate and Amino Acid Supply
<p>Plant respiration can theoretically be fueled by and dependent upon an array of central metabolism components; however, which ones are responsible for the quantitative variation found in respiratory rates is unknown. Here, large-scale screens revealed 2-fold variation in nighttime leaf respiration rate (R<sub>N</sub>) among mature leaves from an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) natural accession collection grown under common favorable conditions. R<sub>N</sub> variation was mostly maintained in the absence of genetic variation, which emphasized the low heritability of R<sub>N</sub> and its plasticity toward relatively small environmental differences within the sampling regime. To pursue metabolic explanations for leaf R<sub>N</sub> variation, parallel metabolite level profiling and assays of total protein and starch were performed. Within an accession, R<sub>N</sub> correlated strongly with stored <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> substrates, including starch and dicarboxylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s, as well as sucrose, major amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s, shikimate, and salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>. Among different accessions, metabolite-R<sub>N</sub> correlations were maintained with protein, sucrose, and major amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s but not stored <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> substrates. A complementary screen of the effect of exogenous metabolites and effectors on leaf R<sub>N</sub> revealed that (1) R<sub>N</sub> is stimulated by the uncoupler FCCP and high levels of substrates, demonstrating that both adenylate turnover and substrate supply can limit leaf R<sub>N</sub>, and (2) inorganic nitrogen did not stimulate R<sub>N</sub>, consistent with limited nighttime nitrogen assimilation. Simultaneous measurements of R<sub>N</sub> and protein synthesis revealed that these processes were largely uncorrelated in mature leaves. These results indicate that differences in preceding daytime metabolic activities are the major source of variation in mature leaf R<sub>N</sub> under favorable controlled conditions.</p>

Cytosolic and Chloroplastic DHARs Cooperate in Oxidative Stress-Driven Activation of the Salicylic Acid Pathway
<p>The complexity of plant anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative systems gives rise to many unresolved questions. One relates to the functional importance of dehydroascorbate reductases (DHARs) in interactions between ascorbate and glutathione. To investigate this issue, we produced a complete set of loss-of-function mutants for the three annotated Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) DHARs. The combined loss of <i>DHAR1</i> and <i>DHAR3</i> expression decreased extractable activity to very low levels but had little effect on phenotype or ascorbate and glutathione pools in standard conditions. An analysis of the subcellular localization of the DHARs in Arabidopsis lines stably transformed with GFP fusion proteins revealed that DHAR1 and DHAR2 are cytosolic while DHAR3 is chloroplastic, with no evidence for peroxisomal or mitochondrial localizations. When the mutations were introduced into an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress genetic background (<i>cat2</i>), the <i>dhar1 dhar2</i> combination decreased glutathione <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation and inhibited <i>cat2</i>-triggered induction of the salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> pathway. These effects were reversed in <i>cat2 dhar1 dhar2 dhar3</i> complemented with any of the three DHARs. The data suggest that (1) DHAR can be decreased to negligible levels without marked effects on ascorbate pools, (2) the cytosolic isoforms are particularly important in coupling intracellular hydrogen per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e metabolism to glutathione <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation, and (3) DHAR-dependent glutathione <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation influences redox-driven salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> accumulation.</p>

Aldehyde Oxidase 4 Plays a Critical Role in Delaying Silique Senescence by Catalyzing Aldehyde Detoxification
<p>The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) aldehyde <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ases are a multigene family of four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ases (AAO1–AAO4) that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ize a variety of aldehydes, among them abscisic aldehyde, which is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized to the phytohormone abscisic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>. Toxic aldehydes are generated in plants both under normal conditions and in response to stress. The detoxification of such aldehydes by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation is attributed to aldehyde dehydrogenases but never to aldehyde <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ases. The feasibility of the detoxification of aldehydes in siliques via <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation by AAO4 was demonstrated, first, by its ability to efficiently <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ize an array of aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes, including the reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>yl species (RCS) acrolein, hydroxyl-2-nonenal, and malondialdehyde. Next, exogenous application of several aldehydes to siliques in AAO4 knockout (KO) Arabidopsis plants induced severe tissue damage and enhanced malondialdehyde levels and senescence symptoms, but not in wild-type siliques. Furthermore, abiotic stresses such as dark and ultraviolet C irradiation caused an increase in endogenous RCS and higher expression levels of senescence marker genes, leading to premature senescence of KO siliques, whereas RCS and senescence marker levels in wild-type siliques were hardly affected. Finally, in naturally senesced KO siliques, higher endogenous RCS levels were associated with enhanced senescence molecular markers, chlorophyll degradation, and earlier seed shattering compared with the wild type. The aldehyde-dependent differential generation of super<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e and hydrogen per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e by AAO4 and the induction of AAO4 expression by hydrogen per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e shown here suggest a self-amplification mechanism for detoxifying additional reactive aldehydes produced during stress. Taken together, our results indicate that AAO4 plays a critical role in delaying senescence in siliques by catalyzing aldehyde detoxification.</p>

Photochemical Route for Accessing Amorphous Metal Oxide Materials for Water Oxidation Catalysis
<sec><title>Amorphous and More Active</title><p>The electrochemical generation of hydrogen from water could help in the storage of energy generated by renewable resources at off-peak times. However, catalysts for the slow step of this reaction, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), are based on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>es of noble metals (iridium and ruthenium) that have limited abundance. A strategy for improving the performance of earth-abundant elements is to explore mixed-metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>es and to prepare these as amorphous phases. <bold>Smith <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 60, published online 28 March) developed a general method for preparing amorphous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>es, based on photodecomposition of organometallic precursors. Amorphous mixed-metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>es of iron, nickel, and cobalt were more active than comparable crystalline materials and provided OER performance comparable to noble metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>es.</p></sec>

Nodulin Intrinsic Protein 7;1 Is a Tapetal Boric Acid Channel Involved in Pollen Cell Wall Formation
<p>Boron is an essential plant micronutrient that plays a structural role in the rhamnogalacturonan II component of the pectic cell wall. To prevent boron deficiency under limiting conditions, its uptake, distribution, and homeostasis are mediated by boric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> transporters and channel proteins. Among the membrane channels that facilitate boric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> uptake are the type II nodulin intrinsic protein (NIP) subfamily of aquaporin-like proteins. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) possesses three NIP II genes (<i>NIP5;1</i>, <i>NIP6;1</i>, and <i>NIP7;1</i>) that show distinct tissue expression profiles (predominantly expressed in roots, stem nodes, and developing flowers, respectively). Orthologs of each are represented in all dicots. Here, we show that purified and reconstituted NIP7;1 is a boric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> facilitator. By using native promoter-reporter fusions, we show that NIP7;1 is expressed predominantly in anthers of young flowers in a narrow developmental window, floral stages 9 and 10, with protein accumulation solely within tapetum cells, where it is localized to the plasma membrane. Under limiting boric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> conditions, loss-of-function T-DNA mutants (<i>nip7;1-1</i> and <i>nip7;1-2</i>) show reduced fertility, including shorter siliques and an increase in aborted seeds, compared with the wild type. Under these conditions, <i>nip7;1</i> mutant pollen grains show morphological defects, increased aggregation, defective exine cell wall formation, reduced germination frequency, and decreased viability. During stages 9 and 10, the tapetum is essential for supplying materials to the pollen microspore cell wall. We propose that NIP7;1 serves as a gated boric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> channel in developing anthers that aids in the uptake of this critical micronutrient by tapetal cells.</p>

Protein Carbonylation and Glycation in Legume Nodules
<p>Nitrogen fixation is an agronomically and environmentally important process catalyzed by bacterial nitrogenase within legume root nodules. These unique symbiotic organs have high metabolic rates and produce large amounts of reactive oxygen species that may modify proteins irreversibly. Here, we examined two types of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative posttranslational modifications of nodule proteins: <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>ylation, which occurs by direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation of certain amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s or by interaction with reactive aldehydes arising from cell membrane lipid per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>es; and glycation, which results from the reaction of lysine and arginine residues with reducing sugars or their auto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation products. We used a strategy based on the enrichment of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>ylated peptides by affinity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromat</span></strong>ography followed by liquid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromat</span></strong>ography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify 369 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized proteins in bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) nodules. Of these, 238 corresponded to plant proteins and 131 to bacterial proteins. Lipid per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation products induced most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>ylation sites. This study also revealed that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>ylation has major effects on two key nodule proteins. Metal-catalyzed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation caused the inactivation of malate dehydrogenase and the aggregation of leghemoglobin. In addition, numerous glycated proteins were identified in vivo, including three key nodule proteins: sucrose synthase, glutamine synthetase, and glutamate synthase. Label-free quantification identified 10 plant proteins and 18 bacterial proteins as age-specifically glycated. Overall, our results suggest that the selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>ylation or glycation of crucial proteins involved in nitrogen metabolism, transcriptional regulation, and signaling may constitute a mechanism to control cell metabolism and nodule senescence.</p>

A Specific Glycogen Mobilization Strategy Enables Rapid Awakening of Dormant Cyanobacteria from Chlorosis
<p>Many organisms survive stressful conditions via entry into a dormant state that can be rapidly exited when the stressor disappears; this ability provides a strong selective advantage. In the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803, the exit from nitrogen chlorosis takes less than 48 h and is enabled by the impressive metabolic flexibility of these cyanobacteria, which pass through heterotrophic and mixotrophic phases before reentering photoautotrophic growth. Switching between these states requires delicate coordination of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbohydr</span></strong>ate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation, CO<sub>2</sub> fixation, and photosynthesis. Here, we investigated the contribution of the different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> catabolic routes by assessing mutants of these pathways during nitrogen chlorosis and resuscitation. The addition of nitrate to nitrogen-starved cells rapidly starts the awakening program. Metabolism switches from maintenance metabolism, characterized by residual photosynthesis and low cellular ATP levels, to an initial heterotrophic phase, characterized by respiration and an immediate increase in ATP levels. This respiration relies on glycogen breakdown catalyzed by the glycogen phosphorylase GlgP2. In the following transient mixotrophic phase, photosynthesis and CO<sub>2</sub> fixation restart and glycogen is consumed. During the mixotrophic phase, parallel operation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative pentose phosphate cycle and the Entner-Doudoroff pathway is required for resuscitation to proceed; the glycolytic route via the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway has minor importance. Our data suggest that, during resuscitation, only the Entner-Doudoroff and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative pentose phosphate pathways supply the metabolic intermediates necessary for the anabolic reactions required to reconstitute a vegetative cell. Intriguingly, the key enzymes for glycogen catabolism are already expressed during the preceding chlorotic phase, in apparent preparation for rapid resuscitation.</p>

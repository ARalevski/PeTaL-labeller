Genetics of Variable Disease Expression Conferred by Inverse Gene-For-Gene Interactions in the Wheat-<i>Parastagonospora nodorum</i> Pathosystem
<p>The wheat-<i>Parastagonospora nodorum</i> pathosystem involves the recognition of pathogen-secreted necrotrophic effectors (NEs) by corresponding wheat NE sensitivity genes. This inverse gene-for-gene recognition leads to necrotrophic effector-triggered susceptibility and ultimately septoria nodorum blotch disease. Here, we used multiple pathogen isolates to individually evaluate the effects of the host gene-NE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions <i>Tan spot necrosis1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum ToxinA (<i>Tsn1</i>-SnToxA), <i>Stagonospora nodorum necrosis1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum Toxin1 (<i>Snn1</i>-SnTox1), and <i>Stagonospora nodorum necrosis3-B genome homeolog1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum Toxin3 (<i>Snn3-B1</i>-SnTox3), alone and in various combinations, to determine the relative importance of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions in causing disease. Genetic analysis of a recombinant inbred wheat population inoculated separately with three <i>P. nodorum</i> isolates, all of which produce all three NEs, indicated that the <i>Tsn1</i>-SnToxA and <i>Snn3-B1</i>-SnTox3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions contributed to disease caused by all four isolates, but their effects varied and ranged from epistatic to additive. The <i>Snn1</i>-SnTox1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion was associated with increased disease for one isolate, but for other isolates, there was evidence that this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion inhibited the expression of other host gene-NE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions. RNA sequencing analysis in planta showed that <i>SnTox1</i> was differentially expressed between these three isolates after infection. Further analysis of NE gene-knockout isolates showed that the effect of some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions could be masked or inhibited by other compatible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions, and the regulation of this occurs at the level of NE gene transcription. Collectively, these results show that the inverse gene-for-gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions leading to necrotrophic effector-triggered susceptibility in the wheat-<i>P. nodorum</i> pathosystem vary in their effects depending on the genetic backgrounds of the pathogen and host, and interplay among the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions is complex and intricately regulated.</p>

Systematic analysis of complex genetic interactions
<p>To systematically explore complex genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions, we constructed ~200,000 yeast triple mutants and scored negative trigenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions. We selected double-mutant query genes across a broad spectrum of biological processes, spanning a range of quantitative features of the global digenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion network and tested for a genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion with a third mutation. Trigenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions often occurred among functionally related genes, and essential genes were hubs on the trigenic network. Despite their functional enrichment, trigenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions tended to link genes in distant bioprocesses and displayed a weaker magnitude than digenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions. We estimate that the global trigenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion network is ~100 times as large as the global digenic network, highlighting the potential for complex genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions to affect the biology of inheritance, including the genotype-to-phenotype relationship.</p>

Generation of specific inhibitors of SUMO-1– and SUMO-2/3–mediated protein-protein interactions using Affimer (Adhiron) technology
<p>Because protein-protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions underpin most biological processes, developing tools that target them to understand their function or to inform the development of therapeutics is an important task. SUMOylation is the posttranslational covalent attachment of proteins in the SUMO family (SUMO-1, SUMO-2, or SUMO-3), and it regulates numerous cellular pathways. SUMOylated proteins are recognized by proteins with SUMO-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion motifs (SIMs) that facilitate noncovalent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions with SUMO. We describe the use of the Affimer system of peptide display for the rapid isolation of synthetic binding proteins that inhibit SUMO-dependent protein-protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions mediated by SIMs both in vitro and in cells. Crucially, these synthetic proteins did not prevent SUMO conjugation either in vitro or in cell-based systems, enabling the specific analysis of SUMO-mediated protein-protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions. Furthermore, through structural analysis and molecular modeling, we explored the molecular mechanisms that may underlie their specificity in interfering with either SUMO-1–mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions mediated by either SUMO-2 or SUMO-3. Not only will these reagents enable investigation of the biological roles of SUMOylation, but the Affimer technology used to generate these synthetic binding proteins could also be exploited to design or validate reagents or therapeutics that target other protein-protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions.</p>

Loss of Cardioprotective Effects at the <i>ADAMTS7</i> Locus as a Result of Gene-Smoking Interactions
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Common diseases such as coronary heart disease (CHD) are complex in etiology. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion of genetic susceptibility with lifestyle factors may play a prominent role.

Isoscapes resolve species-specific spatial patterns in plant–plant interactions in an invaded Mediterranean dune ecosystem
<p>Environmental heterogeneity and plant–plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions are key factors shaping plant communities. However, the spatial dimension of plant–plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions has seldom been addressed in field studies. This is at least partially rooted in a lack of methods that can accurately resolve functional processes in a spatially explicit manner. Isoscapes, that is, spatially explicit representations of stable isotope data, provide a versatile means to trace functional changes on spatial scales, for example, related to N-cycling (foliar δ<sup>15</sup>N) and water use efficiency (WUE<sub>i</sub>, foliar δ<sup>13</sup>C). In a case study in a nutrient-depleted Mediterranean dune ecosystem, we analysed the spatial impact of the invasive N<sub>2</sub>-fixing <i>Acacia longifolia</i> on three native species of different functional types using δ<sup>15</sup>N and δ<sup>13</sup>C isoscapes and spatial autocorrelation analyses. Isoscapes revealed strong spatial patterns in δ<sup>15</sup>N and δ<sup>13</sup>C with pronounced species-specific differences, demonstrating distinct spatial ranges of plant–plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions. A coniferous tree and an ericaceous dwarf shrub showed significant enrichment in δ<sup>15</sup>N within a range of 5–8 m surrounding the canopy of <i>A. longifolia</i>, indicating input of N originating from symbiotic N<sub>2</sub>-fixation by the invader. In the dwarf shrub, which was most responsive to invader influence, enrichment in δ<sup>13</sup>C additionally demonstrated spatially explicit changes to WUE<sub>i</sub>, while a native N<sub>2</sub>-fixer was unresponsive to the presence of the invader. Furthermore, δ<sup>15</sup>N and δ<sup>13</sup>C isoscapes yielded different patterns, indicating that plant–plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions can have distinct spatial distributions and ranges based on the process measured. Additionally, the magnitude of the effect differed between field situations with high and low invasion pressure. This study highlights that the spatial scale must be accounted for when assessing the effects and outcome of species <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions. Functional tracers such as stable isotopes enable us to quantify spatial ranges of plant–plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions, providing empirical data that can help to better understand and predict complex species <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions in multifaceted natural environments.</p>

A global genetic interaction network maps a wiring diagram of cellular function
<p>We generated a global genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion network for <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, constructing more than 23 million double mutants, identifying about 550,000 negative and about 350,000 positive genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions. This comprehensive network maps genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions for essential gene pairs, highlighting essential genes as densely connected hubs. Genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion profiles enabled assembly of a hierarchical model of cell function, including modules corresponding to protein complexes and pathways, biological processes, and cellular compartments. Negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions connected functionally related genes, mapped core bioprocesses, and identified pleiotropic genes, whereas positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions often mapped general regulatory connections among gene pairs, rather than shared functionality. The global network illustrates how coherent sets of genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions connect protein complex and pathway modules to map a functional wiring diagram of the cell.</p>

pTAC10, a Key Subunit of Plastid-Encoded RNA Polymerase, Promotes Chloroplast Development
<p>Regulation of photosynthetic gene expression by plastid-encoded RNA polymerase (PEP) is essential for chloroplast development. The activity of PEP largely relies on at least 12 PEP-associated proteins (PAPs) encoded in the nuclear genome of plant cells. A recent model proposed that these PAPs regulate the establishment of the PEP complex through broad PAP-PEP or PAP-PAP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions. In this study, we identified the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedling-lethal mutant <i>ptac10-1</i>, which has defects in chloroplast development, and found that the mutant phenotype is caused by the suppression of <i>PLASTID S1 RNA-BINDING DOMAIN PROTEIN</i> (<i>pTAC10/PAP3</i>). Analysis of the heterozygous mutant and <i>pTAC10</i>-overexpressing transgenic plants indicated that the expression level of <i>pTAC10</i> is tightly linked to chloroplast development. Characterization of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion of pTAC10 with PAPs revealed that pTAC10 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>s with other PAPs, such as FSD2, FSD3, TrxZ, pTAC7, and pTAC14, but it does not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong> with PEP core enzymes, such as rpoA and rpoB. Analysis of pTAC10 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions using truncated pTAC10 proteins showed that the pTAC10 carboxyl-terminal region downstream of the S1 domain is involved in the pTAC10-PAP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion. Furthermore, overexpression of truncated <i>pTAC10s</i> lacking the C-terminal regions downstream of the S1 domain could not rescue the <i>ptac10-1</i> mutant phenotype and induced an abnormal whitening phenotype in Columbia-0 plants. Our observations suggested that these pTAC10-PAP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions are essential for the formation of the PEP complex and chloroplast development.</p>

The conformational state of hERG1 channels determines integrin association, downstream signaling, and cancer progression
<p>Ion channels regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration in normal and neoplastic cells through cell-cell and cell–extracellular matrix (ECM) transmembrane receptors called integrins. K<sup>+</sup> flux through the human ether-à-go-go–related gene 1 (hERG1) channel shapes action potential firing in excitable cells such as cardiomyocytes. Its abundance is often aberrantly high in tumors, where it modulates integrin-mediated signaling. We found that hERG1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ed with the β<sub>1</sub> integrin subunit at the plasma membrane of human cancer cells. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion was not detected in cardiomyocytes because of the presence of the hERG1 auxiliary subunit KCNE1 (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily E regulatory subunit 1), which blocked the β<sub>1</sub> integrin–hERG1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion. Although open hERG1 channels did not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong> as strongly with β<sub>1</sub> integrins as did closed channels, current flow through hERG1 channels was necessary to activate the integrin-dependent phosphorylation of Tyr<sup>397</sup> in focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in both normal and cancer cells. In immunodeficient mice, proliferation was inhibited in breast cancer cells expressing forms of hERG1 with impaired K<sup>+</sup> flow, whereas metastasis of breast cancer cells was reduced when the hERG1/β<sub>1</sub> integrin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion was disrupted. We conclude that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion of β<sub>1</sub> integrins with hERG1 channels in cancer cells stimulated distinct signaling pathways that depended on the conformational state of hERG1 and affected different aspects of tumor progression.</p>

If two deletions don't stop growth, try three
<p>How many and which genes does an organism need at a minimum to sustain growth? With the identification of essential genes in a variety of organisms such as yeast (<i>1</i>), worms (<i>2</i>), and human cultured cells (<i>3</i>–<i>5</i>), the answer may seem obvious: Remove all nonessential genes, and the organism should be able to continue to survive and grow. In the yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, the workhorse of genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion mapping, ∼1000 of the ∼6000 (∼17%) protein-coding genes are essential for viability (<i>1</i>). So theoretically, one might think that one could remove the other ∼5000 nonessential genes and still have a growing yeast. The reason this does not work is that genes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong> with each other to drive different traits, including viability and growth. On page 283 of this issue, Kuzmin <i>et al.</i> (<i>6</i>) provide the first systematic analysis of trigenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions in yeast in which three gene deletions are combined in individual strains in order to ascertain the importance of multigene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions for growth.

A dedicated network for social interaction processing in the primate brain

Where and how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion analyses are implemented in the brain is unknown. Using whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging in macaque monkeys, we discovered a network centered in the medial and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex that is exclusively engaged in social <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion analysis. Exclusivity of specialization was found for no other function anywhere in the brain. Two additional networks, a parieto-premotor and a temporal one, exhibited both social and physical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion preference, which, in the temporal lobe, mapped onto a fine-grain pattern of object, body, and face selectivity.

SIPP, a Novel Mitochondrial Phosphate Carrier, Mediates in Self-Incompatibility
<p>In Solanaceae, the <i>S</i>-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion between the pistil S-RNase and the pollen <i>S</i>-Locus F-box protein controls self-incompatibility (SI). Although this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion defines the specificity of the pollen rejection response, the identification of three pistil essential modifier genes unlinked to the <i>S</i>-locus (<i>HT-B</i>, <i>120K</i>, and <i>NaStEP</i>) unveils a higher degree of complexity in the pollen rejection pathway. We showed previously that NaStEP, a stigma protein with homology with Kunitz-type protease inhibitors, is essential to SI in <i>Nicotiana</i> spp. During pollination, NaStEP is taken up by pollen tubes, where potential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions with pollen tube proteins might underlie its function. Here, we identified NaSIPP, a mitochondrial protein with phosphate transporter activity, as a novel NaStEP-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ing protein. Coexpression of NaStEP and NaSIPP in pollen tubes showed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion in the mitochondria, although when expressed alone, NaStEP remains mostly cytosolic, implicating NaSIPP-mediated translocation of NaStEP into the organelle. The <i>NaSIPP</i> transcript is detected specifically in mature pollen of <i>Nicotiana</i> spp.; however, in self-compatible plants, this gene has accumulated mutations, so its coding region is unlikely to produce a functional protein. RNA interference suppression of NaSIPP in <i>Nicotiana</i> spp. pollen grains disrupts the SI by preventing pollen tube inhibition. Taken together, our results are consistent with a model whereby the NaStEP and NaSIPP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion, in incompatible pollen tubes, might destabilize the mitochondria and contribute to arrest pollen tube growth.</p>

The DUF1669 domain of FAM83 family proteins anchor casein kinase 1 isoforms
<p>Members of the casein kinase 1 (CK1) family of serine-threonine protein kinases are implicated in the regulation of many cellular processes, including the cell cycle, circadian rhythms, and Wnt and Hedgehog signaling. Because these kinases exhibit constitutive activity in biochemical assays, it is likely that their activity in cells is controlled by subcellular localization, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions with inhibitory proteins, targeted degradation, or combinations of these mechanisms. We identified members of the FAM83 family of proteins as partners of CK1 in cells. All eight members of the FAM83 family (FAM83A to FAM83H) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ed with the α and α-like isoforms of CK1; FAM83A, FAM83B, FAM83E, and FAM83H also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ed with the δ and ε isoforms of CK1. We detected no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion between any FAM83 member and the related CK1γ1, CK1γ2, and CK1γ3 isoforms. Each FAM83 protein exhibited a distinct pattern of subcellular distribution and colocalized with the CK1 isoform(s) to which it bound. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion of FAM83 proteins with CK1 isoforms was mediated by the conserved domain of unknown function 1669 (DUF1669) that characterizes the FAM83 family. Mutations in FAM83 proteins that prevented them from binding to CK1 interfered with the proper subcellular localization and cellular functions of both the FAM83 proteins and their CK1 binding partners. On the basis of its function, we propose that DUF1669 be renamed the polypeptide anchor of CK1 domain.</p>

Global assessment of its network dynamics reveals that the kinase Plk1 inhibits the phosphatase PP6 to promote Aurora A activity
<p>Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is an essential protein kinase that promotes faithful mitotic progression in eukaryotes. The subcellular localization and substrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions of Plk1 are tightly controlled and require its binding to phosphorylated residues. To identify phosphorylation-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions within the Plk1 network in human mitotic cells, we performed quantitative proteomics on HeLa cells cultured with kinase inhibitors or expressing a Plk1 mutant that was deficient in phosphorylation-dependent substrate binding. We found that many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions were abolished upon kinase inhibition; however, a subset was protected from phosphatase opposition or was unopposed, resulting in persistent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion of the substrate with Plk1. This subset includes phosphoprotein phosphatase 6 (PP6), whose activity toward Aurora kinase A (Aurora A) was inhibited by Plk1. Our data suggest that this Plk1-PP6 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion generates a feedback loop that coordinates and reinforces the activities of Plk1 and Aurora A during mitotic entry and is terminated by the degradation of Plk1 during mitotic exit. Thus, we have identified a mechanism for the previously puzzling observation of the Plk1-dependent regulation of Aurora A.</p>

RAF1/BRAF dimerization integrates the signal from RAS to ERK and ROKα
<p>Downstream of growth factor receptors and of the guanine triphosphatase (GTPase) RAS, heterodimers of the serine/threonine kinases BRAF and RAF1 are critical upstream kinases and activators of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) module containing the mitogen-activated and extracellular signal–regulated kinase kinase (MEK) and their targets, the extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) family. Either direct or scaffold protein–mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions among the components of the ERK module (the MAPKKKs BRAF and RAF1, MEK, and ERK) facilitate signal transmission. RAF1 also has essential functions in the control of tumorigenesis and migration that are mediated through its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion with the kinase ROKα, an effector of the GTPase RHO and regulator of cytoskeletal rearrangements. We combined mutational and kinetic analysis with mathematical modeling to show that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion of RAF1 with ROKα is coordinated with the role of RAF1 in the ERK pathway. We found that the phosphorylated form of RAF1 that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ed with and inhibited ROKα was generated during the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion of RAF1 with the ERK module. This mechanism adds plasticity to the ERK pathway, enabling signal diversification at the level of both ERK and RAF. Furthermore, by connecting ERK activation with the regulation of ROKα and cytoskeletal rearrangements by RAF1, this mechanism has the potential to precisely coordinate the proper timing of proliferation with changes in cell shape, adhesion, or motility.</p>

Gene duplication can impart fragility, not robustness, in the yeast protein interaction network

The Extra-Pathway Interactome of the TCA Cycle: Expected and Unexpected Metabolic Interactions

To further understand the in vivo function of the TCA cycle enzymes, we combined affinity purification with proteomics to generate a comprehensive extra-pathway protein-protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion network of the plant TCA cycle. We identified 125 extra-pathway <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mostly related to the mitochondrial electron transport complex/ATP synthesis and amino acid metabolism but also to proteins associated with redox stress. We chose three high-scoring and two low-scoring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions for complementary bimolecular fluorescence complementation and yeast two-hybrid assays, which highlighted the reliability of our approach, supported the intimate involvement of TCA cycle enzymes within many biological processes, and reflected metabolic changes reported previously for the corresponding mutant lines. To analyze the function of a subset of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions, we selected two mutants of mitochondrial glutaredoxin S15 and Amidase, which have not yet been analyzed with respect to their TCA cycle function, and performed metabolite profiling and flux analysis. Consistent with their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions identified in this study, TCA cycle metabolites and the relative TCA flux of the two mutants were altered significantly.</p>

LIL3, a Light-Harvesting Complex Protein, Links Terpenoid and Tetrapyrrole Biosynthesis in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>The LIL3 protein of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) belongs to the light-harvesting complex (LHC) protein family, which also includes the light-harvesting chlorophyll-binding proteins of photosystems I and II, the early-light-inducible proteins, PsbS involved in nonphotochemical quenching, and the one-helix proteins and their cyanobacterial homologs designated high-light-inducible proteins. Each member of this family is characterized by one or two LHC transmembrane domains (referred to as the LHC motif) to which potential functions such as chlorophyll binding, protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion, and integration of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ing partners into the plastid membranes have been attributed. Initially, LIL3 was shown to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong> with geranylgeranyl reductase (CHLP), an enzyme of terpene biosynthesis that supplies the hydrocarbon chain for chlorophyll and tocopherol. Here, we show another function of LIL3 for the stability of protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR). Multiple protein-protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion analyses suggest the direct physical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion of LIL3 with POR but not with chlorophyll synthase. Consistently, LIL3-deficient plants exhibit substantial loss of POR as well as CHLP, which is not due to defective transcription of the POR and CHLP genes but to the posttranslational modification of their protein products. Interestingly, in vitro biochemical analyses provide novel evidence that LIL3 shows high binding affinity to protochlorophyllide, the substrate of POR. Taken together, this study suggests a critical role for LIL3 in the organization of later steps in chlorophyll biosynthesis. We suggest that LIL3 associates with POR and CHLP and thus contributes to the supply of the two metabolites, chlorophyllide and phytyl pyrophosphate, required for the final step in chlorophyll <i>a</i> synthesis.</p>

Saltational evolution of the heterotrimeric G protein signaling mechanisms in the plant kingdom
<p>Signaling proteins evolved diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions to provide specificity for distinct stimuli. Signaling complexity in the G protein (heterotrimeric guanosine triphosphate–binding protein) network was achieved in animals through subunit duplication and incremental evolution. By combining comprehensive and quantitative phenotypic profiles of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> with protein evolution informatics, we found that plant heterotrimeric G protein machinery evolved by a saltational (jumping) process. Sequence similarity scores mapped onto tertiary structures, and biochemical validation showed that the extra-large Gα (XLG) subunit evolved extensively in the charophycean algae (an aquatic green plant) by gene duplication and gene fusion. In terrestrial plants, further evolution uncoupled XLG from its negative regulator, regulator of G protein signaling, but preserved an α-helix region that enables <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion with its partner Gβγ. The ancestral gene evolved slowly due to the molecular constraints imposed by the need for the protein to maintain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions with various partners, whereas the genes encoding XLG proteins evolved rapidly to produce three highly divergent members. Analysis of <i>A. thaliana</i> mutants indicated that these Gα and XLG proteins all function with Gβγ and evolved to operate both independently and cooperatively. The XLG-Gβγ machinery specialized in environmental stress responses, whereas the canonical Gα-Gβγ retained developmental roles. Some developmental processes, such as shoot development, involve both Gα and XLG acting cooperatively or antagonistically. These extensive and rapid evolutionary changes in XLG structure compared to those of the canonical Gα subunit contrast with the accepted notion of how pathway diversification occurs through gene duplication with subsequent incremental coevolution of residues among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ing proteins.</p>

Hypoxia-induced interaction of filamin with Drp1 causes mitochondrial hyperfission–associated myocardial senescence
<p>Defective mitochondrial dynamics through aberrant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions between mitochondria and actin cytoskeleton is increasingly recognized as a key determinant of cardiac fragility after myocardial infarction (MI). Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), a mitochondrial fission–accelerating factor, is activated locally at the fission site through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions with actin. Here, we report that the actin-binding protein filamin A acted as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Drp1 and mediated mitochondrial fission–associated myocardial senescence in mice after MI. In peri-infarct regions characterized by mitochondrial hyperfission and associated with myocardial senescence, filamin A colocalized with Drp1 around mitochondria. Hypoxic stress induced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion of filamin A with the GTPase domain of Drp1 and increased Drp1 activity in an actin-binding–dependent manner in rat cardiomyocytes. Expression of the A1545T filamin mutant, which potentiates actin aggregation, promoted mitochondrial hyperfission under normoxia. Furthermore, pharmacological perturbation of the Drp1–filamin A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion by cilnidipine suppressed mitochondrial hyperfission–associated myocardial senescence and heart failure after MI. Together, these data demonstrate that Drp1 association with filamin and the actin cytoskeleton contributes to cardiac fragility after MI and suggests a potential repurposing of cilnidipine, as well as provides a starting point for innovative Drp1 inhibitor development.</p>

Reducing eIF4E-eIF4G interactions restores the balance between protein synthesis and actin dynamics in fragile X syndrome model mice
<p>Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder. FXS is caused by silencing of the <i>FMR1</i> gene, which encodes fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an mRNA-binding protein that represses the translation of its target mRNAs. One mechanism by which FMRP represses translation is through its association with cytoplasmic FMRP-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ing protein 1 (CYFIP1), which subsequently sequesters and inhibits eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E). CYFIP1 shuttles between the FMRP-eIF4E complex and the Rac1–Wave regulatory complex, thereby connecting translational regulation to actin dynamics and dendritic spine morphology, which are dysregulated in FXS model mice that lack FMRP. Treating FXS mice with 4EGI-1, which blocks <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions between eIF4E and eIF4G, a critical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion partner for translational initiation, reversed defects in hippocampus-dependent memory and spine morphology. We also found that 4EGI-1 normalized the phenotypes of enhanced metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)–mediated long-term depression (LTD), enhanced Rac1–p21-activated kinase (PAK)–cofilin signaling, altered actin dynamics, and dysregulated CYFIP1/eIF4E and CYFIP1/Rac1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions in FXS mice. Our findings are consistent with the idea that an imbalance in protein synthesis and actin dynamics contributes to pathophysiology in FXS mice, and suggest that targeting eIF4E may be a strategy for treating FXS.</p>

Structure, spatial dynamics, and stability of novel seed dispersal mutualistic networks in Hawai<bold></bold>i
<p>Increasing rates of human-caused species invasions and extinctions may reshape communities and modify the structure, dynamics, and stability of species <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions. To investigate how such changes affect communities, we performed multiscale analyses of seed dispersal networks on Oahu, Hawaii.

Introduced species can quickly become well integrated into novel networks, making restoration of native ecosystems more challenging than previously thought.</p>

Imaging dynamic and selective low-complexity domain interactions that control gene transcription
<p>Many eukaryotic transcription factors (TFs) contain intrinsically disordered low-complexity sequence domains (LCDs), but how these LCDs drive transactivation remains unclear. We used live-cell single-molecule imaging to reveal that TF LCDs form local high-concentration <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion hubs at synthetic and endogenous genomic loci. TF LCD hubs stabilize DNA binding, recruit RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II), and activate transcription. LCD-LCD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions within hubs are highly dynamic, display selectivity with binding partners, and are differentially sensitive to disruption by hexanediols. Under physiological conditions, rapid and reversible LCD-LCD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions occur between TFs and the RNA Pol II machinery without detectable phase separation. Our findings reveal fundamental mechanisms underpinning transcriptional control and suggest a framework for developing single-molecule imaging screens for drugs targeting gene regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions implicated in disease.</p>

Induction of CD4 T cell memory by local cellular collectivity

Structural mechanisms of centromeric nucleosome recognition by the kinetochore protein CENP-N

Gating of social reward by oxytocin in the ventral tegmental area

Tudor-SN–mediated endonucleolytic decay of human cell microRNAs promotes G<sub>1</sub>/S phase transition
<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression. The pathways that mediate mature miRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decay</span></strong> are less well understood than those that mediate miRNA biogenesis. We found that functional miRNAs are degraded in human cells by the endonuclease Tudor-SN (TSN). In vitro, recombinant TSN initiated the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decay</span></strong> of both protein-free and Argonaute 2–loaded miRNAs via endonucleolytic cleavage at CA and UA dinucleotides, preferentially at scissile bonds located more than five nucleotides away from miRNA ends.

Analysis of single recessive mutations in <i>rel2</i> revealed an array of vegetative and reproductive phenotypes, many related to defects in meristem initiation and maintenance. To better understand how REL2-mediated transcriptional complexes relate to <i>rel2</i> phenotypes, we performed protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion assays and transcriptional profiling of mutant inflorescences, leading to the identification of different maize transcription factors and regulatory pathways that employ REL2 repression to control traits directly impacting maize yields.

Digital Imaging Combined with Genome-Wide Association Mapping Links Loci to Plant-Pathogen Interaction Traits

However, with the advent of digital imaging and high-throughput phenomics, there are a large number of additional traits available to study quantitative resistance.

DAWDLE Interacts with DICER-LIKE Proteins to Mediate Small RNA Biogenesis

However, the functional mechanism of DDL and its impact on exogenous siRNAs remain elusive.

Potato Mop-Top Virus Co-Opts the Stress Sensor HIPP26 for Long-Distance Movement
<p>Virus movement proteins facilitate virus entry into the vascular system to initiate systemic infection. The potato mop-top virus (PMTV) movement protein, TGB1, is involved in long-distance movement of both viral ribonucleoprotein complexes and virions. Here, our analysis of TGB1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions with host <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> proteins revealed an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion with a member of the heavy metal-associated isoprenylated plant protein family, HIPP26, which acts as a plasma membrane-to-nucleus signal during abiotic stress. We found that knockdown of <i>NbHIPP26</i> expression inhibited virus long-distance movement but did not affect cell-to-cell movement. Drought and PMTV infection up-regulated <i>NbHIPP26</i> gene expression, and PMTV infection protected plants from drought. In addition, <i>NbHIPP26</i> promoter-reporter fusions revealed vascular tissue-specific expression. Mutational and biochemical analyses indicated that NbHIPP26 subcellular localization at the plasma membrane and plasmodesmata was mediated by lipidation (<i>S</i>-acylation and prenylation), as nonlipidated NbHIPP26 was predominantly in the nucleus. Notably, coexpression of NbHIPP26 with TGB1 resulted in a similar nuclear accumulation of NbHIPP26. TGB1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ed with the carboxyl-terminal CVVM (prenyl) domain of NbHIPP26, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation revealed that the TGB1-HIPP26 complex localized to microtubules and accumulated in the nucleolus, with little signal at the plasma membrane or plasmodesmata. These data support a mechanism where <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion with TGB1 negates or reverses NbHIPP26 lipidation, thus releasing membrane-associated NbHIPP26 and redirecting it via microtubules to the nucleus, thereby activating the drought stress response and facilitating virus long-distance movement.</p>

A Violaxanthin Deepoxidase Interacts with a Viral Suppressor of RNA Silencing to Inhibit Virus Amplification
<p>RNA silencing plays a critical role against viral infection. To counteract this antiviral silencing, viruses have evolved various RNA silencing suppressors. Meanwhile, plants have evolved counter-counter defense strategies against RNA silencing suppression (RSS). In this study, the violaxanthin deepoxidase protein of maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), ZmVDE, was shown to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong> specifically with the helper component-proteinase (HC-Pro; a viral RNA silencing suppressor) of <i>Sugarcane mosaic virus</i> (SCMV) via its mature protein region by yeast two-hybrid assay, which was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> cells. It was demonstrated that amino acids 101 to 460 in HC-Pro and the amino acid glutamine-292 in ZmVDE mature protein were essential for this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion. The mRNA levels of <i>ZmVDE</i> were down-regulated 75% to 65% at an early stage of SCMV infection. Interestingly, ZmVDE, which normally localized in the chloroplasts and cytoplasm, could relocalize to HC-Pro-containing aggregate bodies in the presence of HC-Pro alone or SCMV infection. In addition, ZmVDE could attenuate the RSS activity of HC-Pro in a specific protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion-dependent manner. Subsequently, transient silencing of the <i>ZmVDE</i> gene facilitated SCMV RNA and coat protein accumulation. Taken together, our results suggest that ZmVDE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>s with SCMV HC-Pro and attenuates its RSS activity, contributing to decreased SCMV accumulation. This study demonstrates that a host factor can be involved in secondary defense responses against viral infection in monocot plants.</p>

Quantifying Wheat Sensitivities to Environmental Constraints to Dissect Genotype × Environment Interactions in the Field
<p>Yield is subject to strong genotype-by-environment (G × E) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions in the field, especially under abiotic constraints such as soil water deficit (drought [D]) and high temperature (heat [H]). Since environmental conditions show strong fluctuations during the whole crop cycle, geneticists usually do not consider environmental measures as quantitative variables but rather as factors in multienvironment analyses. Based on 11 experiments in a field platform with contrasting temperature and soil water deficit, we determined the periods of sensitivity to drought and heat constraints in wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) and determined the average sensitivities for major yield components. G × E <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions were separated into their underlying components, constitutive genotypic effect (G), G × D, G × H, and G × H × D, and were analyzed for two genotypes, highlighting contrasting responses to heat and drought constraints. We then tested the constitutive and responsive behaviors of two strong quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated previously with yield components. This analysis confirmed the constitutive effect of the chromosome 1B QTL and explained the G × E <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion of the chromosome 3B QTL by a benefit of one allele when temperature rises. In addition to the method itself, which can be applied to other data sets and populations, this study will support the cloning of a major yield QTL on chromosome 3B that is highly dependent on environmental conditions and for which the climatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion is now quantified.</p>

Two h-Type Thioredoxins Interact with the E2 Ubiquitin Conjugase PHO2 to Fine-Tune Phosphate Homeostasis in Rice
<p><i>Phosphate overaccumulator2</i> (<i>PHO2</i>) encodes a ubiquitin-conjugating E2 enzyme that is a major negative regulator of the inorganic phosphate (Pi)-starvation response-signaling pathway. A yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screen in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>; Os) using OsPHO2 as bait revealed an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion between OsPHO2 and two h-type thioredoxins, OsTrxh1 and OsTrxh4. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions were confirmed in vivo using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) of OsPHO2 and OsTrxh1/h4 in rice protoplasts and by in vitro pull-down assays with 6His-tagged OsTrxh1/h4 and GST-tagged OsPHO2. Y2H assays revealed that amino acid Cys-445 of OsPHO2 and an N-terminal Cys in the “WCGPC” motif of Trxhs were required for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion. Split-ubiquitin Y2H analyses and BiFC assays in rice protoplasts confirmed the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion of OsPHO2 with PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER TRAFFIC FACILITATOR1 (OsPHF1), and PHOSPHATE1;2 (OsPHO1;2) in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi membrane system, where OsPHO2 mediates the degradation of OsPHF1 in both tobacco (<i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>) leaves and rice seedlings. Characterization of rice <i>pho2</i> complemented lines, transformed with an endogenous genomic <i>OsPHO2</i> or <i>OsPHO2<sup>C445S</sup></i> (a constitutively reduced form) fragment, indicated that <i>OsPHO2<sup>C445S</sup></i> restored Pi concentration in rice to statistically significant lower levels compared to native <i>OsPHO2</i>. Moreover, the suppression of <i>OsTrxh1</i> (knockdown and knockout) resulted in slightly higher Pi concentration than that of wild-type Nipponbare in leaves. These results demonstrate that OsPHO2 is under redox control by thioredoxins, which fine-tune its activity and link Pi homeostasis with redox balance in rice.</p>

Genetic Bases of Fungal White Rot Wood Decay Predicted by Phylogenomic Analysis of Correlated Gene-Phenotype Evolution
<p>Fungal decomposition of plant cell walls (PCW) is a complex process that has diverse industrial applications and huge impacts on the carbon cycle. White rot (WR) is a powerful mode of PCW <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decay</span></strong> in which lignin and carbohydrates are both degraded. Mechanistic studies of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decay</span></strong> coupled with comparative genomic analyses have provided clues to the enzymatic components of WR systems and their evolutionary origins, but the complete suite of genes necessary for WR remains undetermined. Here, we use phylogenomic comparative methods, which we validate through simulations, to identify shifts in gene family diversification rates that are correlated with evolution of WR, using data from 62 fungal genomes. We detected 409 gene families that appear to be evolutionarily correlated with WR. The identified gene families encode well-characterized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decay</span></strong> enzymes, e.g., fungal class II peroxidases and cellobiohydrolases, and enzymes involved in import and detoxification pathways, as well as 73 gene families that have no functional annotation. About 310 of the 409 identified gene families are present in the genome of the model WR fungus <i>Phanerochaete chrysosporium</i> and 192 of these (62%) have been shown to be upregulated under ligninolytic culture conditions, which corroborates the phylogeny-based functional inferences. These results illuminate the complexity of WR and suggest that its evolution has involved a general elaboration of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decay</span></strong> apparatus, including numerous gene families with as-yet unknown exact functions.</p>

Connecting the Sequence-Space of Bacterial Signaling Proteins to Phenotypes Using Coevolutionary Landscapes
<p>Two-component signaling (TCS) is the primary means by which bacteria sense and respond to the environment. TCS involves two partner proteins working in tandem, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong> to perform cellular functions whereas limiting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions with non-partners (i.e., cross-talk). We construct a Potts model for TCS that can quantitatively predict how mutating amino acid identities affect the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion between TCS partners and non-partners. The parameters of this model are inferred directly from protein sequence data. This approach drastically reduces the computational complexity of exploring the sequence-space of TCS proteins. As a stringent test, we compare its predictions to a recent comprehensive mutational study, which characterized the functionality of 20<sup>4</sup> mutational variants of the PhoQ kinase in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. We find that our best predictions accurately reproduce the amino acid combinations found in experiment, which enable functional signaling with its partner PhoP. These predictions demonstrate the evolutionary pressure to preserve the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion between TCS partners as well as prevent unwanted cross-talk. Further, we calculate the mutational change in the binding affinity between PhoQ and PhoP, providing an estimate to the amount of destabilization needed to disrupt TCS.</p>

Heterochronic Meiotic Misexpression in an Interspecific Yeast Hybrid
<p>Regulatory changes rapidly accumulate between species, and interspecific hybrids often misexpress genes. Hybrid misexpression, expression levels outside the range of both parental species, can result from <i>cis-</i> and <i>trans</i>-acting regulatory changes that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong> abnormally in hybrids. Thus, misexpressed genes may contribute to hybrid sterility. However, in the context of a whole organism, misexpression may not result directly from <i>cis–trans</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions but rather indirectly from differences between hybrid and parental abundance of cell types. Here we eliminate the confounding effects of cell types by examining gene expression in a sterile interspecific yeast hybrid during meiosis. We investigated gene expression of the yeasts <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, <i>S. paradoxus</i>, and their hybrid at multiple meiotic stages. Although the hybrid and parents exhibit similar changes in expression levels across meiosis, the hybrid meiotic program occurs earlier than either parent. The timing change produces a heterochronic pattern of misexpression during midmeiosis. Coincident with the timing of misexpression, we find a transition from predominantly <i>trans</i>-acting to <i>cis-</i>acting expression divergence and an increase in the number of opposing <i>cis–trans</i> changes. However, we find no direct relationship between opposing <i>cis–trans</i> changes and misexpression. Contrary to the notion that <i>cis–trans</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions cause misexpression, a heterochronic shift in the normal meiotic gene expression program produces patterns of misexpression in an yeast hybrid. Our results imply that temporal dynamics of single cell types is important to understanding hybrid misexpression and its relationship to <i>cis–trans</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions.</p>

Canagliflozin for Primary and Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular Events
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Canagliflozin is a sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor that significantly reduces the composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and elevated cardiovascular risk. The comparative effects among participants with and without a history of cardiovascular disease (secondary versus primary prevention) were prespecified for evaluation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The CANVAS Program (Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study) randomly assigned 10 142 participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus to canagliflozin or placebo. The primary prevention cohort comprised individuals ≥50 years of age with ≥2 risk factors for cardiovascular events but with no prior cardiovascular event, and the secondary prevention cohort comprised individuals ≥30 years of age with a prior cardiovascular event. The primary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. Secondary outcomes included heart failure hospitalization and a renal composite (40% reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate, renal replacement therapy, or renal death).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Primary prevention participants (N=3486; 34%) were younger (63 versus 64 years of age), were more often female (45% versus 31%), and had a longer duration of diabetes mellitus (14 versus 13 years) compared with secondary prevention participants (N=6656; 66%). The primary end point event rate was higher in the secondary prevention group compared with the primary prevention group (36.9 versus 15.7/1000 patient-years, <i>P</i><0.001). In the total cohort, the primary end point was reduced with canagliflozin compared with placebo (26.9 versus 31.5/1000 patient-years; hazard ratio [HR], 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75–0.97; <i>P</i><0.001 for noninferiority, <i>P</i>=0.02 for superiority) with no statistical evidence of heterogeneity (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion <i>P</i> value=0.18) between the primary (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.74–1.30) and secondary prevention (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72–0.95) cohorts.

High-Resolution Mapping of Chromatin Conformation in Cardiac Myocytes Reveals Structural Remodeling of the Epigenome in Heart Failure

The Role of Gβ Protein in Controlling Cell Expansion via Potential Interaction with Lipid Metabolic Pathways
<p>Heterotrimeric G-proteins influence almost all aspects of plant growth, development, and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses in plants, likely via their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion with specific effectors. However, the identity of such effectors and their mechanism of action are mostly unknown. While investigating the roles of different G-protein subunits in modulating the oil content in Camelina (<i>Camelina sativa</i>), an oil seed crop, we uncovered a role of Gβ proteins in controlling anisotropic cell expansion. Knockdown of <i>Gβ</i> genes causes reduced longitudinal and enhanced transverse expansion, resulting in altered cell, tissue, and organ shapes in transgenic plants during vegetative and reproductive development. These plants also exhibited substantial changes in their fatty acid and phospholipid profiles, which possibly leads to the increased oil content of the transgenic seeds. This increase is potentially caused by the direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion of Gβ proteins with a specific patatin-like phospholipase, pPLAIIIδ. Camelina plants with suppressed <i>Gβ</i> expression exhibit higher lipase activity, and show phenotypes similar to plants overexpressing <i>pPLAIIIδ</i>, suggesting that the Gβ proteins are negative regulators of pPLAIIIδ. These results reveal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions between the G-protein–mediated and lipid signaling/metabolic pathways, where specific phospholipases may act as effectors that control key developmental and environmental responses of plants.</p>

ABI5-BINDING PROTEIN2 Coordinates CONSTANS to Delay Flowering by Recruiting the Transcriptional Corepressor TPR2
<p>ABI5-BINDING PROTEIN2 (AFP2) negatively regulates the abscisic acid signal by accelerating ABI5 degradation during seed germination in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The abscisic acid signal is reported to delay flowering by up-regulating <i>Flowering Locus C</i> expression, but the role of AFP2 in regulating flowering time is unknown. Here, we found that flowering time was markedly delayed and <i>CONSTANS</i> (<i>CO</i>) expression was reduced in a transgenic Arabidopsis line overexpressing <i>AFP2</i> under LD conditions. Conversely, the loss-of-function <i>afp2</i> mutant showed slightly earlier flowering, with higher <i>CO</i> expression. These data suggest that <i>AFP2</i> negatively regulates photoperiod-dependent flowering time by modulating the CO signal. We then found that <i>AFP2</i> exhibited circadian expression rhythms that peaked during the night. Furthermore, the C-terminus of AFP2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ed with CO, while its N-terminal ethylene response factor–associated amphiphilic repression motif <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ed with the transcriptional corepressor TOPLESS-related protein2 (TPR2). Thus, AFP2 bridges CO and TPR2 to form the CO-AFP2-TPR2 complex. Biochemical and genetic analyses showed that AFP2 mediated CO degradation during the night. AFP2 also recruited histone deacetylase activity at <i>Flowering Locus T</i> chromatin through its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion with TPR2. Taken together, our results reveal an elaborate mechanism by which AFP2 modulates flowering time through coordinating the activity and stability of CO.</p>

Decoys Untangle Complicated Redundancy and Reveal Targets of Circadian Clock F-Box Proteins
<p>Eukaryotic circadian clocks utilize the ubiquitin proteasome system to precisely degrade clock proteins. In plants, the F-box-type E3 ubiquitin ligases ZEITLUPE (ZTL), FLAVIN-BINDING, KELCH REPEAT, F-BOX1 (FKF1), and LOV KELCH PROTEIN2 (LKP2) regulate clock period and couple the clock to photoperiodic flowering in response to end-of-day light conditions. To better understand their functions, we expressed decoy ZTL, FKF1, and LKP2 proteins that associate with target proteins but are unable to ubiquitylate their targets in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). These dominant-negative forms of the proteins inhibit the ubiquitylation of target proteins and allow for the study of ubiquitylation-independent and -dependent functions of ZTL, FKF1, and LKP2. We demonstrate the effects of expressing ZTL, FKF1, and LKP2 decoys on the circadian clock and flowering time. Furthermore, the decoy E3 ligases trap substrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions, and using immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry, we identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ing partners. We focus studies on the clock transcription factor CCA1 HIKING EXPEDITION (CHE) and show that ZTL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>s directly with CHE and can mediate CHE ubiquitylation. We also demonstrate that CHE protein is degraded in the dark and that degradation is reduced in a <i>ztl</i> mutant plant, showing that CHE is a bona fide ZTL target protein. This work increases our understanding of the genetic and biochemical roles for ZTL, FKF1, and LKP2 and also demonstrates an effective methodology for studying complicated genetic redundancy among E3 ubiquitin ligases.</p>

An Oxalyl-CoA Synthetase Is Involved in Oxalate Degradation and Aluminum Tolerance
<p>Acyl Activating Enzyme3 (AAE3) was identified to be involved in the catabolism of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxal</span></strong>ate, which is critical for seed development and defense against fungal pathogens. However, the role of AAE3 protein in abiotic stress responses is unknown. Here, we investigated the role of rice bean (<i>Vigna umbellata</i>) VuAAE3 in Al tolerance. Recombinant VuAAE3 protein has specific activity against <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxal</span></strong>ate, with <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> = 121 ± 8.2 µ<sc>m</sc> and <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> of 7.7 ± 0.88 µmol min<sup>−1</sup> mg<sup>−1</sup> protein, indicating it functions as an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxal</span></strong>yl-CoA synthetase. VuAAE3-GFP localization suggested that this enzyme is a soluble protein with no specific subcellular localization. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and <i>VuAAE3</i> promoter-GUS reporter analysis showed that the expression induction of <i>VuAAE3</i> is mainly confined to rice bean root tips. Accumulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxal</span></strong>ate was induced rapidly by Al stress in rice bean root tips, and exogenous application of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxal</span></strong>ate resulted in the inhibition of root elongation and <i>VuAAE3</i> expression induction, suggesting that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxal</span></strong>ate accumulation is involved in Al-induced root growth inhibition. Furthermore, overexpression of VuAAE3 in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) resulted in the increase of Al tolerance, which was associated with the decrease of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxal</span></strong>ate accumulation. In addition, <i>NtMATE</i> and <i>NtALS3</i> expression showed no difference between transgenic lines and wild-type plants. Taken together, our results suggest that VuAAE3-dependent turnover of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxal</span></strong>ate plays a critical role in Al tolerance mechanisms.</p>

Mineral Deposits in <i>Ficus</i> Leaves: Morphologies and Locations in Relation to Function
<p><i>Ficus</i> trees are adapted to diverse environments and have some of the highest rates of photosynthesis among trees. <i>Ficus</i> leaves can deposit one or more of the three major mineral types found in leaves: amorphous calcium carbonate cystoliths, calcium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxal</span></strong>ates, and silica phytoliths. In order to better understand the functions of these minerals and the control that the leaf exerts over mineral deposition, we investigated leaves from 10 <i>Ficus</i> species from vastly different environments (Rehovot, Israel; Bologna, Italy; Issa Valley, Tanzania; and Ngogo, Uganda). We identified the mineral locations in the soft tissues, the relative distributions of the minerals, and mineral volume contents using microcomputed tomography. Each <i>Ficus</i> species is characterized by a unique 3D mineral distribution that is preserved in different environments. The mineral distribution patterns are generally different on the adaxial and abaxial sides of the leaf. All species examined have abundant calcium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxal</span></strong>ate deposits around the veins. We used micromodulated fluorimetry to examine the effect of cystoliths on photosynthetic efficiency in two species having cystoliths abaxially and adaxially (<i>Ficus</i> <i>microcarpa</i>) or only abaxially (<i>Ficus</i> <i>carica</i>). In <i>F. microcarpa</i>, both adaxial and abaxial cystoliths efficiently contributed to light redistribution inside the leaf and, hence, increased photosynthetic efficiency, whereas in <i>F. carica</i>, the abaxial cystoliths did not increase photosynthetic efficiency.</p>

Three Pectin Methylesterase Inhibitors Protect Cell Wall Integrity for Arabidopsis Immunity to <i>Botrytis</i>
<p>Infection by necrotrophs is a complex process that starts with the breakdown of the cell wall (CW) matrix initiated by CW-degrading enzymes and results in an extensive tissue maceration. Plants exploit induced defense mechanisms based on biochemical modification of the CW components to protect themselves from enzymatic degradation. The pectin matrix is the main CW target of <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>, and pectin methylesterification status is strongly altered in response to infection. The methylesterification of pectin is controlled mainly by pectin methylesterases (PMEs), whose activity is posttranscriptionally regulated by endogenous protein inhibitors (PMEIs). Here, AtPMEI10, AtPMEI11, and AtPMEI12 are identified as functional PMEIs induced in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) during <i>B. cinerea</i> infection. AtPMEI expression is strictly regulated by jasmonic acid and ethylene signaling, while only AtPMEI11 expression is controlled by PME-related damage-associated molecular patterns, such as oligogalacturonides and methanol. The decrease of pectin methylesterification during infection is higher and the immunity to <i>B. cinerea</i> is compromised in <i>pmei10</i>, <i>pmei11</i>, and <i>pmei12</i> mutants with respect to the control plants. A higher stimulation of the fungal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxal</span></strong>ic acid biosynthetic pathway also can contribute to the higher susceptibility of <i>pmei</i> mutants. The lack of <i>PMEI</i> expression does not affect hemicellulose strengthening, callose deposition, and the synthesis of structural defense proteins, proposed as CW-remodeling mechanisms exploited by Arabidopsis to resist CW degradation upon <i>B. cinerea</i> infection. We show that PME activity and pectin methylesterification are dynamically modulated by PMEIs during <i>B. cinerea</i> infection. Our findings point to AtPMEI10, AtPMEI11, and AtPMEI12 as mediators of CW integrity maintenance in plant immunity.</p>

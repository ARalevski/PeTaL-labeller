Impact craters on Pluto and Charon indicate a deficit of small Kuiper belt objects
<p>The flyby of Pluto and Charon by the New Horizons spacecraft provided high-resolution images of cratered surfaces embedded in the Kuiper belt, an extensive region of bodies orbiting beyond Neptune. Impact craters on Pluto and Charon were formed by collisions with other Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) with diameters from ~40 kilometers to ~300 meters, smaller than most KBOs observed directly by telescopes. We find a relative paucity of small craters ≲13 kilometers in diameter, which cannot be explained solely by geological resurfacing. This implies a deficit of small KBOs (≲1 to 2 kilometers in diameter). Some surfaces on Pluto and Charon are likely ≳4 billion years old, thus their crater records provide information on the size-frequency distribution of KBOs in the early Solar System.</p>

<i>Hydra myc2</i>, a unique pre-bilaterian member of the <i>myc</i> gene family, is activated in cell proliferation and gametogenesis
<p>The <i>myc</i> protooncogene encodes the Myc transcription factor which is the essential part of the Myc–Max network controlling fundamental cellular processes. Deregulation of <i>myc</i> leads to tumorigenesis and is a hallmark of many human cancers. We have recently identified homologs of <i>myc</i> (<i>myc1</i>, <i>myc2</i>) and <i>max</i> in the early diploblastic cnidarian <i>Hydra</i> and have characterized <i>myc1</i> in detail. Here we show that <i>myc2</i> is transcriptionally activated in the interstitial stem cell system. Furthermore, in contrast to <i>myc1</i>, <i>myc2</i> expression is also detectable in proliferating epithelial stem cells throughout the gastric region. <i>myc2</i> but not <i>myc1</i> is activated in cycling precursor cells during early oogenesis and spermatogenesis, suggesting that the <i>Hydra</i> Myc2 protein has a possible non-redundant function in cell cycle progression. The Myc2 protein displays the principal design and properties of vertebrate Myc proteins. In complex with Max, Myc2 binds to DNA with similar affinity as Myc1–Max heterodimers. Immunoprecipitation of <i>Hydra</i> chromatin revealed that both Myc1 and Myc2 bind to the enhancer region of <i>CAD</i>, a classical Myc target gene in mammals. Luciferase reporter gene assays showed that Myc1 but not Myc2 transcriptionally activates the <i>CAD</i> promoter. Myc2 has oncogenic potential when tested in primary avian fibroblasts but to a lower degree as compared to Myc1. The identification of an additional <i>myc</i> gene in Cnidaria, a phylum that diverged prior to bilaterians, with characteristic expression patterns in tissue homeostasis and developmental processes suggests that principle functions of <i>myc</i> genes have arisen very early in metazoan evolution.</p>

Easier cure for resistant TB
<p>A new treatment strategy has had astonishing success against extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR TB), which kills more than 70% of patients. XDR and other drug-resistant forms of TB are burgeoning among people with HIV, and current treatments are so prolonged and toxic that many patients fail to adhere to them. But a small study now shows that a simpler, safer regimen can cure the disease. Called Nix-TB, the trial has had 34 people in South Africa with XDR on three antibiotics that have never been combined before to treat TB. After 6 months, the TB bacillus could not be cultured from anyone's sputum, a sign that they had cleared the infection. More impressive, 20 people stopped taking the drugs at that point and none relapsed.</p>

Developmental Decline in Neuronal Regeneration by the Progressive Change of Two Intrinsic Timers
<sec><title>Turn Off Youth</title><p>Our neurons regenerate better when we are young than when we are more mature. Studying the mechanosensory anterior ventral microtubule (AVM) neuron of the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, <bold>Zou <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 372; see the Perspective by <bold>Nix and Bastiani</bold>) found that worms lacking microRNA machinery had unusually robust axon regeneration and youthful-looking growth cones. Under- and overexpression of <i>let-7</i> microRNA confirmed its involvement in depressing axon regeneration.</p></sec>

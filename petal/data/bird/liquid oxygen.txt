Singlet Oxygen Plays an Essential Role in the Root’s Response to Osmotic Stress
<p>The high osmotic potentials in plants subjected to drought stress can be mimicked by the application of high molecular weight polyethylene glycol. Here, we quantified the effects of exposure to polyethylene glycol on the growth of the main and lateral roots of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings. The effects on root growth were highly correlated with the appearance of singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>, as visualized using the singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>-specific probe singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> sensor green. The production of singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> was followed by cell death, as indicated by the intracellular accumulation of propidium iodide due to the loss of membrane integrity. Cell death began in the epidermal region of the root tip and spread in a dynamic manner to meristematic sections. In parallel, gene expression changes specific to the presence of singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> were observed. The accumulation of other reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species, namely hydrogen, per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e, nitric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e, and super<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e, did not correlate with cell death. In addition, both the singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> scavenger His and the lip<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ase inhibitor salicylhydroxamic acid specifically inhibited singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> accumulation and cell death. These results suggest a light-independent, type-I source of singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> production. Serpin-protease interactions were used as a model to assess the possibility of vacuolar-type cell death. Osmotic stress induced the accumulation of complexes between the cytoplasmic serpin AtSERPIN1 and its cognate vacuolar proteases, indicating that vacuolar integrity was compromised. These findings imply that singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> plays an essential role in conveying the root response to osmotic stress.</p>

Proteome-Wide Analysis of Cysteine Reactivity during Effector-Triggered Immunity
<p>A surge in the accumulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ants generates shifts in the cellular redox potential during early stages of plant infection with pathogens and activation of effector-triggered immunity (ETI). The redoxome, defined as the proteome-wide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative modifications of proteins caused by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ants, has a well-known impact on stress responses in metazoans. However, the identity of proteins and the residues sensitive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation during the plant immune response remain largely unknown. Previous studies of the thimet oligopeptidases TOP1 and TOP2 placed them in the salicylic acid dependent branch of ETI, with a current model wherein TOPs sustain interconnected organellar and cytosolic pathways that modulate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative burst and development of cell death. Herein, we characterized the ETI redoxomes in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) wild-type Col-0 and <i>top1top2</i> mutant plants using a differential alkylation-based enrichment technique coupled with label-free mass spectrometry-based quantification. We identified cysteines sensitive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation in a wide range of protein families at multiple time points after pathogen infection. Differences were detected between Col-0 and <i>top1top2</i> redoxomes regarding the identity and number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized cysteines, and the amplitude of time-dependent fluctuations in protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation. Our results support a determining role for TOPs in maintaining the proper level and dynamics of proteome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation during ETI. This study significantly expands the repertoire of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation-sensitive plant proteins and can guide future mechanistic studies.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
A Synthetic Oxygen Sensor for Plants Based on Animal Hypoxia Signaling
<p>Due to the involvement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> in many essential metabolic reactions, all living organisms have developed molecular systems that allow adaptive physiological and metabolic transitions depending on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> availability. In mammals, the expression of hypoxia-response genes is controlled by the heterodimeric Hypoxia-Inducible Factor. The activity of this transcriptional regulator is linked mainly to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>-dependent hydroxylation of conserved proline residues in its α-subunit, carried out by prolyl-hydroxylases, and subsequent ubiquitination via the E3 ligase von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor, which targets Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-α to the proteasome. By exploiting bioengineered versions of this mammalian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> sensor, we designed and optimized a synthetic device that drives gene expression in an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>-dependent fashion in plants. Transient assays in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mesophyll protoplasts indicated that a combination of the yeast Gal4/upstream activating sequence system and the mammalian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> sensor machinery can be used effectively to engineer a modular, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>-inducible transcriptional regulator. This synthetic device also was shown to be selectively controlled by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> in whole plants when its components were expressed stably in Arabidopsis seedlings. We envision the exploitation of our genetically encoded controllers to generate plants able to switch gene expression selectively depending on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> availability, thereby providing a proof of concept for the potential of synthetic biology to assist agricultural practices in environments with variable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> provision.</p>

Carnosic Acid and Carnosol, Two Major Antioxidants of Rosemary, Act through Different Mechanisms
<p>Carnosic acid, a phenolic diterpene specific to the Lamiaceae family, is highly abundant in rosemary (<i>Rosmarinus officinalis</i>). Despite numerous industrial and medicinal/pharmaceutical applications of its anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative features, this compound in planta and its anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ant mechanism have received little attention, except a few studies of rosemary plants under natural conditions. In vitro analyses, using high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet and luminescence imaging, revealed that carnosic acid and its major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized derivative, carnosol, protect lipids from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation. Both compounds preserved linolenic acid and monogalactosyldiacylglycerol from singlet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> and from hydroxyl radical. When applied exogenously, they were both able to protect thylakoid membranes prepared from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves against lipid per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation. Different levels of carnosic acid and carnosol in two contrasting rosemary varieties correlated with tolerance to lipid per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation. Upon reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species (ROS) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation of lipids, carnosic acid was consumed and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized into various derivatives, including into carnosol, while carnosol resisted, suggesting that carnosic acid is a chemical quencher of ROS. The anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative function of carnosol relies on another mechanism, occurring directly in the lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation process. Under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative conditions that did not involve ROS generation, carnosol inhibited lipid per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation, contrary to carnosic acid. Using spin probes and electron paramagnetic resonance detection, we confirmed that carnosic acid, rather than carnosol, is a ROS quencher. Various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized derivatives of carnosic acid were detected in rosemary leaves in low light, indicating chronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation of this compound, and accumulated in plants exposed to stress conditions, in parallel with a loss of carnosic acid, confirming that chemical quenching of ROS by carnosic acid takes place in planta.</p>

Structure Annotation and Quantification of Wheat Seed Oxidized Lipids by High-Resolution LC-MS/MS
<p>Lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation is a process ubiquitous in life, but the direct and comprehensive analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized lipids has been limited by available analytical methods. We applied high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to quantify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized lipids (glycerides, fatty acids, phospholipids, lysophospholipids, and galactolipids) and implemented a platform-independent high-throughput-amenable analysis pipeline for the high-confidence annotation and acyl composition analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized lipids. Lipid contents of 90 different naturally aged wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) seed stocks were quantified in an untargeted high-resolution LC-MS experiment, resulting in 18,556 quantitative mass-to-charge ratio features. In a posthoc liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry experiment, high-resolution MS/MS spectra (5 mD accuracy) were recorded for 8,957 out of 12,080 putatively monoisotopic features of the LC-MS data set. A total of 353 non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized and 559 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized lipids with up to four additional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> atoms were annotated based on the accurate mass recordings (1.5 ppm tolerance) of the LC-MS data set and filtering procedures. MS/MS spectra available for 828 of these annotations were analyzed by translating experimentally known fragmentation rules of lipids into the fragmentation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized lipids. This led to the identification of 259 non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized and 365 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized lipids by both accurate mass and MS/MS spectra and to the determination of acyl compositions for 221 non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized and 295 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized lipids. Analysis of 15-year aged wheat seeds revealed increased lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation and hydrolysis in seeds stored in ambient versus cold conditions.</p>

Oxidation of Translation Factor EF-Tu Inhibits the Repair of Photosystem II<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The repair of photosystem II (PSII) is particularly sensitive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress and the inhibition of repair is associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative damage to the translational elongation system in the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this inhibition are unknown. We previously demonstrated in vitro that EF-Tu, a translation factor that delivers aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosome, is inactivated by reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species via <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation of the Cys residue Cys-82. In this study, we examined the physiological role of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation of EF-Tu in <i>Synechocystis</i>. Under strong light, EF-Tu was rapidly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized to yield <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized monomers in vivo. We generated a <i>Synechocystis</i> transformant that expressed mutated EF-Tu in which Cys-82 had been replaced with a Ser residue. Under strong light, the de novo synthesis of proteins that are required for PSII repair, such as D1, was enhanced in the transformant and photoinhibition of PSII was alleviated. However, photodamage to PSII, measured in the presence of lincomycin, was similar between the transformant and wild-type cells, suggesting that expression of mutated EF-Tu might enhance the repair of PSII. Alleviating photoinhibition through mutation of EF-Tu did not alter cell growth under strong light, perhaps due to the enhanced production of reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species. These observations suggest that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation of EF-Tu under strong light inhibits PSII repair, resulting in the stimulation of photoinhibition.</p>

What Quantity of Photosystem I Is Optimum for Safe Photosynthesis?
<p>PSI has the potential to generate reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species and be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>atively inactivated by the reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species. The photo-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative damage of PSI (also called PSI photoinhibition) causes the inhibition of the plant growth and is a lethal event for plants. It has been reported that PSI photoinhibition does not occur as long as the reaction-center chlorophyll (P700) remains <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized, even in excess light conditions. This process is termed P700 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation and is supported by various regulatory mechanisms and likely also by the stoichiometric quantities of photosynthetic apparatus. In this study, we assessed how decreased photochemically active PSI in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) affected a variety of photosynthetic parameters, including P700 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation. Inactivation of PSI was rapidly and selectively induced by repetitive short-pulse illumination. PSI photoinhibition correlated linearly with decreases in effective quantum yield of PSII and nonphotochemical quenching; however, the photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate was less affected, as exemplified by ∼50% of the normal CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate maintained with an 80% loss in PSI photochemical activity. In contrast, effective quantum yield of PSI was enhanced following PSI photoinhibition, mainly owing to a decrease in the electron donor-side limitation of PSI. Based on these results, we propose that the stoichiometric quantity of PSI is optimized to induce P700 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation for dissipating excess light energy in PSI, thus avoiding inhibition of photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation caused by PSI photoinhibition.</p>

Simultaneous high-resolution pH and spectrophotometric recordings of oxygen binding in blood microvolumes
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> equilibrium curves have been widely used to understand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> transport in numerous organisms. A major challenge has been to monitor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> binding characteristics and concomitant pH changes as they occur <i>in vivo</i>, in limited sample volumes. Here we report a technique allowing highly resolved and simultaneous monitoring of pH and blood pigment saturation in minute blood volumes. We equipped a gas diffusion chamber with a broad-range fibre-optic spectrophotometer and a micro-pH optode and recorded changes of pigment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ation along <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> partial pressure (<i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) and pH gradients to test the setup. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> binding parameters derived from measurements in only 15 μl of haemolymph from the cephalopod <i>Octopus vulgaris</i> showed low instrumental error (0.93%) and good agreement with published data. Broad-range spectra, each resolving 2048 data points, provided detailed insight into the complex absorbance characteristics of diverse blood types. After consideration of photobleaching and intrinsic fluorescence, pH optodes yielded accurate recordings and resolved a sigmoidal shift of 0.03 pH units in response to changing <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> from 0 to 21 kPa. Highly resolved continuous recordings along pH gradients conformed to stepwise measurements at low rates of pH changes. In this study we showed that a diffusion chamber upgraded with a broad-range spectrophotometer and an optical pH sensor accurately characterizes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> binding with minimal sample consumption and manipulation. We conclude that the modified diffusion chamber is highly suitable for experimental biologists who demand high flexibility, detailed insight into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> binding as well as experimental and biological accuracy combined in a single setup.</p>

Rapid mitochondrial adjustments in response to short-term hypoxia and re-oxygenation in the Pacific oyster, <i>Crassostrea gigas</i>

Mitochondrial respiratory rates (states 3 and 4 stimulated by glutamate) and phosphorylation efficiency [respiratory control ratio (RCR) and the relationship between ADP and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> consumption (ADP/O)] were measured. Cytochrome <i>c</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ase (CCO) activity and cytochrome concentrations (<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>c</i>) were measured to investigate the rearrangements of respiratory chain subunits. The potential implication of an alternative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ase (AOX) was investigated using an inhibitor of the respiratory chain (antimycin A) and through gene expression analysis in gills and digestive gland. Results indicate a downregulation of mitochondrial capacity, with 60% inhibition of respiratory rates after 12 h of hypoxia. RCR remained stable, while ADP/O increased after 12 h of hypoxia and 1 h of re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ation, suggesting increased phosphorylation efficiency. CCO showed a fast and remarkable increase of its catalytic activity only after 3 h of hypoxia. AOX mRNA levels showed similar patterns in gills and digestive gland, and were upregulated after 12 and 24 h of hypoxia and during re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ation.

Histone modifiers are oxygen sensors
<p>Approximately 2.6 billion years ago, during the Proterozoic period, the evolution of photosynthesis in cyanobacteria led to the introduction of the by-product of this reaction, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>, into Earth's atmosphere (<i>1</i>). This great <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative event heralded the rise of multicellular organisms, which are almost totally dependent on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> as an efficient fuel for metabolism and as a cofactor in many critical physiological enzymatic reactions. Central to this adaptation, and to allow cellular physiology across a wide range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> concentrations (tensions), metazoans have evolved the highly conserved hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway (<i>2</i>). This is important for both physiological and pathological processes that occur in a hypoxic microenvironment, including embryogenesis, stem cell homeostasis, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. It has long been observed that hypoxia induces histone lysine hypermethylation, a form of epigenetic chromatin modification. However, whether this represents a direct sensing of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> tension or an indirect effect, perhaps through the HIF pathway, has not been established (<i>3</i>). On pages 1222 and 1217 of this issue, Batie <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) and Chakraborty <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>), respectively, resolve this question, demonstrating in different cellular systems that the activity of the lysine-specific demethylases (KDMs) KDM5A and KDM6A is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> sensitive, and thereby identifying them as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> sensors.</p>

Histone demethylase KDM6A directly senses oxygen to control chromatin and cell fate
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> sensing is central to metazoan biology and has implications for human disease. Mammalian cells express multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>-dependent enzymes called 2-oxoglutarate (OG)-dependent di<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ases (2-OGDDs), but they vary in their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> affinities and hence their ability to sense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>. The 2-OGDD histone demethylases control histone methylation. Hypoxia increases histone methylation, but whether this reflects direct effects on histone demethylases or indirect effects caused by the hypoxic induction of the HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor) transcription factor or the 2-OG antagonist 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) is unclear. Here, we report that hypoxia promotes histone methylation in a HIF- and 2-HG–independent manner. We found that the H3K27 histone demethylase KDM6A/UTX, but not its paralog KDM6B, is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> sensitive. KDM6A loss, like hypoxia, prevented H3K27 demethylation and blocked cellular differentiation. Restoring H3K27 methylation homeostasis in hypoxic cells reversed these effects. Thus, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> directly affects chromatin regulators to control cell fate.</p>

Photochemical Route for Accessing Amorphous Metal Oxide Materials for Water Oxidation Catalysis

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Root Bending Is Antagonistically Affected by Hypoxia and ERF-Mediated Transcription via Auxin Signaling
<p>When plants encounter soil water logging or flooding, roots are the first organs to be confronted with reduced gas diffusion resulting in limited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> supply. Since roots do not generate photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>, they are rapidly faced with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> shortage rendering roots particularly prone to damage. While metabolic adaptations to low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> conditions, which ensure basic energy supply, have been well characterized, adaptation of root growth and development have received less attention. In this study, we show that hypoxic conditions cause the primary root to grow sidewise in a low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> environment, possibly to escape soil patches with reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> availability. This growth behavior is reversible in that gravitropic growth resumes when seedlings are returned to normoxic conditions. Hypoxic root bending is inhibited by the group VII ethylene response factor (ERFVII) RAP2.12, as <i>rap2.12-1</i> seedlings show exaggerated primary root bending. Furthermore, overexpression of the ERFVII member <i>HRE2</i> inhibits root bending, suggesting that primary root growth direction at hypoxic conditions is antagonistically regulated by hypoxia and hypoxia-activated ERFVIIs. Root bending is preceded by the establishment of an auxin gradient across the root tip as quantified with DII-VENUS and is synergistically enhanced by hypoxia and the auxin transport inhibitor naphthylphthalamic acid. The protein abundance of the auxin efflux carrier PIN2 is reduced at hypoxic conditions, a response that is suppressed by RAP2.12 overexpression, suggesting antagonistic control of auxin flux by hypoxia and ERFVII. Taken together, we show that hypoxia triggers an escape response of the primary root that is controlled by ERFVII activity and mediated by auxin signaling in the root tip.</p>

The Liverwort, <i>Marchantia</i>, Drives Alternative Electron Flow Using a Flavodiiron Protein to Protect PSI
<p>The diffusion efficiency of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> in the atmosphere, like that of CO<sub>2</sub>, is approximately 10<sup>4</sup> times greater than that in aqueous environments. Consequently, terrestrial photosynthetic organisms need mechanisms to protect against potential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative damage. The liverwort <i>Marchantia polymorpha</i>, a basal land plant, has habitats where it is exposed to both water and the atmosphere. Furthermore, like cyanobacteria, <i>M. polymorpha</i> has genes encoding flavodiiron proteins (FLV). In cyanobacteria, FLVs mediate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>-dependent alternative electron flow (AEF) to suppress the production of reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species. Here, we investigated whether FLVs are required for the protection of photosynthesis in <i>M. polymorpha</i>. A mutant deficient in the FLV1 isozyme (Δ<i>MpFlv1</i>) sustained photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative damage to photosystem I (PSI) following repetitive short-saturation pulses of light. Compared with the wild type (Takaragaike-1), Δ<i>MpFlv1</i> showed the same photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> evolution rate but a lower electron transport rate during the induction phase of photosynthesis. Additionally, the reaction center chlorophyll in PSI, P700, was highly reduced in Δ<i>MpFlv1</i> but not in Takaragaike-1. These results indicate that the gene product of <i>MpFlv1</i> drives AEF to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ize PSI, as in cyanobacteria. Furthermore, FLV-mediated AEF supports the production of a proton motive force to possibly induce the nonphotochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence and suppress electron transport in the cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub>/<i>f</i> complex. After submerging the thalli, a decrease in photosystem II operating efficiency was observed, particularly in Δ<i>MpFlv1</i>, which implies that species living in these sorts of habitats require FLV-mediated AEF.</p>

Physiological correlates of symbiont migration during bleaching of two octocoral species
<p>Perturbed colonies of <i>Phenganax parrini</i> and <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. exhibit migration of symbionts of <i>Symbiodinium</i> spp. into the stolons. Densitometry and visual inspection indicated that polyps bleached while stolons did not. When migration was triggered by temperature, light and confinement, colonies of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. decreased rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> formation in the light (due to the effects of perturbation on photosynthesis and respiration) and increased rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> uptake in the dark (due to the effects of perturbation on respiration alone). Colonies of <i>P. parrini</i>, by contrast, showed no significant changes in either aspect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> metabolism. When migration was triggered by light and confinement, colonies of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. showed decreased rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> formation in the light and increased rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> uptake in the dark, while colonies of <i>P. parrini</i> maintained the former and increased the latter. During symbiont migration into their stolons, colonies of both species showed dramatic increases in reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species (ROS), as visualized with a fluorescent probe, with stolons of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. exhibiting a nearly immediate increase of ROS. Differences in symbiont type may explain the greater sensitivity of colonies of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. Using fluorescent probes, direct measurements of migrating symbionts in the stolons of <i>Sarcothelia</i> sp. showed higher levels of reactive nitrogen species and lower levels of ROS than the surrounding host tissue. As measured by native fluorescence, levels of NAD(P)H in the stolons were unaffected by perturbation. Symbiont migration thus correlates with dramatic physiological changes and may serve as a marker for coral condition.</p>

Reactive oxygen species induce virus-independent MAVS oligomerization in systemic lupus erythematosus
<p>The increased expression of genes induced by type I interferon (IFN) is characteristic of viral infections and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We showed that mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) protein, which normally forms a complex with retinoic acid gene I (RIG-I)–like helicases during viral infection, was activated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress independently of RIG-I helicases. We found that chemically generated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress stimulated the formation of MAVS oligomers, which led to mitochondrial hyperpolarization and decreased adenosine triphosphate production and spare respiratory capacity, responses that were not observed in similarly treated cells lacking MAVS. Peripheral blood lymphocytes of SLE patients also showed spontaneous MAVS oligomerization that correlated with the increased secretion of type I IFN and mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress. Furthermore, inhibition of mitochondrial reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species (ROS) by the mitochondria-targeted anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ant MitoQ prevented MAVS oligomerization and type I IFN production. ROS-dependent MAVS oligomerization and type I IFN production were reduced in cells expressing the MAVS-C79F variant, which occurs in 30% of sub-Saharan Africans and is linked with reduced type I IFN secretion and milder disease in SLE patients. Patients expressing the MAVS-C79F variant also had reduced amounts of oligomerized MAVS in their plasma compared to healthy controls. Together, our findings suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress–induced MAVS oligomerization in SLE patients may contribute to the type I IFN signature that is characteristic of this syndrome.</p>

ATM directs DNA damage responses and proteostasis via genetically separable pathways
<p>The protein kinase ATM is a master regulator of the DNA damage response but also responds directly to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress. Loss of ATM causes ataxia telangiectasia, a neurodegenerative disorder with pleiotropic symptoms that include cerebellar dysfunction, cancer, diabetes, and premature aging. We genetically separated the activation of ATM by DNA damage from that by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress using separation-of-function mutations. We found that deficient activation of ATM by the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex and DNA double-strand breaks resulted in loss of cell viability, checkpoint activation, and DNA end resection in response to DNA damage. In contrast, loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative activation of ATM had minimal effects on DNA damage–related outcomes but blocked ATM-mediated initiation of checkpoint responses after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress and resulted in deficiencies in mitochondrial function and autophagy. In addition, expression of a variant ATM incapable of activation by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress resulted in widespread protein aggregation. These results indicate a direct relationship between the mechanism of ATM activation and its effects on cellular metabolism and DNA damage responses in human cells and implicate ATM in the control of protein homeostasis.</p>

Two-billion-year-old evaporites capture Earth’s great oxidation
<p>Major changes in atmospheric and ocean chemistry occurred in the Paleoproterozoic era (2.5 to 1.6 billion years ago). Increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation dramatically changed Earth’s surface, but few quantitative constraints exist on this important transition. This study describes the sedimentology, mineralogy, and geochemistry of a 2-billion-year-old, ~800-meter-thick evaporite succession from the Onega Basin in Russian Karelia. The deposit consists of a basal unit dominated by halite (~100 meters) followed by units dominated by anhydrite-magnesite (~500 meters) and dolomite-magnesite (~200 meters). The evaporite minerals robustly constrain marine sulfate concentrations to at least 10 millimoles per kilogram of water, representing an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ant reservoir equivalent to more than 20% of the modern ocean-atmosphere <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>izing capacity.

A liquid metal reaction environment for the room-temperature synthesis of atomically thin metal oxides
<p>Two-dimensional (2D) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>es have a wide variety of applications in electronics and other technologies. However, many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>es are not easy to synthesize as 2D materials through conventional methods. We used nontoxic eutectic gallium-based alloys as a reaction solvent and co-alloyed desired metals into the melt. On the basis of thermodynamic considerations, we predicted the composition of the self-limiting interfacial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e. We isolated the surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e as a 2D layer, either on substrates or in suspension.

Structural basis of the redox switches in the NAD<sup>+</sup>-reducing soluble [NiFe]-hydrogenase
<p>NAD<sup>+</sup> (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized form of NAD:nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide)–reducing soluble [NiFe]-hydrogenase (SH) is phylogenetically related to NADH (reduced form of NAD<sup>+</sup>):quinone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>oreductase (complex I), but the geometrical arrangements of the subunits and Fe–S clusters are unclear. Here, we describe the crystal structures of SH in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized and reduced states. The cluster arrangement is similar to that of complex I, but the subunits orientation is not, which supports the hypothesis that subunits evolved as prebuilt modules. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized active site includes a six-coordinate Ni, which is unprecedented for hydrogenases, whose coordination geometry would prevent O<sub>2</sub> from approaching. In the reduced state showing the normal active site structure without a physiological electron acceptor, the flavin mononucleotide cofactor is dissociated, which may be caused by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation state change of nearby Fe–S clusters and may suppress production of reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species.</p>

Archaeal (Per)Chlorate Reduction at High Temperature: An Interplay of Biotic and Abiotic Reactions
<sec><title>Archaea Powered by Rocket Fuel</title><p>Perchlorate is a ubiquitous chlorine-based compound that forms naturally in the atmosphere. It is only present in large deposits in a few locations, such as the Atacama Desert in Chile, which has been assumed to be because perchlorate-reducing bacteria normally degrade it into chloride and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>. <bold>Liebensteiner <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 85; see the Perspective by <bold>Nerenberg</bold>), however, found that an archeon, <i>Archaeoglobus fulgidus</i>, can also reduce perchlorate.

Because hyperthermophilic anaerobic archaea similar to <i>A. fulgidus</i> are thought to have been among the first complex organisms to evolve on Earth, they may have started creating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized conditions in some habitats before the emergence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>-generating photosynthesis.</p></sec>

Protein Carbonylation and Glycation in Legume Nodules
<p>Nitrogen fixation is an agronomically and environmentally important process catalyzed by bacterial nitrogenase within legume root nodules. These unique symbiotic organs have high metabolic rates and produce large amounts of reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species that may modify proteins irreversibly. Here, we examined two types of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative posttranslational modifications of nodule proteins: carbonylation, which occurs by direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation of certain amino acids or by interaction with reactive aldehydes arising from cell membrane lipid per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>es; and glycation, which results from the reaction of lysine and arginine residues with reducing sugars or their auto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation products. We used a strategy based on the enrichment of carbonylated peptides by affinity chromatography followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify 369 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized proteins in bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) nodules. Of these, 238 corresponded to plant proteins and 131 to bacterial proteins. Lipid per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation products induced most carbonylation sites. This study also revealed that carbonylation has major effects on two key nodule proteins. Metal-catalyzed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation caused the inactivation of malate dehydrogenase and the aggregation of leghemoglobin. In addition, numerous glycated proteins were identified in vivo, including three key nodule proteins: sucrose synthase, glutamine synthetase, and glutamate synthase. Label-free quantification identified 10 plant proteins and 18 bacterial proteins as age-specifically glycated. Overall, our results suggest that the selective carbonylation or glycation of crucial proteins involved in nitrogen metabolism, transcriptional regulation, and signaling may constitute a mechanism to control cell metabolism and nodule senescence.</p>

Aldehyde Oxidase 4 Plays a Critical Role in Delaying Silique Senescence by Catalyzing Aldehyde Detoxification
<p>The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) aldehyde <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ases are a multigene family of four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ases (AAO1–AAO4) that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ize a variety of aldehydes, among them abscisic aldehyde, which is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized to the phytohormone abscisic acid. Toxic aldehydes are generated in plants both under normal conditions and in response to stress. The detoxification of such aldehydes by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation is attributed to aldehyde dehydrogenases but never to aldehyde <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ases. The feasibility of the detoxification of aldehydes in siliques via <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation by AAO4 was demonstrated, first, by its ability to efficiently <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ize an array of aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes, including the reactive carbonyl species (RCS) acrolein, hydroxyl-2-nonenal, and malondialdehyde. Next, exogenous application of several aldehydes to siliques in AAO4 knockout (KO) Arabidopsis plants induced severe tissue damage and enhanced malondialdehyde levels and senescence symptoms, but not in wild-type siliques. Furthermore, abiotic stresses such as dark and ultraviolet C irradiation caused an increase in endogenous RCS and higher expression levels of senescence marker genes, leading to premature senescence of KO siliques, whereas RCS and senescence marker levels in wild-type siliques were hardly affected. Finally, in naturally senesced KO siliques, higher endogenous RCS levels were associated with enhanced senescence molecular markers, chlorophyll degradation, and earlier seed shattering compared with the wild type. The aldehyde-dependent differential generation of super<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e and hydrogen per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e by AAO4 and the induction of AAO4 expression by hydrogen per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e shown here suggest a self-amplification mechanism for detoxifying additional reactive aldehydes produced during stress. Taken together, our results indicate that AAO4 plays a critical role in delaying senescence in siliques by catalyzing aldehyde detoxification.</p>

Ferredoxin:NADP(H) Oxidoreductase Abundance and Location Influences Redox Poise and Stress Tolerance
<p>In linear photosynthetic electron transport, ferredoxin:NADP(H) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>oreductase (FNR) transfers electrons from ferredoxin (Fd) to NADP<sup>+</sup>. Both NADPH and reduced Fd (Fd<sup>red</sup>) are required for reductive assimilation and light/dark activation/deactivation of enzymes. FNR is therefore a hub, connecting photosynthetic electron transport to chloroplast redox metabolism. A correlation between FNR content and tolerance to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress is well established, although the precise mechanism remains unclear. We investigated the impact of altered FNR content and localization on electron transport and super<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e radical evolution in isolated thylakoids, and probed resulting changes in redox homeostasis, expression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress markers, and tolerance to high light in planta. Our data indicate that the ratio of Fd<sup>red</sup> to FNR is critical, with either too much or too little FNR potentially leading to increased super<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e production, and perception of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress at the level of gene transcription. In FNR overexpressing plants, which show more NADP(H) and glutathione pools, improved tolerance to high-light stress indicates that disturbance of chloroplast redox poise and increased free radical generation may help “prime” the plant and induce protective mechanisms. In <i>fnr1</i> knock-outs, the NADP(H) and glutathione pools are more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized relative to the wild type, and the photoprotective effect is absent despite perception of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress at the level of gene transcription.</p>

High basal metabolic rate does not elevate oxidative stress during reproduction in laboratory mice
<p>Increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress (OS) has been suggested as a physiological cost of reproduction. However, previous studies reported ambiguous results, with some even showing a reduction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative damage during reproduction. We tested whether the link between reproduction and OS is mediated by basal metabolic rate (BMR), which has been hypothesized to affect both the rate of radical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species production and anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative capacity. We studied the effect of reproduction on OS in females of laboratory mice divergently selected for high (H-BMR) and low (L-BMR) BMR, previously shown to differ with respect to parental investment. Non-reproducing L-BMR females showed higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative damage to lipids (quantified as the level of malondialdehyde in internal organ tissues) and DNA (quantified as the level of 8-oxodG in blood serum) than H-BMR females. Reproduction did not affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative damage to lipids in either line; however, it reduced damage to DNA in L-BMR females. Reproduction increased catalase activity in liver (significantly stronger in L-BMR females) and decreased it in kidneys. We conclude that the effect of reproduction on OS depends on the initial variation in BMR and varies between studied internal organs and markers of OS.</p>

Differential effects of vitamins E and C and carotenoids on growth, resistance to oxidative stress, fledging success and plumage colouration in wild great tits
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress is the imbalance between the production of reactive species and anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ants, which causes damage to lipids, proteins and DNA. Anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ants, like vitamins and carotenoids, can limit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative damage and can therefore regulate the trade-off between growth, which is a period of high reactive species production, and self-maintenance. However, the role of carotenoids as anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ants <i>in vivo</i> has been debated, and it has been suggested that carotenoid-based signals indicate the availability of non-pigmentary anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ants (e.g. vitamins) that protect carotenoids from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation, known as the ‘protection hypothesis’. To evaluate the importance of vitamins versus carotenoids as anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ants during growth and to test the protection hypothesis, we supplemented nestling great tits, <i>Parus major</i>, 3, 5 and 7 days after hatching with a single dose of carotenoids and/or vitamins in a 2×2 full-factorial design. We subsequently measured body condition, anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ant capacity, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative damage, fledging success and plumage reflectance. Vitamins enhanced anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ant capacity, but did not affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative damage. Vitamin-treated nestlings had higher growth rates and higher probability of fledging. In contrast, carotenoids did not affect any of these traits. Furthermore, carotenoid-based colouration increased over the breeding season in nestlings that received vitamins only. This study shows that vitamins are limiting for growth rate and fledging success, and suggests that vitamins could regulate the trade-off between growth and self-maintenance in favour of the former. Moreover, our results are consistent with the idea that carotenoids are minor anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ants in birds, but they do not support the protection hypothesis.</p>

Skeletal muscle fuel selection occurs at the mitochondrial level
<p>Mammals exponentially increase the rate of carbohydrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation as exercise intensity rises, while birds combust lipid almost exclusively while flying at high percentages of aerobic capacity. The fuel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized by contracting muscle depends on many factors: whole-body fuel storage mass, mobilization, blood transport, cellular uptake, and substrate selection at the level of the mitochondrion. We examined the fuel preferences of mitochondria isolated from mammalian and avian locomotory muscles using two approaches. First, the influence of substrates on the kinetics of respiration (<i>K</i><sub>m,ADP</sub> and <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>) was evaluated. For all substrates and combinations, <i>K</i><sub>m,ADP</sub> was generally twofold higher in avian mitochondria. Second, fuel competition between pyruvate, glutamate and/or palmitoyl-<sc>l</sc>-carnitine at three levels of ATP free energy was determined using the principle of mass balance and the measured rates of O<sub>2</sub> consumption and metabolite accumulation/utilization. Avian mitochondria strongly spared pyruvate from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation when another substrate was available and fatty acid was the dominant substrate, regardless of energy state. Mammalian mitochondria exhibited some preference for fatty acid over pyruvate at lower flux (higher energy state), but exhibited a much greater tendency to select pyruvate and glutamate when available. Studies in sonicated mitochondria revealed twofold higher electron transport chain electron conductance in avian mitochondria. We conclude that substantial fuel selection occurs at the level of the mitochondrial matrix and that avian flight muscle mitochondria are particularly biased toward the selection of fatty acid, possibly by facilitating high β-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation flux by maintaining a more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized matrix.</p>

A high-energy-density lithium-oxygen battery based on a reversible four-electron conversion to lithium oxide

Late inception of a resiliently oxygenated upper ocean
<p>Rising oceanic and atmospheric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> levels through time have been crucial to enhanced habitability of surface Earth environments. Few redox proxies can track secular variations in dissolved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> concentrations around threshold levels for metazoan survival in the upper ocean. We present an extensive compilation of iodine-to-calcium ratios (I/Ca) in marine carbonates. Our record supports a major rise in the partial pressure of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> in the atmosphere at ~400 million years (Ma) ago and reveals a step change in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ation of the upper ocean to relatively sustainable near-modern conditions at ~200 Ma ago. An Earth system model demonstrates that a shift in organic matter remineralization to greater depths, which may have been due to increasing size and biomineralization of eukaryotic plankton, likely drove the I/Ca signals at ~200 Ma ago.</p>

Microbial oxidation of lithospheric organic carbon in rapidly eroding tropical mountain soils
<p>Lithospheric organic carbon (“petrogenic”; OC<sub>petro</sub>) is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized during exhumation and subsequent erosion of mountain ranges. This process is a considerable source of carbon di<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e (CO<sub>2</sub>) to the atmosphere over geologic time scales, but the mechanisms that govern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation rates in mountain landscapes are poorly constrained. We demonstrate that, on average, 67 ± 11% of the OC<sub>petro</sub> initially present in bedrock exhumed from the tropical, rapidly eroding Central Range of Taiwan is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized in soils, leading to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of 6.1 to 18.6 metric tons of carbon per square kilometer per year. The molecular and isotopic evolution of bulk OC and lipid biomarkers during soil formation reveals that OC<sub>petro</sub> remineralization is microbially mediated. Rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation in mountain soils drives CO<sub>2</sub> emission fluxes that increase with erosion rate, thereby counteracting CO<sub>2</sub> drawdown by silicate weathering and biospheric OC burial.</p>

Major role of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria in dark ocean carbon fixation
<p>Carbon fixation by chemoautotrophic microorganisms in the dark ocean has a major impact on global carbon cycling and ecological relationships in the ocean’s interior, but the relevant taxa and energy sources remain enigmatic. We show evidence that nitrite-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>izing bacteria affiliated with the Nitrospinae phylum are important in dark ocean chemoautotrophy. Single-cell genomics and community metagenomics revealed that Nitrospinae are the most abundant and globally distributed nitrite-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>izing bacteria in the ocean. Metaproteomics and metatranscriptomics analyses suggest that nitrite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation is the main pathway of energy production in Nitrospinae. Microautoradiography, linked with catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization, indicated that Nitrospinae fix 15 to 45% of inorganic carbon in the mesopelagic western North Atlantic. Nitrite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation may have a greater impact on the carbon cycle than previously assumed.</p>

Selective anaerobic oxidation of methane enables direct synthesis of methanol

The activation in helium at 673 kelvin (K), followed by consecutive catalyst exposures to 7 bars of methane and then water at 473 K, consistently produced 0.204 mole of CH<sub>3</sub>OH per mole of copper in zeolite. Isotopic labeling confirmed water as the source of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> to regenerate the zeolite active centers and renders methanol desorption energetically favorable.

Hawkmoths use nectar sugar to reduce oxidative damage from flight
<p>Nectar-feeding animals have among the highest recorded metabolic rates. High aerobic performance is linked to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative damage in muscles. Anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ants in nectar are scarce to nonexistent. We propose that nectarivores use nectar sugar to mitigate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative damage caused by the muscular demands of flight. We found that sugar-fed moths had lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative damage to their flight muscle membranes than unfed moths. Using respirometry coupled with δ<sup>13</sup>C analyses, we showed that moths generate anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ant potential by shunting nectar glucose to the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), resulting in a reduction in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative damage to the flight muscles.

Signal Dynamics and Interactions during Flooding Stress
<p>Flooding is detrimental for nearly all higher plants, including crops. The compound stress elicited by slow gas exchange and low light levels under water is responsible for both a carbon and an energy crisis ultimately leading to plant death. The endogenous concentrations of four gaseous compounds, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>, carbon di<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e, ethylene, and nitric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e, change during the submergence of plant organs in water. These gases play a pivotal role in signal transduction cascades, leading to adaptive processes such as metabolic adjustments and anatomical features. Of these gases, ethylene is seen as the most consistent, pervasive, and reliable signal of early flooding stress, most likely in tight interaction with the other gases. The production of reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species (ROS) in plant cells during flooding and directly after subsidence, during which the plant is confronted with high light and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> levels, is characteristic for this abiotic stress. Low, well-controlled levels of ROS are essential for adaptive signaling pathways, in interaction with the other gaseous flooding signals. On the other hand, excessive uncontrolled bursts of ROS can be highly damaging for plants. Therefore, a fine-tuned balance is important, with a major role for ROS production and scavenging. Our understanding of the temporal dynamics of the four gases and ROS is basal, whereas it is likely that they form a signature readout of prevailing flooding conditions and subsequent adaptive responses.</p>

Flavodiiron Proteins Promote Fast and Transient O<sub>2</sub> Photoreduction in <i>Chlamydomonas</i><xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>During <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ic photosynthesis, the reducing power generated by light energy conversion is mainly used to reduce carbon di<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e. In bacteria and archae, flavodiiron (Flv) proteins catalyze O<sub>2</sub> or NO reduction, thus protecting cells against <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative or nitrosative stress. These proteins are found in cyanobacteria, mosses, and microalgae, but have been lost in angiosperms. Here, we used chlorophyll fluorescence and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> exchange measurement using [<sup>18</sup>O]-labeled O<sub>2</sub> and a membrane inlet mass spectrometer to characterize <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii flvB</i> insertion mutants devoid of both FlvB and FlvA proteins. We show that Flv proteins are involved in a photo-dependent electron flow to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>, which drives most of the photosynthetic electron flow during the induction of photosynthesis. As a consequence, the chlorophyll fluorescence patterns are strongly affected in <i>flvB</i> mutants during a light transient, showing a lower PSII operating yield and a slower nonphotochemical quenching induction. Photoautotrophic growth of <i>flvB</i> mutants was indistinguishable from the wild type under constant light, but severely impaired under fluctuating light due to PSI photo damage. Remarkably, net photosynthesis of <i>flv</i> mutants was higher than in the wild type during the initial hour of a fluctuating light regime, but this advantage vanished under long-term exposure, and turned into PSI photo damage, thus explaining the marked growth retardation observed in these conditions. We conclude that the <i>C. reinhardtii</i> Flv participates in a Mehler-like reduction of O<sub>2</sub>, which drives a large part of the photosynthetic electron flow during a light transient and is thus critical for growth under fluctuating light regimes.</p>

Cytosolic and Chloroplastic DHARs Cooperate in Oxidative Stress-Driven Activation of the Salicylic Acid Pathway
<p>The complexity of plant anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative systems gives rise to many unresolved questions. One relates to the functional importance of dehydroascorbate reductases (DHARs) in interactions between ascorbate and glutathione. To investigate this issue, we produced a complete set of loss-of-function mutants for the three annotated Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) DHARs. The combined loss of <i>DHAR1</i> and <i>DHAR3</i> expression decreased extractable activity to very low levels but had little effect on phenotype or ascorbate and glutathione pools in standard conditions. An analysis of the subcellular localization of the DHARs in Arabidopsis lines stably transformed with GFP fusion proteins revealed that DHAR1 and DHAR2 are cytosolic while DHAR3 is chloroplastic, with no evidence for peroxisomal or mitochondrial localizations. When the mutations were introduced into an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress genetic background (<i>cat2</i>), the <i>dhar1 dhar2</i> combination decreased glutathione <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation and inhibited <i>cat2</i>-triggered induction of the salicylic acid pathway. These effects were reversed in <i>cat2 dhar1 dhar2 dhar3</i> complemented with any of the three DHARs. The data suggest that (1) DHAR can be decreased to negligible levels without marked effects on ascorbate pools, (2) the cytosolic isoforms are particularly important in coupling intracellular hydrogen per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e metabolism to glutathione <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation, and (3) DHAR-dependent glutathione <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation influences redox-driven salicylic acid accumulation.</p>

Oxidation of P700 in Photosystem I Is Essential for the Growth of Cyanobacteria
<p>The photoinhibition of photosystem I (PSI) is lethal to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ic phototrophs. Nevertheless, it is unclear how photodamage occurs or how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>ic phototrophs prevent it. Here, we provide evidence that keeping P700 (the reaction center chlorophyll in PSI) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ized protects PSI. Previous studies have suggested that PSI photoinhibition does not occur in the two model cyanobacteria, <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 and <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> PCC 7942, when photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> fixation was suppressed under low CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure even in mutants deficient in flavodiiron protein (FLV), which mediates alternative electron flow. The lack of FLV in <i>Synechococcus</i> sp. PCC 7002 (S. 7002), however, is linked directly to reduced growth and PSI photodamage under CO<sub>2</sub>-limiting conditions. Unlike <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 and <i>S. elongatus</i> PCC 7942, S. 7002 reduced P700 during CO<sub>2</sub>-limited illumination in the absence of FLV, resulting in decreases in both PSI and photosynthetic activities. Even at normal air CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, the growth of S. 7002 mutant was retarded relative to that of the wild type. Therefore, P700 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation is essential for protecting PSI against photoinhibition. Here, we present various strategies to alleviate PSI photoinhibition in cyanobacteria.</p>

Phytoglobins Improve Hypoxic Root Growth by Alleviating Apical Meristem Cell Death
<p>Hypoxic root growth in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) is influenced by the expression of phytoglobins (<i>ZmPgbs</i>). Relative to the wild type, suppression of <i>ZmPgb1.1</i> or <i>ZmPgb1.2</i> inhibits the growth of roots exposed to 4% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong>, causing structural abnormalities in the root apical meristems. These effects were accompanied by increasing levels of reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species (ROS), possibly through the transcriptional induction of four <i>Respiratory Burst <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ase Homologs</i>. TUNEL-positive nuclei in meristematic cells indicated the involvement of programmed cell death (PCD) in the process. These cells also accumulated nitric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e and stained heavily for ethylene biosynthetic transcripts. A sharp increase in the expression level of several 1-aminocyclopropane synthase (<i>ZmAcs2</i>, <i>ZmAcs6</i>, and <i>ZmAcs7</i>), 1-aminocyclopropane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ase (<i>Aco15</i>, <i>Aco20</i>, <i>Aco31</i>, and <i>Aco35</i>), and ethylene-responsive (<i>ZmErf2</i> and <i>ZmEbf1</i>) genes was observed in hypoxic <i>ZmPgb</i>-suppressing roots, which overproduced ethylene. Inhibiting ROS synthesis with diphenyleneiodonium or ethylene perception with 1-methylcyclopropene suppressed PCD, increased <i>BAX inhibitor-1</i>, an effective attenuator of the death programs in eukaryotes, and restored root growth. Hypoxic roots overexpressing <i>ZmPgbs</i> had the lowest level of ethylene and showed a reduction in ROS staining and TUNEL-positive nuclei in the meristematic cells. These roots retained functional meristems and exhibited the highest growth performance when subjected to hypoxic conditions. Collectively, these results suggest a novel function of Pgbs in protecting root apical meristems from hypoxia-induced PCD through mechanisms initiated by nitric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e and mediated by ethylene via ROS.</p>

Deep-diving sea lions exhibit extreme bradycardia in long-duration dives
<p>Heart rate and peripheral blood flow distribution are the primary determinants of the rate and pattern of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> store utilisation and ultimately breath-hold duration in marine endotherms. Despite this, little is known about how otariids (sea lions and fur seals) regulate heart rate (<i>f</i><sub>H</sub>) while diving. We investigated dive <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> in five adult female California sea lions (<i>Zalophus californianus</i>) during foraging trips by instrumenting them with digital electrocardiogram (ECG) loggers and time depth recorders. In all dives, dive <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> (number of beats/duration; 50±9 beats min<sup>−1</sup>) decreased compared with surface rates (113±5 beats min<sup>−1</sup>), with all dives exhibiting an instantaneous <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> below resting (<54 beats min<sup>−1</sup>) at some point during the dive. Both dive <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> and minimum instantaneous <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> significantly decreased with increasing dive duration. Typical instantaneous <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> profiles of deep dives (>100 m) consisted of: (1) an initial rapid decline in <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> resulting in the lowest instantaneous <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> of the dive at the end of descent, often below 10 beats min<sup>−1</sup> in dives longer than 6 min in duration; (2) a slight increase in <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> to ~10–40 beats min<sup>−1</sup> during the bottom portion of the dive; and (3) a gradual increase in <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> during ascent with a rapid increase prior to surfacing. Thus, <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> regulation in deep-diving sea lions is not simply a progressive bradycardia. Extreme bradycardia and the presumed associated reductions in pulmonary and peripheral blood flow during late descent of deep dives should (a) contribute to preservation of the lung <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> store, (b) increase dependence of muscle on the myoglobin-bound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> store, (c) conserve the blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> store and (d) help limit the absorption of nitrogen at depth. This <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> profile during deep dives of sea lions may be characteristic of deep-diving marine endotherms that dive on inspiration as similar <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> profiles have been recently documented in the emperor penguin, another deep diver that dives on inspiration.</p>

Endothelial Microparticles From Acute Coronary Syndrome Patients Induce Premature Coronary Artery Endothelial Cell Aging and Thrombogenicity

MPs were prepared from ECs and venous blood from patients with ACS (n=30) and from healthy volunteers (n=4) by sequential centrifugation.

Exposure of P1 ECs to MPs shed from senescent P3 cells or circulating MPs from ACS patients induced increased senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative stress, early phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and Akt, and upregulation of p53, p21, and p16. Ex vivo, the prosenescent effect of circulating MPs from ACS patients was evidenced only under conditions of low shear stress. Depletion of endothelial-derived MPs from ACS patients reduced the induction of senescence. Prosenescent MPs promoted EC thrombogenicity through tissue factor upregulation, shedding of procoagulant MPs, endothelial nitric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e synthase downregulation, and reduced nitric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e–mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation. These MPs exhibited angiotensin-converting enzyme activity and upregulated AT1 receptors and angiotensin-converting enzyme in P1 ECs.

These actions of lovastatin were abolished by enforced miR-133a expression and were mirrored by a miR-133a antagomir. In mice, hyperlipidemia- or hyperglycemia-induced ectopic miR-133a expression in the vascular endothelium, reduced GCH1 protein and tetrahydrobiopterin levels, and impaired endothelial function, which were reversed by lovastatin or miR-133a antagomir. These beneficial effects of lovastatin in mice were abrogated by in vivo miR-133a overexpression or GCH1 knockdown. In rats, multiple cardiovascular risk factors including hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and hyperhomocysteinemia resulted in increased miR-133a vascular expression, reduced GCH1 expression, uncoupled endothelial nitric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e synthase function, and induced endothelial dysfunction, which were prevented by lovastatin.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Statin inhibits aberrant miR-133a expression in the vascular endothelium to prevent endothelial dysfunction by targeting GCH1.

A Specific Glycogen Mobilization Strategy Enables Rapid Awakening of Dormant Cyanobacteria from Chlorosis
<p>Many organisms survive stressful conditions via entry into a dormant state that can be rapidly exited when the stressor disappears; this ability provides a strong selective advantage. In the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803, the exit from nitrogen chlorosis takes less than 48 h and is enabled by the impressive metabolic flexibility of these cyanobacteria, which pass through heterotrophic and mixotrophic phases before reentering photoautotrophic growth. Switching between these states requires delicate coordination of carbohydrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation, CO<sub>2</sub> fixation, and photosynthesis. Here, we investigated the contribution of the different carbon catabolic routes by assessing mutants of these pathways during nitrogen chlorosis and resuscitation. The addition of nitrate to nitrogen-starved cells rapidly starts the awakening program. Metabolism switches from maintenance metabolism, characterized by residual photosynthesis and low cellular ATP levels, to an initial heterotrophic phase, characterized by respiration and an immediate increase in ATP levels. This respiration relies on glycogen breakdown catalyzed by the glycogen phosphorylase GlgP2. In the following transient mixotrophic phase, photosynthesis and CO<sub>2</sub> fixation restart and glycogen is consumed. During the mixotrophic phase, parallel operation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative pentose phosphate cycle and the Entner-Doudoroff pathway is required for resuscitation to proceed; the glycolytic route via the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway has minor importance. Our data suggest that, during resuscitation, only the Entner-Doudoroff and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative pentose phosphate pathways supply the metabolic intermediates necessary for the anabolic reactions required to reconstitute a vegetative cell. Intriguingly, the key enzymes for glycogen catabolism are already expressed during the preceding chlorotic phase, in apparent preparation for rapid resuscitation.</p>

A Central Role for Triacylglycerol in Membrane Lipid Breakdown, Fatty Acid <i>β</i>-Oxidation, and Plant Survival under Extended Darkness
<p>Neutral lipid metabolism is a key aspect of intracellular homeostasis and energy balance and plays a vital role in cell survival under adverse conditions, including nutrient deprivation in yeast and mammals, but the role of triacylglycerol (TAG) metabolism in plant stress response remains largely unknown. By thoroughly characterizing mutants defective in SUGAR-DEPENDENT1 (SDP1) triacylglycerol lipase or PEROXISOMAL ABC TRANSPORTER 1 (PXA1), here we show that TAG is a key intermediate in the mobilization of fatty acids from membrane lipids for peroxisomal β-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation under prolonged dark treatment. Disruption of SDP1 increased TAG accumulation in cytosolic lipid droplets and markedly enhanced plant tolerance to extended darkness. We demonstrate that blocking TAG hydrolysis enhances plant tolerance to dark treatment via two distinct mechanisms. In <i>pxa1</i> mutants, in which free fatty acids accumulated rapidly under extended darkness, SDP1 disruption resulted in a marked decrease in levels of cytotoxic lipid intermediates such as free fatty acids and phosphatidic acid, suggesting a buffer function of TAG accumulation against lipotoxicity under fatty acid overload. In the wild type, in which free fatty acids remained low and unchanged under dark treatment, disruption of SDP1 caused a decrease in reactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxygen</span></strong> species production and hence the level of lipid per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation, indicating a role of TAG in protection against <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ative damage. Overall, our findings reveal a crucial role for TAG metabolism in membrane lipid breakdown, fatty acid turnover, and plant survival under extended darkness.</p>

A Key Role for Apoplastic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in Norway Spruce Phenolic Metabolism
<p>Apoplastic events such as monolignol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation and lignin polymerization are difficult to study in intact trees. To investigate the role of apoplastic hydrogen per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>e (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) in gymnosperm phenolic metabolism, an extracellular lignin-forming cell culture of Norway spruce (<i>Picea abies</i>) was used as a research model. Scavenging of apoplastic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by potassium iodide repressed lignin formation, in line with per<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ases activating monolignols for lignin polymerization. Time-course analyses coupled to candidate substrate-product pair network propagation revealed differential accumulation of low-molecular-weight phenolics, including (glycosylated) oligolignols, (glycosylated) flavonoids, and proanthocyanidins, in lignin-forming and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-scavenging cultures and supported that monolignols are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>atively coupled not only in the cell wall but also in the cytoplasm, where they are coupled to other monolignols and proanthocyanidins. Dilignol glycoconjugates with reduced structures were found in the culture medium, suggesting that cells are able to transport glycosylated dilignols to the apoplast. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that scavenging of apoplastic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> resulted in remodulation of the transcriptome, with reduced carbon flux into the shikimate pathway propagating down to monolignol biosynthesis. Aggregated coexpression network analysis identified candidate enzymes and transcription factors for monolignol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oxid</span></strong>ation and apoplastic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production in addition to potential H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> receptors. The results presented indicate that the redox state of the apoplast has a profound influence on cellular metabolism.</p>

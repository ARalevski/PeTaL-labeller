Global Pulmonary Vascular Remodeling in Pulmonary Hypertension Associated With Heart Failure and Preserved or Reduced Ejection Fraction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>We hypothesized that pulmonary venous hypertension in heart failure (HF) leads to predominate remodeling of pulmonary veins and that the severity of venous remodeling is associated with the severity of pulmonary hypertension (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>) in HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients with HF (n=108; 53 preserved and 55 reduced ejection fraction) with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> (HF-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>; pulmonary artery systolic pressure [PASP] ≥40 mm Hg) were compared to normal controls (n=12) and patients with primary pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD; n=17). In lung specimens from autopsy (control, HF-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>, and 7 PVOD) or surgery (10 PVOD), quantitative histomor<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ometry was performed in all analyzable arteries (n=4949), veins (n=7630), and small indeterminate vessels (IV; n=2168) to define percent medial thickness (arteries) and percent intimal thickness (%IT) (arteries, veins, and IV) relative to external diameter.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The average arterial percent medial thickness (control, 6.9; HF-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>, 11.0; PVOD, 15.0), arterial %IT (control, 4.9; HF-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>, 14.9; PVOD, 31.1), venous %IT (control, 14.0; HF-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>, 24.9; PVOD, 43.9), and IV %IT (control, 10.6; HF-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>, 25.8; PVOD, 50.0) in HF-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> were higher than controls (<i>P</i><0.0001 for all) but lower than PVOD (<i>P</i>≤0.005 for all). PASP (mm Hg) was lower in HF-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> (median, 59 [interquartile range, 50–70]) than in PVOD (median, 91 [interquartile range, 82–103]). PASP correlated with arterial percent medial thickness (<i>r</i>=0.41) and arterial %IT (<i>r</i>=0.35) but more strongly with venous %IT (<i>r</i>=0.49) and IV %IT (<i>r</i>=0.55) (<i>P</i><0.0001 for all). Associations between PASP and venous or IV %IT remained significant after adjusting for arterial percent medial thickness and %IT and did not vary by HF type. In patients with right heart catheterization (30 HF-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>, 14 PVOD), similar associations between the transpulmonary gradient and pulmonary vascular remodeling existed, with numerically stronger associations for venous and IV %IT. Although the PASP was slightly higher in patients with HF-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> with right ventricular dysfunction, pulmonary vascular remodeling was not more severe. Pulmonary vascular remodeling severity was associated with reductions in the diffusing capacity of the lungs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In HF, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> is associated with global pulmonary vascular remodeling, but the severity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> correlates most strongly with venous and small IV intimal thickening, similar to the pattern observed in PVOD.

Metabolic and Proliferative State of Vascular Adventitial Fibroblasts in Pulmonary Hypertension Is Regulated Through a MicroRNA-124/PTBP1 (Polypyrimidine Tract Binding Protein 1)/Pyruvate Kinase Muscle Axis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>An emerging metabolic theory of pulmonary hypertension (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>) suggests that cellular and mitochondrial metabolic dysfunction underlies the pathology of this disease. We and others have previously demonstrated the existence of hyperproliferative, apoptosis-resistant, proinflammatory adventitial fibroblasts from human and bovine hypertensive pulmonary arterial walls (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>-Fibs) that exhibit constitutive reprogramming of glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolism, accompanied by an increased ratio of glucose catabolism through glycolysis versus the tricarboxylic acid cycle. However, the mechanisms responsible for these metabolic alterations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>-Fibs remain unknown. We hypothesized that in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>-Fibs microRNA-124 (miR-124) regulates PTBP1 (polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1) expression to control alternative splicing of pyruvate kinase muscle (PKM) isoforms 1 and 2, resulting in an increased PKM2/PKM1 ratio, which promotes glycolysis and proliferation even in aerobic environments.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Pulmonary adventitial fibroblasts were isolated from calves and humans with severe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>-Fibs) and from normal subjects. PTBP1 gene knockdown was achieved via PTBP1-siRNA; restoration of miR-124 was performed with miR-124 mimic. TEPP-46 and shikonin were used to manipulate PKM2 glycolytic function. Histone deacetylase inhibitors were used to treat cells. Metabolic products were determined by mass spectrometry–based metabolomics analyses, and mitochondrial function was analyzed by confocal microscopy and spectrofluorometry.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We detected an increased PKM2/PKM1 ratio in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>-Fibs compared with normal subjects. PKM2 inhibition reversed the glycolytic status of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>-Fibs, decreased their cell proliferation, and attenuated macro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>age interleukin-1β expression. Furthermore, normalizing the PKM2/PKM1 ratio in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>-Fibs by miR-124 overexpression or PTBP1 knockdown reversed the glycolytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>enotype (decreased the production of glycolytic intermediates and byproducts, ie, lactate), rescued mitochondrial reprogramming, and decreased cell proliferation. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>armacological manipulation of PKM2 activity with TEPP-46 and shikonin or treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors produced similar results.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>, miR-124, through the alternative splicing factor PTBP1, regulates the PKM2/PKM1 ratio, the overall metabolic, proliferative, and inflammatory state of cells. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>enotype can be rescued with interventions at various levels of the metabolic cascade. These findings suggest a more integrated view of vascular cell metabolism, which may open unique therapeutic prospects in targeting the dynamic glycolytic and mitochondrial interactions and between mesenchymal inflammatory cells in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>.</p></sec>

Intracellular pH and its response to CO<sub>2</sub>-driven seawater acidification in symbiotic <i>versus</i> non-symbiotic coral cells
<p>Regulating intracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong><sub>i</sub>) is critical for optimising the metabolic activity of corals, yet the mechanisms involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> regulation and the buffering capacity within coral cells are not well understood. Our study investigated how the presence of symbiotic dinoflagellates affects the response of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong><sub>i</sub> to <i>P</i><sub>CO2</sub>-driven seawater acidification in cells isolated from <i>Pocillopora damicornis</i>. Using the fluorescent dye BCECF-AM, in conjunction with confocal microscopy, we simultaneously characterised the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong><sub>i</sub> response in host coral cells and their dinoflagellate symbionts, in symbiotic and non-symbiotic states under saturating light, with and without the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>otosynthetic inhibitor DCMU. Each treatment was run under control (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> 7.8) and CO<sub>2</sub>-acidified seawater conditions (decreasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> from 7.8 to 6.8). After 105 min of CO<sub>2</sub> addition, by which time the external <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong><sub>e</sub>) had declined to 6.8, the dinoflagellate symbionts had increased their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong><sub>i</sub> by 0.5 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> units above control levels when in the absence of DCMU. In contrast, in both symbiotic and non-symbiotic host coral cells, 15 min of CO<sub>2</sub> addition (0.2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> unit drop in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong><sub>e</sub>) led to cytoplasmic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acidosi</span></strong>s equivalent to 0.3–0.4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> units irrespective of whether DCMU was present. Despite further seawater acidification over the duration of the experiment, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong><sub>i</sub> of non-symbiotic coral cells did not change, though in host cells containing a symbiont cell the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong><sub>i</sub> recovered to control levels when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>otsynthesis was not inhibited. This recovery was negated when cells were incubated with DCMU. Our results reveal that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>otosynthetic activity of the endosymbiont is tightly coupled with the ability of the host cell to recover from cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acidosi</span></strong>s after exposure to high CO<sub>2</sub>/low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>.</p>

Simultaneous high-resolution pH and spectrophotometric recordings of oxygen binding in blood microvolumes
<p>Oxygen equilibrium curves have been widely used to understand oxygen transport in numerous organisms. A major challenge has been to monitor oxygen binding characteristics and concomitant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> changes as they occur <i>in vivo</i>, in limited sample volumes. Here we report a technique allowing highly resolved and simultaneous monitoring of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> and blood pigment saturation in minute blood volumes. We equipped a gas diffusion chamber with a broad-range fibre-optic spectro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>otometer and a micro-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> optode and recorded changes of pigment oxygenation along oxygen partial pressure (<i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> gradients to test the setup. Oxygen binding parameters derived from measurements in only 15 μl of haemolym<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> from the ce<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>alopod <i>Octopus vulgaris</i> showed low instrumental error (0.93%) and good agreement with published data. Broad-range spectra, each resolving 2048 data points, provided detailed insight into the complex absorbance characteristics of diverse blood types. After consideration of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>otobleaching and intrinsic fluorescence, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> optodes yielded accurate recordings and resolved a sigmoidal shift of 0.03 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> units in response to changing <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> from 0 to 21 kPa. Highly resolved continuous recordings along <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> gradients conformed to stepwise measurements at low rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> changes. In this study we showed that a diffusion chamber upgraded with a broad-range spectro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>otometer and an optical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> sensor accurately characterizes oxygen binding with minimal sample consumption and manipulation. We conclude that the modified diffusion chamber is highly suitable for experimental biologists who demand high flexibility, detailed insight into oxygen binding as well as experimental and biological accuracy combined in a single setup.</p>

Activation of Lung p53 by Nutlin-3a Prevents and Reverses Experimental Pulmonary Hypertension
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Induction of cellular senescence through activation of the p53 tumor suppressor protein is a new option for treating proliferative disorders. Nutlins prevent the ubiquitin ligase MDM2 (murine double minute 2), a negative p53 regulator, from interacting with p53.

Nutlin-3a treatment also partially reversed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> in chronically hypoxic or transgenic mice overexpressing the serotonin-transporter in SMCs (SM22-5HTT+ mice). In these mouse models of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>, Nutlin-3a markedly increased senescent p21-stained PA-SMCs; lung p53, p21, and MDM2 protein levels; and p21, Bax, PUMA, BTG2, and MDM2 mRNA levels; but induced only minor changes in control mice without <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>. Marked MDM2 immunostaining was seen in both mouse and human remodeled pulmonary vessels, supporting the use of Nutlins as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>-targeted therapy. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> prevention or reversal by Nutlin-3a required lung p53 stabilization and increased p21 expression, as indicated by the absence of Nutlin-3a effects in hypoxia-exposed p53<sup>−/−</sup> and p21<sup>−/−</sup> mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Nutlin-3a may hold promise as a prosenescence treatment targeting PA-SMCs in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>.</p></sec>

Boron Alleviates Aluminum Toxicity by Promoting Root Alkalization in Transition Zone via Polar Auxin Transport
<p>Boron (B) alleviates aluminum (Al) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong>ity in higher plants; however, the underlying mechanisms behind this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>enomenon remain unknown. Here, we used bromocresol green <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> indicator, noninvasive microtest, and microelectrode ion flux estimation techniques to demonstrate that B promotes root surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> gradients in pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) roots, leading to alkalization in the root transition zone and acidification in the elongation zone, while Al inhibits these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> gradients. B significantly decreased Al accumulation in the transition zone (∼1.0–2.5 mm from the apex) of lateral roots, thereby alleviating Al-induced inhibition of root elongation. Net indole acetic acid (IAA) efflux detected by an IAA-sensitive platinum microelectrode showed that polar auxin transport, which peaked in the root transition zone, was inhibited by Al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong>ity, while it was partially recovered by B. Electro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ysiological experiments using the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) auxin transporter mutants (<i>auxin resistant1-7</i>; <i>pin-formed2</i> [<i>pin2</i>]) and the specific polar auxin transporter inhibitor1-na<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>thyl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>thalamic acid showed that PIN2-based polar auxin transport is involved in root surface alkalization in the transition zone. Our results suggest that B promotes polar auxin transport driven by the auxin efflux transporter PIN2 and leads to the downstream regulation of the plasma membrane-H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, resulting in elevated root surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>, which is essential to decrease Al accumulation in this Al-targeted apical root zone. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the role of exogenous B in alleviation of Al accumulation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong>ity in plants.</p>

Activation of master virulence regulator PhoP in acidic pH requires the <i>Salmonella</i>-specific protein UgtL
<p>Acidic conditions, such as those inside <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>agosomes, stimulate the intracellular pathogen <i>Salmonella enterica</i> to activate virulence genes. The sensor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oQ responds to a mildly acidic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>os<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>orylating, and thereby activating, the virulence regulator <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oP. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oP/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oQ two-component system is conserved in a subset of Gram-negative bacteria. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oQ is thought to be sufficient to activate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oP in mildly acidic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>. However, we found that the <i>Salmonella</i>-specific protein UgtL, which was horizontally acquired by <i>Salmonella</i> before the divergence of <i>S. enterica</i> and <i>Salmonella bongori</i>, was also necessary for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oQ to activate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oP under mildly acidic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> conditions but not for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oQ to activate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oP in response to low Mg<sup>2+</sup> or the antimicrobial peptide C18G. UgtL increased the abundance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>os<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>orylated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oP by stimulating auto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>os<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>orylation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oQ, thereby increasing the amount of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>os<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>odonor for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oP.

These data suggest that when <i>Salmonella</i> experiences mildly acidic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oP activation requires <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oQ to detect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> and UgtL to amplify the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oQ response.

Mammalian pigmentation is regulated by a distinct cAMP-dependent mechanism that controls melanosome pH
<p>The production of melanin increases skin pigmentation and reduces the risk of skin cancer. Melanin production depends on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> of melanosomes, which are more acidic in lighter-skinned than in darker-skinned people. We showed that inhibition of soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) controlled pigmentation by increasing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> of melanosomes both in cells and in vivo. Distinct from the canonical melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R)–dependent cAMP pathway that controls pigmentation by altering gene expression, we found that inhibition of sAC increased pigmentation by increasing the activity of tyrosinase, the rate-limiting enzyme in melanin synthesis, which is more active at basic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>. We demonstrated that the effect of sAC activity on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> and melanin production in human melanocytes depended on the skin color of the donor.

NRT1.1-Related NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> Toxicity Is Associated with a Disturbed Balance between NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> Uptake and Assimilation
<p>A high concentration of ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) as the sole source of nitrogen in the growth medium often is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong> to plants. The nitrate transporter NRT1.1 is involved in mediating the effects of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong>ity; however, the mechanism remains undefined. In this study, wild-type Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> Columbia-0 [Col-0]) and <i>NRT1.1</i> mutants (<i>chl1-1</i> and <i>chl1-5</i>) were grown hydroponically in NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> and (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> media to assess the function of NRT1.1 in NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> stress responses. All the plants grew normally in medium containing mixed nitrogen sources, but Col-0 displayed more chlorosis and lower biomass and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>otosynthesis than the <i>NRT1.1</i> mutants in (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> medium. Grafting experiments between Col-0 and <i>chl1-5</i> further confirmed that NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong>ity is influenced by NRT1.1. In (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> medium, NRT1.1 induced the expression of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> transporters, increasing NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> uptake. Additionally, the activities of glutamine synthetase and glutamate synthetase in roots of Col-0 plants decreased and soluble sugar accumulated significantly, whereas pyruvate kinase-mediated glycolysis was not affected, all of which contributed to NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> accumulation. By contrast, the <i>NRT1.1</i> mutants showed reduced NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> accumulation and enhanced NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> assimilation through glutamine synthetase, glutamate synthetase, and glutamate dehydrogenase. Moreover, the up-regulation of genes involved in ethylene synthesis and senescence in Col-0 plants treated with (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> suggests that ethylene is involved in NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong>ity responses. This study showed that NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong>ity is related to a nitrate-independent signaling function of <i>NRT1.1</i> in Arabidopsis, characterized by enhanced NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> accumulation and altered NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> metabolism, which stimulates ethylene synthesis, leading to plant senescence.</p>

Contribution of Impaired Parasympathetic Activity to Right Ventricular Dysfunction and Pulmonary Vascular Remodeling in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The beneficial effects of parasympathetic stimulation have been reported in left heart failure, but whether it would be beneficial for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) remains to be explored.

De novo design of tunable, pH-driven conformational changes
<p>The ability of naturally occurring proteins to change conformation in response to environmental changes is critical to biological function. Although there have been advances in the de novo design of stable proteins with a single, deep free-energy minimum, the design of conformational switches remains challenging. We present a general strategy to design <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>-responsive protein conformational changes by precisely preorganizing histidine residues in buried hydrogen-bond networks. We design homotrimers and heterodimers that are stable above <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> 6.5 but undergo cooperative, large-scale conformational changes when the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> is lowered and electrostatic and steric repulsion builds up as the network histidine residues become protonated. The transition <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> and cooperativity can be controlled through the number of histidine-containing networks and the strength of the surrounding hydro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>obic interactions. Upon disassembly, the designed proteins disrupt lipid membranes both in vitro and after being endocytosed in mammalian cells. Our results demonstrate that environmentally triggered conformational changes can now be programmed by de novo protein design.</p>

The geologic history of seawater pH
<p>Although <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> is a fundamental property of Earth’s oceans, critical to our understanding of seawater biogeochemistry, its long-timescale geologic history is poorly constrained. We constrain seawater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> through time by accounting for the cycles of the major components of seawater. We infer an increase from early Archean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> values between ~6.5 and 7.0 and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>anerozoic values between ~7.5 and 9.0, which was caused by a gradual decrease in atmos<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>eric <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> in response to solar brightening, alongside a decrease in hydrothermal exchange between seawater and the ocean crust. A lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> in Earth’s early oceans likely affected the kinetics of chemical reactions associated with the origin of life, the energetics of early metabolisms, and climate through the partitioning of CO<sub>2</sub> between the oceans and atmos<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ere.</p>

K<sup>+</sup> Efflux Antiporters 4, 5, and 6 Mediate pH and K<sup>+</sup> Homeostasis in Endomembrane Compartments
<p>KEA4, KEA5, and KEA6 are members of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) K<sup>+</sup> efflux antiporter (KEA) family that share high sequence similarity but whose function remains unknown. Here, we show their gene expression pattern, subcellular localization, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ysiological function in Arabidopsis. <i>KEA4</i>, <i>KEA5</i>, and <i>KEA6</i> had similar tissue expression patterns, and the three KEA proteins localized to the Golgi, the trans-Golgi network, and the prevacuolar compartment/multivesicular bodies, suggesting overlapping roles of these proteins in the endomembrane system. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>enotypic analyses of single, double, and triple mutants confirmed functional redundancy. The triple mutant <i>kea4 kea5 kea6</i> had small rosettes, short seedlings, and was sensitive to low K<sup>+</sup> availability and to the sodicity imposed by high salinity. Also, the <i>kea4 kea5 kea6</i> mutant plants had a reduced luminal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> in the Golgi, trans-Golgi network, prevacuolar compartment, and vacuole, in accordance with the K/H exchange activity of KEA proteins. Genetic analysis indicated that KEA4, KEA5, and KEA6 as well as endosomal Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup>exchanger5 (NHX5) and NHX6 acted coordinately to facilitate endosomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> homeostasis and salt tolerance. Neither cancelling nor overexpressing the vacuolar antiporters <i>NHX1</i> and <i>NHX2</i> in the <i>kea4 kea5 kea6</i> mutant background altered the salt-sensitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>enotype. The NHX1 and NHX2 proteins in the <i>kea4 kea5 kea6</i> mutant background could not suppress the acidity of the endomembrane system but brought the vacuolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> close to wild-type values.

ARSENATE INDUCED CHLOROSIS 1/ TRANSLOCON AT THE OUTER ENVOLOPE MEMBRANE OF CHLOROPLASTS 132 Protects Chloroplasts from Arsenic Toxicity
<p>Arsenic (As) is highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong> to plants and detoxified primarily through complexation with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ytochelatins (PCs) and other thiol compounds. To understand the mechanisms of As <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong>ity and detoxification beyond PCs, we isolated an arsenate-sensitive mutant of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), <i>arsenate induced chlorosis1</i> (<i>aic1</i>), in the background of the PC synthase-defective mutant <i>cadmium-sensitive1-3</i> (<i>cad1-3</i>). Under arsenate stress, <i>aic1 cad1-3</i> showed larger decreases in chloro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>yll content and the number and size of chloroplasts than <i>cad1-3</i> and a severely distorted chloroplast structure. The <i>aic1</i> single mutant also was more sensitive to arsenate than the wild type (Columbia-0). As concentrations in the roots, shoots, and chloroplasts were similar between <i>aic1 cad1-3</i> and <i>cad1-3</i>. Using genome resequencing and complementation, <i>TRANSLOCON AT THE OUTER ENVOLOPE MEMBRANE OF CHLOROPLAST132</i> (<i>TOC132</i>) was identified as the mutant gene, which encodes a translocon protein involved in the import of preproteins from the cytoplasm into the chloroplasts. Proteomic analysis showed that the proteome of <i>aic1 cad1-3</i> chloroplasts was more affected by arsenate stress than that of <i>cad1-3</i>. A number of proteins related to chloroplast ribosomes, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>otosynthesis, compound synthesis, and thioredoxin systems were less abundant in <i>aic1 cad1-3</i> than in <i>cad1-3</i> under arsenate stress. Our results indicate that chloroplasts are a sensitive target of As <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong>ity and that AIC1/Toc132 plays an important role in protecting chloroplasts from As <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong>ity.</p>

Sucrose Transporter Localization and Function in Phloem Unloading in Developing Stems
<p>How sucrose transporters (SUTs) regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>loem unloading in monocot stems is poorly understood and particularly so for species storing high Suc concentrations. To this end, <i>Sorghum bicolor</i> SUTs SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 were characterized by determining their transport properties heterologously expressed in yeast or <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes, and their in planta cellular and subcellular localization. The plasma membrane-localized SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 exhibited a strong selectivity for Suc and high Suc affinities in <i>X. laevis</i> oocytes at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> 5—SbSUT1, 6.3 ± 0.7 m<sc>m,</sc> and SbSUT5, 2.4 ± 0.5 m<sc>m</sc> Suc. The Suc affinity of SbSUT1 was dependent on membrane potential and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>. In contrast, SbSUT5 Suc affinity was independent of membrane potential and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> but supported high transport rates at neutral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>. Suc transport by the tonoplast localized SbSUT4 could not be detected using yeast or <i>X. laevis</i> oocytes. Across internode development, SUTs, other than SbSUT4, were immunolocalized to sieve elements, while for elongating and recently elongated internodes, SUTs also were detected in storage parenchyma cells. We conclude that apoplasmic Suc unloading from de-energized proto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>loem sieve elements in meristematic zones may be mediated by reversal of SbSUT1 and/or by uniporting SWEETs. Storage parenchyma localized SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 may accumulate Suc from the stem apoplasms of elongating and recently elongated internodes, whereas SbSUT4 may function to release Suc from vacuoles. Transiting from an apoplasmic to symplasmic unloading pathway as the stem matures, SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 increasingly function in Suc retrieval into meta<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>loem sieve elements to maintain a high turgor to drive symplasmic unloading by bulk flow.</p>

Combined Experimental and Computational Approaches Reveal Distinct pH Dependence of Pectin Methylesterase Inhibitors
<p>The fine-tuning of the degree of methylesterification of cell wall pectin is a key to regulating cell elongation and ultimately the shape of the plant body. Pectin methylesterification is spatiotemporally controlled by pectin methylesterases (PMEs; 66 members in Arabidopsis [<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>]). The comparably large number of proteinaceous pectin methylesterase inhibitors (PMEIs; 76 members in Arabidopsis) questions the specificity of the PME-PMEI interaction and the functional role of such abundance. To understand the difference, or redundancy, between PMEIs, we used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to predict the behavior of two PMEIs that are coexpressed and have distinct effects on plant development: AtPMEI4 and AtPMEI9. Simulations revealed the structural determinants of the pH dependence for the interaction of these inhibitors with AtPME3, a major PME expressed in roots. Key residues that are likely to play a role in the pH dependence were identified. The predictions obtained from MD simulations were confirmed in vitro, showing that AtPMEI9 is a stronger, less pH-independent inhibitor compared with AtPMEI4. Using pollen tubes as a developmental model, we showed that these biochemical differences have a biological significance. Application of purified proteins at pH ranges in which PMEI inhibition differed between AtPMEI4 and AtPMEI9 had distinct consequences on pollen tube elongation. Therefore, MD simulations have proven to be a powerful tool to predict functional diversity between PMEIs, allowing the discovery of a strategy that may be used by PMEIs to inhibit PMEs in different microenvironmental conditions and paving the way to identify the specific role of PMEI diversity in muro.</p>

Cancer-associated arginine-to-histidine mutations confer a gain in pH sensing to mutant proteins
<p>The intracellular pH (pHi) of most cancers is constitutively higher than that of normal cells and enhances proliferation and cell survival. We found that increased pHi enabled the tumorigenic behaviors caused by somatic arginine-to-histidine mutations, which are frequent in cancer and confer pH sensing not seen with wild-type proteins. Experimentally raising the pHi increased the activity of R776H mutant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR-R776H), thereby increasing proliferation and causing transformation in fibroblasts. An Arg-to-Gly mutation did not confer these effects. Molecular dynamics simulations of EGFR suggested that decreased protonation of His<sup>776</sup> at high pH causes conformational changes in the αC helix that may stabilize the active form of the kinase. An Arg-to-His, but not Arg-to-Lys, mutation in the transcription factor p53 (p53-R273H) decreased its transcriptional activity and attenuated the DNA damage response in fibroblasts and breast cancer cells with high pHi. Lowering pHi attenuated the tumorigenic effects of both EGFR-R776H and p53-R273H. Our data suggest that some somatic mutations may confer a fitness advantage to the higher pHi of cancer cells.</p>

Site-specific phosphorylation of tau inhibits amyloid-β toxicity in Alzheimer’s mice

Elucidation of the Amygdalin Pathway Reveals the Metabolic Basis of Bitter and Sweet Almonds (<i>Prunus dulcis</i>)
<p>Almond (<i>Prunus dulcis</i>) is the principal <i>Prunus</i> species in which the consumed and thus commercially important part of the fruit is the kernel. As a result of continued selection, the vast majority of almonds have a nonbitter kernel. However, in the field, there are trees carrying bitter kernels, which are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong> to humans and, consequently, need to be removed. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong>ity of bitter almonds is caused by the accumulation of the cyanogenic diglucoside amygdalin, which releases <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong> hydrogen cyanide upon hydrolysis. In this study, we identified and characterized the enzymes involved in the amygdalin biosynthetic pathway: PdCYP79D16 and PdCYP71AN24 as the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes catalyzing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>enylalanine-to-mandelonitrile conversion, PdUGT94AF3 as an additional monoglucosyl transferase (UGT) catalyzing prunasin formation, and PdUGT94AF1 and PdUGT94AF2 as the two enzymes catalyzing amygdalin formation from prunasin. This was accomplished by constructing a sequence database containing UGTs known, or predicted, to catalyze a β(1→6)-<i>O</i>-glycosylation reaction and a Basic Local Alignment Search Tool search of the draft version of the almond genome versus these sequences. Functional characterization of candidate genes was achieved by transient expression in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that the expression of <i>PdCYP79D16</i> and <i>PdCYP71AN24</i> was not detectable or only reached minute levels in the sweet almond genotype during fruit development, while it was high and consistent in the bitter genotype. Therefore, the basis for the sweet kernel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>enotype is a lack of expression of the genes encoding the two CYPs catalyzing the first steps in amygdalin biosynthesis.</p>

Retrotransposon Insertion and DNA Methylation Regulate Aluminum Tolerance in European Barley Accessions
<p>Aluminum (Al) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong>ity is a major stress factor limiting crop productivity in acid soil. Although there is great genotypic variation in tolerance to Al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong>ity, the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we report that, in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), the fourth largest cereal crop produced in the world, both retrotransposon insertion and DNA methylation are involved in regulating differential Al tolerance. <i>HvAACT1</i> is a major gene responsible for citrate secretion from the roots for external detoxification of Al. A multiretrotransposon-like (MRL) sequence insertion at least 15.3 kb in length was detected in the upstream genomic region of <i>HvAACT1</i> that displayed promoter activity and significantly enhanced <i>HvAACT1</i> expression, especially in the root tips of Al-tolerant accessions. Furthermore, in a number of accessions with low levels of <i>HvAACT1</i> expression, this MRL insertion was present but highly methylated. Geogra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ical analysis showed that accessions with this MRL insertion are distributed mainly in European areas with acid soils. Two wild barley accessions were found to possess this MRL insertion, but with a high degree of methylation. These results indicate that the MRL insertion and its degree of DNA methylation influence <i>HvAACT1</i> expression and that demethylation of this MRL insertion, which facilitates adaptation to acid soils, occurred following barley domestication. Moreover, our results indicate that barley accessions in East Asia and Europe have developed independent but equivalent strategies to withstand Al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong>ity in acid soils.</p>

Scopoletin 8-Hydroxylase-Mediated Fraxetin Production Is Crucial for Iron Mobilization
<p>Iron (Fe) is an essential mineral nutrient and an important factor for the composition of natural plant communities. Low Fe availability in aerated soils with neutral or alkaline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> has led to the evolution of elaborate mechanisms that extract Fe from the soil solution. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), Fe is acquired by an orchestrated strategy that comprises mobilization, chelation, and reduction of Fe<sup>3+</sup> prior to its uptake. Here, we show that At3g12900, previously annotated as scopoletin 8-hydroxylase (S8H), participates in Fe acquisition by mediating the biosynthesis of fraxetin (7,8-dihydroxy-6-methoxycoumarin), a coumarin derived from the scopoletin pathway. S8H is highly induced in roots of Fe-deficient plants both at the transcript and protein levels. Mutants defective in the expression of <i>S8H</i> showed increased sensitivity to growth on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> 7.0 media supplemented with an immobile source of Fe and reduced secretion of fraxetin. Transgenic lines overexpressing <i>S8H</i> exhibited an opposite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>enotype. Homozygous <i>s8h</i> mutants grown on media with immobilized Fe accumulated significantly more scopolin, the storage form of scopoletin, supporting the designated function of S8H in scopoletin hydroxylation. Fraxetin exhibited Fe-reducing properties in vitro with higher rates being observed at neutral relative to acidic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>. Supplementing the media containing immobile Fe with fraxetin partially rescued the <i>s8h</i> mutants. In natural Arabidopsis accessions differing in their performance on media containing immobilized Fe, the amount of secreted fraxetin was highly correlated with growth and Fe and chloro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>yll content, indicating that fraxetin secretion is a decisive factor for calcicole-calcifuge behavior (i.e. the ability/inability to thrive on alkaline soils) of plants.</p>

Axon degeneration and PGC-1α-mediated protection in a zebrafish model of α-synuclein toxicity
<p>α-synuclein (aSyn) expression is implicated in neurodegenerative processes, including Parkinson’s disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). In animal models of these diseases, axon pathology often precedes cell death, raising the question of whether aSyn has compartment-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong> effects that could require early and/or independent therapeutic intervention. The relevance of axonal pathology to degeneration can only be addressed through longitudinal, <i>in vivo</i> monitoring of different neuronal compartments. With current imaging methods, dopaminergic neurons do not readily lend themselves to such a task in any vertebrate system. We therefore expressed human wild-type aSyn in zebrafish peri<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>eral sensory neurons, which project elaborate superficial axons that can be continuously imaged <i>in vivo</i>. Axonal outgrowth was normal in these neurons but, by 2 days post-fertilization (dpf), many aSyn-expressing axons became dystro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ic, with focal varicosities or diffuse beading. Approximately 20% of aSyn-expressing cells died by 3 dpf. Time-lapse imaging revealed that focal axonal swelling, but not overt fragmentation, usually preceded cell death. Co-expressing aSyn with a mitochondrial reporter revealed deficits in mitochondrial transport and mor<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ology even when axons appeared overtly normal. The axon-protective protein Wallerian degeneration slow (WldS) delayed axon degeneration but not cell death caused by aSyn. By contrast, the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α, which has roles in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and reactive-oxygen-species detoxification, abrogated aSyn <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong>ity in both the axon and the cell body. The rapid onset of axonal pathology in this system, and the relatively moderate degree of cell death, provide a new model for the study of aSyn <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong>ity and protection. Moreover, the accessibility of peri<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>eral sensory axons will allow effects of aSyn to be studied in different neuronal compartments and might have utility in screening for novel disease-modifying compounds.</p>

Structure of the C-terminal guanine nucleotide exchange factor module of Trio in an autoinhibited conformation reveals its oncogenic potential
<p>The C-terminal guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) module of Trio (TrioC) transfers signals from the Gα<sub>q/11</sub> subfamily of heterotrimeric G proteins to the small guanosine tri<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>os<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>atase (GTPase) RhoA, enabling Gα<sub>q/11</sub>-coupled G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) to control downstream events, such as cell motility and gene transcription. This conserved signal transduction axis is crucial for tumor growth in uveal melanoma. Previous studies indicate that the GEF activity of the TrioC module is autoinhibited, with release of autoinhibition upon Gα<sub>q/11</sub> binding. Here, we determined the crystal structure of TrioC in its basal state and found that the pleckstrin homology (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>) domain interacts with the Dbl homology (DH) domain in a manner that occludes the Rho GTPase binding site, thereby suggesting the molecular basis of TrioC autoinhibition. Biochemical and bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ysical assays revealed that disruption of the autoinhibited conformation destabilized and activated the TrioC module in vitro. Last, mutations in the DH-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> interface found in patients with cancer activated TrioC and, in the context of full-length Trio, led to increased abundance of guanosine tri<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>os<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ate–bound RhoA (RhoA·GTP) in human cells. These mutations increase mitogenic signaling through the RhoA axis and, therefore, may represent cancer drivers operating in a Gα<sub>q/11</sub>-independent manner.</p>

Phosphoproteomic analysis of chimeric antigen receptor signaling reveals kinetic and quantitative differences that affect cell function
<p>Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) link an antigen recognition domain to intracellular signaling domains to redirect T cell specificity and function. T cells expressing CARs with CD28/CD3ζ or 4-1BB/CD3ζ signaling domains are effective at treating refractory B cell malignancies but exhibit differences in effector function, clinical efficacy, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong>ity that are assumed to result from the activation of divergent signaling cascades. We analyzed stimulation-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>os<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>orylation events in primary human CD8<sup>+</sup> CD28/CD3ζ and 4-1BB/CD3ζ CAR T cells by mass spectrometry and found that both CAR constructs activated similar signaling intermediates. Stimulation of CD28/CD3ζ CARs activated faster and larger-magnitude changes in protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>os<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>orylation, which correlated with an effector T cell–like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>enotype and function. In contrast, 4-1BB/CD3ζ CAR T cells preferentially expressed T cell memory–associated genes and exhibited sustained antitumor activity against established tumors in vivo. Mutagenesis of the CAR CD28 signaling domain demonstrated that the increased CD28/CD3ζ CAR signal intensity was partly related to constitutive association of Lck with this domain in CAR complexes. Our data show that CAR signaling pathways cannot be predicted solely by the domains used to construct the receptor and that signal strength is a key determinant of T cell fate. Thus, tailoring CAR design based on signal strength may lead to improved clinical efficacy and reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong>ity.</p>

Gene expression kinetics governs stimulus-specific decoration of the <i>Salmonella</i> outer membrane
<p>Lipid A is the innermost component of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecules that occupy the outer leaflet of the outer membrane in Gram-negative bacteria. Lipid A is recognized by the host immune system and targeted by cationic antimicrobial compounds. In <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Ty<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>imurium, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>os<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ates of lipid A are chemically modified by enzymes encoded by targets of the transcriptional regulator PmrA. These modifications increase resistance to the cationic peptide antibiotic polymyxin B by reducing the negative charge of the LPS. We report the mechanism by which <i>Salmonella</i> produces different lipid A profiles when PmrA is activated by low Mg<sup>2+</sup> versus a mildly acidic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>. Low Mg<sup>2+</sup> favored modification of the lipid A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>os<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ates with 4-amino-4-deoxy-<sc>l</sc>-aminoarabinose (<sc>l</sc>-Ara4N) by activating the regulatory protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oP, which initially increased the LPS negative charge by promoting transcription of <i>lpxT</i>, encoding an enzyme that adds an additional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>os<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ate group to lipid A. Later, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oP activated PmrA posttranslationally, resulting in expression of PmrA-activated genes, including those encoding the LpxT inhibitor PmrR and enzymes responsible for the incorporation of <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N. By contrast, a mildly acidic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> favored modification of the lipid A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>os<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ates with a mixture of <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>os<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oethanolamine (pEtN) by simultaneously inducing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oP-activated <i>lpxT</i> and PmrA-activated <i>pmrR</i> genes. Although <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N reduces the LPS negative charge more than does pEtN, modification of lipid A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>os<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ates solely with <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N required a prior transient increase in lipid A negative charge.

Differential abundance of CK1α provides selectivity for pharmacological CK1α activators to target WNT-dependent tumors
<p>Constitutive WNT activity drives the growth of various human tumors, including nearly all colorectal cancers (CRCs). Despite this prominence in cancer, no WNT inhibitor is currently approved for use in the clinic largely due to the small number of druggable signaling components in the WNT pathway and the substantial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong>ity to normal gastrointestinal tissue. We have shown that pyrvinium, which activates casein kinase 1α (CK1α), is a potent inhibitor of WNT signaling. However, its poor bioavailability limited the ability to test this first-in-class WNT inhibitor in vivo. We characterized a novel small-molecule CK1α activator called SSTC3, which has better <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>armacokinetic properties than pyrvinium, and found that it inhibited the growth of CRC xenografts in mice. SSTC3 also attenuated the growth of a patient-derived metastatic CRC xenograft, for which few therapies exist. SSTC3 exhibited minimal gastrointestinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong>ity compared to other classes of WNT inhibitors. Consistent with this observation, we showed that the abundance of the SSTC3 target, CK1α, was decreased in WNT-driven tumors relative to normal gastrointestinal tissue, and knocking down CK1α increased cellular sensitivity to SSTC3. Thus, we propose that distinct CK1α abundance provides an enhanced therapeutic index for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>armacological CK1α activators to target WNT-driven tumors.</p>

PAC, an evolutionarily conserved membrane protein, is a proton-activated chloride channel
<p>Severe local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acidosi</span></strong>s causes tissue damage and pain, and is one of the hallmarks of many diseases including ischemia, cancer, and inflammation. However, the molecular mechanisms of the cellular response to acid are not fully understood.

Overexpression of human PAC in <i>PAC</i> knockout cells generated <i>I</i><sub>Cl,H</sub> with the same characteristics as the endogenous ones.

Poly(ADP-ribose) drives pathologic α-synuclein neurodegeneration in Parkinson’s disease
<p>The pathologic accumulation and aggregation of α-synuclein (α-syn) underlies Parkinson’s disease (PD).

Here, we found that pathologic α-syn activates poly(adenosine 5′-di<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>os<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ate–ribose) (PAR) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), and PAR generation accelerates the formation of pathologic α-syn, resulting in cell death via parthanatos. PARP inhibitors or genetic deletion of PARP-1 prevented pathologic α-syn <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong>ity. In a feed-forward loop, PAR converted pathologic α-syn to a more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong> strain.

Selective targeting of engineered T cells using orthogonal IL-2 cytokine-receptor complexes
<p>Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a cytokine required for effector T cell expansion, survival, and function, especially for engineered T cells in adoptive cell immunotherapy, but its pleiotropy leads to simultaneous stimulation and suppression of immune responses as well as systemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong>ity, limiting its therapeutic use.

Phase separation of a yeast prion protein promotes cellular fitness
<p>Despite the important role of prion domains in neurodegenerative disease, their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ysiological function has remained enigmatic. Previous work with yeast prions has defined prion domains as sequences that form self-propagating aggregates. Here, we uncovered an unexpected function of the canonical yeast prion protein Sup35.

Structural basis of membrane disruption and cellular toxicity by α-synuclein oligomers

Escaping the traps of your own hunters
<p>During the first days of an infection, protection is almost entirely provided by innate immunity, a large part of which consists of one type of immune cell—the neutro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>il. Neutro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ils form the largest group of immune cells in the body [humans produce ∼10<sup>11</sup> neutro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ils daily (<i>1</i>)], and they carry out a number of defense mechanisms, including pathogen ingestion (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>agocytosis) and the production of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong> chemicals that kill intruders directly. They can also cause severe hyperinflammatory diseases, such as lethal influenza-associated lung destruction (<i>2</i>, <i>3</i>). In 2004, another neutro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>il defense system was discovered. In a final act of protection, dying neutro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ils mix their nuclear DNA with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong> components from their cytosolic granules and release it explosively to form a neutro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>il extracellular trap (NET) in the surrounding environment. This process is called NETosis (<i>4</i>). In addition to carrying genetic information, DNA is a very long (each nucleus contains ∼2 m of DNA) and sticky polyanionic molecule. Hence, DNA binds to surfaces such as bacterial cell walls by means of charge interactions (<i>5</i>). Through this immobilization on NETs, pathogens are brought into direct contact with cyto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong> molecules on the NET-DNA complex. However, free extracellular DNA is also a potent trigger of severe side effects in the body, for example, by forming immune complexes with anti nuclear antibodies (antibodies that can bind to DNA) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (<i>6</i>) or by directly clogging blood vessels and establishing vessel-blocking thrombi (<i>7</i>). Consequently, finding mechanisms that mediate the degradation of NETs has been a matter of intense research. On page 1202 of this issue, Jiménez-Alcéázar <i>et al.</i> (<i>8</i>) describe two deoxyribonucleases (DNases) [DNase1 and DNase1-like 3 (DNase1L3)], which cleave DNA and together degrade freshly formed NETs. By doing so, they inhibit otherwise lethal immunopathologies such as thrombus-mediated organ failure.</p>

The genomic landscape of rapid repeated evolutionary adaptation to toxic pollution in wild fish
<p>Atlantic killifish populations have rapidly adapted to normally lethal levels of pollution in four urban estuaries. Through analysis of 384 whole killifish genome sequences and comparative transcriptomics in four pairs of sensitive and tolerant populations, we identify the aryl hydrocarbon receptor–based signaling pathway as a shared target of selection. This suggests evolutionary constraint on adaptive solutions to complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong>ant mixtures at each site. However, distinct molecular variants apparently contribute to adaptive pathway modification among tolerant populations. Selection also targets other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong>ity-mediating genes and genes of connected signaling pathways; this indicates complex tolerance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>enotypes and potentially compensatory adaptations. Molecular changes are consistent with selection on standing genetic variation. In killifish, high nucleotide diversity has likely been a crucial substrate for selective sweeps to propel rapid adaptation.</p>

Modulating Protein Stability to Switch Toxic Protein Function On and Off in Living Cells
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong> proteins are prime targets for molecular farming (the generation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>armacologically active or biotechnologically usable compounds in plants) and are also efficient tools for targeted cell ablation in genetics, developmental biology, and biotechnology. However, achieving conditional activity of cytotoxins and maintaining the toxin-expressing plants as stably transformed lines remain challenging. Here, we produce a switchable version of the highly cyto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong> bacterial RNase barnase by fusing the protein to a portable protein degradation cassette, the low-temperature degron cassette. This method allows conditional genetics based on conditional protein degradation via the N-end rule or N-degron pathway and has been used to vice versa accumulate and/or deplete a diverse variety of highly active, unstable or stable target proteins in different living multicellular organisms and cell systems. Moreover, we expressed the barnase fusion under control of the trichome-specific <i>TRIPTYCHON</i> promoter. This enabled efficient temperature-dependent control of protein accumulation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaf hairs (trichomes). By tuning the levels of the protein, we were able to control the fate of trichomes in vivo. The on-demand formation of trichomes through manipulating the balance between stabilization and destabilization of barnase provides proof of concept for a robust and powerful tool for conditional switchable cell arrest. We present this tool as a potential strategy for the manufacture and accumulation of cyto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong> proteins and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong> high-value products in plants or for conditional genetic cell ablation.</p>

Cation Specificity of Vacuolar NHX-Type Cation/H<sup>+</sup> Antiporters
<p>Cation/H<sup>+</sup> (NHX-type) antiporters are important regulators of intracellular ion homeostasis and are critical for cell expansion and plant stress acclimation. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), four distinct NHX isoforms, named AtNHX1 to AtNHX4, locate to the tonoplast. To determine the concerted roles of all tonoplast NHXs on vacuolar ion and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> homeostasis, we examined multiple knockout mutants lacking all but one of the four vacuolar isoforms and quadruple knockout plants lacking any vacuolar NHX activity. The <i>nhx</i> triple and quadruple knockouts displayed reduced growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>enotypes. Exposure to sodium chloride improved growth while potassium chloride was deleterious to some knockouts. Kinetic analysis of K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> transport indicated that AtNHX1 and AtNHX2 are the main contributors to both vacuolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> and K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> uptake, while AtNHX3 and AtNHX4 differ in Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> selectivity. The lack of any vacuolar NHX activity resulted in no K<sup>+</sup> uptake, highly acidic vacuoles, and reduced but not abolished vacuolar Na<sup>+</sup> uptake. Additional K<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange activity assays in the quadruple knockout indicated Na<sup>+</sup> uptake that was not H<sup>+</sup> coupled, suggesting the existence of an alternative, cation/H<sup>+</sup>-independent, Na<sup>+</sup> conductive pathway in vacuoles. These results highlight the importance of NHX-type cation/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters in the maintenance of cellular cation homeostasis and in growth and development.</p>

Identification of a Hexenal Reductase That Modulates the Composition of Green Leaf Volatiles
<p>Green leaf volatiles (GLVs), including six-carbon (C6) aldehydes, alcohols, and esters, are formed when plant tissues are damaged. GLVs play roles in direct plant defense at wound sites, indirect plant defense via the attraction of herbivore predators, and plant-plant communication. GLV components provoke distinctive responses in their target recipients; therefore, the control of GLV composition is important for plants to appropriately manage stress responses. The reduction of C6-aldehydes into C6-alcohols is a key step in the control of GLV composition and also is important to avoid a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong> buildup of C6-aldehydes. However, the molecular mechanisms behind C6-aldehyde reduction remain poorly understood. In this study, we purified an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) NAD<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>-dependent cinnamaldehyde and hexenal reductase encoded by At4g37980, named here CINNAMALDEHYDE AND HEXENAL REDUCTASE (CHR). <i>CHR</i> T-DNA knockout mutant plants displayed a normal growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>enotype; however, we observed significant suppression of C6-alcohol production following partial mechanical wounding or herbivore infestation. Our data also showed that the parasitic wasp <i>Cotesia vestalis</i> was more attracted to GLVs emitted from herbivore-infested wild-type plants compared with GLVs emitted from <i>chr</i> plants, which corresponded with reduced C6-alcohol levels in the mutant. Moreover, <i>chr</i> plants were more susceptible to exogenous high-dose exposure to (<i>Z</i>)-3-hexenal, as indicated by their markedly lowered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>otosystem II activity. Our study shows that reductases play significant roles in changing GLV composition and, thus, are important in avoiding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong>ity from volatile carbonyls and in the attraction of herbivore predators.</p>

Boron-Dependent Translational Suppression of the Borate Exporter <i>BOR1</i> Contributes to the Avoidance of Boron Toxicity
<p>Boron (B) is an essential element for plants; however, as high B concentrations are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong>, B transport must be tightly regulated. BOR1 is a borate exporter in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) that facilitates B translocation into shoots under B deficiency conditions. When the B supply is sufficient, <i>BOR1</i> expression is down-regulated by selective degradation of BOR1 protein, while additional <i>BOR1</i> regulatory mechanisms are proposed to exist. In this study, we identified a novel B-dependent <i>BOR1</i> translational suppression mechanism. In vivo and in vitro reporter assays demonstrated that <i>BOR1</i> translation was reduced in a B-dependent manner and that the 5′-untranslated region was both necessary and sufficient for this process. Mutational analysis revealed that multiple upstream open reading frames in the 5′-untranslated region were required for <i>BOR1</i> translational suppression, and this process depended on the efficiency of translational reinitiation at the <i>BOR1</i> open reading frame after translation of the upstream open reading frames. To understand the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ysiological significance of <i>BOR1</i> regulation, we characterized transgenic plants defective in either one or both of the <i>BOR1</i> regulation mechanisms. <i>BOR1</i> translational suppression was induced at higher B concentrations than those triggering BOR1 degradation. Plants lacking both regulation mechanisms exhibited more severe shoot growth reduction under high-B conditions than did plants lacking BOR1 degradation alone, thus demonstrating the importance of <i>BOR1</i> translational suppression. This study demonstrates that two mechanisms of posttranscriptional <i>BOR1</i> regulation, each induced under different B concentrations, contribute to the avoidance of B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong>ity in plants.</p>

Altered Expression of a Malate-Permeable Anion Channel, OsALMT4, Disrupts Mineral Nutrition
<p>Aluminum-activated malate transporters (ALMTs) form a family of anion channels in plants, but little is known about most of its members. This study examined the function of <i>OsALMT4</i> from rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). We show that <i>OsALMT4</i> is expressed in roots and shoots and that the OsALMT4 protein localizes to the plasma membrane. Transgenic rice lines overexpressing (OX) <i>OsALMT4</i> released malate from the roots constitutively and had 2-fold higher malate concentrations in the xylem sap than nulls, indicating greater concentrations of malate in the apoplast. OX lines developed brown necrotic spots on the leaves that did not appear on nulls. These symptoms were not associated with altered concentrations of any mineral element in the leaves, although the OX lines had higher concentrations of Mn and B in their grain compared with nulls. While total leaf Mn concentrations were not different between the OX and null lines, Mn concentrations in the apoplast were greater in the OX plants. The OX lines also displayed increased expression of Mn transporters and were more sensitive to Mn <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong>ity than null plants. We showed that the growth of wild-type rice was unaffected by 100 µ<sc>m</sc> Mn in hydroponics but, when combined with 1 m<sc>m</sc> malate, this concentration inhibited growth. We conclude that increasing <i>OsALMT4</i> expression affected malate efflux and compartmentation within the tissues, which increased Mn concentrations in the apoplast of leaves and induced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong>ity symptoms. This study reveals new links between malate transport and mineral nutrition.</p>

A Dioxygenase Catalyzes Steroid 16α-Hydroxylation in Steroidal Glycoalkaloid Biosynthesis
<p>Steroidal glycoalkaloids (SGAs) are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong> specialized metabolites that are found in the Solanaceae. Potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>) contains the SGAs α-solanine and α-chaconine, while tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) contains α-tomatine, all of which are biosynthesized from cholesterol. However, although two cytochrome P450 monooxygenases that catalyze the 22- and 26-hydroxylation of cholesterol have been identified, the 16-hydroxylase remains unknown. Feeding with deuterium-labeled cholesterol indicated that the 16α- and 16β-hydrogen atoms of cholesterol were eliminated to form α-solanine and α-chaconine in potato, while only the 16α-hydrogen atom was eliminated in α-tomatine biosynthesis, suggesting that a single oxidation at C-16 takes place during tomato SGA biosynthesis while a two-step oxidation occurs in potato. Here, we show that a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase, designated as 16DOX, is involved in SGA biosynthesis. We found that the transcript of potato <i>16DOX</i> (<i>St16DOX</i>) was expressed at high levels in the tuber sprouts, where large amounts of SGAs are accumulated. Biochemical analysis of the recombinant St16DOX protein revealed that St16DOX catalyzes the 16α-hydroxylation of hydroxycholesterols and that (22<i>S</i>)-22,26-dihydroxycholesterol was the best substrate among the nine compounds tested. <i>St16DOX</i>-silenced potato plants contained significantly lower levels of SGAs, and a detailed metabolite analysis revealed that they accumulated the glycosides of (22<i>S</i>)-22,26-dihydroxycholesterol. Analysis of the tomato <i>16DOX</i> (<i>Sl16DOX</i>) gene gave essentially the same results. These findings clearly indicate that 16DOX is a steroid 16α-hydroxylase that functions in the SGA biosynthetic pathway. Furthermore, <i>St16DOX</i> silencing did not affect potato tuber yield, indicating that <i>16DOX</i> may be a suitable target for controlling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong> SGA levels in potato.</p>

Enhanced zinc (Zn) uptake closely mimicked Fe deficiency by leading to low chloro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>yll but high ferric-chelate reductase activity and coumarin release. These responses were not caused by Zn-inhibited Fe uptake via IRON-REGULATED TRANSPORTER (IRT1). Instead, Zn simulated the transcriptional response of typical Fe-regulated genes, indicating that Zn affects Fe homeostasis at the level of Fe sensing. Excess supplies of cobalt and nickel altered root traits in a different way from Fe deficiency, inducing only transient Fe deficiency responses, which were characterized by a lack of induction of the ethylene pathway. Cadmium showed a rather inconsistent influence on Fe deficiency responses at multiple levels. By contrast, manganese evoked weak Fe deficiency responses in wild-type plants but strongly exacerbated chlorosis in <i>irt1</i> plants, indicating that manganese antagonized Fe mainly at the level of transport. These results show that the investigated heavy metals modulate Fe deficiency responses at different hierarchic and regulatory levels and that the interaction of metals with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ysiological and mor<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ological Fe deficiency responses is uncoupled. Thus, this study not only em<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>asizes the importance of assessing heavy metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong>ities at multiple levels but also provides a new perspective on how Fe deficiency contributes to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong> action of individual heavy metals.</p>

The <i>Synechocystis</i> Manganese Exporter Mnx Is Essential for Manganese Homeostasis in Cyanobacteria
<p>The essential micronutrient manganese (Mn) functions as redox-active cofactor in active sites of enzymes and, thus, is involved in various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ysiological reactions. Moreover, in oxygenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>otosynthetic organisms, Mn is of special importance, since it is central to the oxygen-evolving complex in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>otosystem II. Although Mn is an essential micronutrient, increased amounts are detrimental to the organism; thus, only a small window exists for beneficial concentrations. Accordingly, Mn homeostasis must be carefully maintained. In contrast to the well-studied uptake mechanisms in cyanobacteria, it is largely unknown how Mn is distributed to the different compartments inside the cell. We identified a protein with so far unknown function as a hypothetical Mn transporter in the cyanobacterial model strain <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 and named this protein Mnx for Mn exporter. The knockout mutant Δ<i>mnx</i> showed increased sensitivity toward externally supplied Mn and Mn <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong>ity symptoms, which could be linked to intracellular Mn accumulation. <sup>54</sup>Mn chase experiments demonstrated that the mutant was not able to release Mn from the internal pool. Microscopic analysis of a Mnx::yellow fluorescent protein fusion showed that the protein resides in the thylakoid membrane. Heterologous expression of <i>mnx</i> suppressed the Mn-sensitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>enotype of the <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> mutant Δ<i>pmr1</i>. Our results indicate that Mnx functions as a thylakoid Mn transporter and is a key player in maintaining Mn homeostasis in <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803. We propose that Mn export from the cytoplasm into the thylakoid lumen is crucial to prevent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong> cytoplasmic Mn accumulation and to ensure Mn provision to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>otosystem II.</p>

Molecular and functional characterization of hemocyanin of the giant African millipede, <i>Archispirostreptus gigas</i>
<p>In contrast to other terrestrial arthropods, where gaseous O<sub>2</sub> that fuels aerobic metabolism diffuses to the tissues in tracheal tubes, and most other metazoans, where O<sub>2</sub> is transported to tissues by circulating respiratory proteins, the myriapods (millipedes and centipedes) strikingly have tracheal systems as well as circulating hemocyanin (Hc). In order to elucidate the evolutionary origin and biological significance of millipede Hc, we report the molecular structure (subunit composition and amino acid sequence) of multimeric (36-mer) Hc from the forest floor-dwelling giant African millipede <i>Archispirostreptus gigas</i> and its allosteric oxygen-binding properties under various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ysico-chemical conditions. <i>Archispirostreptus gigas</i> Hc consists of only a single subunit type with differential glycosylation. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ylogenic analysis revealed that millipede Hc is a sister group to centipede HcA, which supports an early divergence of distinct Hc subunits in myriapods and an ancient origin of multimeric Hcs. <i>Archispirostreptus gigas</i> Hc binds O<sub>2</sub> with a high affinity and shows a strong Bohr effect. O<sub>2</sub> binding is, moreover, modulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, which increase the O<sub>2</sub> affinity of the Hc in the tense (T; deoxygenated) as well as the relaxed (R; oxygenated) states, and by (<sc>l</sc>)-lactate, which modulates Hc–O<sub>2</sub> affinity by changing the allosteric equilibrium constant, <i>L</i>. Cooperativity in O<sub>2</sub> binding at half O<sub>2</sub> saturation (<i>n</i><sub>50</sub>) is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> dependent and maximal at ~<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> 7.4, and the number of interacting O<sub>2</sub>-binding sites (<i>q</i>) is markedly increased by binding Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The data are discussed in the light of the mutually supplementary roles of Hc and the tracheal system for tissue O<sub>2</sub> supply.</p>

The effect of a single early high-dose vitamin D supplement on fracture union in patients with hypovitaminosis D
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To evaluate the effect of a single early high-dose vitamin D   supplement on fracture union in patients with hypovitaminosis D   and a long bone fracture.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between July 2011 and August 2013, 113 adults with a long bone   fracture were enrolled in a prospective randomised double-blind   placebo-controlled trial. Their serum vitamin D levels were measured   and a total of 100 patients were found to be vitamin D deficient   (< 20 ng/ml) or insufficient (< 30 ng/mL). These were then   randomised to receive a single dose of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> orally   (100 000 IU) within two weeks of injury (treatment group, n = 50)   or a placebo (control group, n = 50). We recorded patient demogra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ics,   fracture location and treatment, vitamin D level, time to fracture   union and complications, including vitamin D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong>ity.</p><p>Outcomes included union, nonunion or complication requiring an   early, unplanned secondary procedure. Patients without an outcome   at 15 months and no scheduled follow-up were considered lost to   follow-up. The <i>t</i>-test and cross tabulations verified   the adequacy of randomisation.

Both treatment   and control groups had similar demogra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ics and injury characteristics.   The initial median vitamin D levels were 16 ng/mL (interquartile   range 5 to 28) in both groups (p = 0.885). A total of 14 patients   were lost to follow-up (seven from each group), two had fixation   failure (one in each group) and one control group patient developed   an infection.

A Universal Stress Protein Involved in Oxidative Stress Is a Phosphorylation Target for Protein Kinase CIPK6
<p>Calcineurin B-like interacting protein kinases (CIPKs) decode calcium signals upon interaction with the calcium sensors calcineurin B like proteins into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>os<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>orylation events that result into adaptation to environmental stresses. Few <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>os<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>orylation targets of CIPKs are known and therefore the molecular mechanisms underlying their downstream output responses are not fully understood. Tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) Cipk6 regulates immune and susceptible Programmed cell death in immunity transforming Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals into reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling. To investigate SlCipk6-induced molecular mechanisms and identify putative substrates, a yeast two-hybrid approach was carried on and a protein was identified that contained a Universal stress protein (Usp) domain present in bacteria, protozoa and plants, which we named “SlRd2”. SlRd2 was an ATP-binding protein that formed homodimers in planta. SlCipk6 and SlRd2 interacted using coimmunoprecipitation and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaves and the complex localized in the cytosol. SlCipk6 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>os<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>orylated SlRd2 in vitro, thus defining, to our knowledge, a novel target for CIPKs. Heterologous SlRd2 overexpression in yeast conferred resistance to highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">toxic</span></strong> LiCl, whereas SlRd2 expression in <i>Escherichia coli</i> <i>UspA</i> mutant restored bacterial viability in response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment. Finally, transient expression of SlCipk6 in transgenic <i>N</i>. <i>benthamiana</i> SlRd2 overexpressors resulted in reduced ROS accumulation as compared to wild-type plants. Taken together, our results establish that SlRd2, a tomato UspA, is, to our knowledge, a novel interactor and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>os<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>orylation target of a member of the CIPK family, SlCipk6, and functionally regulates SlCipk6-mediated ROS generation.</p>

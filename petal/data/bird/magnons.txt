Probing magnetism in 2D materials at the nanoscale with single-spin microscopy
<p>The discovery of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ism in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) crystals has generated widespread interest. Making further progress in this area requires quantitative knowledge of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic properties of vdW <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>s at the nanoscale. We used scanning single-spin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ometry based on diamond nitrogen-vacancy centers to image the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ization, localized defects, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic domains of atomically thin crystals of the vdW <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong> chromium(III) iodide (CrI<sub>3</sub>). We determined the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ization of CrI<sub>3</sub> monolayers to be ≈16 Bohr <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ons per square nanometer, with comparable values in samples with odd numbers of layers; however, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ization vanishes when the number of layers is even. We also found that structural modifications can induce switching between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ic interlayer ordering. These results demonstrate the benefit of using single-spin scanning <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ometry to study the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ism of 2D vdW <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>s.</p>

All-oxide–based synthetic antiferromagnets exhibiting layer-resolved magnetization reversal
<p>Synthesizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>s with correlated oxides has been challenging, owing partly to the markedly degraded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ism of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic layer at nanoscale thicknesses. Here we report on the engineering of an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ic interlayer exchange coupling (AF-IEC) between ultrathin but <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic La<sub>2/3</sub>Ca<sub>1/3</sub>MnO<sub>3</sub> layers across an insulating CaRu<sub>1/2</sub>Ti<sub>1/2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> spacer. The layer-resolved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic switching leads to sharp steplike hysteresis loops with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ization plateaus depending on the repetition number of the stacking bilayers. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ization configurations can be switched at moderate fields of hundreds of oersted. Moreover, the AF-IEC can also be realized with an alternative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic layer of La<sub>2/3</sub>Sr<sub>1/3</sub>MnO<sub>3</sub> that possesses a Curie temperature near room temperature. The findings will add functionalities to devices with correlated-oxide interfaces.</p>

Giant tunneling magnetoresistance in spin-filter van der Waals heterostructures
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic multilayer devices that exploit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>oresistance are the backbone of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic sensing and data storage technologies. Here, we report multiple-spin-filter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic tunnel junctions (sf-MTJs) based on van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures in which atomically thin chromium triiodide (CrI<sub>3</sub>) acts as a spin-filter tunnel barrier sandwiched between graphene contacts. We demonstrate tunneling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>oresistance that is drastically enhanced with increasing CrI<sub>3</sub> layer thickness, reaching a record 19,000% for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic multilayer structures using four-layer sf-MTJs at low temperatures. Using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic circular dichroism measurements, we attribute these effects to the intrinsic layer-by-layer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ic ordering of the atomically thin CrI<sub>3</sub>.

Electrical generation and detection of spin waves in a quantum Hall ferromagnet
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin wav</span></strong>es are collective excitations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic systems. An attractive setting for studying long-lived spin-wave physics is the quantum Hall (QH) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>, which forms spontaneously in clean two-dimensional electron systems at low temperature and in a perpendicular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field. We used out-of-equilibrium occupation of QH edge channels in graphene to excite and detect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin wav</span></strong>es in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ically ordered QH states. Our experiments provide direct evidence for long-distance spin-wave propagation through different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic phases in the <i>N</i> = 0 Landau level, as well as across the insulating canted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ic phase.

Saturn’s magnetic field revealed by the Cassini Grand Finale
<p>During 2017, the Cassini fluxgate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ometer made in situ measurements of Saturn’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field at distances ~2550 ± 1290 kilometers above the 1-bar surface during 22 highly inclined Grand Finale orbits. These observations refine the extreme axisymmetry of Saturn’s internal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field and show displacement of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic equator northward from the planet’s physical equator. Persistent small-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic structures, corresponding to high-degree (>3) axisymmetric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic moments, were observed. This suggests secondary shallow dynamo action in the semiconducting region of Saturn’s interior. Some high-degree <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic moments could arise from strong high-latitude concentrations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic flux within the planet’s deep dynamo. A strong field-aligned current (FAC) system is located between Saturn and the inner edge of its D-ring, with strength comparable to the high-latitude auroral FACs.</p>

Probing magnetism in 2D van der Waals crystalline insulators via electron tunneling
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic insulators are a key resource for next-generation spintronic and topological devices. The family of layered metal halides promises varied <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic states, including ultrathin insulating multiferroics, spin liquids, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>s, but device-oriented characterization methods are needed to unlock their potential. Here, we report tunneling through the layered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic insulator CrI<sub>3</sub> as a function of temperature and applied <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field. We electrically detect the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic ground state and interlayer coupling and observe a field-induced meta<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic transition. The meta<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic transition results in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>oresistances of 95, 300, and 550% for bilayer, trilayer, and tetralayer CrI<sub>3</sub> barriers, respectively. We further measure inelastic tunneling spectra for our junctions, unveiling a rich spectrum consistent with collective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic excitations (magnons) in CrI<sub>3</sub>.</p>

Chirally coupled nanomagnets
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ically coupled nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>s have multiple applications in nonvolatile memories, logic gates, and sensors. The most effective couplings have been found to occur between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic layers in a vertical stack. We achieved strong coupling of laterally adjacent nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>s using the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. This coupling is mediated by chiral domain walls between out-of-plane and in-plane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic regions and dominates the behavior of nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>s below a critical size. We used this concept to realize lateral exchange bias, field-free current-induced switching between multistate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic configurations as well as synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>s, skyrmions, and artificial spin ices covering a broad range of length scales and topologies.

Real-space and real-time observation of a plasmon-induced chemical reaction of a single molecule
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plasmon</span></strong>-induced chemical reactions of molecules adsorbed on metal nanostructures are attracting increased attention for photocatalytic reactions. However, the mechanism remains controversial because of the difficulty of direct observation of the chemical reactions in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plasmon</span></strong>ic field, which is strongly localized near the metal surface. We used a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to achieve real-space and real-time observation of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plasmon</span></strong>-induced chemical reaction at the single-molecule level. A single dimethyl disulfide molecule on silver and copper surfaces was dissociated by the optically excited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plasmon</span></strong> at the STM junction. The STM study combined with theoretical calculations shows that this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plasmon</span></strong>-induced chemical reaction occurred by a direct intramolecular excitation mechanism.</p>

Quantized chiral edge conduction on domain walls of a magnetic topological insulator
<p>Electronic ordering in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic and dielectric materials forms domains with different signs of order parameters. The control of configuration and motion of the domain walls (DWs) enables nonvolatile responses against minute external fields. Here, we realize chiral edge states (CESs) on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic DWs of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic topological insulator. We design and fabricate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic domains in the quantum anomalous Hall state with the tip of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic force microscope and prove the existence of the chiral one-dimensional edge conduction along the prescribed DWs through transport measurements. The proof-of-concept devices based on reconfigurable CESs and Landauer-Buttiker formalism are realized for multiple-domain configurations with well-defined DW channels. Our results may lead to the realization of low-power-consumption spintronic devices.</p>

Structure, force balance, and topology of Earth’s magnetopause
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>opause deflects the solar wind plasma and confines Earth’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field. We combine measurements made by the four spacecraft of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ospheric Multiscale mission to demonstrate how the plasma and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic forces at the boundary affect the interaction between the shocked solar wind and Earth’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>osphere.

Small pockets of low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field strength, small radius of curvature, and high electric current mark the electron diffusion region.

Humans may sense Earth's magnetic field
<p>A study published this week offers some of the best evidence yet that humans, like many other creatures, can sense Earth's <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field. But it doesn't settle other questions that have swirled around this contentious idea for decades: If we do have a subconscious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic sense, do we ever use it? And does it arise from an iron mineral found in our brains, as the authors believe? The experiment recorded brain activity from electrodes on the scalp to search 34 participants for some response to changes in a highly controlled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field equal in strength to Earth's. It revealed a marked change in brain waves of a certain frequency.

Photonic crystals for nano-light in moiré graphene superlattices
<p>Graphene is an atomically thin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plasmon</span></strong>ic medium that supports highly confined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plasmon</span></strong> polaritons, or nano-light, with very low loss. Electronic properties of graphene can be drastically altered when it is laid upon another graphene layer, resulting in a moiré superlattice. The relative twist angle between the two layers is a key tuning parameter of the interlayer coupling in thus-obtained twisted bilayer graphene (TBG). We studied the propagation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plasmon</span></strong> polaritons in TBG by infrared nano-imaging. We discovered that the atomic reconstruction occurring at small twist angles transforms the TBG into a natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plasmon</span></strong> photonic crystal for propagating nano-light. This discovery points to a pathway for controlling nano-light by exploiting quantum properties of graphene and other atomically layered van der Waals materials, eliminating the need for arduous top-down nanofabrication.</p>

Quantifying hot carrier and thermal contributions in plasmonic photocatalysis
<p>Photocatalysis based on optically active, “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plasmon</span></strong>ic” metal nanoparticles has emerged as a promising approach to facilitate light-driven chemical conversions under far milder conditions than thermal catalysis. However, an understanding of the relation between thermal and electronic excitations has been lacking. We report the substantial light-induced reduction of the thermal activation barrier for ammonia decomposition on a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plasmon</span></strong>ic photocatalyst. We introduce the concept of a light-dependent activation barrier to account for the effect of light illumination on electronic and thermal excitations in a single unified picture. This framework provides insight into the specific role of hot carriers in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plasmon</span></strong>-mediated photochemistry, which is critically important for designing energy-efficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plasmon</span></strong>ic photocatalysts.</p>

Phase transitions in a programmable quantum spin glass simulator
<p>Understanding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic phases in quantum mechanical systems is one of the essential goals in condensed matter physics, and the advent of prototype quantum simulation hardware has provided new tools for experimentally probing such systems.

The ability to control and read out the state of individual spins provides direct access to several order parameters, which we used to determine the lattice’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic phases as well as critical disorder and one of its universal exponents. By tuning the degree of disorder and effective transverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field, we observed phase transitions between a para<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic, an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ic, and a spin-glass phase.</p>

Separation of enantiomers by their enantiospecific interaction with achiral magnetic substrates
<p>It is commonly assumed that recognition and discrimination of chirality, both in nature and in artificial systems, depend solely on spatial effects. However, recent studies have suggested that charge redistribution in chiral molecules manifests an enantiospecific preference in electron spin orientation. We therefore reasoned that the induced spin polarization may affect enantiorecognition through exchange interactions. Here we show experimentally that the interaction of chiral molecules with a perpendicularly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ized substrate is enantiospecific. Thus, one enantiomer adsorbs preferentially when the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic dipole is pointing up, whereas the other adsorbs faster for the opposite alignment of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ization. The interaction is not controlled by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field per se, but rather by the electron spin orientations, and opens prospects for a distinct approach to enantiomeric separations.</p>

Probing the ultimate plasmon confinement limits with a van der Waals heterostructure
<p>The ability to confine light into tiny spatial dimensions is important for applications such as microscopy, sensing, and nanoscale lasers. Although <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plasmon</span></strong>s offer an appealing avenue to confine light, Landau damping in metals imposes a trade-off between optical field confinement and losses. We show that a graphene-insulator-metal heterostructure can overcome that trade-off, and demonstrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plasmon</span></strong> confinement down to the ultimate limit of the length scale of one atom. This is achieved through far-field excitation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plasmon</span></strong> modes squeezed into an atomically thin hexagonal boron nitride dielectric spacer between graphene and metal rods. A theoretical model that takes into account the nonlocal optical response of both graphene and metal is used to describe the results. These ultraconfined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plasmon</span></strong>ic modes, addressed with far-field light excitation, enable a route to new regimes of ultrastrong light-matter interactions.</p>

Chiromagnetic nanoparticles and gels
<p>Chiral inorganic nanostructures have high circular dichroism, but real-time control of their optical activity has so far been achieved only by irreversible chemical changes. Field modulation is a far more desirable path to chiroptical devices. We hypothesized that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field modulation can be attained for chiral nanostructures with large contributions of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic transition dipole moments to polarization rotation. We found that dispersions and gels of para<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles with chiral distortions of the crystal lattices exhibited chiroptical activity in the visible range that was 10 times as strong as that of nonpara<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic nanoparticles of comparable size. Transparency of the nanoparticle gels to circularly polarized light beams in the ultraviolet range was reversibly modulated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic fields. These phenomena were also observed for other nanoscale metal oxides with lattice distortions from imprinted amino acids and other chiral ligands.

Revealing hidden antiferromagnetic correlations in doped Hubbard chains via string correlators

Instead, nonlocal string order parameters can be employed to reveal their hidden order. Similar diluted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic correlations appear in doped one-dimensional lattice systems owing to the phenomenon of spin-charge separation. Here we report on the direct observation of such hidden <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic correlations via quantum gas microscopy of hole-doped ultracold Fermi-Hubbard chains. The measurement of nonlocal spin-density correlation functions reveals a hidden finite-range <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ic order, a direct consequence of spin-charge separation.

Early Use of N-acetylcysteine With Nitrate Therapy in Patients Undergoing Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention for ST-Segment–Elevation Myocardial Infarction Reduces Myocardial Infarct Size (the NACIAM Trial [N-acetylcysteine in Acute Myocardial Infarction])
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Contemporary ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction management involves primary percutaneous coronary intervention, with ongoing studies focusing on infarct size reduction using ancillary therapies. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is an antioxidant with reactive oxygen species scavenging properties that also potentiates the effects of nitroglycerin and thus represents a potentially beneficial ancillary therapy in primary percutaneous coronary intervention. The NACIAM trial (N-acetylcysteine in Acute Myocardial Infarction) examined the effects of NAC on infarct size in patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study evaluated the effects of intravenous high-dose NAC (29 g over 2 days) with background low-dose nitroglycerin (7.2 mg over 2 days) on early cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic resonance imaging–assessed infarct size.

With background nitroglycerin infusion administered to all patients, those randomized to NAC exhibited an absolute 5.5% reduction in cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic resonance–assessed infarct size relative to placebo (median, 11.0%; [interquartile range 4.1, 16.3] versus 16.5%; [interquartile range 10.7, 24.2]; <i>P</i>=0.02). Myocardial salvage was approximately doubled in the NAC group (60%; interquartile range, 37–79) compared with placebo (27%; interquartile range, 14–42; <i>P</i><0.01) and median creatine kinase areas under the curve were 22 000 and 38 000 IU·h in the NAC and placebo groups, respectively (<i>P</i>=0.08).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>High-dose intravenous NAC administered with low-dose intravenous nitroglycerin is associated with reduced infarct size in patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.

High-Sensitive Cardiac Troponin T as an Early Biochemical Signature for Clinical and Subclinical Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although small elevations of high-sensitive cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) are associated with incident heart failure (HF) in the general population, the underlying mechanisms are not well defined. Evaluating the association of hs-cTnT with replacement fibrosis and progression of structural heart disease before symptoms is fundamental to understanding the potential of this biomarker in a HF prevention strategy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We measured hs-cTnT at baseline among 4986 participants in MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis), a cohort initially free of overt cardiovascular disease (CVD). Cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic resonance imaging was performed at baseline. Repeat cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic resonance was performed 10 years later among 2831 participants who remained free of interim CVD events; of these, 1723 received gadolinium-enhanced cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic resonance for characterization of replacement fibrosis by late gadolinium enhancement. Progression of subclinical CVD was defined by 10-year change in left ventricular structure and function. Associations of hs-cTnT with incident HF, CV-related mortality, and coronary heart disease were estimated using Cox regression models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Late gadolinium enhancement for replacement fibrosis was detectable in 6.3% participants without interim CVD events by follow-up cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic resonance. A graded association was observed between higher baseline hs-cTnT categories and late gadolinium enhancement (≥7.42 ng/L versus <limit of detection [<3 ng/L]; adjusted odds ratio, 2.87; 95% confidence interval, 1.38–5.94). Higher hs-cTnT was also associated with a greater probability of an increase in LV mass >12% (highest category versus <limit of detection; odds ratio, 1.50; 95% confidence interval, 1.09–2.07), but not with decline in left ventricular ejection fraction. The risk of incident HF was greater for higher hs-cTnT (≥8.81 ng/L versus <limit of detection; adjusted hazards ratio, 5.59; 95% CI, 2.97–10.68).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>hs-cTnT levels are associated with replacement fibrosis and progressive changes in left ventricular structure in CVD-free adults, findings that may precede HF symptoms by years. Minor elevations of hs-cTnT may represent a biochemical signature of early subclinical cardiac disease, providing an opportunity for targeted preventive interventions.</p></sec>

Evaluation of Cell Therapy on Exercise Performance and Limb Perfusion in Peripheral Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Atherosclerotic peripheral artery disease affects 8% to 12% of Americans >65 years of age and is associated with a major decline in functional status, increased myocardial infarction and stroke rates, and increased risk of ischemic amputation. Current treatment strategies for claudication have limitations. PACE (Patients With Intermittent Claudication Injected With ALDH Bright Cells) is a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute–sponsored, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 exploratory clinical trial designed to assess the safety and efficacy of autologous bone marrow–derived aldehyde dehydrogenase bright (ALDHbr) cells in patients with peripheral artery disease and to explore associated claudication physiological mechanisms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>All participants, randomized 1:1 to receive ALDHbr cells or placebo, underwent bone marrow aspiration and isolation of ALDHbr cells, followed by 10 injections into the thigh and calf of the index leg.

Magneto-Seebeck tunneling on the atomic scale
<p>The tunneling of spin-polarized electrons across a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic tunnel junction driven by a temperature gradient is a fundamental process for the thermal control of electron spin transport. We experimentally investigated the atomic-scale details of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>o-Seebeck tunneling by placing a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic probe tip in close proximity to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic sample at cryogenic temperature, with a vacuum as the tunneling barrier. Heating the tip and measuring the thermopower of the junction while scanning across the spin texture of the sample lead to spin-resolved Seebeck coefficients that can be mapped at atomic-scale lateral resolution. We propose a spin detector for spintronics applications that is driven solely by waste heat, using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>o-Seebeck tunneling to convert spin information into a voltage that can be used for further data processing.</p>

Observation of magnetically tunable Feshbach resonances in ultracold <sup>23</sup>Na<sup>40</sup>K + <sup>40</sup>K collisions
<p>Resonances in ultracold collisions involving heavy molecules are difficult to simulate theoretically and have proven challenging to detect. Here we report the observation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ically tunable Feshbach resonances in ultracold collisions between potassium-40 (<sup>40</sup>K) atoms and sodium-23–potassium-40 (<sup>23</sup>Na<sup>40</sup>K) molecules in the rovibrational ground state. We prepare the atoms and molecules in various hyperfine levels of their ground states and observe the loss of molecules as a function of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field. The atom-molecule Feshbach resonances are identified by observing an enhancement of the loss. We have observed 11 resonances in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field range of 43 to 120 gauss. The observed atom-molecule Feshbach resonances at ultralow temperatures probe the three-body potential energy surface with exceptional resolution and will help to improve understanding of ultracold collisions.</p>

Scale-invariant magnetoresistance in a cuprate superconductor
<p>The anomalous metallic state in the high-temperature superconducting cuprates is masked by superconductivity near a quantum critical point. Applying high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic fields to suppress superconductivity has enabled detailed studies of the normal state, yet the direct effect of strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic fields on the metallic state is poorly understood.

The magnitude of the linear-in-field resistivity mirrors the magnitude and doping evolution of the well-known linear-in-temperature resistivity that has been associated with quantum criticality in high-temperature superconductors.</p>

Chiral Majorana fermion modes in a quantum anomalous Hall insulator–superconductor structure
<p>Majorana fermion is a hypothetical particle that is its own antiparticle. We report transport measurements that suggest the existence of one-dimensional chiral Majorana fermion modes in the hybrid system of a quantum anomalous Hall insulator thin film coupled with a superconductor. As the external <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field is swept, half-integer quantized conductance plateaus are observed at the locations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ization reversals, giving a distinct signature of the Majorana fermion modes. This transport signature is reproducible over many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field sweeps and appears at different temperatures. This finding may open up an avenue to control Majorana fermions for implementing robust topological quantum computing.</p>

Control and local measurement of the spin chemical potential in a magnetic insulator
<p>The spin chemical potential characterizes the tendency of spins to diffuse. Probing this quantity could provide insight into materials such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic insulators and spin liquids and aid optimization of spintronic devices. Here we introduce single-spin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ometry as a generic platform for nonperturbative, nanoscale characterization of spin chemical potentials. We experimentally realize this platform using diamond nitrogen-vacancy centers and use it to investigate magnons in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic insulator, finding that the magnon chemical potential can be controlled by driving the system’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic resonance. We introduce a symmetry-based two-fluid theory describing the underlying magnon processes, measure the local thermomagnonic torque, and illustrate the detection sensitivity using electrically controlled spin injection. Our results pave the way for nanoscale control and imaging of spin transport in mesoscopic systems.</p>

Reconciling solar and stellar magnetic cycles with nonlinear dynamo simulations
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic fields of solar-type stars are observed to cycle over decadal periods—11 years in the case of the Sun. The fields originate in the turbulent convective layers of stars and have a complex dependency upon stellar rotation rate. We have performed a set of turbulent global simulations that exhibit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic cycles varying systematically with stellar rotation and luminosity. We find that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic cycle period is inversely proportional to the Rossby number, which quantifies the influence of rotation on turbulent convection. The trend relies on a fundamentally nonlinear dynamo process and is compatible with the Sun’s cycle and those of other solar-type stars.</p>

Anti-coalescence of bosons on a lossy beam splitter
<p>Two-boson interference, a fundamentally quantum effect, has been extensively studied with photons through the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect and observed with guided <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plasmon</span></strong>s. Using two freely propagating surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plasmon</span></strong> polaritons (SPPs) interfering on a lossy beam splitter, we show that the presence of loss enables us to modify the reflection and transmission factors of the beam splitter, thus revealing quantum interference paths that do not exist in a lossless configuration. We investigate the two-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plasmon</span></strong> interference on beam splitters with different sets of reflection and transmission factors. Through coincidence-detection measurements, we observe either coalescence or anti-coalescence of SPPs.

Lifetime of the solar nebula constrained by meteorite paleomagnetism
<p>A key stage in planet formation is the evolution of a gaseous and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ized solar nebula. However, the lifetime of the nebular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field and nebula are poorly constrained. We present paleo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic analyses of volcanic angrites demonstrating that they formed in a near-zero <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field (<0.6 microtesla) at 4563.5 ± 0.1 million years ago, ~3.8 million years after solar system formation. This indicates that the solar nebula field, and likely the nebular gas, had dispersed by this time. This sets the time scale for formation of the gas giants and planet migration. Furthermore, it supports formation of chondrules after 4563.5 million years ago by non-nebular processes like planetesimal collisions. The core dynamo on the angrite parent body did not initiate until about 4 to 11 million years after solar system formation.</p>

Quantum oscillations of electrical resistivity in an insulator
<p>In metals, orbital motions of conduction electrons on the Fermi surface are quantized in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic fields, which is manifested by quantum oscillations in electrical resistivity. This Landau quantization is generally absent in insulators. Here, we report a notable exception in an insulator—ytterbium dodecaboride (YbB<sub>12</sub>). The resistivity of YbB<sub>12</sub>, which is of a much larger magnitude than the resistivity in metals, exhibits distinct quantum oscillations. These unconventional oscillations arise from the insulating bulk, even though the temperature dependence of the oscillation amplitude follows the conventional Fermi liquid theory of metals with a large effective mass. Quantum oscillations in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic torque are also observed, albeit with a lighter effective mass.</p>

Interaction-driven quantum Hall wedding cake–like structures in graphene quantum dots

The ease with which external electric and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic fields can be introduced in graphene opens a door to creating a tabletop prototype of strongly confined relativistic matter. Here, through a detailed spectroscopic mapping, we directly visualize the interplay between spatial and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic confinement in a circular graphene resonator as atomic-like shell states condense into Landau levels. We directly observe the development of a “wedding cake”–like structure of concentric regions of compressible-incompressible quantum Hall states, a signature of electron interactions in the system.

Coherent band excitations in CePd<sub>3</sub>: A comparison of neutron scattering and ab initio theory

We show that inelastic neutron scattering measurements of the dynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic susceptibility of CePd<sub>3</sub> provides a benchmark for ab initio calculations based on dynamical mean field theory. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic response is strongly momentum dependent thanks to the formation of coherent f-electron bands at low temperature, with an amplitude that is strongly enhanced by local particle-hole interactions. The agreement between experiment and theory shows that we have a robust first-principles understanding of the temperature dependence of f-electron coherence.</p>

<p>We fabricated a C<sub>60</sub> fullerene–based molecular spin-photovoltaic device that integrates a photovoltaic response with the spin transport across the molecular layer. The photovoltaic response can be modified under the application of a small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field, with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ophotovoltage of up to 5% at room temperature. Device functionalities include a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic current inverter and the presence of diverging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ocurrent at certain illumination levels that could be useful for sensing. Completely spin-polarized currents can be created by balancing the external partially spin-polarized injection with the photogenerated carriers.</p>

High-temperature quantum oscillations caused by recurring Bloch states in graphene superlattices
<p>Cyclotron motion of charge carriers in metals and semiconductors leads to Landau quantization and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>o-oscillatory behavior in their properties. Cryogenic temperatures are usually required to observe these oscillations. We show that graphene superlattices support a different type of quantum oscillation that does not rely on Landau quantization. The oscillations are extremely robust and persist well above room temperature in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic fields of only a few tesla. We attribute this phenomenon to repetitive changes in the electronic structure of superlattices such that charge carriers experience effectively no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field at simple fractions of the flux quantum per superlattice unit cell. Our work hints at unexplored physics in Hofstadter butterfly systems at high temperatures.</p>

Nanoscale nuclear magnetic resonance with chemical resolution
<p>Nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a key analytical technique in chemistry, biology, and medicine. However, conventional NMR spectroscopy requires an at least nanoliter-sized sample volume to achieve sufficient signal. We combined the use of a quantum memory and high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic fields with a dedicated quantum sensor based on nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond to achieve chemical shift resolution in <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>19</sup>F NMR spectroscopy of 20-zeptoliter sample volumes. We demonstrate the application of NMR pulse sequences to achieve homonuclear decoupling and spin diffusion measurements. The best measured NMR linewidth of a liquid sample was ~1 part per million, mainly limited by molecular diffusion. To mitigate the influence of diffusion, we performed high-resolution solid-state NMR by applying homonuclear decoupling and achieved a 20-fold narrowing of the NMR linewidth.</p>

Neutron scattering in the proximate quantum spin liquid α-RuCl<sub>3</sub>
<p>The Kitaev quantum spin liquid (KQSL) is an exotic emergent state of matter exhibiting Majorana fermion and gauge flux excitations. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic insulator α-RuCl<sub>3</sub> is thought to realize a proximate KQSL. We used neutron scattering on single crystals of α-RuCl<sub>3</sub> to reconstruct dynamical correlations in energy-momentum space. We discovered highly unusual signals, including a column of scattering over a large energy interval around the Brillouin zone center, which is very stable with temperature. This finding is consistent with scattering from the Majorana excitations of a KQSL. Other, more delicate experimental features can be transparently associated with perturbations to an ideal model. Our results encourage further study of this prototypical material and may open a window into investigating emergent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic Majorana fermions in correlated materials.</p>

An on/off Berry phase switch in circular graphene resonators
<p>The phase of a quantum state may not return to its original value after the system’s parameters cycle around a closed path; instead, the wave function may acquire a measurable phase difference called the Berry phase. Berry phases typically have been accessed through interference experiments. Here, we demonstrate an unusual Berry phase–induced spectroscopic feature: a sudden and large increase in the energy of angular-momentum states in circular graphene p-n junction resonators when a relatively small critical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field is reached. This behavior results from turning on a π Berry phase associated with the topological properties of Dirac fermions in graphene. The Berry phase can be switched on and off with small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field changes on the order of 10 millitesla, potentially enabling a variety of optoelectronic graphene device applications.</p>

Quantum sensing with arbitrary frequency resolution
<p>Quantum sensing takes advantage of well-controlled quantum systems for performing measurements with high sensitivity and precision. We have implemented a concept for quantum sensing with arbitrary frequency resolution, independent of the qubit probe and limited only by the stability of an external synchronization clock. Our concept makes use of quantum lock-in detection to continuously probe a signal of interest. Using the electronic spin of a single nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond, we demonstrate detection of oscillating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic fields with a frequency resolution of 70 microhertz over a megahertz bandwidth. The continuous sampling further guarantees an enhanced sensitivity, reaching a signal-to-noise ratio in excess of 10<sup>4</sup> for a 170-nanotesla test signal measured during a 1-hour interval. Our technique has applications in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic resonance spectroscopy, quantum simulation, and sensitive signal detection.</p>

Revealing the subfemtosecond dynamics of orbital angular momentum in nanoplasmonic vortices
<p>The ability of light to carry and deliver orbital angular momentum (OAM) in the form of optical vortices has attracted much interest. The physical properties of light with a helical wavefront can be confined onto two-dimensional surfaces with subwavelength dimensions in the form of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plasmon</span></strong>ic vortices, opening avenues for thus far unknown light-matter interactions. Because of their extreme rotational velocity, the ultrafast dynamics of such vortices remained unexplored. Here we show the detailed spatiotemporal evolution of nanovortices using time-resolved two-photon photoemission electron microscopy. We observe both long- and short-range <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plasmon</span></strong>ic vortices confined to deep subwavelength dimensions on the scale of 100 nanometers with nanometer spatial resolution and subfemtosecond time-step resolution. Finally, by measuring the angular velocity of the vortex, we directly extract the OAM magnitude of light.</p>

The magnetic field and turbulence of the cosmic web measured using a brilliant fast radio burst
<p>Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration events thought to originate beyond the Milky Way galaxy. Uncertainty surrounding the burst sources, and their propagation through intervening plasma, has limited their use as cosmological probes. We report on a mildly dispersed (dispersion measure 266.5 ± 0.1 parsecs per cubic centimeter), exceptionally intense (120 ± 30 janskys), linearly polarized, scintillating burst (FRB 150807) that we directly localize to 9 square arc minutes. On the basis of a low Faraday rotation (12.0 ± 0.7 radians per square meter), we infer negligible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ization in the circum-burst plasma and constrain the net <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ization of the cosmic web along this sightline to <21 nanogauss, parallel to the line-of-sight. The burst scintillation suggests weak turbulence in the ionized intergalactic medium.</p>

Anatomy of STEM teaching in North American universities
<p>A large body of evidence demonstrates that strategies that promote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">student</span></strong> interactions and cognitively engage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">student</span></strong>s with content (<i>1</i>) lead to gains in learning and attitudinal outcomes for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">student</span></strong>s in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). Many educational and governmental bodies have called for and supported adoption of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">student</span></strong>-centered strategies throughout the undergraduate STEM curriculum. But to the extent that we have pictures of the STEM undergraduate instructional landscape, it has mostly been provided through self-report surveys of faculty members, within a particular STEM discipline [e.g., (<i>3</i>–<i>6</i>)]. Such surveys are prone to reliability threats and can underestimate the complexity of classroom environments, and few are implemented nationally to provide valid and reliable data (<i>7</i>). Reflecting the limited state of these data, a report from the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine called for improved data collection to understand the use of evidence-based instructional practices (<i>8</i>). We report here a major step toward a characterization of STEM teaching practices in North American universities based on classroom observations from over 2000 classes taught by more than 500 STEM faculty members across 25 institutions.</p>

The role of education interventions in improving economic rationality
<p>Schooling rewards people with labor market returns and nonpecuniary benefits in other realms of life. However, there is no experimental evidence showing that education interventions improve individual economic rationality. We examine this hypothesis by studying a randomized 1-year financial support program for education in Malawi that reduced absence and dropout rates and increased scores on a qualification exam of female secondary school <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">student</span></strong>s. We measure economic rationality 4 years after the intervention by using lab-in-the-field experiments to create scores of consistency with utility maximization that are derived from revealed preference theory. We find that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">student</span></strong>s assigned to the intervention had higher scores of rationality. The results remain robust after controlling for changes in cognitive and noncognitive skills. Our results suggest that education enhances the quality of economic decision-making.</p>

Particulate Matter Exposure and Stress Hormone Levels
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Exposure to ambient particulate matter (PM) is associated with a number of adverse health outcomes, but potential mechanisms are largely unknown. Metabolomics represents a powerful approach to study global metabolic changes in response to environmental exposures. We therefore conducted this study to investigate changes in serum metabolites in response to the reduction of PM exposure among healthy college <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">student</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a randomized, double-blind crossover trial in 55 healthy college <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">student</span></strong>s in Shanghai, China. Real and sham air purifiers were placed in participants’ dormitories in random order for 9 days with a 12-day washout period. Serum metabolites were quantified by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Between-treatment differences in metabolites were examined using orthogonal partial least square-discriminant analysis and mixed-effect models. Secondary outcomes include blood pressure, corticotropin-releasing hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, insulin resistance, and biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The average personal exposure to PMs with aerodynamic diameters ≤2.5 μm was 24.3 μg/m<sup>3</sup> during the real purification and 53.1 μg/m<sup>3</sup> during the sham purification. Metabolomics analysis showed that higher exposure to PMs with aerodynamic diameters ≤2.5 μm led to significant increases in cortisol, cortisone, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. Between-treatment differences were also observed for glucose, amino acids, fatty acids, and lipids. We found significantly higher blood pressure, hormones, insulin resistance, and biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation among individuals exposed to higher PMs with aerodynamic diameters ≤2.5 μm.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This study suggests that higher PM may induce metabolic alterations that are consistent with activations of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal and sympathetic-adrenal-medullary axes, adding potential mechanistic insights into the adverse health outcomes associated with PM. Furthermore, our study demonstrated short-term reductions in stress hormone following indoor air purification.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

The MOOC pivot
<p>When massive open online courses (MOOCs) first captured global attention in 2012, advocates imagined a disruptive transformation in postsecondary education. Video lectures from the world's best professors could be broadcast to the farthest reaches of the networked world, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">student</span></strong>s could demonstrate proficiency using innovative computer-graded assessments, even in places with limited access to traditional education. But after promising a reordering of higher education, we see the field instead coalescing around a different, much older business model: helping universities outsource their online master's degrees for professionals (<i>1</i>). To better understand the reasons for this shift, we highlight three patterns emerging from data on MOOCs provided by Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) via the edX platform: The vast majority of MOOC learners never return after their first year, the growth in MOOC participation has been concentrated almost entirely in the world's most affluent countries, and the bane of MOOCs—low completion rates (<i>2</i>)—has not improved over 6 years.</p>

Immigration order threatens overseas talent
<p>Last week, President Donald Trump issued an executive order barring the entry of any citizen from seven mostly Muslim nations for 90 days while procedures for more-rigorous vetting of visa applicants are put in place. The order sparked chaos at airports in the United States and abroad, as dozens of academics and others with valid U.S. entry documents were not allowed to board U.S.-bound flights or were turned back after arriving. It provoked angst in scientists and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">student</span></strong>s from the target countries—Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Sudan, and Yemen—who had secured a visa to come to the United States, and in those already living there. And it raised broader questions about whether the country can continue to benefit from the flow of scientific and engineering talent from overseas.</p>

Energy pulses reveal possible new state of memory
<p>Memory researchers have shone light into a cognitive limbo. A new memory—the name of someone you've just met, for example—is held for seconds in so-called working memory, as your brain's neurons continue to fire. If the person is important to you, the name will over a few days enter your long-term memory, preserved by permanently altered neural connections. But where does it go during the in-between hours, when it has left your standard working memory and is not yet embedded in long-term memory? To figure this out, a research team resurrects memories from this limbo. Their observations point to a new form of working memory, which they dub prioritized long-term memory, that exists without elevated neural activity. Consistent with other recent work, the study suggests that information can somehow be held among the synapses that connect neurons, even after conventional working memory has faded. This new memory state could have a range of practical implications, from helping college <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">student</span></strong>s learn more efficiently to assisting people with memory-related neurological conditions such as amnesia, epilepsy, and schizophrenia.</p>

A finer look at a fine cellular meshwork
<p>Students learning about the eukaryotic cell are taught that mitochondria are the powerhouse of the cell, the nucleus is the information storehouse, and lysosomes are the garbage disposal. Summing up the role of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is more problematic, even for professional cell biologists. Classically, the ER is where membrane proteins, secreted proteins, and most lipids are synthesized. It is also the site of calcium regulation. More recent work shows that it is the site of antigen presentation by major histocompatibility complex class I molecules, and the location of the unfolded protein response, now thought to be central to several major diseases. A new frontier is its relationships with other organelles (<i>1</i>). On page 433 of this issue, Nixon-Abell <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) describe how an armamentarium of superresolution imaging techniques reveals new aspects of the ER's very heterogeneous morphology. Indeed, the “form follows function” adage may help to make sense of this organelle's functional issues.</p>

Opportunities and Challenges in Next Generation Standards
<p>Imagine that politicians and the people they represent understood how human activity impacts Earth, including climate. And imagine that they had learned how to evaluate claims, argue from evidence, and understand models. These understandings and practices are prominent in the U.S. National Research Council (NRC) framework to guide the next iteration of standards for U.S. elementary and secondary school <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">student</span></strong>s (<i>1</i>). We discuss how aspects such as authorship, coordination among subject areas, and broader goals of college and career readiness give reason to believe that this effort will be more successful than previous attempts to use standards to improve science education (<i>2</i>).</p>

Soluble gp130 prevents interleukin-6 and interleukin-11 cluster signaling but not intracellular autocrine responses
<p>Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a proinflammatory cytokine of the IL-6 family, members of which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> through a complex of a cytokine-specific receptor and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>-transducing subunit gp130. The interaction of IL-6 with the membrane-bound IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) and gp130 stimulates “classic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing,” whereas the binding of IL-6 and a soluble version of the IL-6R to gp130 stimulates “trans-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing.” Alternatively, “cluster <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing” occurs when membrane-bound IL-6:IL-6R complexes on transmitter cells activate gp130 receptors on neighboring receiver cells. The soluble form of gp130 (sgp130) is a selective trans-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing inhibitor, but it does not affect classic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing. We demonstrated that the interaction of soluble gp130 with natural and synthetic membrane-bound IL-6:IL-6R complexes inhibited IL-6 cluster <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing. Similarly, IL-11 cluster <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing through the IL-11R to gp130 was also inhibited by soluble gp130. However, autocrine classic and trans-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing was not inhibited by extracellular inhibitors such as sgp130 or gp130 antibodies. Together, our results suggest that autocrine IL-6 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing may occur intracellularly.</p>

Phosphoproteomic analysis of chimeric antigen receptor signaling reveals kinetic and quantitative differences that affect cell function
<p>Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) link an antigen recognition domain to intracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing domains to redirect T cell specificity and function. T cells expressing CARs with CD28/CD3ζ or 4-1BB/CD3ζ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing domains are effective at treating refractory B cell malignancies but exhibit differences in effector function, clinical efficacy, and toxicity that are assumed to result from the activation of divergent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing cascades. We analyzed stimulation-induced phosphorylation events in primary human CD8<sup>+</sup> CD28/CD3ζ and 4-1BB/CD3ζ CAR T cells by mass spectrometry and found that both CAR constructs activated similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing intermediates. Stimulation of CD28/CD3ζ CARs activated faster and larger-magnitude changes in protein phosphorylation, which correlated with an effector T cell–like phenotype and function. In contrast, 4-1BB/CD3ζ CAR T cells preferentially expressed T cell memory–associated genes and exhibited sustained antitumor activity against established tumors in vivo. Mutagenesis of the CAR CD28 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing domain demonstrated that the increased CD28/CD3ζ CAR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> intensity was partly related to constitutive association of Lck with this domain in CAR complexes. Our data show that CAR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathways cannot be predicted solely by the domains used to construct the receptor and that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> strength is a key determinant of T cell fate. Thus, tailoring CAR design based on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> strength may lead to improved clinical efficacy and reduced toxicity.</p>

A calcium-sensing receptor mutation causing hypocalcemia disrupts a transmembrane salt bridge to activate β-arrestin–biased signaling
<p>The calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is a G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>s through G<sub>q/11</sub> and G<sub>i/o</sub> to stimulate cytosolic calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>i</sub>) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing to control extracellular calcium homeostasis. Studies of loss- and gain-of-function <i>CASR</i> mutations, which cause familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia type 1 (FHH1) and autosomal dominant hypocalcemia type 1 (ADH1), respectively, have revealed that the CaSR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>s in a biased manner. Thus, some mutations associated with FHH1 lead to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing predominantly through the MAPK pathway, whereas mutations associated with ADH1 preferentially enhance Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>i</sub> responses. We report a previously unidentified ADH1-associated R680G CaSR mutation, which led to the identification of a CaSR structural motif that mediates biased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing.

Moreover, this gain of function in MAPK activity occurred independently of G<sub>q/11</sub> and G<sub>i/o</sub> and was mediated instead by a noncanonical pathway involving β-arrestin proteins. Homology modeling and mutagenesis studies showed that the R680G CaSR mutation selectively enhanced β-arrestin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing by disrupting a salt bridge formed between Arg<sup>680</sup> and Glu<sup>767</sup>, which are located in CaSR transmembrane domain 3 and extracellular loop 2, respectively.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Extracellular ATP Shapes a Defense-Related Transcriptome Both Independently and along with Other Defense Signaling Pathways
<p>ATP is not only an essential metabolite of cellular biochemistry but also acts as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> in the extracellular milieu. In plants, extracellular ATP is monitored by the purinergic receptor P2K1. Recent studies have revealed that extracellular ATP acts as a damage-associated molecular pattern in plants, and its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing through P2K1 is important for mounting an effective defense response against various pathogenic microorganisms. Biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens attack plants using different strategies, to which plants respond accordingly with salicylate-based or jasmonate/ethylene-based defensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing, respectively. Interestingly, defense mediated by P2K1 is effective against pathogens of both lifestyles, raising the question of the level of interplay between extracellular ATP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing and that of jasmonate, ethylene, and salicylate. To address this issue, we analyzed ATP-induced transcriptomes in wild-type Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings and mutant seedlings defective in essential components in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathways of jasmonate, ethylene, and salicylate (classic defense hormones) as well as a mutant and an overexpression line of the P2K1 receptor. We found that P2K1 function is crucial for faithful ATP-induced transcriptional changes and that a subset of genes is more responsive in the P2K1 overexpression line. We also found that more than half of the ATP-responsive genes required <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing by one or more of the pathways for the classical defense hormones, with the jasmonate-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing being more critical than others. By contrast, the other ATP-responsive genes were unaffected by deficiencies in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing for any of the classical defense hormones. These ATP-responsive genes were highly enriched for defense-related Gene Ontology terms. We further tested the ATP-induced genes in knockout mutants of transcription factors, demonstrating that MYCs acting downstream of the jasmonate receptor complex and calmodulin-binding transcription activators are nuclear transducers of P2K1-mediated extracellular ATP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing.</p>

Functional selectivity profiling of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor using pathway-wide BRET signaling sensors
<p>G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) are important therapeutic targets that exhibit functional selectivity (biased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing), in which different ligands or receptor variants elicit distinct downstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing. Understanding all the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing events and biases that contribute to both the beneficial and adverse effects of GPCR stimulation by given ligands is important for drug discovery. Here, we report the design, validation, and use of pathway-selective bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) biosensors that monitor the engagement and activation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing effectors downstream of G proteins, including protein kinase C (PKC), phospholipase C (PLC), p63RhoGEF, and Rho. Combined with G protein and β-arrestin BRET biosensors, our sensors enabled real-time monitoring of GPCR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing at different levels in downstream pathways in both native and engineered cells. Profiling of the responses to 14 angiotensin II (AngII) type 1 receptor (AT1R) ligands enabled the clustering of compounds into different subfamilies of biased ligands and showed that, in addition to the previously reported functional selectivity between Gα<sub>q</sub> and β-arrestin, there are also biases among G protein subtypes. We also demonstrated that biases observed at the receptor and G protein levels propagated to downstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathways and that these biases could occur through the engagement of different G proteins to activate a common effector. We also used these tools to determine how naturally occurring AT1R variants affected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing bias. This suite of BRET biosensors provides a useful resource for fingerprinting biased ligands and mutant receptors and for dissecting functional selectivity at various levels of GPCR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing.</p>

Dampening oncogenic RAS signaling
<p>The control of normal cellular homeostasis is a function of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing by the RAS guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) KRAS, NRAS, and HRAS and their downstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing proteins, such as the RAF kinases (BRAF and CRAF), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (MEK), and extracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>–regulated kinase (ERK), which together constitute the RAS-MAPK pathway (<i>1</i>). This pathway is dysregulated in human diseases, particularly cancer, in which mutations or other nongenetic events hyperactivate the pathway in more than 50% of cases (<i>1</i>). Activating mutations in RAS genes occur in more than 30% of all cancers and seemingly lock RAS into a constitutively active, GTP-bound state to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> autonomously without the need for upstream input (<i>1</i>). Therapeutic suppression of pathogenic RASMAPK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing to maximize disease control in cancer patients remains an elusive goal. Multiple strategies targeting upstream [e.g., receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)] or downstream (e.g., MEK) RAS pathway proteins to limit RAS-GTP–mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing in RAS-MAPK pathway–driven cancers are under evaluation (<i>1</i>–<i>3</i>). However, recent studies have extended our knowledge of how certain forms of oncogenic RAS and other oncogenic MAPK pathway proteins function not in an autonomous manner but instead semiautonomously, such that they still respond to upstream regulation (<i>4</i>–<i>8</i>). These findings reveal mechanisms by which RAS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing is dysregulated in cancer and highlight newly identified therapeutic strategies with the potential to target oncogenic RAS-MAPK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Extracellular ATP Acts on Jasmonate Signaling to Reinforce Plant Defense
<p>Damaged cells send various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>s to stimulate defense responses. Recent identification and genetic studies of the plant purinoceptor, P2K1 (also known as DORN1), have demonstrated that extracellular ATP is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> involved in plant stress responses, including wounding, perhaps to evoke plant defense. However, it remains largely unknown how extracellular ATP induces plant defense responses. Here, we demonstrate that extracellular ATP induces plant defense mediated through activation of the intracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing of jasmonate (JA), a well-characterized defense hormone. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves, ATP pretreatment induced resistance against the necrotrophic fungus, <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>. The induced resistance was enhanced in the P2K1 receptor overexpression line, but reduced in the receptor mutant, <i>dorn1</i>-<i>3</i>. Mining the transcriptome data revealed that ATP induces a set of JA-induced genes. In addition, the P2K1-associated coexpression network contains defense-related genes, including those encoding jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins, which play key roles as repressors of JA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing. We examined whether extracellular ATP impacts the stability of JAZ1 in Arabidopsis. The results showed that the JAZ1 stability decreased in response to ATP addition in a proteasome-dependent manner. This reduction required intracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing via second messengers—cytosolic calcium, reactive oxygen species, and nitric oxide. Interestingly, the ATP-induced JAZ1 degradation was attenuated in the JA receptor mutant, <i>coi1</i>, but not in the JA biosynthesis mutant, <i>aos</i>, or upon addition of JA biosynthesis inhibitors. Immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that ATP increases the interaction between COI1 and JAZ1, suggesting direct cross talk between extracellular ATP and JA in intracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing events. Taken together, these results suggest that extracellular ATP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing directly impacts the JA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathway to maximize plant defense responses.</p>

Late-phase synthesis of IκBα insulates the TLR4-activated canonical NF-κB pathway from noncanonical NF-κB signaling in macrophages
<p>The nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) transcription factors coordinate the inflammatory immune response during microbial infection. Pathogenic substances engage canonical NF-κB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing through the heterodimer RelA:p50, which is subjected to rapid negative feedback by inhibitor of κBα (IκBα). The noncanonical NF-κB pathway is required for the differentiation of immune cells; however, cross-talk between both pathways can occur. Concomitantly activated noncanonical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing generates p52 from the p100 precursor. The synthesis of p100 is induced by canonical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing, leading to the formation of the late-acting RelA:p52 heterodimer. This cross-talk prolongs inflammatory RelA activity in epithelial cells to ensure pathogen clearance. We found that the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)–activated canonical NF-κB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathway is insulated from lymphotoxin β receptor (LTβR)–induced noncanonical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing in mouse macrophage cell lines. Combined computational and biochemical studies indicated that the extent of NF-κB–responsive expression of <i>Nfkbia</i>, which encodes IκBα, inversely correlated with cross-talk. The <i>Nfkbia</i> promoter showed enhanced responsiveness to NF-κB activation in macrophages compared to that in fibroblasts. We found that this hyperresponsive promoter engaged the RelA:p52 dimer generated during costimulation of macrophages through TLR4 and LTβR to trigger synthesis of IκBα at late time points, which prevented the late-acting RelA cross-talk response. Together, these data suggest that, despite the presence of identical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing networks in cells of diverse lineages, emergent cross-talk between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathways is subject to cell type–specific regulation. We propose that the insulation of canonical and noncanonical NF-κB pathways limits the deleterious effects of macrophage-mediated inflammation.</p>

Integrated proximal proteomics reveals IRS2 as a determinant of cell survival in ALK-driven neuroblastoma
<p>Oncogenic anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is one of the few druggable targets in neuroblastoma, and therapy resistance to ALK-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) comprises an inevitable clinical challenge. Therefore, a better understanding of the oncogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing network rewiring driven by ALK is necessary to improve and guide future therapies. Here, we performed quantitative mass spectrometry–based proteomics on neuroblastoma cells treated with one of three clinically relevant ALK TKIs (crizotinib, LDK378, or lorlatinib) or an experimentally used ALK TKI (TAE684) to unravel aberrant ALK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathways. Our integrated proximal proteomics (IPP) strategy included multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing layers, such as the ALK interactome, phosphotyrosine interactome, phosphoproteome, and proteome. We identified the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing adaptor protein IRS2 (insulin receptor substrate 2) as a major ALK target and an ALK TKI–sensitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing node in neuroblastoma cells driven by oncogenic ALK. TKI treatment decreased the recruitment of IRS2 to ALK and reduced the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS2. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated depletion of ALK or IRS2 decreased the phosphorylation of the survival-promoting kinase Akt and of a downstream target, the transcription factor FoxO3, and reduced the viability of three ALK-driven neuroblastoma cell lines. Collectively, our IPP analysis provides insight into the proximal architecture of oncogenic ALK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing by revealing IRS2 as an adaptor protein that links ALK to neuroblastoma cell survival through the Akt-FoxO3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing axis.</p>

Sphingosine 1-phosphate stimulates eyelid closure in the developing rat by stimulating EGFR signaling

Spns2, a sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) transporter that releases S1P from cells, was enriched at the tip of developing eyelids in wild-type rat embryos. <i>Spns2</i> expression or treatment with S1P or any one of several EGFR ligands rescued the EOB <i>Spns2</i> mutant phenotype in vivo and in tissue explants in vitro and rescued the formation of stress fibers in primary keratinocytes from mutants.

Unique BIR domain sets determine inhibitor of apoptosis protein–driven cell death and NOD2 complex signal specificity

IAPs direct both nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing 2 (NOD2) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing complexes and cell death mechanisms to appropriately regulate inflammation. Although it is known that XIAP is critical for NOD2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing and that the loss of cIAP1 and cIAP2 blunts NOD2 activity, it is unclear whether these three highly related proteins can compensate for one another in NOD2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing or in mechanisms governing apoptosis or necroptosis. This potential redundancy is critically important, given that genetic loss of XIAP causes both very early onset inflammatory bowel disease and X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome 2 (XLP-2) and that the overexpression of cIAP1 and cIAP2 is linked to both carcinogenesis and chemotherapeutic resistance. Given the therapeutic interest in IAP inhibition and the potential toxicities associated with disruption of inflammatory homeostasis, we used synthetic biology techniques to examine the functional redundancies of key domains in the IAPs. From this analysis, we defined the features of the IAPs that enable them to function at overlapping <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing complexes but remain independent and functionally exclusive in their roles as E3 ubiquitin ligases in innate immune and inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing.</p>

G protein–coupled receptors control the sensitivity of cells to the morphogen Sonic Hedgehog
<p>The morphogen Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) patterns tissues during development by directing cell fates in a concentration-dependent manner. The SHH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> is transmitted across the membrane of target cells by the heptahelical transmembrane protein Smoothened (SMO), which activates the GLI family of transcription factors through a mechanism that is undefined in vertebrates. Using CRISPR-edited null alleles and small-molecule inhibitors, we systematically analyzed the epistatic interactions between SMO and three proteins implicated in SMO <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing: the heterotrimeric G protein subunit Gα<sub>S</sub>, the G protein–coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2), and the Gα<sub>S</sub>-coupled receptor GPR161. Our experiments uncovered a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing mechanism that modifies the sensitivity of target cells to SHH and consequently changes the shape of the SHH dose-response curve. In both fibroblasts and spinal neural progenitors, the loss of GPR161, previously implicated as an inhibitor of basal SHH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing, increased the sensitivity of target cells across the entire spectrum of SHH concentrations.

Guard Cell Salicylic Acid Signaling Is Integrated into Abscisic Acid Signaling via the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CPK-Dependent Pathway

The Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent protein kinase Open Stomata1 (OST1) and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein kinases (CPKs) are key for ABA-induced activation of the slow-type anion channel SLAC1 and stomatal closure. Here, we show that SA-induced stomatal closure and SA activation of slow-type anion channel are impaired in the CPK disruption mutant <i>cpk3-2 cpk6-1</i> but not in the OST1 disruption mutant <i>ost1-3</i>.

Functional analysis of a zebrafish <i>myd88</i> mutant identifies key transcriptional components of the innate immune system
<p>Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are an important class of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that recognize microbial and danger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>s. Their downstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing upon ligand binding is vital for initiation of the innate immune response. In human and mammalian models, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MYD88) is known for its central role as an adaptor molecule in interleukin 1 receptor (IL-1R) and TLR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing. The zebrafish is increasingly used as a complementary model system for disease research and drug screening. Here, we describe a zebrafish line with a truncated version of MyD88 as the first zebrafish mutant for a TLR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing component. We show that this immune-compromised mutant has a lower survival rate under standard rearing conditions and is more susceptible to challenge with the acute bacterial pathogens <i>Edwardsiella tarda</i> and <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>. Microarray and quantitative PCR analysis revealed that expression of genes for transcription factors central to innate immunity (including NF-ĸB and AP-1) and the pro-inflammatory cytokine Il1b, is dependent on MyD88 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing during these bacterial infections. Nevertheless, expression of immune genes independent of MyD88 in the <i>myd88</i> mutant line was sufficient to limit growth of an attenuated <i>S. typhimurium</i> strain. In the case of infection with the chronic bacterial pathogen <i>Mycobacterium marinum</i>, we show that MyD88 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing has an important protective role during early pathogenesis. During mycobacterial infection, the <i>myd88</i> mutant shows accelerated formation of granuloma-like aggregates and increased bacterial burden, with associated lower induction of genes central to innate immunity.

We have previously shown that dorsoventral (DV) tissues are temporally patterned progressively from anterior to posterior by a BMP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathway. Here we report that DV patterning along the zebrafish anteroposterior (AP) axis is temporally coordinated with AP patterning by an identical patterning clock. We altered AP patterning by inhibiting or activating FGF, Wnt or retinoic acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing combined with inhibition of BMP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing at a series of developmental time points, which revealed that the temporal progression of DV patterning is directly coordinated with AP patterning. We investigated how these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathways are integrated and suggest a model for how DV and AP patterning are temporally coordinated. It has been shown that in <i>Xenopus</i> dorsal tissues FGF and Wnt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing quell BMP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing by degrading phosphorylated (P) Smad1/5, the BMP pathway <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> transducer, via phosphorylation of the Smad1/5 linker region. We show that in zebrafish FGF/MAPK, but not Wnt/GSK3, phosphorylation of the Smad1/5 linker region localizes to a ventral vegetal gastrula region that could coordinate DV patterning with AP patterning ventrally without degrading P-Smad1/5. Furthermore, we demonstrate that alteration of the MAPK phosphorylation sites in the Smad5 linker causes precocious patterning of DV tissues along the AP axis during gastrulation. Thus, DV and AP patterning are intimately coordinated to allow cells to acquire both positional and temporal information simultaneously.</p>

Inhibition of T cell activation and function by the adaptor protein CIN85
<p>T cell activation is initiated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing molecules downstream of the T cell receptor (TCR) that are organized by adaptor proteins. CIN85 (Cbl-interacting protein of 85 kDa) is one such adaptor protein. Here, we showed that CIN85 limited T cell responses to TCR stimulation. Compared to activated wild-type (WT) T cells, those that lacked CIN85 produced more IL-2 and exhibited greater proliferation. After stimulation of WT T cells with their cognate antigen, CIN85 was recruited to the TCR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing complex. Early TCR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing events, such as phosphorylation of ζ-chain–associated protein kinase 70 (Zap70), Src homology 2 (SH2) domain–containing leukocyte protein of 76 kDa (SLP76), and extracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>–regulated kinase (Erk), were enhanced in CIN85-deficient T cells. The inhibitory function of CIN85 required the SH3 and PR regions of the adaptor, which associated with the phosphatase suppressor of TCR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing–2 (Sts-2) after TCR stimulation. Together, our data suggest that CIN85 is recruited to the TCR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing complex and mediates inhibition of T cell activation through its association with Sts-2.</p>

CD45 exclusion– and cross-linking–based receptor signaling together broaden FcεRI reactivity
<p>For many years, the high-affinity receptor for immunoglobulin E (IgE) FcεRI, which is expressed by mast cells and basophils, has been widely held to be the exemplar of cross-linking (that is, aggregation dependent) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing receptors. We found, however, that FcεRI <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing could occur in the presence or absence of receptor cross-linking. Using both cell and cell-free systems, we showed that FcεRI <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing was stimulated by surface-associated monovalent ligands through the passive, size-dependent exclusion of the receptor-type tyrosine phosphatase CD45 from plasma membrane regions of FcεRI-ligand engagement. Similarly to the T cell receptor, FcεRI <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing could also be initiated in a ligand-independent manner. These data suggest that a simple mechanism of CD45 exclusion–based receptor triggering could function together with cross-linking–based FcεRI <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing, broadening mast cell and basophil reactivity by enabling these cells to respond to both multivalent and surface-presented monovalent antigens. These findings also strengthen the case that a size-dependent, phosphatase exclusion–based receptor triggering mechanism might serve generally to facilitate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing by noncatalytic immune receptors.</p>

The inositol phosphatase SHIP2 enables sustained ERK activation downstream of FGF receptors by recruiting Src kinases
<p>Sustained activation of extracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>–regulated kinase (ERK) drives pathologies caused by mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs). We previously identified the inositol phosphatase SHIP2 (also known as INPPL1) as an FGFR-interacting protein and a target of the tyrosine kinase activities of FGFR1, FGFR3, and FGFR4. We report that loss of SHIP2 converted FGF-mediated sustained ERK activation into a transient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> and rescued cell phenotypes triggered by pathologic FGFR-ERK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing. Mutant forms of SHIP2 lacking phosphoinositide phosphatase activity still associated with FGFRs and did not prevent FGF-induced sustained ERK activation, demonstrating that the adaptor rather than the catalytic activity of SHIP2 was required. SHIP2 recruited Src family kinases to the FGFRs, which promoted FGFR-mediated phosphorylation and assembly of protein complexes that relayed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing to ERK. SHIP2 interacted with FGFRs, was phosphorylated by active FGFRs, and promoted FGFR-ERK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing at the level of phosphorylation of the adaptor FRS2 and recruitment of the tyrosine phosphatase PTPN11. Thus, SHIP2 is an essential component of canonical FGF-FGFR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> transduction and a potential therapeutic target in FGFR-related disorders.</p>

Lgl reduces endosomal vesicle acidification and Notch signaling by promoting the interaction between Vap33 and the V-ATPase complex
<p>Epithelial cell polarity is linked to the control of tissue growth and tumorigenesis. The tumor suppressor and cell polarity protein lethal-2-giant larvae (Lgl) promotes Hippo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing and inhibits Notch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing to restrict tissue growth in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Notch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing is greater in <i>lgl</i> mutant tissue than in wild-type tissue because of increased acidification of endosomal vesicles, which promotes the proteolytic processing and activation of Notch by γ-secretase. We showed that the increased Notch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing and tissue growth defects of <i>lgl</i> mutant tissue depended on endosomal vesicle acidification mediated by the vacuolar adenosine triphosphatase (V-ATPase). Lgl promoted the activity of the V-ATPase by interacting with Vap33 (VAMP-associated protein of 33 kDa). Vap33 physically and genetically interacted with Lgl and V-ATPase subunits and repressed V-ATPase–mediated endosomal vesicle acidification and Notch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing. Vap33 overexpression reduced the abundance of the V-ATPase component Vha44, whereas Lgl knockdown reduced the binding of Vap33 to the V-ATPase component Vha68-3.

Our findings implicate the deregulation of Vap33 and V-ATPase activity in polarity-impaired epithelial cancers.</p>

Integration of protein phosphorylation, acetylation, and methylation data sets to outline lung cancer signaling networks
<p>Protein posttranslational modifications (PTMs) have typically been studied independently, yet many proteins are modified by more than one PTM type, and cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathways somehow integrate this information. We coupled immunoprecipitation using PTM-specific antibodies with tandem mass tag (TMT) mass spectrometry to simultaneously examine phosphorylation, methylation, and acetylation in 45 lung cancer cell lines compared to normal lung tissue and to cell lines treated with anticancer drugs. This simultaneous, large-scale, integrative analysis of these PTMs using a cluster-filtered network (CFN) approach revealed that cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathways were outlined by clustering patterns in PTMs. We used the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) method to identify PTM clusters and then integrated each with known protein-protein interactions (PPIs) to elucidate functional cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathways. The CFN identified known and previously unknown cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathways in lung cancer cells that were not present in normal lung epithelial tissue. In various proteins modified by more than one type of PTM, the incidence of those PTMs exhibited inverse relationships, suggesting that molecular exclusive “OR” gates determine a large number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> transduction events. We also showed that the acetyltransferase EP300 appears to be a hub in the network of pathways involving different PTMs. In addition, the data shed light on the mechanism of action of geldanamycin, an HSP90 inhibitor. Together, the findings reveal that cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathways mediated by acetylation, methylation, and phosphorylation regulate the cytoskeleton, membrane traffic, and RNA binding protein–mediated control of gene expression.</p>

Inflammatory but not mitogenic contexts prime synovial fibroblasts for compensatory signaling responses to p38 inhibition
<p>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disorder that causes joint pain, swelling, and loss of function. Development of effective new drugs has proven challenging in part because of the complexities and interconnected nature of intracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing networks that complicate the effects of pharmacological interventions. We characterized the kinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathways that are activated in RA and evaluated the multivariate effects of targeted inhibitors. Synovial fluids from RA patients activated the kinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathways JAK, JNK, p38, and MEK in synovial fibroblasts (SFs), a stromal cell type that promotes RA progression. Kinase inhibitors enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing of “off-target” pathways in a manner dependent on stimulatory context. Inhibitors of p38, which have been widely explored in clinical trials for RA, resulted in undesirable increases in nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), JNK, and MEK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing in SFs in inflammatory, but not mitogenic, contexts. This was mediated by the transcription factor CREB, which functions in part within a negative feedback loop in MAPK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing. CREB activation was induced predominately by p38 in response to inflammatory stimuli, but by MEK in response to mitogenic stimuli; hence, the effects of drugs targeting p38 or MEK were markedly different in SFs cultured under mitogenic or inflammatory conditions. Together, these findings illustrate how stimulatory context can alter dominance in pathway cross-talk even for a fixed network topology, thereby providing a rationale for why p38 inhibitors deliver limited benefits in RA and demonstrating the need for careful consideration of p38-targeted drugs in inflammation-related disorders.</p>

Convergence of Wnt, growth factor, and heterotrimeric G protein signals on the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Daple
<p>Cellular proliferation, differentiation, and morphogenesis are shaped by multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing cascades, and their dysregulation plays an integral role in cancer progression. Three cascades that contribute to oncogenic potential are those mediated by Wnt proteins and the receptor Frizzled (FZD), growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), and heterotrimeric G proteins and associated GPCRs. Daple is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the G protein G<sub>αi</sub>. Daple also binds to FZD and the Wnt/FZD mediator Dishevelled (Dvl), and it enhances β-catenin–independent Wnt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing in response to Wnt5a-FZD7 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing. We identified Daple as a substrate of multiple RTKs and non-RTKs and, hence, as a point of convergence for the three cascades. We found that phosphorylation near the Dvl-binding motif in Daple by both RTKs and non-RTKs caused Daple/Dvl complex dissociation and augmented the ability of Daple to bind to and activate G<sub>αi</sub>, which potentiated β-catenin–independent Wnt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>s and stimulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) similarly to Wnt5a/FZD7 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing. Although Daple acts as a tumor suppressor in the healthy colon, the concurrent increased abundance of Daple and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in colorectal tumors was associated with poor patient prognosis. Thus, the Daple-dependent activation of G<sub>αi</sub> and the Daple-dependent enhancement of β-catenin–independent Wnt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>s are not only stimulated by Wnt5a/FZD7 to suppress tumorigenesis but also hijacked by growth factor–activated RTKs to enhance tumor progression. These findings identify a cross-talk paradigm among growth factor RTKs, heterotrimeric G proteins, and the Wnt/FZD pathway in cancer.</p>

The scaffolding protein Cnk binds to the receptor tyrosine kinase Alk to promote visceral founder cell specification in <i>Drosophila</i>
<p>In <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) anaplastic lymphoma kinase (Alk) and its ligand jelly belly (Jeb) are required to specify muscle founder cells in the visceral mesoderm. We identified a critical role for the scaffolding protein Cnk (connector enhancer of kinase suppressor of Ras) in this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathway. Embryos that ectopically expressed the minimal Alk interaction region in the carboxyl terminus of Cnk or lacked maternal and zygotic <i>cnk</i> did not generate visceral founder cells or a functional gut musculature, phenotypes that resemble those of <i>jeb</i> and <i>Alk</i> mutants. Deletion of the entire Alk-interacting region in the <i>cnk</i> locus affected the Alk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathway in the visceral mesoderm and not other RTK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathways in other tissues.

Alk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing stimulates the MAPK/ERK pathway, but the scaffolding protein Ksr, which facilitates activation of this pathway, was not required to promote visceral founder cell specification.

TGF-β receptor I/II trafficking and signaling at primary cilia are inhibited by ceramide to attenuate cell migration and tumor metastasis
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing by the transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) receptors I and II (TβRI/II) and the primary cilia-localized sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway promote cell migration and, consequently, tumor metastasis. In contrast, the sphingolipid ceramide inhibits cell proliferation and tumor metastasis. We investigated whether ceramide metabolism inhibited TβRI/II trafficking to primary cilia to attenuate cross-talk between TβRI/II and the Shh pathway. We found that ceramide synthase 4 (CerS4)–generated ceramide stabilized the association between TβRI and the inhibitory factor Smad7, which limited the trafficking of TβRI/II to primary cilia. Expression of a mutant TβRI that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>s but does not interact with Smad7 prevented the CerS4-mediated inhibition of migration in various cancer cells. Genetic deletion or knockdown of CerS4 prevented the formation of the Smad7-TβRI inhibitory complex and increased the association between TβRI and the transporter Arl6 through a previously unknown cilia-targeting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> (Ala<sup>31</sup>Thr<sup>32</sup>Ala<sup>33</sup>Leu<sup>34</sup>Gln<sup>35</sup>) in TβRI. Mutating the cilia-targeting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> abolished the trafficking of TβRI to the primary cilia. Localization of TβRI to primary cilia activated a key mediator of Shh <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing, Smoothened (Smo), which stimulated cellular migration and invasion. TβRI-Smo cross-talk at the cilia in CerS4-deficient 4T1 mammary cancer cells induced liver metastasis from orthotopic allografts in both wild-type and CerS4-deficient mice, which was prevented by overexpression of Smad7 or knockdown of intraflagellar transport protein 88 (IFT88). Overall, these data reveal a ceramide-dependent mechanism that suppresses cell migration and invasion by restricting TβRI/II-Shh <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing selectively at the plasma membrane of the primary cilium.</p>

In silico modeling identifies CD45 as a regulator of IL-2 synergy in the NKG2D-mediated activation of immature human NK cells
<p>Natural killer (NK) cells perform immunosurveillance of virally infected and transformed cells, and their activation depends on the balance between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing by inhibitory and activating receptors. Cytokine receptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing can synergize with activating receptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing to induce NK cell activation. We investigated the interplay between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathways stimulated by the cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2) and the activating receptor NKG2D in immature (CD56<sup>bright</sup>) and mature (CD56<sup>dim</sup>) subsets of human primary NK cells using mass cytometry experiments and in silico modeling. Our analysis revealed that IL-2 changed the abundances of several key proteins, including NKG2D and the phosphatase CD45. Furthermore, we found differences in correlations between protein abundances, which were associated with the maturation state of the NK cells. The mass cytometry measurements also revealed that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing kinetics of key protein abundances induced by NKG2D stimulation depended on the maturation state and the pretreatment condition of the NK cells. Our in silico model, which described the multidimensional data with coupled first-order reactions, predicted that the increase in CD45 abundance was a major enhancer of NKG2D-mediated activation in IL-2–treated CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells but not in IL-2–treated CD56<sup>dim</sup> NK cells. This dependence on CD45 was verified by measurement of CD107a mobilization to the NK cell surface (a marker of activation). Our mathematical framework can be used to glean mechanisms underlying synergistic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathways in other activated immune cells.</p>

PSMA redirects cell survival signaling from the MAPK to the PI3K-AKT pathways to promote the progression of prostate cancer
<p>Increased abundance of the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) on prostate epithelium is a hallmark of advanced metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) and correlates negatively with prognosis. However, direct evidence that PSMA functionally contributes to PCa progression remains elusive. We generated mice bearing PSMA-positive or PSMA-negative PCa by crossing PSMA-deficient mice with transgenic PCa (TRAMP) models, enabling direct assessment of PCa incidence and progression in the presence or absence of PSMA. Compared with PSMA-positive tumors, PSMA-negative tumors were smaller, lower-grade, and more apoptotic with fewer blood vessels, consistent with the recognized proangiogenic function of PSMA. Relative to PSMA-positive tumors, tumors lacking PSMA had less than half the abundance of type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R), less activity in the survival pathway mediated by PI3K-AKT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing, and more activity in the proliferative pathway mediated by MAPK-ERK1/2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing. Biochemically, PSMA interacted with the scaffolding protein RACK1, disrupting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing between the β<sub>1</sub> integrin and IGF-1R complex to the MAPK pathway, enabling activation of the AKT pathway instead. Manipulation of PSMA abundance in PCa cell lines recapitulated this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathway switch. Analysis of published databases indicated that IGF-1R abundance, cell proliferation, and expression of transcripts for antiapoptotic markers positively correlated with PSMA abundance in patients, suggesting that this switch may be relevant to human PCa. Our findings suggest that increase in PSMA in prostate tumors contributes to progression by altering normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> transduction pathways to drive PCa progression and that enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing through the IGF-1R/β<sub>1</sub> integrin axis may occur in other tumors.</p>

Although great progress has been made in the understanding of plant architecture regulation, the precise mechanism is still an urgent need to be revealed. Here, we report that over-expression of <i>OsMIR396d</i> in rice results in semidwarf and increased leaf angle, a typical phenotype of brassinosteroid (BR) enhanced mutant. OsmiR396d is involved in the interaction network of BR and gibberellin (GA) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing. In <i>OsMIR396d</i> over-expression plants, BR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing was enhanced. In contrast, both the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing and biosynthesis of GA were impaired. BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT1, a core transcription activator of BR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing, directly promoted the accumulation of OsmiR396d, which controlled BR response and GA biosynthesis by regulating the expression of different target genes respectively. <i>GROWTH REGULATING FACTOR 6</i>, one of OsmiR396d targets, participated in GA biosynthesis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> transduction but was not directly involved in BR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing. This study provides a new insight into the understanding of interaction between BR and GA from multiple levels on controlling plant architecture.</p>

DELLA1-Mediated Gibberellin Signaling Regulates Cytokinin-Dependent Symbiotic Nodulation
<p>In legume plants, low-nitrogen soils promote symbiotic interactions with rhizobial bacteria, leading to the formation of nitrogen-fixing root nodules. Among critical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>s regulating this developmental process are bacterial Nod Factors (NFs) and several plant hormones, including cytokinins (CKs) and gibberellins (GAs). Here, we show in <i>Medicago truncatula</i> that GA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing mediated by DELLA1 decreases the amount of bioactive CKs in roots and negatively impacts the Cytokinin Response1 (CRE1)-dependent NF activation of a subset of CK-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing genes as well as of the CK-regulated <i>Nodulation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing Pathway2</i> and <i>Ethylene Response Factor Required for Nodulation1</i> early nodulation genes. Consistently, a dominant-active DELLA1 protein can partially rescue the reduced nodulation of the <i>cre1</i> mutant and triggers the formation of nodule-like structures when expressed in the root cortex or in the root epidermis. This suggests a model where the DELLA1-mediated GA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing interplays with the CRE1-dependent CK pathway to regulate early nodulation in response to both NF and CK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>s critical for this symbiotic interaction.</p>

Shoot Removal Induces Chloroplast Development in Roots via Cytokinin Signaling
<p>The development of plant chloroplasts is regulated by various developmental, environmental, and hormonal cues. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), chloroplast development is repressed in roots via auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing. However, roots develop chloroplasts when they are detached from the shoot. In contrast to auxin, cytokinin positively affects chloroplast development in roots, but the role and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathway of cytokinin in the root greening response remain unclear. To understand the regulatory pathways of chloroplast development in the plant stress response, we examined the mechanisms underlying the conditional greening of detached roots. In wild-type Arabidopsis roots, shoot removal activates type B ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR (ARR)-mediated cytokinin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing and induces chlorophyll accumulation and photosynthetic remodeling. ARR1 and ARR12 are essential for up-regulating nucleus- and plastid-encoded genes associated with chloroplast development in detached roots. In this process, WOUND INDUCED DEDIFFERENTIATION1 and class B GATA transcription factors (B-GATAs) act upstream and downstream of ARRs, respectively. Overexpression of B-GATAs promotes root greening, as does shoot removal, dependent on a light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing transcription factor, LONG HYPOCOTYL5. Auxin represses the root greening response independent of ARR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing. <i>GNC-LIKE</i> (<i>GNL</i>), a B-GATA, is strongly up-regulated in detached roots via ARR1 and ARR12 but is repressed by auxin, so <i>GNL</i> may function at the point of convergence of cytokinin and auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing in the root greening response.</p>

The Transcription Factor MYB29 Is a Regulator of <i>ALTERNATIVE OXIDASE1a</i>
<p>Plants sense and integrate a variety of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>s from the environment through different interacting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> transduction pathways that involve hormones and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing molecules. Using <i>ALTERNATIVE OXIDASE1a</i> (<i>AOX1a</i>) gene expression as a model system of retrograde or stress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing between mitochondria and the nucleus, MYB DOMAIN PROTEIN29 (MYB29) was identified as a negative regulator (<i>regulator of alternative oxidase1a 7</i> [<i>rao7</i>] mutant) in a genetic screen of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). <i>rao7/myb29</i> mutants have increased levels of AOX1a transcript and protein compared to wild type after induction with antimycin A. A variety of genes previously associated with the mitochondrial stress response also display enhanced transcript abundance, indicating that RAO7/MYB29 negatively regulates mitochondrial stress responses in general. Meta-analysis of hormone-responsive marker genes and identification of downstream transcription factor networks revealed that MYB29 functions in the complex interplay of ethylene, jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, and reactive oxygen species <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing by regulating the expression of various ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR and WRKY transcription factors. Despite an enhanced induction of mitochondrial stress response genes, <i>rao7</i>/<i>myb29</i> mutants displayed an increased sensitivity to combined moderate light and drought stress. These results uncover interactions between mitochondrial retrograde <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing and the regulation of glucosinolate biosynthesis, both regulated by RAO7/MYB29. This common regulator can explain why perturbation of the mitochondrial function leads to transcriptomic responses overlapping with responses to biotic stress.</p>

Jasmonic Acid Enhances Al-Induced Root Growth Inhibition<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>Phytohormones such as ethylene and auxin are involved in the regulation of the aluminum (Al)-induced root growth inhibition. Although jasmonate (JA) has been reported to play a crucial role in the regulation of root growth and development in response to environmental stresses through interplay with ethylene and auxin, its role in the regulation of root growth response to Al stress is not yet known. In an attempt to elucidate the role of JA, we found that exogenous application of JA enhanced the Al-induced root growth inhibition. Furthermore, phenotype analysis with mutants defective in either JA biosynthesis or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing suggests that JA is involved in the regulation of Al-induced root growth inhibition. The expression of the JA receptor CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 (COI1) and the key JA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing regulator MYC2 was up-regulated in response to Al stress in the root tips. This process together with COI1-mediated Al-induced root growth inhibition under Al stress was controlled by ethylene but not auxin. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that many responsive genes under Al stress were regulated by JA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing. The differential responsive of microtubule organization-related genes between the wild-type and <i>coi1-2</i> mutant is consistent with the changed depolymerization of cortical microtubules in <i>coi1</i> under Al stress. In addition, ALMT-mediated malate exudation and thus Al exclusion from roots in response to Al stress was also regulated by COI1-mediated JA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing. Together, this study suggests that root growth inhibition is regulated by COI1-mediated JA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing independent from auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing and provides novel insights into the phytohormone-mediated root growth inhibition in response to Al stress.</p>

A DII Domain-Based Auxin Reporter Uncovers Low Auxin Signaling during Telophase and Early G1
<p>A sensitive and dynamically responsive auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing reporter based on the DII domain of the INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID28 (IAA28, DII) protein from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) was modified for use in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). The DII domain was fused to a yellow fluorescent protein and a nuclear localization sequence to simplify quantitative nuclear fluorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>. DII degradation dynamics provide an estimate of input <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> into the auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathway that is influenced by both auxin accumulation and F-box coreceptor concentration. In maize, the DII-based marker responded rapidly and in a dose-dependent manner to exogenous auxin via proteasome-mediated degradation. Low levels of DII-specific fluorescence corresponding to high endogenous auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing occurred near vasculature tissue and the outer layer and glume primordia of spikelet pair meristems and floral meristems, respectively. In addition, high DII levels were observed in cells during telophase and early G1, suggesting that low auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing at these stages may be important for cell cycle progression.</p>

High complexity of aquatic irradiance may have driven the evolution of four-dimensional colour vision in shallow-water fish
<p>Humans use three cone photoreceptor classes for colour vision, yet many birds, reptiles and shallow-water fish are tetrachromatic and use four cone classes. Screening pigments, which narrow the spectrum of photoreceptors in birds and diurnal reptiles, render visual systems with four cone classes more efficient. To date, however, the question of tetrachromacy in shallow-water fish that, like humans, lack screening pigments, is still unsolved. We raise the possibility that tetrachromacy in fish has evolved in response to higher spectral complexity of underwater light. We compared the dimensionality of colour vision in humans and fish by examining the spectral complexity of the colour <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> reflected from objects into their eyes. We show that fish require four to six cone classes to reconstruct the colour <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> of aquatic objects at the accuracy level achieved by humans viewing terrestrial objects. This is because environmental light, which alters the colour <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>s, is more complex and contains more spectral fluctuations underwater than on land. We further show that fish cones are better suited than human cones to detect these spectral fluctuations, suggesting that the capability of fish cones to detect high-frequency fluctuations in the colour <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> confers an advantage. Taken together, we propose that tetrachromacy in fish has evolved to enhance the reconstruction of complex colour <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>s in shallow aquatic environments. Of course, shallow-water fish might possess fewer than four cone classes; however, this would come with the inevitable loss in accuracy of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> reconstruction.</p>

Inhibition of Endothelial Notch Signaling Impairs Fatty Acid Transport and Leads to Metabolic and Vascular Remodeling of the Adult Heart
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Nutrients are transported through endothelial cells before being metabolized in muscle cells. However, little is known about the regulation of endothelial transport processes. Notch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing is a critical regulator of metabolism and angiogenesis during development. Here, we studied how genetic and pharmacological manipulation of endothelial Notch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing in adult mice affects endothelial fatty acid transport, cardiac angiogenesis, and heart function.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Endothelial-specific Notch inhibition was achieved by conditional genetic inactivation of Rbp-jκ in adult mice to analyze fatty acid metabolism and heart function. Wild-type mice were treated with neutralizing antibodies against the Notch ligand Delta-like 4. Fatty acid transport was studied in cultured endothelial cells and transgenic mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Treatment of wild-type mice with Delta-like 4 neutralizing antibodies for 8 weeks impaired fractional shortening and ejection fraction in the majority of mice. Inhibition of Notch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing specifically in the endothelium of adult mice by genetic ablation of Rbp-jκ caused heart hypertrophy and failure. Impaired heart function was preceded by alterations in fatty acid metabolism and an increase in cardiac blood vessel density. Endothelial Notch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing controlled the expression of endothelial lipase, Angptl4, CD36, and Fabp4, which are all needed for fatty acid transport across the vessel wall. In endothelial-specific Rbp-jκ–mutant mice, lipase activity and transendothelial transport of long-chain fatty acids to muscle cells were impaired. In turn, lipids accumulated in the plasma and liver. The attenuated supply of cardiomyocytes with long-chain fatty acids was accompanied by higher glucose uptake, increased concentration of glycolysis intermediates, and mTOR-S6K <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing.

Long-Term Biased β-Arrestin Signaling Improves Cardiac Structure and Function in Dilated Cardiomyopathy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Biased agonism of the angiotensin II receptor is known to promote cardiac contractility.

However, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing mechanisms remain unknown. Because a common finding in dilated cardiomyopathy is a reduction in the myofilament-Ca<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> response, we hypothesized that β-arrestin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing would increase myofilament-Ca<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> responsiveness in a model of familial dilated cardiomyopathy and improve cardiac function and morphology.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We treated a dilated cardiomyopathy–linked mouse model expressing a mutant tropomyosin (Tm-E54K) for 3 months with either TRV120067, a β-arrestin 2–biased ligand of the angiotensin II receptor, or losartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker. At the end of the treatment protocol, we assessed cardiac function using echocardiography, the myofilament-Ca<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> response of detergent-extracted fiber bundles, and used proteomic approaches to understand changes in posttranslational modifications of proteins that may explain functional changes.

Myofilaments of TRV120067-treated Tm-E54K mice had significantly improved myofilament-Ca<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> responsiveness, which was depressed in untreated Tm-E54K mice. We attributed these changes to increased MLC2v and MYPT1/2 phosphorylation seen only in TRV120067-treated mice. We found that the functional changes were attributable to an activation of ERK1/2-RSK3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing, mediated through β-arrestin, which may have a novel role in increasing MLC2v phosphorylation through a previously unrecognized interaction of β-arrestin localized to the sarcomere.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Long-term β-arrestin 2–biased agonism of the angiotensin II receptor may be a viable approach to the treatment of dilated cardiomyopathy by not only preventing maladaptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing, but also improving cardiac function by altering the myofilament-Ca<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> response via β-arrestin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathways.</p></sec>

ATP promotes the fast migration of dendritic cells through the activity of pannexin 1 channels and P2X<sub>7</sub> receptors
<p>Upon its release from injured cells, such as infected, transformed, inflamed, or necrotic cells, extracellular adenosine-5′-triphosphate (ATP) acts as a danger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> that recruits phagocytes, such as neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs), to the site of injury. The sensing of extracellular ATP occurs through purinergic (P2) receptors. We investigated the cellular mechanisms linking purinergic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing to DC motility. We found that ATP stimulated fast DC motility through an autocrine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing loop, which was initiated by the activation of P2X<sub>7</sub> receptors and further amplified by pannexin 1 (Panx1) channels. Upon stimulation of the P2X<sub>7</sub> receptor by ATP, Panx1 contributed to fast DC motility by increasing the permeability of the plasma membrane, which resulted in supplementary ATP release. In the absence of Panx1, DCs failed to increase their speed of migration in response to ATP, despite exhibiting a normal P2X<sub>7</sub> receptor–mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> response. In addition to DC migration, Panx1 channel– and P2X<sub>7</sub> receptor–dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing was further required to stimulate the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. In vivo, functional Panx1 channels were required for the homing of DCs to lymph nodes, although they were dispensable for DC maturation.

MAFB enhances oncogenic Notch signaling in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia
<p>Activating mutations in the gene encoding the cell-cell contact <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing protein Notch1 are common in human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALLs). However, expressing <i>Notch1</i> mutant alleles in mice fails to efficiently induce the development of leukemia. We performed a gain-of-function screen to identify proteins that enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing by leukemia-associated Notch1 mutants. The transcription factors MAFB and ETS2 emerged as candidates that individually enhanced Notch1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing, and when coexpressed, they synergistically increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing to an extent similar to that induced by core components of the Notch transcriptional complex. In mouse models of T-ALL, MAFB enhanced leukemogenesis by the naturally occurring Notch1 mutants, decreased disease latency, and increased disease penetrance. Decreasing MAFB abundance in mouse and human T-ALL cells reduced the expression of Notch1 target genes, including <i>MYC</i> and <i>HES1</i>, and sustained MAFB knockdown impaired T-ALL growth in a competitive setting. MAFB bound to ETS2 and interacted with the acetyltransferases PCAF and P300, highlighting its importance in recruiting coactivators that enhance Notch1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing. Together, these data identify a mechanism for enhancing the oncogenic potential of weak Notch1 mutants in leukemia models, and they reveal the MAFB-ETS2 transcriptional axis as a potential therapeutic target in T-ALL.</p>

Aberrant Rac1-cofilin signaling mediates defects in dendritic spines, synaptic function, and sensory perception in fragile X syndrome
<p>Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disabilities and a leading cause of autism. FXS is caused by a trinucleotide expansion in the gene <i>FMR1</i> on the X chromosome. The neuroanatomical hallmark of FXS is an overabundance of immature dendritic spines, a factor thought to underlie synaptic dysfunction and impaired cognition. We showed that aberrantly increased activity of the Rho GTPase Rac1 inhibited the actin-depolymerizing factor cofilin, a major determinant of dendritic spine structure, and caused disease-associated spine abnormalities in the somatosensory cortex of FXS model mice. Increased cofilin phosphorylation and actin polymerization coincided with abnormal dendritic spines and impaired synaptic maturation. Viral delivery of a constitutively active cofilin mutant (cofilinS3A) into the somatosensory cortex of <i>Fmr1</i>-deficient mice rescued the immature dendritic spine phenotype and increased spine density. Inhibition of the Rac1 effector PAK1 with a small-molecule inhibitor rescued cofilin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing in FXS mice, indicating a causal relationship between PAK1 and cofilin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing. PAK1 inhibition rescued synaptic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing (specifically the synaptic ratio of NMDA/AMPA in layer V pyramidal neurons) and improved sensory processing in FXS mice. These findings suggest a causal relationship between increased Rac1-cofilin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing, synaptic defects, and impaired sensory processing in FXS and uncover a previously unappreciated role for impaired Rac1-cofilin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing in the aberrant spine morphology and spine density associated with FXS.</p>

Tim-3 signaling in peripheral NK cells promotes maternal-fetal immune tolerance and alleviates pregnancy loss

We found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing by the type I membrane protein T cell immunoglobulin and mucin-containing protein 3 (Tim-3) in natural killer (NK) cells had an essential protective role during early pregnancy. Tim-3 on peripheral NK (pNK) cells was transiently increased in abundance during the first trimester of pregnancy, which depended on interleukin-4 (IL-4)–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) and progesterone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing. Tim-3<sup>+</sup> pNK cells displayed immunosuppressive activities, including the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines and the induction of regulatory T cells (T<sub>regs</sub>) in a transforming growth factor–β1 (TGF-β1)–dependent manner. Tim-3 on pNK cells was stimulated by its ligand galectin-9 (Gal-9), leading to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing by the kinases c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and AKT. In recurrent miscarriage (RM) patients, Tim-3 abundance on pNK cells was reduced and the immunosuppressive activity of Tim-3<sup>+</sup> pNK cells was impaired.

p53 dynamics in response to DNA damage vary across cell lines and are shaped by efficiency of DNA repair and activity of the kinase ATM
<p>Cellular systems show a wide range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing dynamics. Many of these dynamics are highly stereotyped, such as oscillations at a fixed frequency. However, most studies looking at the role of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing dynamics focus on one or a few cell lines, leaving the diversity of dynamics across tissues or cell lines a largely unexplored question. We focused on the dynamics of the tumor suppressor protein p53, which regulates cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to DNA damage. We established live-cell reporters for 12 cancer cell lines expressing wild-type p53 and quantified p53 dynamics in response to double-strand break–inducing DNA damage. In many of the tested cell lines, we found that p53 abundance oscillated in response to ionizing radiation or the DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic neocarzinostatin and that the periodicity of the oscillations was fixed. In other cell lines, p53 abundance dynamically changed in different ways, such as a single broad pulse or a continuous induction. By combining single-cell assays of p53 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing dynamics, small-molecule screening in live cells, and mathematical modeling, we identified molecules that perturbed p53 dynamics and determined that cell-specific variation in the efficiency of DNA repair and the activity of the kinase ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) controlled the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing landscape of p53 dynamics. Because the dynamics of wild-type p53 varied substantially between cell lines, our study highlights the limitation of using one line as a model system and emphasizes the importance of studying the dynamics of other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathways across different cell lines and genetic backgrounds.</p>

From oncogenic mutation to dynamic code
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> transduction pathways (STPs) convert biochemical reactions into precise and reproducible biological outcomes. These functions are performed reliably and reproducibly against a background of noise (variation) arising from the stochastic nature of biochemical reactions (<i>1</i>). Indeed, information theory analysis of STPs indicates that they have a limited capacity to discriminate information, including different ligands or different activation states of components (<i>2</i>). However, this discrimination is dramatically enhanced by adding dynamic information, such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> rise time, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> duration, amplitude, and decay rate (<i>3</i>). The observation that differential activation dynamics of the extracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway can determine whether rat pheochromocytoma cells proliferate or differentiate was reported more than 20 years ago (<i>4</i>), and evidence has since accumulated that STP dynamics control cell fate decisions. However, we are still struggling to understand how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing dynamics is encoded and decoded and how pathological changes, such as the expression of mutant proteins, affect the dynamic STP code. On page 892 of this issue, Bugaj <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) make use of new tools with which to decipher this code and reveal how certain cancer-associated BRAF mutations can corrupt the dynamic STP code and trick cells into unlicensed proliferation.</p>

Programming self-organizing multicellular structures with synthetic cell-cell signaling
<p>A common theme in the self-organization of multicellular tissues is the use of cell-cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing networks to induce morphological changes. We used the modular synNotch juxtacrine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing platform to engineer artificial genetic programs in which specific cell-cell contacts induced changes in cadherin cell adhesion. Despite their simplicity, these minimal intercellular programs were sufficient to yield assemblies with hallmarks of natural developmental systems: robust self-organization into multidomain structures, well-choreographed sequential assembly, cell type divergence, symmetry breaking, and the capacity for regeneration upon injury. The ability of these networks to drive complex structure formation illustrates the power of interlinking cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing with cell sorting: <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>-induced spatial reorganization alters the local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>s received by each cell, resulting in iterative cycles of cell fate branching. These results provide insights into the evolution of multicellularity and demonstrate the potential to engineer customized self-organizing tissues or materials.</p>

Structure of a prehandover mammalian ribosomal SRP·SRP receptor targeting complex
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> recognition particle (SRP) targets proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). SRP recognizes the ribosome synthesizing a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> sequence and delivers it to the SRP receptor (SR) on the ER membrane followed by the transfer of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> sequence to the translocon. Here, we present the cryo–electron microscopy structure of the mammalian translating ribosome in complex with SRP and SR in a conformation preceding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> sequence handover. The structure visualizes all eukaryotic-specific SRP and SR proteins and reveals their roles in stabilizing this conformation by forming a large protein assembly at the distal site of SRP RNA. We provide biochemical evidence that the guanosine triphosphate hydrolysis of SRP·SR is delayed at this stage, possibly to provide a time window for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> sequence handover to the translocon.</p>

A Mobile Auxin Signal Connects Temperature Sensing in Cotyledons with Growth Responses in Hypocotyls
<p>Plants have a remarkable capacity to adjust their growth and development to elevated ambient temperatures. Increased elongation growth of roots, hypocotyls, and petioles in warm temperatures are hallmarks of seedling thermomorphogenesis. In the last decade, significant progress has been made to identify the molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing components regulating these growth responses. Increased ambient temperature utilizes diverse components of the light sensing and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> transduction network to trigger growth adjustments. However, it remains unknown whether temperature sensing and responses are universal processes that occur uniformly in all plant organs. Alternatively, temperature sensing may be confined to specific tissues or organs, which would require a systemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong> that mediates responses in distal parts of the plant. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings show organ-specific transcriptome responses to elevated temperatures and that thermomorphogenesis involves both autonomous and organ-interdependent temperature sensing and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing. Seedling roots can sense and respond to temperature in a shoot-independent manner, whereas shoot temperature responses require both local and systemic processes. The induction of cell elongation in hypocotyls requires temperature sensing in cotyledons, followed by the generation of a mobile auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>. Subsequently, auxin travels to the hypocotyl, where it triggers local brassinosteroid-induced cell elongation in seedling stems, which depends upon a distinct, permissive temperature sensor in the hypocotyl.</p>

Modulation of Auxin Signaling and Development by Polyadenylation Machinery
<p>Polyadenylation influences gene expression by affecting mRNA stability, transport, and translatability. Here, we report that Cleavage stimulation Factor 77 (AtCstF77), a component of the pre-mRNA 3′-end polyadenylation machinery, affects polyadenylation site (PAS) selection in transcripts of some auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing genes in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Disruption of <i>AtCstF77</i> reduced auxin sensitivity and decreased the expression of the auxin reporter <i>DR5</i>-<i>GFP</i>. Null mutations of <i>cstf77</i> caused severe developmental defects, but were not lethal as previously reported. <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> genetically interacted with <i>transport inhibitor response 1 auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing f</i>-<i>box 2</i> auxin receptor double mutants, further supporting that polyadenylation affects auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing. <i>AtCstF77</i> was ubiquitously expressed in embryos, seedlings, and adult plants. The AtCstF77 protein was localized in the nucleus, which is consistent with its function in pre-mRNA processing. We observed that PASs in transcripts from approximately 2,400 genes were shifted in the <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> mutant. Moreover, most of the PAS shifts were from proximal to distal sites. Auxin treatment also caused PAS shifts in transcripts from a small number of genes. Several auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing or homeostasis genes had different PASs in their transcripts in the <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> mutant. The expression levels of <i>AUXIN RESISTANT 2</i>/<i>INDOLE</i>-<i>3</i>-<i>ACETIC ACID 7</i> were significantly increased in the <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> mutant, which can partially account for the auxin resistance phenotype of this mutant. Our results demonstrate that AtCstF77 plays pleiotropic and critical roles in Arabidopsis development. Moreover, disruption of AtCstF64, another component of the polyadenylation machinery, led to developmental defects and reduced auxin response, similar to those of the <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> mutant. We conclude that AtCstF77 affects auxin responses, likely by controlling PAS selection of transcripts of some auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing components.</p>

Network Analysis Reveals a Role for Salicylic Acid Pathway Components in Shade Avoidance
<p>Plants have sophisticated mechanisms for sensing neighbor shade. To maximize their ability to compete for light, plants respond to shade through enhanced elongation and physiological changes. The shade avoidance response affects many different organs and growth stages, yet the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathways underlying this response have mostly been studied in seedlings. We assayed transcriptome changes in response to shade across a 2-d time course in the wild type and 12 Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants. The resulting temporal map of transcriptional responses to shade defines early and late responses in adult plants, enabling us to determine connections between key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing genes and downstream responses. We found a pervasive and unexpectedly strong connection between shade avoidance and genes related to salicylic acid, suggesting salicylic acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing to be an important shade avoidance growth regulator. We tested this connection and found that several mutants disrupting salicylic acid levels or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing were defective in shade avoidance. The effect of these mutations on shade avoidance was specific to petiole elongation; neither hypocotyl nor flowering time responses were altered, thereby defining important stage-specific differences in the downstream shade avoidance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">signal</span></strong>ing pathway. Shade treatment did not change salicylic acid levels, indicating that the mediation of shade avoidance by salicylic acid is not dependent on the modulation of salicylic acid levels. These results demonstrate that salicylic acid pathway genes also are key components of petiole shade avoidance.</p>

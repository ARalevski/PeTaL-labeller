A Model of Leaf Coordination to Scale-Up Leaf Expansion from the Organ to the Canopy
<p>Process-based crop growth models are popular tools with which to analyze and understand the impact of crop management, genotype-by-environment interactions, or climate change. The ability to predict leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> development is critical to predict crop growth, particularly under conditions of limited resources. Here, we aimed at deciphering growth coordination rules between wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) plant organs (i.e. between leaves within a stem, between laminae and sheaths, and between the mainstem and axillary tillers) to model the dynamics of canopy development. We found a unique relationship between laminae <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> and leaf rank for the mainstem and its tillers, which was robust across a range of sowing dates and plant densities. Robust relationships between laminae and sheath <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong>s also were found, highlighting the tight control of organ growth within and between phytomers. These relationships identified at the phytomer scale were used to develop a simulation model of leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> dynamics at the canopy level that was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ated in the wheat model SiriusQuality. The model was then evaluated using several independent experiments. The model accurately predicts leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> dynamics under different scenarios of nitrogen and water limitations. It accounted for 85%, 64%, and 73% of the variability of the surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> of leaf cohorts, total leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> index, and total green <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> index, respectively. The process-based model of the dynamics of leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> described here is a key element to quantify the value of candidate traits for use in plant breeding and to project the impact of climate change on wheat growth.</p>

Structures of the CRISPR genome integration complex
<p>CRISPR-Cas systems depend on the Cas1-Cas2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ase to capture and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ate short foreign DNA fragments into the CRISPR locus, enabling adaptation to new viruses. We present crystal structures of Cas1-Cas2 bound to both donor and target DNA in intermediate and product <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ation complexes, as well as a cryo–electron microscopy structure of the full CRISPR locus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ation complex, including the accessory protein IHF (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ation host factor). The structures show unexpectedly that indirect sequence recognition dictates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ation site selection by favoring deformation of the repeat and the flanking sequences. IHF binding bends the DNA sharply, bringing an upstream recognition motif into contact with Cas1 to increase both the specificity and efficiency of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ation. These results explain how the Cas1-Cas2 CRISPR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ase recognizes a sequence-dependent DNA structure to ensure site-selective CRISPR array expansion during the initial step of bacterial adaptive immunity.</p>

Low–interfacial toughness materials for effective large-scale deicing
<p>Ice accretion has adverse effects on a range of commercial and residential activities. The force required to remove ice from a surface is typically considered to scale with the iced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong>. This imparts a scalability limit to the use of icephobic coatings for structures with large surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong>s, such as power lines or ship hulls. We describe a class of materials that exhibit a low interfacial toughness with ice, resulting in systems for which the forces required to remove large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong>s of ice (a few square centimeters or greater) are both low and independent of the iced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong>. We further demonstrate that coatings made of such materials allow ice to be shed readily from large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong>s (~1 square meter) merely by self-weight.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Identification of Putative Substrates of SEC2, a Chloroplast Inner Envelope Translocase
<p>Most chloroplast proteins are synthesized in the cytosol and imported into chloroplasts. Many imported proteins are further targeted to the thylakoid membrane and lumen by the SEC1, TAT, or SRP/ALB3 translocases. Others are targeted to the inner chloroplast envelope membrane by undescribed translocases. Recently, a second SEC system (SEC2) consisting of SCY2, SECE2, and SECA2 was found in the chloroplast envelope. Null mutants of <i>SCY2</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) exhibit a severe embryo-lethal phenotype. To investigate the function of the SEC2 system in plants, we used inducible RNA interference to knock down <i>SCY2</i> in Arabidopsis. Seedlings cultured with inducer were chlorotic with aberrant chloroplasts and undeveloped thylakoids, indicating an essential role for SCY2 in chloroplast biogenesis beyond embryo development. In <i>SCY2</i> down-regulated seedlings, several thylakoid membrane proteins, including SCY1, ALB3, and TATC, and inner envelope membrane proteins, including TIC40, TIC110, and FTSH12, were reduced substantially, suggesting that they may be SEC2 substrates. Additional insight was achieved by the in vitro reconstitution of protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ation into chloroplast membranes. The results show that SCY1 and ALB3 target directly to the thylakoid membrane and are likely independent of SEC2. FTSH12 was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ated into the envelope membrane in a coupled import-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ation reaction that was impaired by the SECA inhibitor sodium azide. The stromal intermediate of TIC40 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ated into the envelope in a reaction that was largely inhibited when antibodies against epitope-tagged SCY2 or SECE2 were applied. These data demonstrate that the SEC2 translocase likely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ates a subset of inner envelope membrane proteins, such as FTSH12 and TIC40.</p>

Size-dependent enhancement of water relations during post-fire resprouting
<p>In resprouting species, fire-induced topkill causes a reduction in height and leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> without a comparable reduction in the size of the root system, which should lead to an increase in the efficiency of water transport after fire. However, large plants undergo a greater relative reduction in size, compared with small plants, so we hypothesized that this enhancement in hydraulic efficiency would be greatest among large growth forms. In the ecotone between long-leaf pine (<i>Pinus palustris</i> Mill.) savannas and wetlands, we measured stomatal conductance (<i>g</i><sub>s</sub>), mid-day leaf water potential (<i>Ψ</i><sub>leaf</sub>), leaf-specific whole-plant hydraulic conductance (<i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub>), leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> and height of 10 species covering a range of growth forms in burned and unburned sites. As predicted, <i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub> was higher in post-fire resprouts than in unburned plants, and the post-fire increase in <i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub> was positively related to plant size. Specifically, large-statured species tended to undergo the greatest relative reductions in leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> and height, and correspondingly experienced the greatest increases in <i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub>. The post-fire increase in <i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub> was smaller than expected, however, due to a decrease in absolute root hydraulic conductance (i.e., not scaled to leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong>). The higher <i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub> in burned sites was manifested as an increase in <i>g</i><sub>s</sub> rather than an increase in <i>Ψ</i><sub>leaf</sub>. Post-fire increases in <i>g</i><sub>s</sub> should promote high rates of photosynthesis for recovery of carbohydrate reserves and aboveground biomass, which is particularly important for large-statured species that require more time to recover their pre-fire size.</p>

The uncertain future of protected lands and waters
<p>Protected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong>s are intended to safeguard biodiversity in perpetuity, yet evidence suggests that widespread legal changes undermine protected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> durability and efficacy. We documented these legal changes—protected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> downgrading, downsizing, and degazettement (PADDD) events—in the United States and Amazonian countries and compiled available data globally. Governments of the United States and Amazonian countries enacted 269 and 440 PADDD events, respectively. Between 1892 and 2018, 73 countries enacted 3749 PADDD events, removing 519,857 square kilometers from protection and tempering regulations in an additional 1,659,972 square kilometers; 78% of events were enacted since 2000. Most PADDD events (62%) are associated with industrial-scale resource extraction and development, suggesting that PADDD may compromise biodiversity conservation objectives. Strategic policy responses are needed to address PADDD and sustain effective protected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong>s.</p>

Inverse-designed metastructures that solve equations
<p>Metastructures hold the potential to bring a new twist to the field of spatial-domain optical analog computing: migrating from free-space and bulky systems into conceptually wavelength-sized elements. We introduce a metamaterial platform capable of solving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>al equations using monochromatic electromagnetic fields. For an arbitrary wave as the input function to an equation associated with a prescribed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>al operator, the solution of such an equation is generated as a complex-valued output electromagnetic field. Our approach is experimentally demonstrated at microwave frequencies through solving a generic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>al equation and using a set of waveguides as the input and output to the designed metastructures. By exploiting subwavelength-scale light-matter interactions in a metamaterial platform, our wave-based, material-based analog computer may provide a route to achieve chip-scale, fast, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>able computing elements.</p>

Elevated trawling inside protected areas undermines conservation outcomes in a global fishing hot spot
<p>Marine protected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong>s (MPAs) are increasingly used as a primary tool to conserve biodiversity. This is particularly relevant in heavily exploited fisheries hot spots such as Europe, where MPAs now cover 29% of territorial waters, with unknown effects on fishing pressure and conservation outcomes. We investigated industrial trawl fishing and sensitive indicator species in and around 727 MPAs designated by the European Union. We found that 59% of MPAs are commercially trawled, and average trawling intensity across MPAs is at least 1.4-fold higher as compared with nonprotected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong>s. Abundance of sensitive species (sharks, rays, and skates) decreased by 69% in heavily trawled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong>s. The widespread industrial exploitation of MPAs undermines global biodiversity conservation targets, elevating recent concerns about growing human pressures on protected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong>s worldwide.</p>

One-third of global protected land is under intense human pressure
<p>In an era of massive biodiversity loss, the greatest conservation success story has been the growth of protected land globally. Protected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong>s are the primary defense against biodiversity loss, but extensive human activity within their boundaries can undermine this. Using the most comprehensive global map of human pressure, we show that 6 million square kilometers (32.8%) of protected land is under intense human pressure. For protected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong>s designated before the Convention on Biological Diversity was ratified in 1992, 55% have since experienced human pressure increases. These increases were lowest in large, strict protected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong>s, showing that they are potentially effective, at least in some nations. Transparent reporting on human pressure within protected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong>s is now critical, as are global targets aimed at efforts required to halt biodiversity loss.</p>

Noise pollution is pervasive in U.S. protected areas
<p>Anthropogenic noise threatens ecological systems, including the cultural and biodiversity resources in protected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong>s. Using continental-scale sound models, we found that anthropogenic noise doubled background sound levels in 63% of U.S. protected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> units and caused a 10-fold or greater increase in 21%, surpassing levels known to interfere with human visitor experience and disrupt wildlife behavior, fitness, and community composition. Elevated noise was also found in critical habitats of endangered species, with 14% experiencing a 10-fold increase in sound levels. However, protected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong>s with more stringent regulations had less anthropogenic noise. Our analysis indicates that noise pollution in protected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong>s is closely linked with transportation, development, and extractive land use, providing insight into where mitigation efforts can be most effective.</p>

A global map of roadless areas and their conservation status

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Diffusion of CO<sub>2</sub> across the Mesophyll-Bundle Sheath Cell Interface in a C<sub>4</sub> Plant with Genetically Reduced PEP Carboxylase Activity
<p>Phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), localized to the cytosol of the mesophyll cell, catalyzes the first carboxylation step of the C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic pathway. Here, we used RNA interference to target the cytosolic photosynthetic PEPC isoform in <i>Setaria viridis</i> and isolated independent transformants with very low PEPC activities. These plants required high ambient CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations for growth, consistent with the essential role of PEPC in C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. The combination of estimating direct CO<sub>2</sub> fixation by the bundle sheath using gas-exchange measurements and modeling C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis with low PEPC activity allowed the calculation of bundle sheath conductance to CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion (<i>g<sub>bs</sub></i>) in the progeny of these plants. Measurements made at a range of temperatures suggested no or negligible effect of temperature on <i>g<sub>bs</sub></i> depending on the technique used to calculate <i>g<sub>bs</sub></i>. Anatomical measurements revealed that plants with reduced PEPC activity had reduced cell wall thickness and increased plasmodesmata (PD) density at the mesophyll-bundle sheath (M-BS) cell interface, whereas we observed little difference in these parameters at the mesophyll-mesophyll cell interface. The increased PD density at the M-BS interface was largely driven by an increase in the number of PD pit fields (cluster of PDs) rather than an increase in PD per pit field or the size of pit fields. The correlation of <i>g<sub>bs</sub></i> with bundle sheath surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> per leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> and PD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> per M-BS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> showed that these parameters and cell wall thickness are important determinants of <i>g<sub>bs</sub></i>. It is intriguing to speculate that PD development is responsive to changes in C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic flux.</p>

Hemodynamic and Echocardiographic Comparison of the Lotus and CoreValve Transcatheter Aortic Valves in Patients With High and Extreme Surgical Risk
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Comparative echocardiographic data on transcatheter aortic valve replacement systems from randomized trials are limited. The REPRISE III trial (Repositionable Percutaneous Replacement of Stenotic Aortic Valve through Implantation of Lotus Valve System – Randomized Clinical Evaluation) is a multicenter, randomized comparison of a mechanically expanded (Lotus) versus self-expanding (CoreValve) transcatheter aortic valve replacement device. This analysis rigorously assesses Doppler-derived valve hemodynamics and the impact on outcomes at 1 year in patients with extreme/high surgical risk treated with Lotus and CoreValve from REPRISE III.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>REPRISE III includes patients with extreme- and high-risk aortic stenosis. Patients were enrolled at 55 centers. All transthoracic echocardiograms with Doppler were obtained following a standard protocol up to 12 months postimplant and analyzed by a core laboratory. Valve size, mean gradient, aortic valve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong>, and Doppler velocity index and their impact on clinical outcomes are reported. Additional parameters including paravalvular leak were evaluated using a multiparametric approach.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 912 patients were randomly assigned (2:1 ratio; 607 Lotus:305 CoreValve). Median age was 84 years, 51% of the patients were women, and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons score was 6.8±4.1. CoreValve demonstrated lower gradients and larger aortic valve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> and Doppler velocity index than Lotus at discharge; the difference decreased in subsequent follow-up up to a year (all <i>P</i><0.01). Lotus had lower rates of paravalvular leak that persisted over time (<i>P</i><0.05). Similar outcomes were seen when comparing each valve type by size group (small, medium, large). The hemodynamic differences between valves did not translate into worse clinical outcomes. All-cause mortality was not different between the 2 groups in any of the 3 valve sizes. When comparing patients with normal valve gradients (<20 mm Hg, n=780) with those with abnormal gradients (>20 mm Hg, n=48) in the entire patient population, all-cause mortality was not different. This was also not significant when evaluating each valve type separately. Similarly, there were no differences for aortic valve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> >1.1 cm<sup>2</sup> or <1.1 cm<sup>2</sup> and for Doppler velocity index >0.35 or <0.35 (all <i>P</i>=not significant).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Lotus had significantly greater freedom from moderate or severe paravalvular leak and smaller valve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> and higher gradients than CoreValve.

Study Comparing Vein Integrity and Clinical Outcomes in Open Vein Harvesting and 2 Types of Endoscopic Vein Harvesting for Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Current consensus statements maintain that endoscopic vein harvesting (EVH) should be standard care in coronary artery bypass graft surgery, but vein quality and clinical outcomes have been questioned. The VICO trial (Vein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ity and Clinical Outcomes) was designed to assess the impact of different vein harvesting methods on vessel damage and whether this contributes to clinical outcomes after coronary artery bypass grafting.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In this single-center, randomized clinical trial, patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with an internal mammary artery and with 1 to 4 vein grafts were recruited. All veins were harvested by a single experienced practitioner. We randomly allocated 300 patients into closed tunnel CO<sub>2</sub> EVH (n=100), open tunnel CO<sub>2</sub> EVH (n=100), and traditional open vein harvesting (n=100) groups. The primary end point was endothelial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ity and muscular damage of the harvested vein. Secondary end points included clinical outcomes (major adverse cardiac events), use of healthcare resources, and impact on health status (quality-adjusted life-years).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The open vein harvesting group demonstrated marginally better endothelial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ity in random samples (85% versus 88% versus 93% for closed tunnel EVH, open tunnel EVH, and open vein harvesting; <i>P</i><0.001). Closed tunnel EVH displayed the lowest longitudinal hypertrophy (1% versus 13.5% versus 3%; <i>P</i>=0.001). However, no differences in endothelial stretching were observed between groups (37% versus 37% versus 31%; <i>P</i>=0.62). Secondary clinical outcomes demonstrated no significant differences in composite major adverse cardiac event scores at each time point up to 48 months. The quality-adjusted life-year gain per patient was 0.11 (<i>P</i><0.001) for closed tunnel EVH and 0.07 (<i>P</i>=0.003) for open tunnel EVH compared with open vein harvesting. The likelihood of being cost-effective, at a predefined threshold of £20 000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, was 75% for closed tunnel EVH, 19% for open tunnel EVH, and 6% for open vein harvesting.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our study demonstrates that harvesting techniques affect the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ity of different vein layers, albeit only slightly. Secondary outcomes suggest that histological findings do not directly contribute to major adverse cardiac event outcomes.

Impact of Practice-Based Management of Pulmonary Artery Pressures in 2000 Patients Implanted With the CardioMEMS Sensor
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Elevated pulmonary artery (PA) pressures in patients with heart failure are associated with a high risk for hospitalization and mortality. Recent clinical trial evidence demonstrated a direct relationship between lowering remotely monitored PA pressures and heart failure hospitalization risk reduction with a novel implantable PA pressure monitoring system (CardioMEMS HF System, St. Jude Medical). This study examines PA pressure changes in the first 2000 US patients implanted in general practice use.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Deidentified data from the remote monitoring Merlin.net (St. Jude Medical) database were used to examine PA pressure trends from the first consecutive 2000 patients with at least 6 months of follow-up. Changes in PA pressures were evaluated with an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> under the curve methodology to estimate the total sum increase or decrease in pressures (mm Hg-day) during the follow-up period relative to the baseline pressure. As a reference, the PA pressure trends were compared with the historic CHAMPION clinical trial (CardioMEMS Heart Sensor Allows Monitoring of Pressure to Improve Outcomes in New York Heart Association [NYHA] Functional Class III Heart Failure Patients). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> under the curve results are presented as mean±2 SE, and <i>P</i> values comparing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> under the curve of the general-use cohort with outcomes in the CHAMPION trial were computed by the <i>t</i> test with equal variance.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Patients were on average 70±12 years old; 60% were male; 34% had preserved ejection fraction; and patients were followed up for an average of 333±125 days.

Gene Expression Profiling for the Identification and Classification of Antibody-Mediated Heart Rejection
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) contributes to heart allograft loss. However, an important knowledge gap remains in terms of the pathophysiology of AMR and how detection of immune activity, injury degree, and stage could be improved by intragraft gene expression profiling.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We prospectively monitored 617 heart transplant recipients referred from 4 French transplant centers (January 1, 2006–January 1, 2011) for AMR. We compared patients with AMR (n=55) with a matched control group of 55 patients without AMR. We characterized all patients using histopathology (ISHLT [International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation] 2013 grades), immunostaining, and circulating anti-HLA donor-specific antibodies at the time of biopsy, together with systematic gene expression assessments of the allograft tissue, using microarrays. Effector cells were evaluated with in vitro human cell cultures. We studied a validation cohort of 98 heart recipients transplanted in Edmonton, AB, Canada, including 27 cases of AMR and 71 controls.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 240 heart transplant endomyocardial biopsies were assessed. AMR showed a distinct pattern of injury characterized by endothelial activation with microcirculatory inflammation by monocytes/macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells. We also observed selective changes in endothelial/angiogenesis and NK cell transcripts, including CD16A signaling and interferon-γ–inducible genes. The AMR-selective gene sets accurately discriminated patients with AMR from those without and included NK transcripts (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> under the curve=0.87), endothelial activation transcripts (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> under the curve=0.80), macrophage transcripts (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> under the curve=0.86), and interferon-γ transcripts (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> under the curve=0.84; <i>P</i><0.0001 for all comparisons). These 4 gene sets showed increased expression with increasing pathological AMR (pAMR) International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation grade (<i>P</i><0.001) and association with donor-specific antibody levels. The unsupervised principal components analysis demonstrated a high proportion of molecularly inactive pAMR1(I+), and there was significant molecular overlap between pAMR1(H<sup>+</sup>) and full-blown pAMR2/3 cases. Endothelial activation transcripts, interferon-γ, and NK transcripts showed association with chronic allograft vasculopathy. The molecular architecture and selective AMR transcripts, together with gene set discrimination capacity for AMR identified in the discovery set, were reproduced in the validation cohort.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Tissue-based measurements of specific pathogenesis-based transcripts reflecting NK burden, endothelial activation, macrophage burden, and interferon-γ effects accurately classify AMR and correlate with degree of injury and disease activity.

Tree Physiology
Nitrogen uptake over entire root systems of tree seedlings
<p>Uptake of nitrogen (N) by sequential root regions in six tree species was measured in roots of 16- to 26-month-old seedlings at 50 and 1500 µM NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> concentration, at the cell level using oscillating microelectrodes and at the root region level using enriched <sup>15</sup>N application. Our objective was to determine the root regions making the greatest contribution to total N uptake in each species as measured by the two contrasting techniques. White and condensed tannin zones were the regions with the smallest surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> in all species, but these zones often had the highest net flux of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>. For most species, little variation was found among root regions in N flux calculated using a <sup>15</sup>N mass balance approach, but where significant differences existed, high N flux was observed in white, cork or woody zones. When N fluxes measured by each of the two methods were multiplied by the estimated surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> or biomass of each root region, the effect of root region size had the greatest influence on regional N uptake. Root regions of greatest overall N uptake were the cork and woody zones, on average. Total N uptake may thus be greatest in older regions of tree seedling roots, despite low rates of uptake per unit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong>.</p>

Revisiting the sequencing of the first tree genome: <i>Populus trichocarpa</i>
<p>Ten years ago, it was announced that the Joint Genome Institute with funds provided by the Department of Energy, Office of Science, Biological and Environmental Research would sequence the black cottonwood (<i>Populus trichocarpa</i> Torr. & Gray) genome. This landmark decision was the culmination of work by the forest science community to develop <i>Populus</i> as a model system. Since its public release in late 2006, the availability of the <i>Populus</i> genome has spawned research in plant biology, morphology, genetics and ecology. Here we address how the tree physiologist has used this resource. More specifically, we revisit our earlier contention that the rewards of sequencing the <i>Populus</i> genome would depend on how quickly scientists working with woody perennials could adopt molecular approaches to investigate the mechanistic underpinnings of basic physiological processes. Several examples illustrate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ation of functional and comparative genomics into the forest sciences, especially in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong>s that target improved understanding of the developmental differences between woody perennials and herbaceous annuals (e.g., phase transitions). Sequencing the <i>Populus</i> genome and the availability of genetic and genomic resources has also been instrumental in identifying candidate genes that underlie physiological and morphological traits of interest. Genome-enabled research has advanced our understanding of how phenotype and genotype are related and provided insights into the genetic mechanisms whereby woody perennials adapt to environmental stress. In the future, we anticipate that low-cost, high-throughput sequencing will continue to facilitate research in tree physiology and enhance our understanding at scales of individual organisms and populations. A challenge remains, however, as to how genomic resources, including the <i>Populus</i> genome, can be used to understand ecosystem function. Although examples are limited, progress in this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> is encouraging and will undoubtedly improve as future research targets the many unique aspects of <i>Populus</i> as a keystone species in terrestrial ecosystems.</p>

Integration of protein phosphorylation, acetylation, and methylation data sets to outline lung cancer signaling networks
<p>Protein posttranslational modifications (PTMs) have typically been studied independently, yet many proteins are modified by more than one PTM type, and cell signaling pathways somehow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ate this information. We coupled immunoprecipitation using PTM-specific antibodies with tandem mass tag (TMT) mass spectrometry to simultaneously examine phosphorylation, methylation, and acetylation in 45 lung cancer cell lines compared to normal lung tissue and to cell lines treated with anticancer drugs. This simultaneous, large-scale, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ative analysis of these PTMs using a cluster-filtered network (CFN) approach revealed that cell signaling pathways were outlined by clustering patterns in PTMs. We used the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) method to identify PTM clusters and then <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ated each with known protein-protein interactions (PPIs) to elucidate functional cell signaling pathways. The CFN identified known and previously unknown cell signaling pathways in lung cancer cells that were not present in normal lung epithelial tissue. In various proteins modified by more than one type of PTM, the incidence of those PTMs exhibited inverse relationships, suggesting that molecular exclusive “OR” gates determine a large number of signal transduction events. We also showed that the acetyltransferase EP300 appears to be a hub in the network of pathways involving different PTMs. In addition, the data shed light on the mechanism of action of geldanamycin, an HSP90 inhibitor. Together, the findings reveal that cell signaling pathways mediated by acetylation, methylation, and phosphorylation regulate the cytoskeleton, membrane traffic, and RNA binding protein–mediated control of gene expression.</p>

Large-area graphene-nanomesh/carbon-nanotube hybrid membranes for ionic and molecular nanofiltration
<p>Nanoporous two-dimensional materials are attractive for ionic and molecular nanofiltration but limited by insufficient mechanical strength over large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong>s. We report a large-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> graphene-nanomesh/single-walled carbon nanotube (GNM/SWNT) hybrid membrane with excellent mechanical strength while fully capturing the merit of atomically thin membranes. The monolayer GNM features high-density, subnanometer pores for efficient transport of water molecules while blocking solute ions or molecules to enable size-selective separation. The SWNT network physically separates the GNM into microsized islands and acts as the microscopic framework to support the GNM, thus ensuring the structural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ity of the atomically thin GNM. The resulting GNM/SWNT membranes show high water permeance and a high rejection ratio for salt ions or organic molecules, and they retain stable separation performance in tubular modules.</p>

Cross-boundary human impacts compromise the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem
<p>Protected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong>s provide major benefits for humans in the form of ecosystem services, but landscape degradation by human activity at their edges may compromise their ecological functioning. Using multiple lines of evidence from 40 years of research in the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem, we find that such edge degradation has effectively “squeezed” wildlife into the core protected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> and has altered the ecosystem’s dynamics even within this 40,000-square-kilometer ecosystem. This spatial cascade reduced resilience in the core and was mediated by the movement of grazers, which reduced grass fuel and fires, weakened the capacity of soils to sequester nutrients and carbon, and decreased the responsiveness of primary production to rainfall. Similar effects in other protected ecosystems worldwide may require rethinking of natural resource management outside protected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong>s.</p>

Using neuroscience to develop artificial intelligence
<p>When the mathematician Alan Turing posed the question “Can machines think?” in the first line of his seminal 1950 paper that ushered in the quest for artificial intelligence (AI) (<i>1</i>), the only known systems carrying out complex computations were biological nervous systems. It is not surprising, therefore, that scientists in the nascent field of AI turned to brain circuits as a source for guidance. One path that was taken since the early attempts to perform intelligent computation by brain-like circuits (<i>2</i>), and which led recently to remarkable successes, can be described as a highly reductionist approach to model cortical circuitry. In its basic current form, known as a “deep network” (or deep net) architecture, this brain-inspired model is built from successive layers of neuron-like elements, connected by adjustable weights, called “synapses” after their biological counterparts (<i>3</i>). The application of deep nets and related methods to AI systems has been transformative. They proved superior to previously known methods in central <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong>s of AI research, including computer vision, speech recognition and production, and playing complex games. Practical applications are already in broad use, in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong>s such as computer vision and speech and text translation, and large-scale efforts are under way in many other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong>s. Here, I discuss how additional aspects of brain circuitry could supply cues for guiding network models toward broader aspects of cognition and general AI.</p>

A collicular visual cortex: Neocortical space for an ancient midbrain visual structure
<p>Visual responses in the cerebral cortex are believed to rely on the geniculate input to the primary visual cortex (V1). Indeed, V1 lesions substantially reduce visual responses throughout the cortex. Visual information enters the cortex also through the superior colliculus (SC), but the function of this input on visual responses in the cortex is less clear. SC lesions affect cortical visual responses less than V1 lesions, and no visual cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> appears to entirely rely on SC inputs. We show that visual responses in a mouse lateral visual cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> called the postrhinal cortex are independent of V1 and are abolished upon silencing of the SC. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> outperforms V1 in discriminating moving objects. We thus identify a collicular primary visual cortex that is independent of the geniculo-cortical pathway and is capable of motion discrimination.</p>

Global extent of rivers and streams
<p>The turbulent surfaces of rivers and streams are natural hotspots of biogeochemical exchange with the atmosphere.

We used a global database of planform river hydromorphology and a statistical approach to show that global river and stream surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> at mean annual discharge is 773,000 ± 79,000 square kilometers (0.58 ± 0.06%) of Earth’s nonglaciated land surface, an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> 44 ± 15% larger than previous spatial estimates. We found that rivers and streams likely play a greater role in controlling land-atmosphere fluxes than is currently represented in global carbon budgets.</p>

Moving in the Anthropocene: Global reductions in terrestrial mammalian movements
<p>Animal movement is fundamental for ecosystem functioning and species survival, yet the effects of the anthropogenic footprint on animal movements have not been estimated across species. Using a unique GPS-tracking database of 803 individuals across 57 species, we found that movements of mammals in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong>s with a comparatively high human footprint were on average one-half to one-third the extent of their movements in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong>s with a low human footprint. We attribute this reduction to behavioral changes of individual animals and to the exclusion of species with long-range movements from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong>s with higher human impact. Global loss of vagility alters a key ecological trait of animals that affects not only population persistence but also ecosystem processes such as predator-prey interactions, nutrient cycling, and disease transmission.</p>

Genomic signals of selection predict climate-driven population declines in a migratory bird

Two areas for familiar face recognition in the primate brain
<p>Familiarity alters face recognition: Familiar faces are recognized more accurately than unfamiliar ones and under difficult viewing conditions when unfamiliar face recognition fails. The neural basis for this fundamental difference remains unknown. Using whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging, we found that personally familiar faces engage the macaque face-processing network more than unfamiliar faces. Familiar faces also recruited two hitherto unknown face <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong>s at anatomically conserved locations within the perirhinal cortex and the temporal pole. These two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong>s, but not the core face-processing network, responded to familiar faces emerging from a blur with a characteristic nonlinear surge, akin to the abruptness of familiar face recognition. In contrast, responses to unfamiliar faces and objects remained linear. Thus, two temporal lobe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong>s extend the core face-processing network into a familiar face-recognition system.</p>

The impact of hunting on tropical mammal and bird populations

We synthesized 176 studies to quantify hunting-induced declines of mammal and bird populations across the tropics. Bird and mammal abundances declined by 58% (25 to 76%) and by 83% (72 to 90%) in hunted compared with unhunted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong>s. Bird and mammal populations were depleted within 7 and 40 kilometers from hunters’ access points (roads and settlements).

Quantum optical circulator controlled by a single chirally coupled atom
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ated nonreciprocal optical components, which have an inherent asymmetry between their forward and backward propagation direction, are key for routing signals in photonic circuits. Here, we demonstrate a fiber-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ated quantum optical circulator operated by a single atom. Its nonreciprocal behavior arises from the chiral interaction between the atom and the transversally confined light. We demonstrate that the internal quantum state of the atom controls the operation direction of the circulator and that it features a strongly nonlinear response at the single-photon level. This enables, for example, photon number–dependent routing and novel quantum simulation protocols. Furthermore, such a circulator can in principle be prepared in a coherent superposition of its operational states and may become a key element for quantum information processing in scalable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ated optical circuits.</p>

Guard Cell Salicylic Acid Signaling Is Integrated into Abscisic Acid Signaling via the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CPK-Dependent Pathway
<p>The phenolic hormone salicylic acid (SA) induces stomatal closure. It has been suggested that SA signaling is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ated with abscisic acid (ABA) signaling in guard cells, but the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ation mechanism remains unclear. The Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent protein kinase Open Stomata1 (OST1) and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein kinases (CPKs) are key for ABA-induced activation of the slow-type anion channel SLAC1 and stomatal closure. Here, we show that SA-induced stomatal closure and SA activation of slow-type anion channel are impaired in the CPK disruption mutant <i>cpk3-2 cpk6-1</i> but not in the OST1 disruption mutant <i>ost1-3</i>. We also found that the key phosphorylation sites of SLAC1 in ABA signaling, serine-59 and serine-120, also are important for SA signaling. Chemiluminescence-based detection of superoxide anion revealed that SA did not require CPK3 and CPK6 for the induction of reactive oxygen species production. Taken together, our results suggest that SA activates peroxidase-mediated reactive oxygen species signal that is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ated into Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CPK-dependent ABA signaling branch but not the OST1-dependent signaling branch in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) guard cells.</p>

Variable Mesophyll Conductance among Soybean Cultivars Sets a Tradeoff between Photosynthesis and Water-Use-Efficiency
<p>Photosynthetic efficiency is a critical determinant of crop yield potential, although it remains below the theoretical optimum in modern crop varieties. Enhancing mesophyll conductance (i.e. the rate of carbon dioxide diffusion from substomatal cavities to the sites of carboxylation) may increase photosynthetic and water use efficiencies. To improve water use efficiency, mesophyll conductance should be increased without concomitantly increasing stomatal conductance. Here, we partition the variance in mesophyll conductance to within- and among-cultivar components across soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) grown under both controlled and field conditions and examine the covariation of mesophyll conductance with photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, water use efficiency, and leaf mass per <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong>. We demonstrate that mesophyll conductance varies more than 2-fold and that 38% of this variation is due to cultivar identity. As expected, mesophyll conductance is positively correlated with photosynthetic rates. However, a strong positive correlation between mesophyll and stomatal conductance among cultivars apparently impedes positive scaling between mesophyll conductance and water use efficiency in soybean. Contrary to expectations, photosynthetic rates and mesophyll conductance both increased with increasing leaf mass per <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong>. The presence of genetic variation for mesophyll conductance suggests that there is potential to increase photosynthesis and mesophyll conductance by selecting for greater leaf mass per <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong>. Increasing water use efficiency, though, is unlikely unless there is simultaneous stabilizing selection on stomatal conductance.</p>

Dynamic Interplay between Nucleoid Segregation and Genome Integrity in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> Chloroplasts
<p>The chloroplast (cp) genome is organized as nucleoids that are dispersed throughout the cp stroma. Previously, a cp homolog of bacterial recombinase RecA (cpRECA) was shown to be involved in the maintenance of cp genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ity by repairing damaged chloroplast DNA and by suppressing aberrant recombination between short dispersed repeats in the moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. Here, overexpression and knockdown analysis of cpRECA in the green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> revealed that cpRECA was involved in cp nucleoid dynamics as well as having a role in maintaining cp genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ity. Overexpression of <i>cpRECA</i> tagged with yellow fluorescent protein or hemagglutinin resulted in the formation of giant filamentous structures that colocalized exclusively to chloroplast DNA and cpRECA localized to cp nucleoids in a heterogenous manner. Knockdown of <i>cpRECA</i> led to a significant reduction in cp nucleoid number that was accompanied by nucleoid enlargement. This phenotype resembled those of gyrase inhibitor-treated cells and <i>monokaryotic chloroplast</i> mutant cells and suggested that cpRECA was involved in organizing cp nucleoid dynamics. The cp genome also was destabilized by induced recombination between short dispersed repeats in <i>cpRECA-</i>knockdown cells and gyrase inhibitor-treated cells. Taken together, these results suggest that cpRECA and gyrase are both involved in nucleoid dynamics and the maintenance of genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ity and that the mechanisms underlying these processes may be intimately related in <i>C. reinhardtii</i> cps.</p>

Scaling of the hydrostatic skeleton in the earthworm <i>Lumbricus terrestris</i>
<p>The structural and functional consequences of changes in size or scale have been well studied in animals with rigid skeletons, but relatively little is known about scale effects in animals with hydrostatic skeletons. We used glycol methacrylate histology and microscopy to examine the scaling of mechanically important morphological features of the earthworm <i>Lumbricus terrestris</i> over an ontogenetic size range from 0.03 to 12.89 g. We found that <i>L. terrestris</i> becomes disproportionately longer and thinner as it grows. This increase in the length to diameter ratio with size means that, when normalized for mass, adult worms gain ~117% mechanical advantage during radial expansion, compared with hatchling worms. We also found that the cross-sectional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> of the longitudinal musculature scales as body mass to the ~0.6 power across segments, which is significantly lower than the 0.66 power predicted by isometry. The cross-sectional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> of the circular musculature, however, scales as body mass to the ~0.8 power across segments, which is significantly higher than predicted by isometry. By modeling the interaction of muscle cross-sectional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> and mechanical advantage, we calculate that the force output generated during both circular and longitudinal muscle contraction scales near isometry. We hypothesize that the allometric scaling of earthworms may reflect changes in soil properties and burrowing mechanics with size.</p>

Integrated Consensus Map of Cultivated Peanut and Wild Relatives Reveals Structures of the A and B Genomes of <i>Arachis</i> and Divergence of the Legume Genomes
<p>The complex, tetraploid genome structure of peanut (<i>Arachis hypogaea</i>) has obstructed advances in genetics and genomics in the species. The aim of this study is to understand the genome structure of <i>Arachis</i> by developing a high-density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ated consensus map. Three recombinant inbred line populations derived from crosses between the A genome diploid species, <i>Arachis duranensis</i> and <i>Arachis stenosperma</i>; the B genome diploid species, <i>Arachis ipaënsis</i> and <i>Arachis magna</i>; and between the AB genome tetraploids, <i>A. hypogaea</i> and an artificial amphidiploid (<i>A. ipaënsis</i> × <i>A. duranensis</i>)<sup>4×</sup>, were used to construct genetic linkage maps: 10 linkage groups (LGs) of 544 cM with 597 loci for the A genome; 10 LGs of 461 cM with 798 loci for the B genome; and 20 LGs of 1442 cM with 1469 loci for the AB genome. The resultant maps plus 13 published maps were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ated into a consensus map covering 2651 cM with 3693 marker loci which was anchored to 20 consensus LGs corresponding to the A and B genomes. The comparative genomics with genome sequences of <i>Cajanus cajan</i>, <i>Glycine max</i>, <i>Lotus japonicus</i>, and <i>Medicago truncatula</i> revealed that the <i>Arachis</i> genome has segmented synteny relationship to the other legumes. The comparative maps in legumes, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ated tetraploid consensus maps, and genome-specific diploid maps will increase the genetic and genomic understanding of <i>Arachis</i> and should facilitate molecular breeding.</p>

Derivation and Validation of the CREST Model for Very Early Prediction of Circulatory Etiology Death in Patients Without ST-Segment–Elevation Myocardial Infarction After Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>No practical tool quantitates the risk of circulatory-etiology death (CED) immediately after successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation in patients without ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction. We developed and validated a prediction model to rapidly determine that risk and facilitate triage to individualized treatment pathways.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>With the use of INTCAR (International Cardiac Arrest Registry), an 87-question data set representing 44 centers in the United States and Europe, patients were classified as having had CED or a combined end point of neurological-etiology death or survival. Demographics and clinical factors were modeled in a derivation cohort, and backward stepwise logistic regression was used to identify factors independently associated with CED. We demonstrated model performance using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> under the curve and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test in the derivation and validation cohorts, and assigned a simplified point-scoring system.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 638 patients in the derivation cohort, 121 (18.9%) had CED. The final model included preexisting coronary artery disease (odds ratio [OR], 2.86; confidence interval [CI], 1.83–4.49; <i>P</i>≤0.001), nonshockable rhythm (OR, 1.75; CI, 1.10–2.77; P=0.017), initial ejection fraction<30% (OR, 2.11; CI, 1.32–3.37; <i>P</i>=0.002), shock at presentation (OR, 2.27; CI, 1.42–3.62; P<0.001), and ischemic time >25 minutes (OR, 1.42; CI, 0.90–2.23; P=0.13). The derivation model <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> under the curve was 0.73, and Hosmer-Lemeshow test P=0.47. Outcomes were similar in the 318-patient validation cohort (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> under the curve 0.68, Hosmer-Lemeshow test P=0.41). When assigned a point for each associated factor in the derivation model, the average predicted versus observed probability of CED with a CREST score (coronary artery disease, initial heart rhythm, low ejection fraction, shock at the time of admission, and ischemic time >25 minutes) of 0 to 5 was: 7.1% versus 10.2%, 9.5% versus 11%, 22.5% versus 19.6%, 32.4% versus 29.6%, 38.5% versus 30%, and 55.7% versus 50%.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The CREST model stratified patients immediately after resuscitation according to risk of a circulatory-etiology death. The tool may allow for estimation of circulatory risk and improve the triage of survivors of cardiac arrest without ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction at the point of care.</p></sec>

Ventricular Fibrillation Conversion Testing After Implantation of a Subcutaneous Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Compared with transvenous implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), subcutaneous (S)-ICDs require a higher energy for effective defibrillation. Although ventricular fibrillation conversion testing (CT) is recommended after S-ICD implantation to ensure an adequate margin between the defibrillation threshold and maximum device output (80J), prior work found that adherence to this recommendation is declining.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied first-time recipients of S-ICDs (between September 28, 2012, and April 1, 2016) in the National Cardiovascular Database Registry ICD Registry to determine predictors of use of CT, predictors of an insufficient safety margin (ISM, defined as ventricular fibrillation conversion energy >65J) during testing, and inhospital outcomes associated with use of CT. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to predict use of CT and ISM. Inverse probability weighted logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between use of CT and inhospital adverse events including death.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>CT testing was performed in 70.7% (n=5624) of 7960 patients with S-ICDs. Although deferral of CT was associated with several patient characteristics (including increased body mass index, increased body surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong>, severely reduced ejection fraction, dialysis dependence, warfarin use, anemia, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), the facility effect was comparatively more important (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> under the curve for patient level versus generalized linear mixed model: 0.619 versus 0.877). An ISM occurred in 6.9% (n=336) of 4864 patients without a prior ICD and was more common among white patients and those with ventricular pacing on the preimplant ECG, higher preimplant blood pressure, larger body surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong>, higher body mass index, and lower ejection fraction. A risk score was able to identify patients at low (<5%), medium (5% to 10%), and high risk (>10%) for ISM. CT testing was not associated with a composite of inhospital complications including death.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Use of CT testing after S-ICD implantation was driven by facility preference to a greater extent than patient factors and was not associated with a composite of inhospital complications or death. ISM was relatively uncommon and is associated with several widely available patient characteristics. These data may inform ICD system selection and a targeted approach to CT.</p></sec>

Prognostic Implications of Magnetic Resonance–Derived Quantification in Asymptomatic Patients With Organic Mitral Regurgitation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an accurate method for the quantitative assessment of organic mitral regurgitation (OMR). The aim of the present study was to compare the discriminative power of MRI quantification and the recommended Doppler echocardiography (ECHO)–derived <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ative approach to identify asymptomatic patients with OMR and adverse outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The study population consisted of 258 asymptomatic patients (63±14 years, 60% men) with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (>60%) and chronic moderate and severe OMR (flail 25%, prolapse 75%) defined by using the ECHO-derived <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ative approach. All patients underwent MRI to quantify regurgitant volume (RV) of OMR by subtracting the aortic forward flow volume from the total left ventricular stroke volume. Severe OMR was defined as RV≥60 mL.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Mean ECHO-derived RV was on average 17.1 mL larger than the MRI-derived RV (<i>P</i><0.05). Concordant grading of OMR severity with both techniques was observed in 197 (76%) individuals with 62 (31%) patients having severe OMR (MRI SEV-ECHO SEV) and 135 (69%) patients having moderate OMR (MRI MOD-ECHO MOD). The remaining 61 (24%) individuals had discordant findings (MRI SEV-ECHO MOD or MRI MOD-ECHO SEV) between the 2 techniques. The majority of these differences in OMR classification were observed in patients with late systolic or multiple jets (both κ<0.2). Patients with eccentric jets showed moderate agreement (κ=0.53; 95% confidence interval, 0.41–0.64). In contrast, a very good agreement (κ=0.90; 95% confidence interval, 0.82–0.98) was observed in a combination of holosystolic, central, and single jet. During a median follow-up of 5.0 years (interquartile range, 3.5–6.0 years), 38 (15%) patients died and 106 (41%) either died or developed indication for mitral valve surgery. In separate Cox regression analyses, the MRI-derived left ventricular end-systolic volume index, RV, and OMR category (severe versus moderate), and the ECHO-derived OMR category were independent predictors of all-cause mortality (all <i>P</i><0.05). The MRI-derived RV showed the largest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> under the curve to predict mortality (0.72) or its combination with the development of indication for mitral valve surgery (0.83).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The findings of the present study suggest that the MRI-derived assessment of OMR can better identify patients with severe OMR and adverse outcome than ECHO-derived <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ative approach warranting close follow-up and perhaps, early mitral valve surgery.</p></sec>

Age-Related Autonomous Aldosteronism
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Both aging and inappropriate secretion of aldosterone increase the risk for developing cardiovascular disease; however, the influence of aging on aldosterone secretion and physiology is not well understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The relationship between age and adrenal aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) expression was evaluated in 127 normal adrenal glands from deceased kidney donors (age, 9 months to 68 years). Following immunohistochemistry, CYP11B2-expressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong>s of abnormal foci of CYP11B2-expressing cells, called aldosterone-producing cell clusters, were analyzed. In a separate ancillary clinical study of 677 participants without primary aldosteronism, who were studied on both high and restricted sodium diets (age, 18–71 years), we used multivariable linear regression to assess the independent associations between age and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system physiology.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In adrenal tissue, the total CYP11B2-expressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> was negatively correlated with age (<i>r</i>=−0.431, <i>P</i><0.0001), whereas the total aldosterone-producing cell cluster <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> was positively correlated with age (<i>r</i>=0.390, <i>P</i><0.0001). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ated ratio of aldosterone-producing cell cluster to CYP11B2-expressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> was most strongly and positively correlated with age (<i>r</i>=0.587, <i>P</i><0.0001). When participants in the clinical study were maintained on a high sodium balance, renin activity progressively declined with older age, whereas serum and urinary aldosterone did not significantly decline. Correspondingly, the aldosterone-to-renin ratio was positively and independently associated with older age (adjusted β=+5.54 ng/dL per ng/mL per hour per 10 years, <i>P</i><0.001). In contrast, when participants were assessed under sodium-restricted conditions, physiological stimulation of aldosterone was blunted with older age (β=−4.6 ng/dL per 10 years, <i>P</i><0.0001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Aging is associated with a pattern of decreased normal zona glomerulosa CYP11B2 expression and increased aldosterone-producing cell cluster expression. This histopathologic finding parallels an age-related autonomous aldosteronism and abnormal aldosterone physiology that provides 1 potential explanation for age-related cardiovascular risk.</p></sec>

Integrated Noninvasive Physiological Assessment of Coronary Circulatory Function and Impact on Cardiovascular Mortality in Patients With Stable Coronary Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>It is suggested that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ation of maximal myocardial blood flow (MBF) and coronary flow reserve (CFR), termed coronary flow capacity, allows for comprehensive evaluation of patients with known or suspected stable coronary artery disease. Because management decisions are predicated on clinical risk, we sought to determine the independent and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ated value of maximal MBF and CFR for predicting cardiovascular death.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>MBF and CFR were quantified in 4029 consecutive patients (median age 66 years, 50.5% women) referred for rest/stress myocardial perfusion positron emission tomography scans from January 2006 to December 2013. The primary outcome was cardiovascular mortality. Maximal MBF <1.8 mL·g<sup>−1</sup>·min<sup>−1</sup> and CFR<2 were considered impaired. Four patient groups were identified based on the concordant or discordant impairment of maximal MBF or CFR. Association of maximal MBF and CFR with cardiovascular death was assessed using Cox and Poisson regression analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 392 (9.7%) cardiovascular deaths occurred over a median follow-up of 5.6 years. CFR was a stronger predictor of cardiovascular mortality than maximal MBF beyond traditional cardiovascular risk factors, left ventricular ejection fraction, myocardial scar and ischemia, rate-pressure product, type of radiotracer or stress agent used, and revascularization after scan (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.38–2.31; <i>P</i><0.001 per unit decrease in CFR after adjustment for maximal MBF and clinical covariates; and adjusted hazard ratio, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.84–1.27; <i>P</i>=0.8 per unit decrease in maximal MBF after adjustment for CFR and clinical covariates). In univariable analyses, patients with concordant impairment of CFR and maximal MBF had high cardiovascular mortality of 3.3% (95% CI, 2.9–3.7) per year. Patients with impaired CFR but preserved maximal MBF had an intermediate cardiovascular mortality of 1.7% (95% CI, 1.3–2.1) per year. These patients were predominantly women (70%). Patients with preserved CFR but impaired maximal MBF had low cardiovascular mortality of 0.9% (95% CI, 0.6–1.6) per year. Patients with concordantly preserved CFR and maximal MBF had the lowest cardiovascular mortality of 0.4% (95 CI, 0.3–0.6) per year. In multivariable analysis, the cardiovascular mortality risk gradient across the 4 concordant or discordant categories was independently driven by impaired CFR irrespective of impairment in maximal MBF.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>CFR is a stronger predictor of cardiovascular mortality than maximal MBF. Concordant and discordant categories based on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ating CFR and maximal MBF identify unique prognostic phenotypes of patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease.</p></sec>

Aortic Cross-Sectional Area/Height Ratio and Outcomes in Patients With a Trileaflet Aortic Valve and a Dilated Aorta

A ratio of aortic root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> over height was calculated (cm<sup>2</sup>/m) on tomography, and a cutoff of 10 cm<sup>2</sup>/m was chosen as abnormal, on the basis of previous reports. All-cause death was recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The cohort comprised 771 patients (63 years [interquartile range, 53–71], 87% men, 85% hypertension, 51% hyperlipidemia, 56% smokers). Inherited aortopathies, moderate to severe aortic regurgitation, and severe aortic stenosis were seen in 7%, 18%, and 2%, whereas 91% and 54% were on β-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, respectively. Aortic root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong>/height ratio was ≥10 cm<sup>2</sup>/m in 24%. The Society of Thoracic Surgeons score and right ventricular systolic pressure were 3.3±3 and 31±7 mm Hg, respectively. At 7.8 years (interquartile range, 6.6–8.9), 280 (36%) patients underwent aortic surgery (76% within 1 year) and 130 (17%) died (1% in-hospital postoperative mortality). A lower proportion of patients in the surgical (versus nonsurgical) group died (13% versus 19%, <i>P</i><0.01). On multivariable Cox proportional hazard analysis, aortic root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong>/height ratio (hazard ratio, 4.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.69–6.231) was associated with death, whereas aortic surgery (hazard ratio, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.27–0.81) was associated with improved survival (both <i>P</i><0.01).

Observed Arctic sea-ice loss directly follows anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emission
<p>Arctic sea ice is retreating rapidly, raising prospects of a future ice-free Arctic Ocean during summer. Because climate-model simulations of the sea-ice loss differ substantially, we used a robust linear relationship between monthly-mean September sea-ice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> and cumulative carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions to infer the future evolution of Arctic summer sea ice directly from the observational record. The observed linear relationship implies a sustained loss of 3 ± 0.3 square meters of September sea-ice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> per metric ton of CO<sub>2</sub> emission. On the basis of this sensitivity, Arctic sea ice will be lost throughout September for an additional 1000 gigatons of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Most models show a lower sensitivity, which is possibly linked to an underestimation of the modeled increase in incoming longwave radiation and of the modeled transient climate response.</p>

A disynaptic feedback network activated by experience promotes the integration of new granule cells
<p>Experience shapes the development and connectivity of adult-born granule cells (GCs) through mechanisms that are poorly understood. We examined the remodeling of dentate gyrus microcircuits in mice in an enriched environment (EE). Short exposure to EE during early development of new GCs accelerated their functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ation. This effect was mimicked by in vivo chemogenetic activation of a limited population of mature GCs. Slice recordings showed that mature GCs recruit parvalbumin γ-aminobutyric acid–releasing interneurons (PV-INs) that feed back onto developing GCs. Accordingly, chemogenetic stimulation of PV-INs or direct depolarization of developing GCs accelerated GC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ation, whereas inactivation of PV-INs prevented the effects of EE. Our results reveal a mechanism for dynamic remodeling in which experience activates dentate networks that “prime” young GCs through a disynaptic feedback loop mediated by PV-INs.</p>

Incorporation of rubidium cations into perovskite solar cells improves photovoltaic performance
<p>All of the cations currently used in perovskite solar cells abide by the tolerance factor for incorporation into the lattice. We show that the small and oxidation-stable rubidium cation (Rb<sup>+</sup>) can be embedded into a “cation cascade” to create perovskite materials with excellent material properties. We achieved stabilized efficiencies of up to 21.6% (average value, 20.2%) on small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong>s (and a stabilized 19.0% on a cell 0.5 square centimeters in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong>) as well as an electroluminescence of 3.8%. The open-circuit voltage of 1.24 volts at a band gap of 1.63 electron volts leads to a loss in potential of 0.39 volts, versus 0.4 volts for commercial silicon cells. Polymer-coated cells maintained 95% of their initial performance at 85°C for 500 hours under full illumination and maximum power point tracking.</p>

A Price to Pay for Adult Neurogenesis
<p>We tend to believe that plasticity is what makes brain circuits adaptable to continuous changes in environmental demands and that greater brain plasticity should result in a better ability to cope with the surrounding world. To adapt to everyday life, animals explore, learn, and remember, and these tasks make use of various cortical structures, including the hippocampus. The dentate gyrus, part of the hippocampus, is a remarkable structure in that it is one of two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong>s of the adult mammalian brain, including the human brain, that continue to generate new neurons throughout postnatal life (<i>1</i>). It is well established that adult-born neurons <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ate into preexisting neuronal networks and participate in information processing (<i>2</i>). Much evidence accumulated over the past decade supports the hypothesis that adult neurogenesis itself is a type of circuit plasticity required for hippocampus-dependent learning and memory recall. The work by Akers <i>et al.</i> on page 598 of this issue (<i>3</i>) now shows that adult hippocampal neurogenesis may also promote forgetting.</p>

Alternative Oxidase Capacity of Mitochondria in Microsporophylls May Function in Cycad Thermogenesis
<p>Cone thermogenesis is a widespread phenomenon in cycads and may function to promote volatile emissions that affect pollinator behavior. Given their large population size and intense and durable heat-producing effects, cycads are important organisms for comprehensive studies of plant thermogenesis. However, knowledge of mitochondrial morphology and function in cone thermogenesis is limited. Therefore, we investigated these mitochondrial properties in the thermogenic cycad species <i>Cycas revoluta</i>. Male cones generated heat even in cool weather conditions. Female cones produced heat, but to a lesser extent than male cones. Ultrastructural analyses of the two major tissues of male cones, microsporophylls and microsporangia, revealed the existence of a population of mitochondria with a distinct morphology in the microsporophylls. In these cells, we observed large mitochondria (cross-sectional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> of 2 μm<sup>2</sup> or more) with a uniform matrix density that occupied >10% of the total mitochondrial volume. Despite the size difference, many nonlarge mitochondria (cross-sectional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">area</span></strong> <2 μm<sup>2</sup>) also exhibited a shape and a matrix density similar to those of large mitochondria. Alternative oxidase (AOX) capacity and expression levels in microsporophylls were much higher than those in microsporangia. The <i>AOX</i> genes expressed in male cones revealed two different <i>AOX</i> complementary DNA sequences: <i>CrAOX1</i> and <i>CrAOX2</i>. The expression level of <i>CrAOX1</i> mRNA in the microsporophylls was 100 times greater than that of <i>CrAOX2</i> mRNA. Collectively, these results suggest that distinctive mitochondrial morphology and CrAOX1-mediated respiration in microsporophylls might play a role in cycad cone thermogenesis.</p>

CyanoGate: A Modular Cloning Suite for Engineering Cyanobacteria Based on the Plant MoClo Syntax
<p>Recent advances in synthetic biology research have been underpinned by an exponential increase in available genomic information and a proliferation of advanced DNA assembly tools. The adoption of plasmid vector assembly standards and parts libraries has greatly enhanced the reproducibility of research and the exchange of parts between different labs and biological systems. However, a standardized modular cloning (MoClo) system is not yet available for cyanobacteria, which lag behind other prokaryotes in synthetic biology despite their huge potential regarding biotechnological applications. By building on the assembly library and syntax of the Plant Golden Gate MoClo kit, we have developed a versatile system called CyanoGate that unites cyanobacteria with plant and algal systems. Here, we describe the generation of a suite of parts and acceptor vectors for making (1) marked/unmarked knock-outs or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ations using an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ative acceptor vector, and (2) transient multigene expression and repression systems using known and previously undescribed replicative vectors. We tested and compared the CyanoGate system in the established model cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 and the more recently described fast-growing strain <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973. The UTEX 2973 fast-growth phenotype was only evident under specific growth conditions; however, UTEX 2973 accumulated high levels of proteins with strong native or synthetic promoters. The system is publicly available and can be readily expanded to accommodate other standardized MoClo parts to accelerate the development of reliable synthetic biology tools for the cyanobacterial community.</p>

SlHY5 Integrates Temperature, Light, and Hormone Signaling to Balance Plant Growth and Cold Tolerance
<p>During the transition from warm to cool seasons, plants experience decreased temperatures, shortened days, and decreased red/far-red (R/FR) ratios of light. The mechanism by which plants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ate these environmental cues to maintain plant growth and adaptation remains poorly understood. Here, we report that low temperature induced the transcription of <i>PHYTOCHROME A</i> and accumulation of LONG HYPOCOTYL5 (SlHY5, a basic Leu zipper transcription factor) in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) plants, especially under short day conditions with low R/FR light ratios. Reverse genetic approaches and physiological analyses revealed that silencing of <i>SlHY5</i> increased cold susceptibility in tomato plants, whereas overexpression of <i>SlHY5</i> enhanced cold tolerance. SlHY5 directly bound to and activated the transcription of genes encoding a gibberellin-inactivation enzyme, namely <i>GIBBERELLIN2-OXIDASE4</i>, and an abscisic acid biosynthetic enzyme, namely <i>9-CIS-EPOXYCAROTENOID DIOXYGENASE6</i> (<i>SlNCED6</i>). Thus, phytochrome A-dependent SlHY5 accumulation resulted in an increased abscisic acid/gibberellin ratio, which was accompanied by growth cessation and induction of cold response. Furthermore, silencing of <i>SlNCED6</i> compromises short day- and low R/FR-induced tomato resistance to cold stress. These findings provide insight into the molecular genetic mechanisms by which plants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">integr</span></strong>ate environmental stimuli with hormones to coordinate their growth with impending cold temperatures. Moreover, this work reveals a molecular mechanism that plants have evolved for growth and survival in response to seasonal changes.</p>

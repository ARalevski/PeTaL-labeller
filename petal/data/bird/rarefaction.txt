Conventional Versus Compression-Only Versus No-Bystander Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation for Pediatric Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) (chest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compress</span></strong>ion and rescue breathing) has been recommended for pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) because of the asphyxial nature of the majority of pediatric cardiac arrest events. However, the clinical effectiveness of additional rescue breathing (conventional CPR) compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compress</span></strong>ion-only CPR in children is uncertain.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This nationwide population-based study of pediatric OHCA patients was based on data from the All-Japan Utstein Registry. We included all pediatric patients who experienced OHCA in Japan from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2012. The primary outcome was a favorable neurological state 1 month after OHCA defined as a Glasgow-Pittsburgh Cerebral Performance Category score of 1 to 2 (corresponding to a Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category score of 1–3). Outcomes were compared with logistic regression with uni- and multivariable modeling in the overall cohort and for a propensity-matched subset of patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 2157 patients were included; 417 received conventional CPR, 733 received <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compress</span></strong>ion-only CPR, and 1007 did not receive any bystander CPR. Among these patients, 213 (9.9%) survived with a favorable neurological status 1 month after OHCA, including 108/417 (25.9%) for conventional, 68/733 (9.3%) for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compress</span></strong>ion-only, and 37/1007 (3.7%) for no-bystander CPR. In unadjusted analyses, conventional CPR was superior to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compress</span></strong>ion-only CPR in neurologically favorable survival (odds ratio [OR] 3.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.45–4.76; <i>P</i><0.0001), with a trend favoring conventional CPR that was no longer statistically significant after multivariable adjustment (OR<sub>adjusted</sub> 1.52, 95% CI 0.93–2.49), and with further attenuation of the difference in a propensity-matched subset (OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.81–1.77). Both conventional and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compress</span></strong>ion-only CPR were associated with higher odds for neurologically favorable survival compared with no-bystander CPR (OR<sub>adjusted</sub> 5.01, 95% CI 2.98–8.57, and OR<sub>adjusted</sub> 3.29, 95% CI 1.93–5.71), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In this population-based study of pediatric OHCA in Japan, both conventional and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compress</span></strong>ion-only CPR were associated with superior outcomes compared with no-bystander CPR. Unadjusted outcomes with conventional CPR were superior to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compress</span></strong>ion-only CPR, with the magnitude of difference attenuated and no longer statistically significant after statistical adjustments. These findings support randomized clinical trials comparing conventional versus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compress</span></strong>ion-only CPR in children, with conventional CPR preferred until such controlled comparative data are available, and either method preferred over no-bystander CPR.</p></sec>

Circadian, Carbon, and Light Control of Expansion Growth and Leaf Movement
<p>We used Phytotyping<sup>4D</sup> to investigate the contribution of clock and light signaling to the diurnal regulation of rosette <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion growth and leaf movement in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Wild-type plants and clock mutants with a short (<i>lhycca1</i>) and long (<i>prr7prr9</i>) period were analyzed in a T24 cycle and in T-cycles that were closer to the mutants’ period. Wild types also were analyzed in various photoperiods and after transfer to free-running light or darkness. Rosette <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion and leaf movement exhibited a circadian oscillation, with superimposed transients after dawn and dusk. Diurnal responses were modified in clock mutants. <i>lhycca1</i> exhibited an inhibition of growth at the end of night and growth rose earlier after dawn, whereas <i>prr7prr9</i> showed decreased growth for the first part of the light period. Some features were partly rescued by a matching T-cycle, like the inhibition in <i>lhycca1</i> at the end of the night, indicating that it is due to premature exhaustion of starch. Other features were not rescued, revealing that the clock also regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion growth more directly. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion growth was faster at night than in the daytime, whereas published work has shown that the synthesis of cellular components is faster in the day than at nighttime. This temporal uncoupling became larger in short photoperiods and may reflect the differing dependence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion and biosynthesis on energy, carbon, and water. While it has been proposed that leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion and movement are causally linked, we did not observe a consistent temporal relationship between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion and leaf movement.</p>

The Transcription Factor ATHB5 Affects GA-Mediated Plasticity in Hypocotyl Cell Growth during Seed Germination
<p>Gibberellic acid (GA)-mediated cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion initiates the seed-to-seedling transition in plants and is repressed by DELLA proteins. Using digital single-cell analysis, we identified a cellular subdomain within the midhypocotyl, whose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion drives the final step of this developmental transition under optimal conditions. Using network inference, the transcription factor ATHB5 was identified as a genetic factor whose localized expression promotes GA-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion specifically within these cells. Both this protein and its putative growth-promoting target <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>IN3</i> are repressed by DELLA, and coregulated at single-cell resolution during seed germination. The cellular domains of hormone sensitivity were explored within the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) embryo by putting seeds under GA-limiting conditions and quantifying cellular growth responses. The middle and upper hypocotyl have a greater requirement for GA to promote cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion than the lower embryo axis. Under these conditions, germination was still completed following enhanced growth within the radicle and lower axis. Under GA-limiting conditions, the <i>athb5</i> mutant did not show a phenotype at the level of seed germination, but it did at a cellular level with reduced cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion in the hypocotyl relative to the wild type. These data reveal that the spatiotemporal cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion events driving this transition are not determinate, and the conditional use of GA-ATHB5-mediated hypocotyl growth under optimal conditions may be used to optionally support rapid seedling growth. This study demonstrates that multiple genetic and spatiotemporal cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion mechanisms underlie the seed to seedling transition in Arabidopsis.</p>

Duration of Ventilations During Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation by Lay Rescuers and First Responders
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>The 2010 guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation allow 5 seconds to give 2 breaths to deliver sufficient chest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compress</span></strong>ions and to keep perfusion pressure high. This study aims to determine whether the recommended short interruption for ventilations by trained lay rescuers and first responders can be achieved and to evaluate its consequence for chest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compress</span></strong>ions and survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>From a prospective data collection of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, we used automatic external defibrillator recordings of cardiopulmonary resuscitation by rescuers who had received a standard European Resuscitation Council basic life support and automatic external defibrillator course. Ventilation periods and total <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compress</span></strong>ions delivered per minute during each 2 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation cycle were measured, and the chest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compress</span></strong>ion fraction was calculated. Neurological intact survival to discharge was studied in relation to these factors and covariates. We included 199 automatic external defibrillator recordings. The median interruption time for 2 ventilations was 7 seconds (25th–75th percentile, 6–9 seconds). Of all rescuers, 21% took <5 seconds and 83% took <10 seconds for a ventilation period; 97%, 88%, and 63% of rescuers were able to deliver >60, >70, and >80 chest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compress</span></strong>ions per minute, respectively. The median chest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compress</span></strong>ion fraction was 65% (25th–75th percentile, 59%–71%).

AIBP-mediated cholesterol efflux instructs hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell fate
<p>Hypercholesterolemia, the driving force of atherosclerosis, accelerates the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion and mobilization of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). The molecular determinants connecting hypercholesterolemia with hematopoiesis are unclear. Here, we report that a somite-derived prohematopoietic cue, AIBP, orchestrates HSPC emergence from the hemogenic endothelium, a type of specialized endothelium manifesting hematopoietic potential. Mechanistically, AIBP-mediated cholesterol efflux activates endothelial Srebp2, the master transcription factor for cholesterol biosynthesis, which in turn transactivates Notch and promotes HSPC emergence. Srebp2 inhibition impairs hypercholesterolemia-induced HSPC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion. Srebp2 activation and Notch up-regulation are associated with HSPC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion in hypercholesterolemic human subjects. Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) indicate that Srebp2 transregulates Notch pathway genes required for hematopoiesis. Our studies outline an AIBP-regulated Srebp2-dependent paradigm for HSPC emergence in development and HPSC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.</p>

Light-induced lattice expansion leads to high-efficiency perovskite solar cells
<p>Light-induced structural dynamics plays a vital role in the physical properties, device performance, and stability of hybrid perovskite–based optoelectronic devices. We report that continuous light illumination leads to a uniform lattice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion in hybrid perovskite thin films, which is critical for obtaining high-efficiency photovoltaic devices. Correlated, in situ structural and device characterizations reveal that light-induced lattice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion benefits the performances of a mixed-cation pure-halide planar device, boosting the power conversion efficiency from 18.5 to 20.5%. The lattice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion leads to the relaxation of local lattice strain, which lowers the energetic barriers at the perovskite-contact interfaces, thus improving the open circuit voltage and fill factor. The light-induced lattice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion did not compromise the stability of these high-efficiency photovoltaic devices under continuous operation at full-spectrum 1-sun (100 milliwatts per square centimeter) illumination for more than 1500 hours.</p>

Vesicle Dynamics during Plant Cell Cytokinesis Reveals Distinct Developmental Phases
<p>Cell division in plant cells requires the deposition of a new cell wall between the two daughter cells. The assembly of this plate requires the coordinated movement of cargo vesicles whose size is below the diffraction-limited resolution of the optical microscope. We combined high spatial and temporal resolution confocal laser scanning microscopy with advanced image-processing tools and fluorescence fluctuation methods and distinguished three distinct phases during cell plate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) ‘Bright Yellow-2’ cells: massive delivery of preexisting vesicles to a disk-shaped region at the equatorial plane precedes a primary rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion phase followed by a secondary, slow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion phase during which the extremity of the circular plate seeks contact with the mother wall and brings about the separation of the two portions of cytoplasm.

Constitutive Expression of Arabidopsis <i>SMALL AUXIN UP RNA19</i> (<i>SAUR19</i>) in Tomato Confers Auxin-Independent Hypocotyl Elongation<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The plant hormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA or auxin) mediates the elongation growth of shoot tissues by promoting cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion. According to the acid growth theory proposed in the 1970s, auxin activates plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases (PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases) to facilitate cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion by both loosening the cell wall through acidification and promoting solute uptake. Mechanistically, however, this process is poorly understood. Recent findings in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) have demonstrated that auxin-induced <i>SMALL AUXIN UP RNA</i> (<i>SAUR</i>) genes promote elongation growth and play a key role in PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activation by inhibiting PP2C.D family protein phosphatases. Here, we extend these findings by demonstrating that SAUR proteins also inhibit tomato PP2C.D family phosphatases and that AtSAUR19 overexpression in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) confers the same suite of phenotypes as previously reported for Arabidopsis. Furthermore, we employ a custom image-based method for measuring hypocotyl segment elongation with high resolution and a method for measuring cell wall mechanical properties, to add mechanistic details to the emerging description of auxin-mediated cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion. We find that constitutive expression of GFP-AtSAUR19 bypasses the normal requirement of auxin for elongation growth by increasing the mechanical extensibility of excised hypocotyl segments. In contrast, hypocotyl segments overexpressing a PP2C.D phosphatase are specifically impaired in auxin-mediated elongation. The time courses of auxin-induced <i>SAUR</i> expression and auxin-dependent elongation growth were closely correlated. These findings indicate that induction of <i>SAUR</i> expression is sufficient to elicit auxin-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion growth by activating PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases to facilitate apoplast acidification and mechanical wall loosening.</p>

Atypical Protein Phosphatase 2A Gene Families Do Not Expand via Paleopolyploidization
<p>Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) presents unique opportunities for analyzing molecular mechanisms of functional divergence between gene family members. The canonical PP2A holoenzyme regulates multiple eukaryotic signaling pathways by dephosphorylating target proteins and contains a catalytic (C) subunit, a structural/scaffolding (A) subunit, and a regulatory (B) subunit. Genes encoding PP2A subunits have expanded into multigene families in both flowering plants and mammals, and the extent to which different isoform functions may overlap is not clearly understood. To gain insight into the diversification of PP2A subunits, we used phylogenetic analyses to reconstruct the evolutionary histories of PP2A gene families in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Genes encoding PP2A subunits in mammals represent ancient lineages that expanded early in vertebrate evolution, while flowering plant PP2A subunit lineages evolved much more recently. Despite this temporal difference, our data indicate that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion of PP2A subunit gene families in both flowering plants and animals was driven by whole-genome duplications followed by nonrandom gene loss. Selection analysis suggests that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion of one B subunit gene family (B56/PPP2R5) was driven by functional diversification rather than by the maintenance of gene dosage. We also observed reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion rates in three distinct B subunit subclades. One of these subclades plays a highly conserved role in cell division, while the distribution of a second subclade suggests a specialized function in supporting beneficial microbial associations. Thus, while whole-genome duplications have driven the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion and diversification of most PP2A gene families, members of functionally specialized subclades quickly revert to singleton status after duplication events.</p>

Maxima in the thermodynamic response and correlation functions of deeply supercooled water
<p>Femtosecond x-ray laser pulses were used to probe micrometer-sized water droplets that were cooled down to 227 kelvin in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vacuum</span></strong>. Isothermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compress</span></strong>ibility and correlation length were extracted from x-ray scattering at the low–momentum transfer region. The temperature dependence of these thermodynamic response and correlation functions shows maxima at 229 kelvin for water and 233 kelvin for heavy water. In addition, we observed that the liquids undergo the fastest growth of tetrahedral structures at similar temperatures. These observations point to the existence of a Widom line, defined as the locus of maximum correlation length emanating from a critical point at positive pressures in the deeply supercooled regime. The difference in the maximum value of the isothermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compress</span></strong>ibility between the two isotopes shows the importance of nuclear quantum effects.</p>

Clonal hematopoiesis associated with TET2 deficiency accelerates atherosclerosis development in mice
<p>Human aging is associated with an increased frequency of somatic mutations in hematopoietic cells. Several of these recurrent mutations, including those in the gene encoding the epigenetic modifier enzyme TET2, promote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion of the mutant blood cells. This clonal hematopoiesis correlates with an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. We studied the effects of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion of <i>Tet2</i>-mutant cells in atherosclerosis-prone, low-density lipoprotein receptor–deficient (<i>Ldlr</i><sup>–/–</sup>) mice. We found that partial bone marrow reconstitution with TET2-deficient cells was sufficient for their clonal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion and led to a marked increase in atherosclerotic plaque size. TET2-deficient macrophages exhibited an increase in NLRP3 inflammasome–mediated interleukin-1β secretion. An NLRP3 inhibitor showed greater atheroprotective activity in chimeric mice reconstituted with TET2-deficient cells than in nonchimeric mice. These results support the hypothesis that somatic <i>TET2</i> mutations in blood cells play a causal role in atherosclerosis.</p>

Self-renewal of a purified <i>Tie2</i><sup>+</sup> hematopoietic stem cell population relies on mitochondrial clearance
<p>A single hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) is capable of reconstituting hematopoiesis and maintaining homeostasis by balancing self-renewal and cell differentiation. The mechanisms of HSC division balance, however, are not yet defined. Here we demonstrate, by characterizing at the single-cell level a purified and minimally heterogeneous murine <i>Tie2</i><sup>+</sup> HSC population, that these top hierarchical HSCs preferentially undergo symmetric divisions. The induction of mitophagy, a quality control process in mitochondria, plays an essential role in self-renewing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion of <i>Tie2<sup>+</sup></i> HSCs. Activation of the PPAR (peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor)–fatty acid oxidation pathway promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion of <i>Tie2</i><sup>+</sup> HSCs through enhanced Parkin recruitment in mitochondria. These metabolic pathways are conserved in human TIE2<sup>+</sup> HSCs. Our data thus identify mitophagy as a key mechanism of HSC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion and suggest potential methods of cell-fate manipulation through metabolic pathways.</p>

Post-operative neuropathy after total hip arthroplasty
<p>Nerve palsy is a well-described complication   following total hip arthroplasty, but is highly distressing and   disabling. A nerve palsy may cause difficulty with the post-operative   rehabilitation, and overall mobility of the patient. Nerve palsy   may result from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compress</span></strong>ion and tension to the affected nerve(s)   during the course of the operation via surgical manipulation and   retractor placement, tension from limb lengthening or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compress</span></strong>ion   from post-operative hematoma. In the literature, hip dysplasia,   lengthening of the leg, the use of an uncemented femoral component, and   female gender are associated with a greater risk of nerve palsy.   We examined our experience at a high-volume, tertiary care referral   centre, and found an overall incidence of 0.3% out of 39 056 primary   hip arthroplasties. Risk factors found to be associated with the   incidence of nerve palsy at our institution included the presence   of spinal stenosis or lumbar disc disease, age younger than 50,   and smoking. If a nerve palsy is diagnosed, imaging is mandatory   and surgical evacuation or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compress</span></strong>ive haematomas may be beneficial.

Tracing the origin and evolution of pseudokinases across the tree of life
<p>Protein phosphorylation by eukaryotic protein kinases (ePKs) is a fundamental mechanism of cell signaling in all organisms. In model vertebrates, ~10% of ePKs are classified as pseudokinases, which have amino acid changes within the catalytic machinery of the kinase domain that distinguish them from their canonical kinase counterparts. However, pseudokinases still regulate various signaling pathways, usually doing so in the absence of their own catalytic output. To investigate the prevalence, evolutionary relationships, and biological diversity of these pseudoenzymes, we performed a comprehensive analysis of putative pseudokinase sequences in available eukaryotic, bacterial, and archaeal proteomes. We found that pseudokinases are present across all domains of life, and we classified nearly 30,000 eukaryotic, 1500 bacterial, and 20 archaeal pseudokinase sequences into 86 pseudokinase families, including ~30 families that were previously unknown. We uncovered a rich variety of pseudokinases with notable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ions not only in animals but also in plants, fungi, and bacteria, where pseudokinases have previously received cursory attention. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ions are accompanied by domain shuffling, which suggests roles for pseudokinases in plant innate immunity, plant-fungal interactions, and bacterial signaling. Mechanistically, the ancestral kinase fold has diverged in many distinct ways through the enrichment of unique sequence motifs to generate new families of pseudokinases in which the kinase domain is repurposed for noncanonical nucleotide binding or to stabilize unique, inactive kinase conformations. We further provide a collection of annotated pseudokinase sequences in the Protein Kinase Ontology (ProKinO) as a new mineable resource for the signaling community.</p>

R-Ras2 is required for germinal center formation to aid B cells during energetically demanding processes
<p>Upon antigen recognition within peripheral lymphoid organs, B cells interact with T cells and other immune cells to transiently form morphological structures called germinal centers (GCs), which are required for B cell clonal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion, immunoglobulin class switching, and affinity maturation. This process, known as the GC response, is an energetically demanding process that requires the metabolic reprogramming of B cells. We showed that the Ras-related guanosine triphosphate hydrolase (GTPase) R-Ras2 (also known as TC21) plays an essential, nonredundant, and B cell–intrinsic role in the GC response. Both the conversion of B cells into GC B cells and their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion were impaired in mice lacking R-Ras2, but not in those lacking a highly related R-Ras subfamily member or both the classic H-Ras and N-Ras GTPases. In the absence of R-Ras2, activated B cells did not exhibit increased oxidative phosphorylation or aerobic glycolysis. We showed that R-Ras2 was an effector of both the B cell receptor (BCR) and CD40 and that, in its absence, B cells exhibited impaired activation of the PI3K-Akt-mTORC1 pathway, reduced mitochondrial DNA replication, and decreased expression of genes involved in glucose metabolism. Because most human B cell lymphomas originate from GC B cells or B cells that have undergone the GC response, our data suggest that R-Ras2 may also regulate metabolism in B cell malignancies.</p>

Double-negative-index ceramic aerogels for thermal superinsulation
<p>Ceramic aerogels are attractive for thermal insulation but plagued by poor mechanical stability and degradation under thermal shock. In this study, we designed and synthesized hyperbolic architectured ceramic aerogels with nanolayered double-pane walls with a negative Poisson’s ratio (−0.25) and a negative linear thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion coefficient (−1.8 × 10<sup>−6</sup> per °C). Our aerogels display robust mechanical and thermal stability and feature ultralow densities down to ~0.1 milligram per cubic centimeter, superelasticity up to 95%, and near-zero strength loss after sharp thermal shocks (275°C per second) or intense thermal stress at 1400°C, as well as ultralow thermal conductivity in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vacuum</span></strong> [~2.4 milliwatts per meter-kelvin (mW/m·K)] and in air (~20 mW/m·K). This robust material system is ideal for thermal superinsulation under extreme conditions, such as those encountered by spacecraft.</p>

Ghost cytometry
<p>Ghost imaging is a technique used to produce an object’s image without using a spatially resolving detector. Here we develop a technique we term “ghost cytometry,” an image-free ultrafast fluorescence “imaging” cytometry based on a single-pixel detector. Spatial information obtained from the motion of cells relative to a static randomly patterned optical structure is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compress</span></strong>ively converted into signals that arrive sequentially at a single-pixel detector. Combinatorial use of the temporal waveform with the intensity distribution of the random pattern allows us to computationally reconstruct cell morphology. More importantly, we show that applying machine-learning methods directly on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compress</span></strong>ed waveforms without image reconstruction enables efficient image-free morphology-based cytometry. Despite a compact and inexpensive instrumentation, image-free ghost cytometry achieves accurate and high-throughput cell classification and selective sorting on the basis of cell morphology without a specific biomarker, both of which have been challenging to accomplish using conventional flow cytometers.</p>

Scaling of human brain size
<p>What makes humans unique as a species and as individuals? Our uniqueness stems from language, tool use, reasoning, and other cognitive abilities that are largely mediated by specialized regions of the cerebral cortex. These regions of higher cognitive function have expanded disproportionately during human evolution (compared with nonhuman primates) and during postnatal maturation, when cortical surface area expands threefold between infancy and adulthood (<i>1</i>). Our uniqueness as individuals reflects countless differences in brain structure, function, and connectivity. One basic anatomical difference between similarly aged individuals is a more than 1.5-fold variation in total brain size (and total cortical volume) (<i>2</i>). On page 1222 of this issue, Reardon <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) bring this aspect of individual variability under the umbrella of “differential scaling” by showing that human brains of different sizes do not scale uniformly across all regions. Rather, larger brains show greater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion in regions associated with higher cognition and less <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion in regions associated with sensory, motor, and limbic (emotion- and affect-related) functions.</p>

Ancient genomes revisit the ancestry of domestic and Przewalski’s horses
<p>The Eneolithic Botai culture of the Central Asian steppes provides the earliest archaeological evidence for horse husbandry, ~5500 years ago, but the exact nature of early horse domestication remains controversial. We generated 42 ancient-horse genomes, including 20 from Botai. Compared to 46 published ancient- and modern-horse genomes, our data indicate that Przewalski’s horses are the feral descendants of horses herded at Botai and not truly wild horses. All domestic horses dated from ~4000 years ago to present only show ~2.7% of Botai-related ancestry. This indicates that a massive genomic turnover underpins the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion of the horse stock that gave rise to modern domesticates, which coincides with large-scale human population <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ions during the Early Bronze Age.</p>

Polarity compensation mechanisms on the perovskite surface KTaO<sub>3</sub>(001)
<p>The stacking of alternating charged planes in ionic crystals creates a diverging electrostatic energy—a “polar catastrophe”—that must be compensated at the surface. We used scanning probe microscopies and density functional theory to study compensation mechanisms at the perovskite potassium tantalate<i> </i>(KTaO<sub>3</sub>) (001) surface as increasing degrees of freedom were enabled. The as-cleaved surface in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vacuum</span></strong> is frozen in place but immediately responds with an insulator-to-metal transition and possibly ferroelectric lattice distortions. Annealing in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vacuum</span></strong> allows the formation of isolated oxygen vacancies, followed by a complete rearrangement of the top layers into an ordered pattern of KO and TaO<sub>2</sub> stripes. The optimal solution is found after exposure to water vapor through the formation of a hydroxylated overlayer with ideal geometry and charge.</p>

Microtubules acquire resistance from mechanical breakage through intralumenal acetylation
<p>Eukaryotic cells rely on long-lived microtubules for intracellular transport and as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compress</span></strong>ion-bearing elements. We considered that long-lived microtubules are acetylated inside their lumen and that microtubule acetylation may modify microtubule mechanics. Here, we found that tubulin acetylation is required for the mechanical stabilization of long-lived microtubules in cells. Depletion of the tubulin acetyltransferase TAT1 led to a significant increase in the frequency of microtubule breakage. Nocodazole-resistant microtubules lost upon removal of acetylation were largely restored by either pharmacological or physical removal of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compress</span></strong>ive forces. In in vitro reconstitution experiments, acetylation was sufficient to protect microtubules from mechanical breakage. Thus, acetylation increases mechanical resilience to ensure the persistence of long-lived microtubules.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Massive Tandem Proliferation of ELIPs Supports Convergent Evolution of Desiccation Tolerance across Land Plants
<p>Desiccation tolerance was a critical adaptation for the colonization of land by early nonvascular plants. Resurrection plants have maintained or rewired these ancestral protective mechanisms, and desiccation-tolerant species are dispersed across the land plant phylogeny. Although common physiological, biochemical, and molecular signatures are observed across resurrection plant lineages, features underlying the recurrent evolution of desiccation tolerance are unknown. Here we used a comparative approach to identify patterns of genome evolution and gene duplication associated with desiccation tolerance. We identified a single gene family with dramatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion in all sequenced resurrection plant genomes and no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion in desiccation-sensitive species. This gene family of early light-induced proteins (ELIPs) expanded in resurrection plants convergent through repeated tandem gene duplication. ELIPs are universally highly expressed during desiccation in all surveyed resurrection plants and may play a role in protecting against photooxidative damage of the photosynthetic apparatus during prolonged dehydration. Photosynthesis is particularly sensitive to dehydration, and the increased abundance of ELIPs may help facilitate the rapid recovery observed for most resurrection plants. Together, these observations support convergent evolution of desiccation tolerance in land plants through tandem gene duplication.</p>

The Role of Gβ Protein in Controlling Cell Expansion via Potential Interaction with Lipid Metabolic Pathways
<p>Heterotrimeric G-proteins influence almost all aspects of plant growth, development, and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses in plants, likely via their interaction with specific effectors. However, the identity of such effectors and their mechanism of action are mostly unknown. While investigating the roles of different G-protein subunits in modulating the oil content in Camelina (<i>Camelina sativa</i>), an oil seed crop, we uncovered a role of Gβ proteins in controlling anisotropic cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion. Knockdown of <i>Gβ</i> genes causes reduced longitudinal and enhanced transverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion, resulting in altered cell, tissue, and organ shapes in transgenic plants during vegetative and reproductive development. These plants also exhibited substantial changes in their fatty acid and phospholipid profiles, which possibly leads to the increased oil content of the transgenic seeds. This increase is potentially caused by the direct interaction of Gβ proteins with a specific patatin-like phospholipase, pPLAIIIδ. Camelina plants with suppressed <i>Gβ</i> expression exhibit higher lipase activity, and show phenotypes similar to plants overexpressing <i>pPLAIIIδ</i>, suggesting that the Gβ proteins are negative regulators of pPLAIIIδ. These results reveal interactions between the G-protein–mediated and lipid signaling/metabolic pathways, where specific phospholipases may act as effectors that control key developmental and environmental responses of plants.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Cuticle Biosynthesis in Tomato Leaves Is Developmentally Regulated by Abscisic Acid
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion of aerial organs in plants is coupled with the synthesis and deposition of a hydrophobic cuticle, composed of cutin and waxes, which is critically important in limiting water loss. While the abiotic stress-related hormone abscisic acid (ABA) is known to up-regulate wax accumulation in response to drought, the hormonal regulation of cuticle biosynthesis during organ ontogeny is poorly understood. To address the hypothesis that ABA also mediates cuticle formation during organ development, we assessed the effect of ABA deficiency on cuticle formation in three ABA biosynthesis-impaired tomato mutants. The mutant leaf cuticles were thinner, had structural abnormalities, and had a substantial reduction in levels of cutin. ABA deficiency also consistently resulted in differences in the composition of leaf cutin and cuticular waxes. Exogenous application of ABA partially rescued these phenotypes, confirming that they were a consequence of reduced ABA levels. The ABA mutants also showed reduced expression of genes involved in cutin or wax formation. This difference was again countered by exogenous ABA, further indicating regulation of cuticle biosynthesis by ABA. The fruit cuticles were affected differently by the ABA-associated mutations, but in general were thicker. However, no structural abnormalities were observed, and the cutin and wax compositions were less affected than in leaf cuticles, suggesting that ABA action influences cuticle formation in an organ-dependent manner. These results suggest dual roles for ABA in regulating leaf cuticle formation: one that is fundamentally associated with leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion, independent of abiotic stress, and another that is drought induced.</p>

Forever Young: The Role of Ubiquitin Receptor DA1 and E3 Ligase BIG BROTHER in Controlling Leaf Growth and Development
<p>The final size of plant organs is determined by a combination of cell proliferation and cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion. Leaves account for a large part of above-ground biomass and provide energy to complete the plant’s life cycle. Although the final size of leaves is remarkably constant under fixed environmental conditions, several genes have been described to enhance leaf growth when their expression is modulated. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), mutations in <i>DA1</i> and <i>BB</i> increase leaf size, an effect that is synergistically enhanced in the double mutant. Here, we show that overexpression of a dominant-negative version of <i>DA1</i> enhances leaf size in a broad range of natural accessions of this species, indicating a highly conserved role of this protein in controlling organ size. We also found that during early stages of development, leaves of <i>da1-1</i> and <i>bb/eod1-2</i> mutants were already larger than the isogenic Col-0 wild type, but this phenotype was triggered by different cellular mechanisms. Later during development, <i>da1-1</i> and <i>bb/eod1-2</i> leaves showed a prolonged longevity, which was enhanced in the double mutant. Conversely, ectopic expression of <i>DA1</i> or <i>BB</i> restricted growth and promoted leaf senescence. In concert, shortly upon induction of <i>DA1</i> and <i>BB</i> expression, several marker genes for the transition from proliferation to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion were highly up-regulated. Additionally, multiple genes involved in maintaining the mitotic cell cycle were rapidly down-regulated and senescence genes were strongly up-regulated, particularly upon <i>BB</i> induction. With these results, we demonstrate that DA1 and BB restrict leaf size and promote senescence through converging and different mechanisms.</p>

Large Numbers of Novel miRNAs Originate from DNA Transposons and Are Coincident with a Large Species Radiation in Bats
<p>Vesper bats (family Vespertilionidae) experienced a rapid adaptive radiation beginning around 36 Ma that resulted in the second most species-rich mammalian family (>400 species). Coincident with that radiation was an initial burst of DNA transposon activity that has continued into the present in some species. Such extensive and recent DNA transposon activity has not been seen in any other extant mammal. Indeed, retrotransposon activity is much more common in all other sequenced mammal genomes. Deep sequencing of the small RNA fraction from a vespertilionid bat, <i>Eptesicus fuscus</i>, as well as a dog and horse revealed large numbers of 17–24 bp putative miRNAs (p/miRNAs). Although the origination rate of p/miRNAs is similar in all three taxa, 61.1% of postdivergence p/miRNAs in <i>Eptesicus</i> are derived from transposable elements (TEs) compared with only 23.9% and 16.5% in the dog and horse, respectively. Not surprisingly, given the retrotransposon bias of dog and horse, the majority of TE-derived p/miRNAs are associated with retrotransposons. In <i>Eptesicus</i>, however, 58.7% of the TE-derived and 35.9% of the total p/miRNAs arose not from retrotransposons but from bat-specific DNA transposons. Notably, we observe that the timing of the DNA transposon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion and the resulting introduction of novel p/miRNAs coincide with the rapid diversification of the family Vespertilionidae. Furthermore, potential targets of the DNA transposon-derived p/miRNAs are identifiable and enriched for genes that are important for regulation of transcription. We propose that lineage-specific DNA transposon activity lead to the rapid and repeated introduction of novel p/miRNAs. Some of these p/miRNAs are likely functional miRNAs and potentially influenced the diversification of Vespertilionidae. Our observations suggest a mechanism for introducing functional genomic variation rapidly through the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion of DNA transposons that fits within the TE-thrust hypothesis.</p>

Sequential Duplications of an Ancient Member of the DnaJ-Family Expanded the Functional Chaperone Network in the Eukaryotic Cytosol
<p>Across eukaryotes, Hsp70-based chaperone machineries display an underlying unity in their sequence, structure, and biochemical mechanism of action, while working in a myriad of cellular processes. In good part, this extraordinary functional versatility is derived from the ability of a single Hsp70 to interact with an array of J-protein cochaperones to form a functional chaperone network. Among J-proteins, the DnaJ-type is the most prevalent, being present in all three kingdoms and in several different compartments of eukaryotic cells. However, because these ancient DnaJ-type proteins diverged at the base of the eukaryotic phylogeny, little is understood about the evolutionary basis of their diversification and thus the functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion of the chaperone network. Here, we report results of evolutionary and experimental analyses of two more recent members of the cytosolic DnaJ family of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, Xdj1 and Apj1, which emerged by sequential duplications of the ancient <i>YDJ1</i> in Ascomycota. Sequence comparison and molecular modeling revealed that both Xdj1 and Apj1 maintained a domain organization similar to that of multifunctional Ydj1. However, despite these similarities, both Xdj1 and Apj1 evolved highly specialized functions. Xdj1 plays a unique role in the translocation of proteins from the cytosol into mitochondria. Apj1’s specialized role is related to degradation of sumolyated proteins. Together these data provide the first clear example of cochaperone duplicates that evolved specialized functions, allowing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion of the chaperone functional network, while maintaining the overall structural organization of their parental gene.</p>

Development of the prethalamus is crucial for thalamocortical projection formation and is regulated by Olig2
<p>Thalamocortical axons (TCAs) pass through the prethalamus in the first step of their neural circuit formation. Although it has been supposed that the prethalamus is an intermediate target for thalamocortical projection formation, much less is known about the molecular mechanisms of this targeting. Here, we demonstrated the functional implications of the prethalamus in the formation of this neural circuit. We show that Olig2 transcription factor, which is expressed in the ventricular zone (VZ) of prosomere 3, regulates prethalamus formation, and loss of Olig2 results in reduced prethalamus size in early development, which is accompanied by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion of the thalamic eminence (TE). Extension of TCAs is disorganized in the <i>Olig2-KO</i> dorsal thalamus, and initial elongation of TCAs is retarded in the <i>Olig2-KO</i> forebrain. Microarray analysis demonstrated upregulation of several axon guidance molecules, including <i>Epha3</i> and <i>Epha5</i>, in the <i>Olig2-KO</i> basal forebrain. <i>In situ</i> hybridization showed that the prethalamus in the wild type excluded the expression of <i>Epha3</i> and <i>Epha5</i>, whereas loss of Olig2 resulted in reduction of this Ephas-negative area and the corresponding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion of the Ephas-positive TE. Dissociated cultures of thalamic progenitor cells demonstrated that substrate-bound EphA3 suppresses neurite extension from dorsal thalamic neurons. These results indicate that Olig2 is involved in correct formation of the prethalamus, which leads to exclusion of the EphA3-expressing region and is crucial for proper TCA formation. Our observation is the first report showing the molecular mechanisms underlying how the prethalamus acts on initial thalamocortical projection formation.</p>

Scaling of the hydrostatic skeleton in the earthworm <i>Lumbricus terrestris</i>
<p>The structural and functional consequences of changes in size or scale have been well studied in animals with rigid skeletons, but relatively little is known about scale effects in animals with hydrostatic skeletons. We used glycol methacrylate histology and microscopy to examine the scaling of mechanically important morphological features of the earthworm <i>Lumbricus terrestris</i> over an ontogenetic size range from 0.03 to 12.89 g. We found that <i>L. terrestris</i> becomes disproportionately longer and thinner as it grows. This increase in the length to diameter ratio with size means that, when normalized for mass, adult worms gain ~117% mechanical advantage during radial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion, compared with hatchling worms. We also found that the cross-sectional area of the longitudinal musculature scales as body mass to the ~0.6 power across segments, which is significantly lower than the 0.66 power predicted by isometry. The cross-sectional area of the circular musculature, however, scales as body mass to the ~0.8 power across segments, which is significantly higher than predicted by isometry. By modeling the interaction of muscle cross-sectional area and mechanical advantage, we calculate that the force output generated during both circular and longitudinal muscle contraction scales near isometry. We hypothesize that the allometric scaling of earthworms may reflect changes in soil properties and burrowing mechanics with size.</p>

Local bisphosphonate reduces migration and formation of radiolucent lines adjacent to cemented acetabular components
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Post-operative migration of cemented acetabular components as   measured by radiostereometric analysis (RSA) has a strong predictive   power for late, aseptic loosening. Also, radiolucent lines predict   late loosening. Migration has been reduced by systemic bisphosphonate   treatment in randomised trials of hip and knee arthroplasty. Used   as a local treatment, a higher local dose of bisphosphonate can   be achieved without systemic exposure. We wished to see if this   principle could be applied usefully in total hip arthroplasty (THA).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>In this randomised placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial with   60 participants, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compress</span></strong>ed gauze soaked in bisphosphonate solution   (ibandronate) or saline against the acetabular bone bed immediately   before cementing the acetabular component. RSA, classification of   radiolucent lines, the Harris Hip Score (HHS) and the Western Ontario McMasters   Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) were carried out at three-,   six-, 12-, and 24-month follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Migration of the cemented acetabular component relative to the   pelvis was reduced by movement almost half in the ibandronate group,   when measured as maximum total point or as movement of the femoral   head (p = 0.001 and 0.004, respectively). Radiolucent lines after   one year were classified as absent, partial or complete, and correlated with   treatment (rho 0.37; p = 0.004). Only three of 30 patients in the   ibandronate group had complete lines, compared with 13 of 28 in   the placebo group (p = 0.002). There were no significant effects   on HHS or WOMAC score.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Considering the power of RSA to predict loosening of cemented   acetabular components, and the likelihood that radiolucent lines   indicate risk of loosening, these data suggest that local treatment   with a bisphosphonate can reduce the risk of late aseptic loosening.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:317–24.</p></sec>

Comparison of the elution properties of commercially available gentamicin and bone cement containing vancomycin with ‘home-made’ preparations
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Vancomycin is commonly added to acrylic bone cement during revision   arthroplasty surgery. Proprietary cement preparations containing   vancomycin are available, but are significantly more expensive.   We investigated whether the elution of antibiotic from ‘home-made’   cement containing vancomycin was comparable with more expensive   commercially available vancomycin impregnated cement.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A total of 18 cement discs containing either proprietary CopalG+V;   or ‘home-made’ CopalR+G with vancomycin added by hand, were made.   Each disc contained the same amount of antibiotic (0.5 g gentamycin,   2 g vancomycin) and was immersed in ammonium acetate buffer in a   sealed container. Fluid from each container was sampled at eight   time points over a two-week period. The concentrations of gentamicin   and vancomycin in the fluid were analysed using high performance   liquid chromatography mass spectrometry.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The highest peak concentrations of antibiotic were observed from   the ‘home-made’ cements containing vancomycin, added as in the operating   theatre. The overall elution of antibiotic was, fivefold (vancomycin)   and twofold (gentamicin) greater from the ‘home-made’ mix compared   with the commercially mixed cement. The use of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vacuum</span></strong> during mixing   had no significant effect on antibiotic elution in any of the samples.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These findings suggest that the addition of 2 g vancomycin powder   to gentamicin-impregnated bone cement by hand significantly increases   the elution of both antibiotics compared with commercially prepared   cements containing vancomycin. We found no significant advantages   of using expensive commercially produced vancomycin-impregnated cement   and recommend the addition of vancomycin powder by hand in the operating theatre.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:73–7.</p></sec>

Quantifying the ‘law of diminishing returns’ in magnetically controlled growing rods
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Magnetically controlled growing rods (MCGRs) allow non-invasive   correction of the spinal deformity in the treatment of early-onset   scoliosis. Conventional growing rod systems (CGRS) need repeated   surgical distractions: these are associated with the effect of the   ‘law of diminishing returns’.</p><p>The primary aim of this study was to quantify this effect in   MCGRs over sequential distractions. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 35 patients with a maximum follow-up of 57 months   were included in the study. There were 17 boys and 18 girls with   a mean age of 7.4 years (2 to 14). True Distraction (TD) was determined   by measuring the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion gap on fluoroscopy. This was compared   with Intended Distraction (ID) and expressed as the ‘T/I’ ratio.   The T/I ratio and the Cobb angle were calculated at several time   points during follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean follow-up was 30 months (6 to 57). There was a significant   decrease in the mean T/I ratio over time (convex rod at 3 months   0.81, <sc>sd</sc> 0.58 <i>vs</i> 51 months 0.17, <sc>sd </sc>0.16,    p = 0.0001; concave rod at 3 months 0.93, <sc>sd</sc> 0.67 <i>vs</i> 51   months 0.18, <sc>sd</sc> 0.15, p = 0.0001). A linear decline of   the mean T/I ratios was noted for both convex rods (r<sup>2</sup> =   0.90, p = 0.004) and concave rods (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.81, p = 0.015)   over 51 months. At the 24-month follow-up stage, there was a significant   negative correlation between the mean T/I ratio of the concave rod   with weight (r = -0.59, p = 0.01), age (r = -0.59, p = 0.01), and   BMI of the child (r = -0.54,    p = 0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The ‘law of diminishing returns’ is also seen after serial distraction   using MCGR.

The challenge of Monteggia-like lesions of the elbow
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this retrospective multicentre study was to evaluate   mid-term results of the operative treatment of Monteggia-like lesions   and to determine the prognostic factors that influence the clinical   and radiological outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 46 patients (27 women and 19 men), with a mean age   of 57.7 years (18 to 84) who had sustained a Monteggia-like lesion   were followed up clinically and radiologically after surgical treatment.   The Mayo Modified Wrist Score (MMWS), Mayo Elbow Performance Score   (MEPS), Broberg and Morrey Score, and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder   and Hand (DASH) score were used for evaluation at a mean of 65 months   (27 to 111) postoperatively. All ulnar fractures were stabilized   using a proximally contoured or precontoured locking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compress</span></strong>ion   plate. Mason type I fractures of the radial head were treated conservatively, type   II fractures were treated with reconstruction, and type III fractures   with arthroplasty. All Morrey type II and III fractures of the coronoid   process was stabilized using lag screws.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Good results were found for the MMWS, with a mean of 88.4 (40 to   100). There were 29 excellent results (63%), nine good (20%), seven   satisfactory (15%), and one poor (2%). Excellent results were obtained   for the MEPS, with a mean of 90.7 (70 to 100): 31 excellent results   (68%), 13 good (28%), and two fair (4%). Good results were also   found for the functional rating index of Broberg and Morrey, with   a mean score of 86.6 (57 to 100). There were 16 excellent results   (35%), 22 good (48%), six fair (13%), and two poor (4%). The mean DASH   score was 15.1 (0 to 55.8).

Functional and histopathological identification of the respiratory failure in a DMSXL transgenic mouse model of myotonic dystrophy
<p>Acute and chronic respiratory failure is one of the major and potentially life-threatening features in individuals with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). Despite several clinical demonstrations showing respiratory problems in DM1 patients, the mechanisms are still not completely understood. This study was designed to investigate whether the DMSXL transgenic mouse model for DM1 exhibits respiratory disorders and, if so, to identify the pathological changes underlying these respiratory problems. Using pressure plethysmography, we assessed the breathing function in control mice and DMSXL mice generated after large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ions of the CTG repeat in successive generations of DM1 transgenic mice. Statistical analysis of breathing function measurements revealed a significant decrease in the most relevant respiratory parameters in DMSXL mice, indicating impaired respiratory function. Histological and morphometric analysis showed pathological changes in diaphragmatic muscle of DMSXL mice, characterized by an increase in the percentage of type I muscle fibers, the presence of central nuclei, partial denervation of end-plates (EPs) and a significant reduction in their size, shape complexity and density of acetylcholine receptors, all of which reflect a possible breakdown in communication between the diaphragmatic muscles fibers and the nerve terminals. Diaphragm muscle abnormalities were accompanied by an accumulation of mutant DMPK RNA foci in muscle fiber nuclei. Moreover, in DMSXL mice, the unmyelinated phrenic afferents are significantly lower. Also in these mice, significant neuronopathy was not detected in either cervical phrenic motor neurons or brainstem respiratory neurons. Because EPs are involved in the transmission of action potentials and the unmyelinated phrenic afferents exert a modulating influence on the respiratory drive, the pathological alterations affecting these structures might underlie the respiratory impairment detected in DMSXL mice. Understanding mechanisms of respiratory deficiency should guide pharmaceutical and clinical research towards better therapy for the respiratory deficits associated with DM1.</p>

Neurons and cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells as a model for mitochondrial defects in Friedreich’s ataxia
<p>Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA) is a recessive neurodegenerative disorder commonly associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. FRDA is due to expanded GAA repeats within the first intron of the gene encoding frataxin, a conserved mitochondrial protein involved in iron-sulphur cluster biosynthesis. This mutation leads to partial gene silencing and substantial reduction of the frataxin level. To overcome limitations of current cellular models of FRDA, we derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from two FRDA patients and successfully differentiated them into neurons and cardiomyocytes, two affected cell types in FRDA. All FRDA iPSC lines displayed expanded GAA alleles prone to high instability and decreased levels of frataxin, but no biochemical phenotype was observed. Interestingly, both FRDA iPSC-derived neurons and cardiomyocytes exhibited signs of impaired mitochondrial function, with decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and progressive mitochondrial degeneration, respectively. Our data show for the first time that FRDA iPSCs and their neuronal and cardiac derivatives represent promising models for the study of mitochondrial damage and GAA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">expans</span></strong>ion instability in FRDA.</p>

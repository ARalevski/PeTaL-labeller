F-Actin Mediated Focusing of Vesicles at the Cell Tip Is Essential for Polarized Growth
<p>F-actin has been shown to be essential for tip growth in an array of plant models, including <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. One hypothesis is that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion can transport secretory vesicles, while actin plays a regulatory role during secretion. Alternatively, it is possible that actin-based transport is necessary to overcome vesicle transport limitations to sustain secretion. Therefore, a quantitative analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion, secretion kinetics, and cell geometry is necessary to clarify the role of actin in polarized growth. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis, we first show that secretory vesicles move toward and accumulate at the tip in an actin-dependent manner. We then depolymerized F-actin to decouple vesicle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion from actin-mediated transport and measured the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion coefficient and concentration of vesicles. Using these values, we constructed a theoretical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-based model for growth, demonstrating that with fast-enough vesicle fusion kinetics, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion could support normal cell growth rates. We further refined our model to explore how experimentally extrapolated vesicle fusion kinetics and the size of the secretion zone limit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-based growth. This model predicts that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-mediated growth is dependent on the size of the region of exocytosis at the tip and that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-based growth would be significantly slower than normal cell growth. To further explore the size of the secretion zone, we used a cell wall degradation enzyme cocktail and determined that the secretion zone is smaller than 6 Î¼m in diameter at the tip. Taken together, our results highlight the requirement for active transport in polarized growth and provide important insight into vesicle secretion during tip growth.</p>

Excess Diffuse Light Absorption in Upper Mesophyll Limits CO<sub>2</sub> Drawdown and Depresses Photosynthesis
<p>In agricultural and natural systems, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e light can enhance plant primary productivity due to deeper penetration into and greater irradiance of the entire canopy. However, for individual sun-grown leaves from three species, photosynthesis is actually less efficient under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e compared with direct light. Despite its potential impact on canopy-level productivity, the mechanism for this leaf-level <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e light photosynthetic depression effect is unknown. Here, we investigate if the spatial distribution of light absorption relative to electron transport capacity in sun- and shade-grown sunflower (<i>Helianthus annuus</i>) leaves underlies its previously observed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e light photosynthetic depression. Using a new one-dimensional porous medium finite element gas-exchange model parameterized with light absorption profiles, we found that weaker penetration of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e versus direct light into the mesophyll of sun-grown sunflower leaves led to a more heterogenous saturation of electron transport capacity and lowered its CO<sub>2</sub> concentration drawdown capacity in the intercellular airspace and chloroplast stroma. This decoupling of light availability from photosynthetic capacity under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e light is sufficient to generate an 11% decline in photosynthesis in sun-grown but not shade-grown leaves, primarily because thin shade-grown leaves similarly distribute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e and direct light throughout the mesophyll. Finally, we illustrate how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e light photosynthetic depression could overcome enhancement in canopies with low light extinction coefficients and/or leaf area, pointing toward a novel direction for future research.</p>

Source of CpG Depletion in the HIV-1 Genome
<p>The dinucleotide CpG is highly underrepresented in the genome of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). To identify the source of CpG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deplet</span></strong>ion in the HIV-1 genome, we investigated two biological mechanisms: (1) CpG methylation-induced transcriptional silencing and (2) CpG recognition by Toll-like receptors (TLRs). We hypothesized that HIV-1 has been under selective evolutionary pressure by these mechanisms leading to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion of CpG in its genome. A CpG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deplet</span></strong>ed genome would enable HIV-1 to avoid methylation-induced transcriptional silencing and/or to avoid recognition by TLRs that identify foreign CpG sequences. We investigated these two hypotheses by determining the sequence context dependency of CpG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deplet</span></strong>ion and comparing it with that of CpG methylation and TLR recognition. We found that in both human and HIV-1 genomes the CpG motifs flanked by T/A were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deplet</span></strong>ed most and those flanked by C/G were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deplet</span></strong>ed least. Similarly, our analyses of human methylome data revealed that the CpG motifs flanked by T/A were methylated most and those flanked by C/G were methylated least. Given that a similar CpG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deplet</span></strong>ion pattern was observed for the human genome within which CpGs are not likely to be recognized by TLRs, we argue that the main source of CpG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deplet</span></strong>ion in HIV-1 is likely host-induced methylation. Analyses of CpG motifs in over 100 viruses revealed that this unique CpG representation pattern is specific to the human and simian immunodeficiency viruses.</p>

Can T cells be too exhausted to fight back?
<p>When T cells are persistently activated by antigen, such as during chronic infection or in cancer, they can become functionally incapable of performing their effector activities, a condition called T cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exhaust</span></strong>ion. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exhaust</span></strong>ion therefore thwarts optimal immune control of infection and tumors. There is a need to learn more about the molecular factors that drive T cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exhaust</span></strong>ion and just how malleable T cell immunity is once <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exhaust</span></strong>ion is established. On pages 1165 and 1160 of this issue, Sen <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) and Pauken <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>), respectively, demonstrate that T cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exhaust</span></strong>ion represents a stable differentiation state, underpinned by the apparently irreversible installation of an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exhaust</span></strong>ion-specific genetic landscape. This implies that perhaps in a majority of cases of persistent immune activation, T cells are too <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exhaust</span></strong>ed to fight back against cancer or pathogens.</p>

Hindered cytoplasmic diffusion of inositol trisphosphate restricts its cellular range of action
<p>The range of action of intracellular messengers is determined by their rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion and degradation. Previous measurements in oocyte cytoplasmic extracts indicated that the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-liberating second messenger inositol trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>es with a coefficient (~280 Î¼m<sup>2</sup> s<sup>â1</sup>) similar to that in water, corresponding to a range of action of ~25 Î¼m. Consequently, IP<sub>3</sub> is generally considered a âglobalâ cellular messenger. We reexamined this issue by measuring local IP<sub>3</sub>-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> puffs to monitor IP<sub>3</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ing from spot photorelease in neuroblastoma cells. Fitting these data by numerical simulations yielded a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion coefficient (â¤10 Î¼m<sup>2</sup> s<sup>â1</sup>) about 30-fold slower than that previously reported. We propose that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion of IP<sub>3</sub> in mammalian cells is hindered by binding to immobile, functionally inactive receptors that were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dilut</span></strong>ed in oocyte extracts. The predicted range of action of IP<sub>3</sub> (<5 Î¼m) is thus smaller than the size of typical mammalian cells, indicating that IP<sub>3</sub> should better be considered as a local rather than a global cellular messenger.</p>

Scalable and safe synthetic organic electroreduction inspired by Li-ion battery chemistry
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ive electrosynthesis has faced long-standing challenges in applications to complex organic substrates at scale. Here, we show how decades of research in lithium-ion battery materials, electrolytes, and additives can serve as an inspiration for achieving practically scalable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ive electrosynthetic conditions for the Birch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion. Specifically, we demonstrate that using a sacrificial anode material (magnesium or aluminum), combined with a cheap, nontoxic, and water-soluble proton source (dimethylurea), and an overcharge protectant inspired by battery technology [tris(pyrrolidino)phosphoramide] can allow for multigram-scale synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant building blocks. We show how these conditions have a very high level of functional-group tolerance relative to classical electrochemical and chemical dissolving-metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ions. Finally, we demonstrate that the same electrochemical conditions can be applied to other dissolving metalâtype <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ive transformations, including McMurry couplings, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ive ketone deoxygenations, and epoxide openings.</p>

Factoring stream turbulence into global assessments of nitrogen pollution
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e of excess nitrogen to streams and rivers poses an existential threat to both humans and ecosystems. A seminal study of headwater streams across the United States concluded that in-stream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">remov</span></strong>al of nitrate is controlled primarily by stream chemistry and biology. Reanalysis of these data reveals that stream turbulence (in particular, turbulent mass transfer across the concentration boundary layer) imposes a previously unrecognized upper limit on the rate at which nitrate is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">remov</span></strong>ed from streams. The upper limit closely approximates measured nitrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">remov</span></strong>al rates in streams with low concentrations of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollut</span></strong>ant, a discovery that should inform stream restoration designs and efforts to assess the effects of nitrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollut</span></strong>ion on receiving water quality and the global nitrogen cycle.</p>

The epigenetic landscape of T cell exhaustion
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exhaust</span></strong>ed T cells in cancer and chronic viral infection express distinctive patterns of genes, including sustained expression of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). However, the regulation of gene expression in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exhaust</span></strong>ed T cells is poorly understood. Here, we define the accessible chromatin landscape in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exhaust</span></strong>ed CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and show that it is distinct from functional memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exhaust</span></strong>ed CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in humans and a mouse model of chronic viral infection acquire a state-specific epigenetic landscape organized into functional modules of enhancers. Genome editing shows that PD-1 expression is regulated in part by an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exhaust</span></strong>ion-specific enhancer that contains essential RAR, T-bet, and Sox3 motifs. Functional enhancer maps may offer targets for genome editing that alter gene expression preferentially in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exhaust</span></strong>ed CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p>

Impact of Bystander Automated External Defibrillator Use on Survival and Functional Outcomes in Shockable Observed Public Cardiac Arrests
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Survival following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with shockable rhythms can be improved with early defibrillation. Although shockable OHCA accounts for only â25% of overall arrests, â60% of public OHCAs are shockable, offering the possibility of restoring thousands of individuals to full recovery with early defibrillation by bystanders. We sought to determine the association of bystander automated external defibrillator use with survival and functional outcomes in shockable observed public OHCA.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>From 2011 to 2015, the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium prospectively collected detailed information on all cardiac arrests at 9 regional centers. The exposures were shock administration by a bystander-applied automated external defibrillator in comparison with initial defibrillation by emergency medical services. The primary outcome measure was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e with normal or near-normal (favorable) functional status defined as a modified Rankin Score â¤2. Survival to hospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e was the secondary outcome measure.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 49â555 OHCAs, 4115 (8.3%) observed public OHCAs were analyzed, of which 2500 (60.8%) were shockable. A bystander shock was applied in 18.8% of the shockable arrests. Patients shocked by a bystander were significantly more likely to survive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e (66.5% versus 43.0%) and be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>ed with favorable functional outcome (57.1% versus 32.7%) than patients initially shocked by emergency medical services. After adjusting for known predictors of outcome, the odds ratio associated with a bystander shock was 2.62 (95% confidence interval, 2.07â3.31) for survival to hospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e and 2.73 (95% confidence interval, 2.17â3.44) for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e with favorable functional outcome. The benefit of bystander shock increased progressively as emergency medical services response time became longer.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Bystander automated external defibrillator use before emergency medical services arrival in shockable observed public OHCA was associated with better survival and functional outcomes. Continued emphasis on public automated external defibrillator utilization programs may further improve outcomes of OHCA.</p></sec>

Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate is a major source of GPCR-stimulated phosphoinositide production
<p>Phospholipase C (PLC) enzymes hydrolyze the plasma membrane (PM) lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI4,5P<sub>2</sub>) to generate the second messengers inositol trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) and diacylglycerol (DAG) in response to receptor activation in almost all mammalian cells. We previously found that stimulation of G proteinâcoupled receptors (GPCRs) in cardiac cells leads to the PLC-dependent hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) at the Golgi, a process required for the activation of nuclear protein kinase D (PKD) during cardiac hypertrophy. We hypothesized that GPCR-stimulated PLC activation leading to direct PI4P hydrolysis may be a general mechanism for DAG production. We measured GPCR activationâdependent changes in PM and Golgi PI4P pools in various cells using GFP-based detection of PI4P. Stimulation with various agonists caused a time-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion in PI4P-associated, but not PI4,5P<sub>2</sub>-associated, fluorescence at the Golgi and PM. Targeted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deplet</span></strong>ion of PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> from the PM before GPCR stimulation had no effect on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deplet</span></strong>ion of PM or Golgi PI4P, total inositol phosphate (IP) production, or PKD activation. In contrast, acute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deplet</span></strong>ion of PI4P specifically at the PM completely blocked the GPCR-dependent production of IPs and activation of PKD but did not change the abundance of PI4,5P<sub>2</sub>. Acute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deplet</span></strong>ion of Golgi PI4P had no effect on these processes. These data suggest that most of the PM PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> pool is not involved in GPCR-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis and that PI4P at the PM is responsible for the bulk of receptor-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis and DAG production.</p>

Reactivation of recall-induced neurons contributes to remote fear memory attenuation
<p>Whether fear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ation is mediated by inhibition of the original memory trace of fear with a new memory trace of safety or by updating of the original fear trace toward safety has been a long-standing question in neuroscience and psychology alike.

We foundâchemogenetically and in an engram-specific mannerâthat effective remote fear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ation is accompanied by the reactivation of memory recallâinduced neurons in the dentate gyrus and that the continued activity of these neurons is critical for fear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion.

Infarcted mice also had larger pericardial clusters and 3-fold upregulated numbers of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factorâproducing B cells within pericardial AT, but not spleen or lymph nodes. This was associated with higher DC and T-cell counts in pericardial AT, which outnumbered DCs and T cells in lymph nodes. Analysis of DC maturation markers, tracking experiments with fluorescently labeled cells, and use of CCR7-deficient mice suggested that activated DCs migrate from infarcts into pericardial AT via CCR7. B-cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deplet</span></strong>ion or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor neutralization inhibited DC and T-cell expansion within pericardial AT, and translated into reduced bone marrow granulopoiesis and cardiac neutrophil infiltration 3 days after MI. The relevance of the pericardial AT in mediating all these effects was confirmed by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">remov</span></strong>al of pericardial AT and ex vivo coculture with pericardial AT and granulocyte progenitors.

ICare-ACS (Improving Care Processes for Patients With Suspected Acute Coronary Syndrome)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Efforts to safely reduce length of stay for emergency department patients with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) have had mixed success. Few system-wide efforts affecting multiple hospital emergency departments have ever been evaluated. We evaluated the effectiveness of a nationwide implementation of clinical pathways for potential ACS in disparate hospitals.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This was a multicenter pragmatic stepped-wedge before-and-after trial in 7 New Zealand acute care hospitals with 31â332 patients investigated for suspected ACS with serial troponin measurements. The implementation was a clinical pathway for the assessment of patients with suspected ACS that included a clinical pathway document in paper or electronic format, structured risk stratification, specified time points for electrocardiographic and serial troponin testing within 3 hours of arrival, and directions for combining risk stratification and electrocardiographic and troponin testing in an accelerated diagnostic protocol.

The main outcome measure was the odds of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e within 6 hours of presentation</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>There were 11â529 participants in the preimplementation phase (range, 284â3465) and 19â803 in the postimplementation phase (range, 395â5039). Overall, the mean 6-hour <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e rate increased from 8.3% (range, 2.7%â37.7%) to 18.4% (6.8%â43.8%). The odds of being <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>ed within 6 hours increased after clinical pathway implementation. The odds ratio was 2.4 (95% confidence interval, 2.3â2.6). In patients without ACS, the median length of hospital stays decreased by 2.9 hours (95% confidence interval, 2.4â3.4). For patients <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>ed within 6 hours, there was no change in 30-day major adverse cardiac event rates (0.52% versus 0.44%; <i>P</i>=0.96).

Hospital Variation in Adherence Rates to Secondary Prevention Medications and the Implications on Quality
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Medication adherence is important to improve the long-term outcomes after acute myocardial infarction (MI). We hypothesized that there is significant variation among US hospitals in terms of medication adherence after MI, and that patients treated at hospitals with higher medication adherence after MI will have better long-term cardiovascular outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We identified 19â704 Medicare patients <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>ed after acute MI from 347 US hospitals participating in the ACTION Registry-GWTG (Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network Registry-Get With the Guidelines) from January 2, 2007, to October 1, 2010. Using linked Medicare Part D prescription filling data, medication adherence was defined as proportion of days covered >80% within 90 days after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to compare 2-year major adverse cardiovascular events among hospitals with high, moderate, and low 90-day medication adherence.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>By 90 days after MI, overall rates of adherence to medications prescribed at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e were 68% for Î²-blockers, 63% for statins, 64% for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, and 72% for thienopyridines. Adherence to these medications up to 90 days varied significantly among hospitals: Î²-blockers (proportion of days covered >80%; 59% to 75%), statins (55% to 69%), thienopyridines (64% to 77%), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (57% to 69%). Compared with hospitals in the lowest quartile of 90-day composite medication adherence, hospitals with the highest adherence had lower unadjusted and adjusted 2-year major adverse cardiovascular event risk (27.5% versus 35.3%; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.88; 95% confidence interval, 0.80â0.96). High-adherence hospitals also had lower adjusted rates of death or readmission (hazard ratio, 0.90; 95% confidence interval, 0.85â0.96), whereas there was no difference in mortality after adjustment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Use of secondary prevention medications after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e varies significantly among US hospitals and is inversely associated with 2-year outcomes. Hospitals may improve medication adherence after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e and patient outcomes through better coordination of care between inpatient and outpatient settings.</p></sec>

NT-proBNP (N-Terminal pro-B-Type Natriuretic Peptide)-Guided Therapy in Acute Decompensated Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The concept of natriuretic peptide guidance has been extensively studied in patients with chronic heart failure (HF), with only limited success. The effect of NT-proBNP (N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide)-guided therapy in patients with acute decompensated HF using a relative NT-proBNP target has not been investigated. This study aimed to assess whether NT-proBNP-guided therapy of patients with acute decompensated HF using a relative NT-proBNP target would lead to improved outcomes compared with conventional therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial to study the impact of in-hospital guidance for acute decompensated HF treatment by a predefined NT-proBNP target (>30% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion from admission to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e) versus conventional treatment. Patients with acute decompensated HF with NT-proBNP levels >1700 ng/L were eligible. After achieving clinical stability, 405 patients were randomized to either NT-proBNP-guided or conventional treatment (1:1). The primary end point was dual: a composite of all-cause mortality and HF readmissions in 180 days and the number of days alive out of the hospital in 180 days. Secondary end points were all-cause mortality within 180 days, HF readmissions within 180 days, and a composite of all-cause mortality and HF readmissions within 90 days.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Significantly more patients in the NT-proBNP-guided therapy group were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>ed with an NT-proBNP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion of >30% (80% versus 64%, <i>P</i>=0.001).

Particulate Matter Exposure and Stress Hormone Levels
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Exposure to ambient particulate matter (PM) is associated with a number of adverse health outcomes, but potential mechanisms are largely unknown. Metabolomics represents a powerful approach to study global metabolic changes in response to environmental exposures. We therefore conducted this study to investigate changes in serum metabolites in response to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion of PM exposure among healthy college students.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a randomized, double-blind crossover trial in 55 healthy college students in Shanghai, China. Real and sham air <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">purif</span></strong>iers were placed in participantsâ dormitories in random order for 9 days with a 12-day washout period. Serum metabolites were quantified by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Between-treatment differences in metabolites were examined using orthogonal partial least square-discriminant analysis and mixed-effect models. Secondary outcomes include blood pressure, corticotropin-releasing hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, insulin resistance, and biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The average personal exposure to PMs with aerodynamic diameters â¤2.5 Î¼m was 24.3 Î¼g/m<sup>3</sup> during the real <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">purif</span></strong>ication and 53.1 Î¼g/m<sup>3</sup> during the sham <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">purif</span></strong>ication. Metabolomics analysis showed that higher exposure to PMs with aerodynamic diameters â¤2.5 Î¼m led to significant increases in cortisol, cortisone, epinephrine, and norepinephrine.

Polygenic Risk Score Identifies Subgroup With Higher Burden of Atherosclerosis and Greater Relative Benefit From Statin Therapy in the Primary Prevention Setting
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Relative risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion with statin therapy has been consistent across nearly all subgroups studied to date. However, in analyses of 2 randomized controlled primary prevention trials (ASCOT [Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes TrialâLipid-Lowering Arm] and JUPITER [Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin]), statin therapy led to a greater relative risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion among a subgroup at high genetic risk. Here, we aimed to confirm this observation in a third primary prevention randomized controlled trial. In addition, we assessed whether those at high genetic risk had a greater burden of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied participants from a randomized controlled trial of primary prevention with statin therapy (WOSCOPS [West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study]; n=4910) and 2 observational cohort studies (CARDIA [Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults] and BioImage; n=1154 and 4392, respectively). For each participant, we calculated a polygenic risk score derived from up to 57 common DNA sequence variants previously associated with coronary heart disease. We compared the relative efficacy of statin therapy in those at high genetic risk (top quintile of polygenic risk score) versus all others (WOSCOPS), as well as the association between the polygenic risk score and coronary artery calcification (CARDIA) and carotid artery plaque burden (BioImage).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among WOSCOPS trial participants at high genetic risk, statin therapy was associated with a relative risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion of 44% (95% confidence interval [CI], 22â60; <i>P</i><0.001), whereas in all others, the relative risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion was 24% (95% CI, 8â37; <i>P</i>=0.004) despite similar low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering. In a study-level meta-analysis across the WOSCOPS, ASCOT, and JUPITER primary prevention, relative risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion in those at high genetic risk was 46% versus 26% in all others (<i>P</i> for heterogeneity=0.05).

Association Between Duration of Resuscitation and Favorable Outcome After Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Little evidence guides the appropriate duration of resuscitation in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, and case features justifying longer or shorter durations are ill defined. We estimated the impact of resuscitation duration on the probability of favorable functional outcome in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest using a large, multicenter cohort.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This was a secondary analysis of a North American, single-blind, multicenter, cluster-randomized, clinical trial (ROC-PRIMED [Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium Prehospital Resuscitation Using an Impedance Valve and Early Versus Delayed]) of consecutive adults with nontraumatic, emergency medical servicesâtreated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

An empirical study of the wound effect on sap flux density measured with thermal dissipation probes
<p>The insertion of thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissip</span></strong>ation (TD) sensors on tree stems for sap flux density (SFD) measurements can lead to SFD underestimations due to a wound formation close to the drill hole. However, the wound effect has not been assessed experimentally for this method yet. Here, we propose an empirical approach to investigate the effect of the wound healing on measured sap flux with TD probes. The approach was performed for both, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e-porous (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i> (Linnaeus)) and ring-porous (<i>Quercus petraea</i> (Lieblein)) species. Thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissip</span></strong>ation probes were installed on different dates along the growing season to document the effects of the dynamic wound formation. The trees were cut in autumn and additional sensors were installed in the cut stems, therefore, without potential effects of wound development. A range of water pressures was applied to the stem segments and SFDs were simultaneously measured by TD sensors as well as gravimetrically in the laboratory. The formation of wounds around sensors installed in living tree stems led to underestimation of SFD by 21.4Â Â±Â 3 and 47.5Â Â±Â 3.8% in beech and oak, respectively. The differences between SFD underestimations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e-porous beech and ring-porous oak were, however, not statistically significant. Sensors with 5-, 11- and 22-week-old wounds also showed no significant differences, which implies that the influence of wound formation on SFD estimates was completed within the first few weeks after perforation. These results were confirmed by time courses of SFD measurements in the field. Field SFD values decreased immediately after sensor installation and reached stable values after ~2 weeks with similar underestimations to the ones observed in the laboratory. We therefore propose a feasible approach to correct directly field observations of SFD for potential underestimations due to the wound effect.</p>

Size-dependent enhancement of water relations during post-fire resprouting
<p>In resprouting species, fire-induced topkill causes a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion in height and leaf area without a comparable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion in the size of the root system, which should lead to an increase in the efficiency of water transport after fire. However, large plants undergo a greater relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion in size, compared with small plants, so we hypothesized that this enhancement in hydraulic efficiency would be greatest among large growth forms. In the ecotone between long-leaf pine (<i>Pinus palustris</i> Mill.) savannas and wetlands, we measured stomatal conductance (<i>g</i><sub>s</sub>), mid-day leaf water potential (<i>Î¨</i><sub>leaf</sub>), leaf-specific whole-plant hydraulic conductance (<i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub>), leaf area and height of 10 species covering a range of growth forms in burned and unburned sites. As predicted, <i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub> was higher in post-fire resprouts than in unburned plants, and the post-fire increase in <i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub> was positively related to plant size. Specifically, large-statured species tended to undergo the greatest relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ions in leaf area and height, and correspondingly experienced the greatest increases in <i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub>. The post-fire increase in <i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub> was smaller than expected, however, due to a decrease in absolute root hydraulic conductance (i.e., not scaled to leaf area). The higher <i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub> in burned sites was manifested as an increase in <i>g</i><sub>s</sub> rather than an increase in <i>Î¨</i><sub>leaf</sub>. Post-fire increases in <i>g</i><sub>s</sub> should promote high rates of photosynthesis for recovery of carbohydrate reserves and aboveground biomass, which is particularly important for large-statured species that require more time to recover their pre-fire size.</p>

Single-molecule diffusion-based estimation of ligand effects on G proteinâcoupled receptors
<p>G proteinâcoupled receptors (GPCRs) are major drug targets. Developing a method to measure the activities of GPCRs is essential for pharmacology and drug screening. However, it is difficult to measure the effects of a drug by monitoring the receptor on the cell surface; thus, changes in the concentrations of downstream signaling molecules, which depend on the signaling pathway selectivity of the receptor, are often used as an index of receptor activity. We show that single-molecule imaging analysis provides an alternative method for assessing the effects of ligands on GPCRs. Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM), we monitored the dynamics of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion of metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (mGluR3), a class C GPCR, under various ligand conditions. Our single-molecule tracking analysis demonstrated that increases and decreases in the average <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion coefficient of mGluR3 quantitatively reflected the ligand-dependent inactivation and activation of receptors, respectively. Through experiments with inhibitors and dual-color single-molecule imaging analysis, we found that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion of receptor molecules was altered by common physiological events associated with GPCRs, including G protein binding, and receptor accumulation in clathrin-coated pits. We also confirmed that agonist also decreased the average <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion coefficient for class A and B GPCRs, demonstrating that this parameter is a good index for estimating ligand effects on many GPCRs regardless of their phylogenetic groups, the chemical properties of the ligands, or G proteinâcoupling selectivity.</p>

Ketyl radical reactivity via atom transfer catalysis
<p>Single-electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion of a carbonyl to a ketyl enables access to a polarity-reversed platform of reactivity for this cornerstone functional group. However, the synthetic utility of the ketyl radical is hindered by the strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ants necessary for its generation, which also limit its reactivity to net <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ive mechanisms. We report a strategy for net redox-neutral generation and reaction of ketyl radicals. The in situ conversion of aldehydes to Î±-acetoxy iodides lowers their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion potential by more than 1 volt, allowing for milder access to the corresponding ketyl radicals and an oxidative termination event. Upon subjecting these iodides to a dimanganese decacarbonyl precatalyst and visible light irradiation, an atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) mechanism affords a broad scope of vinyl iodide products with high <i>Z</i>-selectivity.</p>

The South Asian monsoonâpollution pump and purifier
<p>Air <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollut</span></strong>ion is growing fastest in monsoon-affected South Asia. During the dry winter monsoon, the fumes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>e toward the Indian Ocean, creating a vast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollut</span></strong>ion haze, but their fate during the wet summer monsoon has been unclear. We performed atmospheric chemistry measurements by aircraft in the Oxidation Mechanism Observations campaign, sampling the summer monsoon outflow in the upper troposphere between the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean. The measurements, supported by model calculations, show that the monsoon sustains a remarkably efficient cleansing mechanism by which contaminants are rapidly oxidized and deposited to Earthâs surface. However, some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollut</span></strong>ants are lofted above the monsoon clouds and chemically processed in a reactive reservoir before being redistributed globally, including to the stratosphere.</p>

Improving mechanical sensor performance through larger damping
<p>Mechanical resonances are used in a wide variety of devices, from smartphone accelerometers to computer clocks and from wireless filters to atomic force microscopes. Frequency stability, a critical performance metric, is generally assumed to be tantamount to resonance quality factor (the inverse of the linewidth and of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damp</span></strong>ing). We show that the frequency stability of resonant nanomechanical sensors can be improved by lowering the quality factor. At high bandwidths, quality-factor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion is completely mitigated by increases in signal-to-noise ratio. At low bandwidths, notably, increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damp</span></strong>ing leads to better stability and sensor resolution, with improvement proportional to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damp</span></strong>ing. We confirm the findings by demonstrating temperature resolution of 60 microkelvin at 300-hertz bandwidth. These results open the door to high-performance ultrasensitive resonators in gaseous or liquid environments, single-cell nanocalorimetry, nanoscale gas chromatography, atmospheric-pressure nanoscale mass spectrometry, and new approaches in crystal oscillator stability.</p>

Determination of intrinsic attenuation in the oceanic lithosphere-asthenosphere system
<p>We recorded <i>P</i> and <i>S</i> waves traveling through the oceanic lithosphere-asthenosphere system (LAS) using broadband ocean-bottom seismometers in the northwest Pacific, and we quantitatively separated the intrinsic (anelastic) and extrinsic (scattering) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ation effects on seismic wave propagation to directly infer the thermomechanical properties of the oceanic LAS. The strong intrinsic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ation in the asthenosphere obtained at higher frequency (~3 hertz) is comparable to that constrained at lower frequency (~100 seconds) by surface waves and suggests frequency-independent anelasticity, whereas the intrinsic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ation in the lithosphere is frequency dependent. This difference in frequency dependence indicates that the strong and broad peak <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dissip</span></strong>ation recently observed in the laboratory exists only in the asthenosphere and provides new insight into what distinguishes the asthenosphere from the lithosphere.</p>

When early adopters don't adopt
<p>Individuals who naturally adopt a new technology early are important for influencing whether and how the technology <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>es more broadly among later users (<i>1</i>â<i>7</i>). Such natural early adopters (NEAs) may influence the difference between successful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion of new technology and failure. Yet the factors that most influence how and why NEAs engage with new technologies are not entirely understood. We asked, âWhat if natural early adopters are not able to adopt early?â This paper is the first to measure the counterfactual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion curve that occurs when NEAs are not allowed to adopt early. The results suggest that NEAs can stifle broader <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion of a technology if their usual ability to be firstâand to derive value from being firstâis compromised. Small changes in the initial availability of a technology among different types of users can have a lasting effect on its potential.</p>

Seagrass ecosystems reduce exposure to bacterial pathogens of humans, fishes, and invertebrates
<p>Plants are important in urban environments for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">remov</span></strong>ing pathogens and improving water quality. Seagrass meadows are the most widespread coastal ecosystem on the planet. Although these plants are known to be associated with natural biocide production, they have not been evaluated for their ability to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">remov</span></strong>e microbiological contamination. Using amplicon sequencing of the 16<i>S</i> ribosomal RNA gene, we found that when seagrass meadows are present, there was a 50% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion in the relative abundance of potential bacterial pathogens capable of causing disease in humans and marine organisms. Moreover, field surveys of more than 8000 reef-building corals located adjacent to seagrass meadows showed twofold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ions in disease levels compared to corals at paired sites without adjacent seagrass meadows. These results highlight the importance of seagrass ecosystems to the health of humans and other organisms.</p>

Cognition-mediated evolution of low-quality floral nectars
<p>Plants pollinated by hummingbirds or bats produce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dilut</span></strong>e nectars even though these animals prefer more concentrated sugar solutions. This mismatch is an unsolved evolutionary paradox. Here we show that lower quality, or more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dilut</span></strong>e, nectars evolve when the strength of preferring larger quantities or higher qualities of nectar diminishes as magnitudes of the physical stimuli increase. In a virtual evolution experiment conducted in the tropical rainforest, bats visited computer-automated flowers with simulated genomes that evolved relatively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dilut</span></strong>e nectars. Simulations replicated this evolution only when value functions, which relate the physical stimuli to subjective sensations, were nonlinear. Selection also depended on the supply/demand ratio; bats selected for more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dilut</span></strong>e nectar when competition for food was higher. We predict such a pattern to generally occur when decision-makers consider multiple value dimensions simultaneously, and increases of psychological value are not fully proportional to increases in physical magnitude.</p>

Diurnal Variation in Nonstructural Carbohydrate Storage in Trees: Remobilization and Vertical Mixing
<p>Nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) storage plays a critical role in tree function and survival, but understanding and predicting local NSC storage dynamics is challenging because NSC storage pools are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed throughout the complex architecture of trees and continuously exchange carbon between source and sink organs at different time scales. To address these knowledge gaps, characterization and understanding of NSC diel variation are necessary. Here, we analyzed diurnal NSC dynamics in the overall architecture of almond (<i>Prunus dulcis</i>) trees. We also analyzed the allocation of newly assimilated carbon using isotopic labeling. We show that both components of NSC (i.e. soluble carbohydrates and starch) are highly dynamic at the diurnal time scale and that these trends are influenced by tissue type, age, and/or position within the canopy. In leaves, starch reserves can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deplet</span></strong>ed completely during the night, while woody tissue starch levels may vary by more than 50% over a daily cycle. Recently assimilated carbon showed a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed downward allocation across the entire tree. NSC diurnal fluctuations within the treeâs structure in combination with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed carbon allocation patterns provide evidence for the presence of vertical mixing and suggest that the xylem acts as a secondary NSC redistribution pathway.</p>

The Potato MAP3K StVIK Is Required for the <i>Phytophthora infestans</i> RXLR Effector Pi17316 to Promote Disease
<p>Plant pathogens deliver effectors to manipulate processes in their hosts, creating a suitable environment for invasion and proliferation. Yet, little is known about the host proteins that are targeted by effectors from filamentous pathogens. Here, we show that stable transgenic expression in potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>) and transient expression in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> of the arginine-any amino acid-leucine-arginine effector Pi17316 enhances leaf colonization by the late blight pathogen <i>Phytophthora infestans</i>. Expression of Pi17316 also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ates cell death triggered by the pathogen-associated molecular pattern Infestin1 (INF1), indicating that the effector suppresses pattern-triggered immunity. However, this effector does not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ate cell death triggered by a range of resistance proteins, showing that it specifically suppresses INF1-triggered cell death (ICD). In yeast two-hybrid assays, Pi17316 interacts directly with the potato ortholog of VASCULAR HIGHWAY1-interacting kinase (StVIK), encoding a predicted MEK kinase (MAP3K). Interaction in planta was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and occurs at the plant plasma membrane. Virus-induced gene silencing of <i>VIK</i> in <i>N. benthamiana</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ated <i>P. infestans</i> colonization, whereas transient overexpression of <i>StVIK</i> enhanced colonization, indicating that this host protein acts as a susceptibility factor. Moreover, <i>VIK</i> overexpression specifically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ated ICD, indicating that it is a negative regulator of immunity. The abilities of Pi17316 to enhance <i>P. infestans</i> colonization or suppress ICD were compromised significantly in <i>NbVIK</i>-silenced plants, demonstrating that the effector activity of Pi17316 is mediated by this MAP3K. Thus, StVIK is exploited by <i>P. infestans</i> as a susceptibility factor to promote late blight disease.</p>

Evidence That Isoprene Emission Is Not Limited by Cytosolic Metabolites. Exogenous Malate Does Not Invert the Reverse Sensitivity of Isoprene Emission to High [CO<sub>2</sub>]
<p>Isoprene is synthesized via the chloroplastic 2-<i>C</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-erythritol 4-phosphate/1-deoxy-<sc>d</sc>-xylulose 5-phosphate pathway (MEP/DOXP), and its synthesis is directly related to photosynthesis, except under high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, when the rate of photosynthesis increases but isoprene emission decreases. Suppression of MEP/DOXP pathway activity by high CO<sub>2</sub> has been explained either by limited supply of the cytosolic substrate precursor, phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate (PEP), into chloroplast as the result of enhanced activity of cytosolic PEP carboxylase or by limited supply of energetic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ive equivalents. We tested the PEP-limitation hypotheses by feeding leaves with the PEP carboxylase competitive inhibitors malate and diethyl oxalacetate (DOA) in the strong isoprene emitter hybrid aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> Ã <i>Populus tremuloides</i>). Malate feeding resulted in the inhibition of net assimilation, photosynthetic electron transport, and isoprene emission rates, but DOA feeding did not affect any of these processes except at very high application concentrations. Both malate and DOA did not alter the sensitivity of isoprene emission to high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. Malate inhibition of isoprene emission was associated with enhanced chloroplastic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ive status that suppressed light reactions of photosynthesis, ultimately leading to reduced isoprene substrate dimethylallyl diphosphate pool size. Additional experiments with altered oxygen concentrations in conditions of feedback-limited and non-feedback-limited photosynthesis further indicated that changes in isoprene emission rate in control and malate-inhibited leaves were associated with changes in the share of ATP and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ive equivalent supply for isoprene synthesis. The results of this study collectively indicate that malate importantly controls the chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ive status and, thereby, affects isoprene emission, but they do not support the hypothesis that cytosolic metabolite availability alters the response of isoprene emission to changes in atmospheric composition.</p>

A Program for Iron Economy during Deficiency Targets Specific Fe Proteins
<p>Iron (Fe) is an essential element for plants, utilized in nearly every cellular process. Because the adjustment of uptake under Fe limitation cannot satisfy all demands, plants need to acclimate their physiology and biochemistry, especially in their chloroplasts, which have a high demand for Fe. To investigate if a program exists for the utilization of Fe under deficiency, we analyzed how hydroponically grown Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) adjusts its physiology and Fe protein composition in vegetative photosynthetic tissue during Fe deficiency. Fe deficiency first affected photosynthetic electron transport with concomitant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ions in carbon assimilation and biomass production when effects on respiration were not yet significant. Photosynthetic electron transport function and protein levels of Fe-dependent enzymes were fully recovered upon Fe resupply, indicating that the Fe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deplet</span></strong>ion stress did not cause irreversible secondary damage. At the protein level, ferredoxin, the cytochrome-<i>b<sub>6</sub>f</i> complex, and Fe-containing enzymes of the plastid sulfur assimilation pathway were major targets of Fe deficiency, whereas other Fe-dependent functions were relatively less affected. In coordination, SufA and SufB, two proteins of the plastid Fe-sulfur cofactor assembly pathway, were also diminished early by Fe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deplet</span></strong>ion. Iron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deplet</span></strong>ion reduced mRNA levels for the majority of the affected proteins, indicating that loss of enzyme was not just due to lack of Fe cofactors. SufB and ferredoxin were early targets of transcript down-regulation. The data reveal a hierarchy for Fe utilization in photosynthetic tissue and indicate that a program is in place to acclimate to impending Fe deficiency.</p>

Dynamic Interplay between Nucleoid Segregation and Genome Integrity in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> Chloroplasts
<p>The chloroplast (cp) genome is organized as nucleoids that are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed throughout the cp stroma. Previously, a cp homolog of bacterial recombinase RecA (cpRECA) was shown to be involved in the maintenance of cp genome integrity by repairing damaged chloroplast DNA and by suppressing aberrant recombination between short <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed repeats in the moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. Here, overexpression and knockdown analysis of cpRECA in the green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> revealed that cpRECA was involved in cp nucleoid dynamics as well as having a role in maintaining cp genome integrity. Overexpression of <i>cpRECA</i> tagged with yellow fluorescent protein or hemagglutinin resulted in the formation of giant filamentous structures that colocalized exclusively to chloroplast DNA and cpRECA localized to cp nucleoids in a heterogenous manner. Knockdown of <i>cpRECA</i> led to a significant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion in cp nucleoid number that was accompanied by nucleoid enlargement. This phenotype resembled those of gyrase inhibitor-treated cells and <i>monokaryotic chloroplast</i> mutant cells and suggested that cpRECA was involved in organizing cp nucleoid dynamics. The cp genome also was destabilized by induced recombination between short <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed repeats in <i>cpRECA-</i>knockdown cells and gyrase inhibitor-treated cells. Taken together, these results suggest that cpRECA and gyrase are both involved in nucleoid dynamics and the maintenance of genome integrity and that the mechanisms underlying these processes may be intimately related in <i>C. reinhardtii</i> cps.</p>

The Chinese soft-shelled turtle, <i>Pelodiscus sinensis</i>, decreases nitrogenous excretion, reduces urea synthesis and suppresses ammonia production during emersion
<p>The objective of this study was to examine the effects of 6 days of emersion on nitrogen metabolism and excretion in the Chinese soft-shelled turtle, <i>Pelodiscus sinensis</i>. Despite having a soft shell with a cutaneous surface that is known to be water permeable, <i>P. sinensis</i> lost only ~2% of body mass and was able to maintain its hematocrit and plasma osmolality, [Na<sup>+</sup>] and [Cl<sup>â</sup>] during 6 days of emersion. During emersion, it ameliorated water loss by reducing urine output, which led to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion (by 29â76%) in ammonia excretion. In comparison, there was a more prominent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion (by 82â99%) in urea excretion during emersion due to a lack of water to flush the buccopharyngeal epithelium, which is known to be the major route of urea excretion. Consequently, emersion resulted in an apparent shift from ureotely to ammonotely in <i>P. sinensis</i>. Although urea concentration increased in several tissues, the excess urea accumulated could only account for 13â22% of the deficit in urea excretion. Hence, it can be concluded that a decrease (~80%) in urea synthesis occurred in <i>P. sinensis</i> during the 6 days of emersion. Indeed, emersion led to significant decreases in the activity of some ornithineâurea cycle enzymes (argininosuccinate synthetase/argininosuccinate lyase and arginase) from the liver of <i>P. sinensis</i>. As a decrease in urea synthesis occurred without the accumulation of ammonia and total free amino acids, it can be deduced that ammonia production through amino acid catabolism was suppressed with a proportional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion in proteolysis in <i>P. sinensis</i> during emersion. Indeed, calculated results revealed that there could be a prominent decrease (~88%) in ammonia production in turtles after 6 days of emersion. In summary, despite being ureogenic and ureotelic in water, <i>P. sinensis</i> adopted a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion in ammonia production, instead of increased urea synthesis, as the major strategy to ameliorate ammonia toxicity and problems associated with dehydration during terrestrial exposure.</p>

Median (interquartile range) baseline hsCRP was 1.8 (0.9â3.6) mg/L and levels were not altered by evolocumab (change at 48 weeks of â0.2 mg/dL [â1.0 to 0.4] in both treatment arms).

High-Target Versus Low-Target Blood Pressure Management During Cardiopulmonary Bypass to Prevent Cerebral Injury in Cardiac Surgery Patients
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cerebral injury is an important complication after cardiac surgery with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. The rate of overt stroke after cardiac surgery is 1% to 2%, whereas silent strokes, detected by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, are found in up to 50% of patients. It is unclear whether a higher versus a lower blood pressure during cardiopulmonary bypass reduces cerebral infarction in these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a patient- and assessor-blinded randomized trial, we allocated patients to a higher (70â80 mmâHg) or lower (40â50 mmâHg) target for mean arterial pressure by the titration of norepinephrine during cardiopulmonary bypass. Pump flow was fixed at 2.4 LÂ·min<sup>â1</sup>Â·m<sup>â2</sup>. The primary outcome was the total volume of new ischemic cerebral lesions (summed in millimeters cubed), expressed as the difference between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-weighted imaging conducted preoperatively and again postoperatively between days 3 and 6. Secondary outcomes included <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-weighted imagingâevaluated total number of new ischemic lesions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among the 197 enrolled patients, mean (SD) age was 65.0 (10.7) years in the low-target group (n=99) and 69.4 (8.9) years in the high-target group (n=98). Procedural risk scores were comparable between groups. Overall, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-weighted imaging revealed new cerebral lesions in 52.8% of patients in the low-target group versus 55.7% in the high-target group (<i>P</i>=0.76). The primary outcome of volume of new cerebral lesions was comparable between groups, 25 mm<sup>3</sup> (interquartile range, 0â118 mm<sup>3</sup>; range, 0â25â261 mm<sup>3</sup>) in the low-target group versus 29 mm<sup>3</sup> (interquartile range, 0â143 mm<sup>3</sup>; range, 0â22â116 mm<sup>3</sup>) in the high-target group (median difference estimate, 0; 95% confidence interval, â25 to 0.028; <i>P</i>=0.99), as was the secondary outcome of number of new lesions (1 [interquartile range, 0â2; range, 0â24] versus 1 [interquartile range, 0â2; range, 0â29] respectively; median difference estimate, 0; 95% confidence interval, 0â0; <i>P</i>=0.71). No significant difference was observed in frequency of severe adverse events.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among patients undergoing on-pump cardiac surgery, targeting a higher versus a lower mean arterial pressure during cardiopulmonary bypass did not seem to affect the volume or number of new cerebral infarcts.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Benefit of Adding Ezetimibe to Statin Therapy on Cardiovascular Outcomes and Safety in Patients With Versus Without Diabetes Mellitus
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Ezetimibe, when added to simvastatin, reduces cardiovascular events after acute coronary syndrome. We explored outcomes stratified by diabetes mellitus (DM).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In IMPROVE-IT (Improved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial), 18â144 patients after acute coronary syndrome with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 50 to 125 mg/dL were randomized to 40 mg ezetimibe/simvastatin (E/S) or 40 mg placebo/simvastatin. The primary composite end point was cardiovascular death, major coronary events, and stroke. DM was a prespecified subgroup.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The 4933 (27%) patients with DM were more often older and female, had had a prior myocardial infarction and revascularization, and presented more frequently with non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome compared with patients without DM (each <i>P</i><0.001). The median admission low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was lower among patients with DM (89 versus 97 mg/dL, <i>P</i><0.001). E/S achieved a significantly lower median time-weighted average low-density lipoprotein cholesterol compared with placebo/simvastatin, irrespective of DM (DM: 49 versus 67 mg/dL; no DM: 55 versus 71 mg/dL; both <i>P</i><0.001). In patients with DM, E/S reduced the 7-year KaplanâMeier primary end point event rate by 5.5% absolute (hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.78-0.94); in patients without DM, the absolute difference was 0.7% (hazard ratio, 0.98; 95% confidence interval, 0.91â1.04; <i>P</i><sub>int</sub>=0.02). The largest relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ions in patients with DM were in myocardial infarction (24%) and ischemic stroke (39%). No differences in safety outcomes by treatment were present regardless of DM. When stratified further by age, patients â¥75 years of age had a 20% relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion in the primary end point regardless of DM (<i>P</i><sub>int</sub>=0.91), whereas patients <75 years of age with DM had greater benefit than those without (<i>P</i><sub>int</sub>=0.011). When stratified by the TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) Risk Score for Secondary Prevention, all patients with DM demonstrated benefit with E/S regardless of risk.

Prevention of Stroke with the Addition of Ezetimibe to Statin Therapy in Patients With Acute Coronary Syndrome in IMPROVE-IT (Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients who experience an acute coronary syndrome are at heightened risk of recurrent ischemic events, including stroke. Ezetimibe improved cardiovascular outcomes when added to statin therapy in patients stabilized after acute coronary syndrome. We investigated the efficacy of the addition of ezetimibe to simvastatin for the prevention of stroke and other adverse cardiovascular events in IMPROVE-IT (Improved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial), with a focus on patients with a stroke before randomization.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients who experienced acute coronary syndrome were randomized to a placebo/simvastatin or ezetimibe/simvastatin regimen and followed for a median of 6 years.

Transcatheter Treatment of Severe Tricuspid Regurgitation With the Edge-to-Edge MitraClip Technique
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Current surgical and medical treatment options for severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) are limited, and additional interventional approaches are required. In the present observational study, the safety and feasibility of transcatheter repair of chronic severe TR with the MitraClip system were evaluated. In addition, the effects on clinical symptoms were assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients with heart failure symptoms and severe TR on optimal medical treatment were treated with the MitraClip system. Safety, defined as periprocedural adverse events such as death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiac tamponade, and feasibility, defined as successful implantation of 1 or more MitraClip devices and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion of TR by at least 1 grade, were evaluated before <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e and after 30 days. In addition, functional outcome, defined as changes in New York Heart Assocation class and 6-minute walking distance, were assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We included 64 consecutive patients (mean age 76.6Â±10 years) deemed unsuitable for surgery who underwent MitraClip treatment for chronic, severe TR for compassionate use. Functional TR was present in 88%; in addition, 22 patients were also treated with the MitraClip system for mitral regurgitation as a combined procedure. The degree of TR was severe or massive in 88% of patients before the procedure. The MitraClip device was successfully implanted in the tricuspid valve in 97% of the cases. After the procedure, TR was reduced by at least 1 grade in 91% of the patients, thereof 4% that were reduced from massive to severe. In 13% of patients, TR remained severe after the procedure. Significant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ions in effective regurgitant orifice area (0.9Â±0.3cm<sup>2</sup> versus 0.4Â±0.2cm<sup>2</sup>; <i>P</i><0.001), vena contracta width (1.1Â±0.5 cm versus 0.6Â±0.3 cm; <i>P</i>=0.001), and regurgitant volume (57.2Â±12.8 mL/beat versus 30.8Â±6.9 mL/beat; <i>P</i><0.001) were observed. No intraprocedural deaths, cardiac tamponade, emergency surgery, stroke, myocardial infarction, or major vascular complications occurred. Three (5%) in-hospital deaths occurred.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Cellulose-Derived Oligomers Act as Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns and Trigger Defense-Like Responses
<p>The plant cell wall, often the site of initial encounters between plants and their microbial pathogens, is composed of a complex mixture of cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin polysaccharides as well as proteins. The concept of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) was proposed to describe plant elicitors like oligogalacturonides (OGs), which can be derived by the breakdown of the pectin homogalacturon by pectinases. OGs act via many of the same signaling steps as pathogen- or microbe-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) to elicit defenses and provide protection against pathogens. Given both the complexity of the plant cell wall and the fact that many pathogens secrete a wide range of cell wall-degrading enzymes, we reasoned that the breakdown products of other cell wall polymers may be similarly biologically active as elicitors and may help to reinforce the perception of danger by plant cells. Our results indicate that oligomers derived from cellulose are perceived as signal molecules in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), triggering a signaling cascade that shares some similarities to responses to well-known elicitors such as chitooligomers and OGs. However, in contrast to other known PAMPs/DAMPs, cellobiose stimulates neither detectable reactive oxygen species production nor callose deposition. Confirming our idea that both PAMPs and DAMPs are likely to cooccur at infection sites, cotreatments of cellobiose with flg22 or chitooligomers led to synergistic increases in gene expression. Thus, the perception of cellulose-derived oligomers may participate in cell wall integrity surveillance and represents an additional layer of signaling following plant cell wall breakdown during cell wall remodeling or pathogen attack.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Selective Sweeps across Twenty Millions Years of Primate Evolution
<p>The contribution from selective sweeps to variation in genetic diversity has proven notoriously difficult to assess, in part because polymorphism data only allows detection of sweeps in the most recent few hundred thousand years. Here, we show how linked selection in ancestral species can be quantified across evolutionary timescales by analyzing patterns of incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) along the genomes of closely related species. We show that sweeps in the humanâchimpanzee and humanâorangutan ancestors can be identified as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deplet</span></strong>ions of ILS in regions in excess of 100 kb in length. Sweeps predicted in each ancestral species, as well as recurrent sweeps predicted in both species, often overlap sweeps predicted in humans. This suggests that many genomic regions experience recurrent selective sweeps. By comparing the ILS patterns along the genomes of the closely related humanâchimpanzee and humanâorangutan ancestors, we are further able to quantify the impact of selective sweeps relative to that of background selection. Compared with the humanâorangutan ancestor, the humanâchimpanzee ancestor shows a strong excess of regions <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deplet</span></strong>ed of ILS as well as a stronger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion in ILS around genes. We conclude that sweeps play a strong role in reducing diversity along the genome and that sweeps have reduced diversity in the humanâchimpanzee ancestor much more than in the humanâorangutan ancestor.</p>

Simultaneous high-resolution pH and spectrophotometric recordings of oxygen binding in blood microvolumes
<p>Oxygen equilibrium curves have been widely used to understand oxygen transport in numerous organisms. A major challenge has been to monitor oxygen binding characteristics and concomitant pH changes as they occur <i>in vivo</i>, in limited sample volumes. Here we report a technique allowing highly resolved and simultaneous monitoring of pH and blood pigment saturation in minute blood volumes. We equipped a gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion chamber with a broad-range fibre-optic spectrophotometer and a micro-pH optode and recorded changes of pigment oxygenation along oxygen partial pressure (<i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) and pH gradients to test the setup. Oxygen binding parameters derived from measurements in only 15 Î¼l of haemolymph from the cephalopod <i>Octopus vulgaris</i> showed low instrumental error (0.93%) and good agreement with published data. Broad-range spectra, each resolving 2048 data points, provided detailed insight into the complex absorbance characteristics of diverse blood types. After consideration of photobleaching and intrinsic fluorescence, pH optodes yielded accurate recordings and resolved a sigmoidal shift of 0.03 pH units in response to changing <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> from 0 to 21 kPa. Highly resolved continuous recordings along pH gradients conformed to stepwise measurements at low rates of pH changes. In this study we showed that a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion chamber upgraded with a broad-range spectrophotometer and an optical pH sensor accurately characterizes oxygen binding with minimal sample consumption and manipulation. We conclude that the modified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion chamber is highly suitable for experimental biologists who demand high flexibility, detailed insight into oxygen binding as well as experimental and biological accuracy combined in a single setup.</p>

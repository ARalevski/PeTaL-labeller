Legacy nitrogen may prevent achievement of water quality goals in the Gulf of Mexico
<p>In August 2017, the Gulf of Mexico’s hypoxic zone was declared to be the largest ever measured. It has been estimated that a 60% decrease in watershed nitrogen (N) loading may be necessary to adequately reduce eutrophication in the Gulf. However, to date there has been no rigorous assessment of the effect of N legacies on achieving water quality goals. In this study, we show that even if agricultural N use became 100% efficient, it would take decades to meet target N loads due to legacy N within the Mississippi River basin. Our results suggest that both long-term commitment and large-scale changes in agricultural management practices will be necessary to decrease Mississippi N loads and to meet current goals for reducing the size of the Gulf hypoxic zone.</p>

Above- and belowground controls on water use by trees of different wood types in an eastern US deciduous forest
<p>Stomata control tree transpiration by sensing and integrating environmental signals originating in the atmosphere and soil, and co-occurring species may differ in inherent stomatal sensitivity to these above- and belowground signals and in the types of signals to which they respond. Stomatal responsiveness to environmental signals is likely to differ across species having different types of wood (e.g., ring-porous, diffuse-porous and coniferous) because each wood type differs in the structure, size and spatial distribution of its xylem conduits as well as in the scaling of hydraulic properties with stem diameter. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of variation in soil water availability and atmospheric evaporative demand on stomatal regulation of transpiration in seven co-occurring temperate deciduous forest species representing three wood types. We measured whole-tree sap flux and soil and atmospheric variables in a mixed deciduous forest in central Pennsylvania over the course of a growing season characterized by severe drought and large fluctuations in atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (<i>D</i>). The relative sensitivity of sap flux to soil drying was ∼2.2–2.3 times greater in the diffuse-porous and coniferous species than in the ring-porous species. Stomata of the ring-porous oaks were only about half as responsive to increased <i>D</i> as those of trees of the other two wood types. These differences in responsiveness to changes in the below- and aboveground environment implied that regulation of leaf water potential in the ring-porous oaks was less stringent than that in the diffuse-porous angiosperms or the conifers. The results suggest that increases in the frequency or intensity of summer droughts in the study region could have multiple consequences for forest function, including altered successional time courses or climax species composition and cumulative effects on whole-tree architecture, resulting in a structural and physiological legacy that would restrict the ability of trees to respond rapidly to more favorable growth conditions.</p>

Adaptive introgression enables evolutionary rescue from extreme environmental pollution
<p>Radical environmental change that provokes population decline can impose constraints on the sources of genetic variation that may enable evolutionary rescue. Adaptive toxicant resistance has rapidly evolved in Gulf killifish (<i>Fundulus grandis</i>) that occupy polluted habitats. We show that resistance scales with pollution level and negatively correlates with inducibility of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) signaling. Loci with the strongest signatures of recent selection harbor genes regulating AHR signaling. Two of these loci introgressed recently (18 to 34 generations ago) from Atlantic killifish (<i>F. heteroclitus</i>). One introgressed locus contains a deletion in <i>AHR</i> that confers a large adaptive advantage [selection coefficient (<i>s</i>) = 0.8]. Given the limited migration of killifish, recent adaptive introgression was likely mediated by human-assisted transport. We suggest that interspecies connectivity may be an important source of adaptive variation during extreme environmental change.</p>

Replicating Meyerhoff for inclusive excellence in STEM
<p>Ethnic minorities comprise rapidly growing portions of the populations of most developed countries (<i>1</i>) but are underrepresented in fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) (<i>2</i>, <i>3</i>). Efforts to increase diversity in the STEM workforce, important for developing more effective approaches to group problem-solving (<i>4</i>–<i>6</i>), have been under way in the United States for decades, but widespread impact remains relatively low (<i>3</i>). The Meyerhoff Scholars Program (MYS) at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), provides a promising model for increasing retention and academic performance of underrepresented minority (URM) undergraduates in STEM and for preparing those undergraduates to pursue and succeed in graduate and professional programs (<i>7</i>, <i>8</i>). Although MYS is nearly 30 years old and outcomes for African-American STEM majors have been extensively documented [see (<i>7</i>, <i>8</i>) and references therein], no other majority university [not meeting the definition of being a minority-serving institution (MSI) (<i>9</i>)] has achieved similar outcomes (<i>10</i>). We describe here some promising early indicators that an interinstitutional partnership approach can help enable MYS-like outcomes at majority universities with different URM compositions, geographies, and institutional sizes and cultures: The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) and Pennsylvania State University at University Park (PSU).</p>

Early Ceremonial Constructions at Ceibal, Guatemala, and the Origins of Lowland Maya Civilization
<sec><title>Early Mayan Architects</title><p>Lowland Mayan civilizations began to construct dramatic pyramids beginning about 900 BCE. The cultural origins of these civilizations have been uncertain, particularly the connection to earlier Olmec cultures along the Gulf of Mexico. <bold>Inomata <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 467; see the cover; see the News story by Pringle) describe excavations and extensive radiocarbon dating at the early Mayan city of Ceibal in Guatamala. The site shows incipient plaza and pyramid construction beginning before those seen in the lowlands or Olmec areas, suggesting a broader cultural exchange through to the Pacific Coast as Mayan cultures evolved.</p></sec>

Renoguanylin stimulates apical CFTR translocation and decreases HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> secretion through PKA activity in the Gulf toadfish (<i>Opsanus beta</i>)
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Renoguanylin stimulation radically alters the physiology of Gulf toadfish enterocytes via protein kinase A, by reversing ion-absorbing mechanisms, inhibiting HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> secretion and causing insertion of CFTR into the apical membrane.</p>

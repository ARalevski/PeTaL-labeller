Electromagnetic evidence that SSS17a is the result of a binary neutron star merger
<p>Eleven hours after the detection of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravit</span></strong>ational wave source GW170817 by the Laser Interferometer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravit</span></strong>ational-Wave Observatory and Virgo Interferometers, an associated optical transient, SSS17a, was identified in the galaxy NGC 4993. Although the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravit</span></strong>ational wave data indicate that GW170817 is consistent with the merger of two compact objects, the electromagnetic observations provide independent constraints on the nature of that system. We synthesize the optical to near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy of SSS17a collected by the One-Meter Two-Hemisphere collaboration, finding that SSS17a is unlike other known transients. The source is best described by theoretical models of a kilonova consisting of radioactive elements produced by rapid neutron capture (the r-process). We conclude that SSS17a was the result of a binary neutron star merger, reinforcing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravit</span></strong>ational wave result.</p>

A surface gravity traverse on Mars indicates low bedrock density at Gale crater
<p>Gravimetry, the precise measurement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravit</span></strong>ational fields, can be used to probe the internal structure of Earth and other planets. The Curiosity rover on Mars carries accelerometers normally used for navigation and attitude determination. We have recalibrated them to isolate the signature of the changing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravit</span></strong>ational acceleration as the rover climbs through Gale crater. The subsurface rock density is inferred from the measured decrease in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravit</span></strong>ational field strength with elevation. The density of the sedimentary rocks in Gale crater is 1680 ± 180 kilograms per cubic meter. This value is lower than expected, indicating a high porosity and constraining maximum burial depths of the rocks over their history.</p>

Origin of the bright photoluminescence of few-atom silver clusters confined in LTA zeolites
<p>Silver (Ag) clusters confined in matrices possess remarkable luminescence properties, but little is known about their structural and electronic properties. We characterized the bright green luminescence of Ag clusters confined in partially exchanged Ag–Linde Type A (LTA) zeolites by means of a combination of x-ray excited optical luminescence-extended x-ray absorption fine structure, time-dependent–density functional theory calculations, and time-resolved spectroscopy. A mixture of tetrahedral Ag<sub>4</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<i><sub>x</sub></i><sup>2+</sup> (<i>x</i> = 2 and <i>x</i> = 4) clusters occupies the center of a fraction of the sodalite cages. Their optical properties originate from a confined two-electron superatom quantum system with hybridized Ag and water O <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orbit</span></strong>als delocalized over the cluster. Upon excitation, one electron of the s-type highest occupied molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orbit</span></strong>al is promoted to the p-type lowest unoccupied molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orbit</span></strong>als and relaxes through enhanced intersystem crossing into long-lived triplet states.</p>

<i>Swift</i> and <i>NuSTAR</i> observations of GW170817: Detection of a blue kilonova
<p>With the first direct detection of merging black holes in 2015, the era of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravit</span></strong>ational wave (GW) astrophysics began. A complete picture of compact object mergers, however, requires the detection of an electromagnetic (EM) counterpart. We report ultraviolet (UV) and x-ray observations by <i>Swift</i> and the <i>Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array</i> of the EM counterpart of the binary neutron star merger GW170817. The bright, rapidly fading UV emission indicates a high mass (≈0.03 solar masses) wind-driven outflow with moderate electron fraction (<i>Y</i><sub>e</sub> ≈ 0.27). Combined with the x-ray limits, we favor an observer viewing angle of ≈30° away from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orbit</span></strong>al rotation axis, which avoids both obscuration from the heaviest elements in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orbit</span></strong>al plane and a direct view of any ultrarelativistic, highly collimated ejecta (a γ-ray burst afterglow).</p>

Eliminating nonradiative decay in Cu(I) emitters: >99% quantum efficiency and microsecond lifetime
<p>Luminescent complexes of heavy metals such as iridium, platinum, and ruthenium play an important role in photocatalysis and energy conversion applications as well as organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). Achieving comparable performance from more–earth-abundant copper requires overcoming the weak spin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orbit</span></strong> coupling of the light metal as well as limiting the high reorganization energies typical in copper(I) [Cu(I)] complexes. Here we report that two-coordinate Cu(I) complexes with redox active ligands in coplanar conformation manifest suppressed nonradiative decay, reduced structural reorganization, and sufficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orbit</span></strong>al overlap for efficient charge transfer. We achieve photoluminescence efficiencies >99% and microsecond lifetimes, which lead to an efficient blue-emitting OLED. Photophysical analysis and simulations reveal a temperature-dependent interplay between emissive singlet and triplet charge-transfer states and amide-localized triplet states.</p>

Revealing hidden spin-momentum locking in a high-temperature cuprate superconductor
<p>Cuprate superconductors have long been thought of as having strong electronic correlations but negligible spin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orbit</span></strong> coupling. Using spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we discovered that one of the most studied cuprate superconductors, Bi2212, has a nontrivial spin texture with a spin-momentum locking that circles the Brillouin zone center and a spin-layer locking that allows states of opposite spin to be localized in different parts of the unit cell. Our findings pose challenges for the vast majority of models of cuprates, such as the Hubbard model and its variants, where spin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orbit</span></strong> interaction has been mostly neglected, and open the intriguing question of how the high-temperature superconducting state emerges in the presence of this nontrivial spin texture.</p>

Quantum entanglement of the spin and orbital angular momentum of photons using metamaterials
<p>Metamaterials constructed from deep subwavelength building blocks have been used to demonstrate phenomena ranging from negative refractive index and ε-near-zero to cloaking, emulations of general relativity, and superresolution imaging. More recently, metamaterials have been suggested as a new platform for quantum optics. We present the use of a dielectric metasurface to generate entanglement between the spin and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orbit</span></strong>al angular momentum of photons. We demonstrate the generation of the four Bell states on a single photon by using the geometric phase that arises from the photonic spin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orbit</span></strong> interaction and subsequently show nonlocal correlations between two photons that interacted with the metasurface. Our results show that metamaterials are suitable for the generation and manipulation of entangled photon states, introducing the area of quantum optics metamaterials.</p>

SSS17a is located in NGC 4993, an S0 galaxy at a distance of 40 megaparsecs.

Discovery of orbital-selective Cooper pairing in FeSe
<p>The superconductor iron selenide (FeSe) is of intense interest owing to its unusual nonmagnetic nematic state and potential for high-temperature superconductivity. But its Cooper pairing mechanism has not been determined. We used Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference imaging to determine the Fermi surface geometry of the electronic bands surrounding the Γ = (0, 0) and <i>X</i> = (π/<i>a</i><sub>Fe</sub>, 0) points of FeSe and to measure the corresponding superconducting energy gaps. We show that both gaps are extremely anisotropic but nodeless and that they exhibit gap maxima oriented orthogonally in momentum space. Moreover, by implementing a novel technique, we demonstrate that these gaps have opposite sign with respect to each other. This complex gap configuration reveals the existence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orbit</span></strong>al-selective Cooper pairing that, in FeSe, is based preferentially on electrons from the d<i><sub>yz</sub></i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orbit</span></strong>als of the iron atoms.</p>

A parity-breaking electronic nematic phase transition in the spin-orbit coupled metal Cd<sub>2</sub>Re<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>
<p>Strong electron interactions can drive metallic systems toward a variety of well-known symmetry-broken phases, but the instabilities of correlated metals with strong spin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orbit</span></strong> coupling have only recently begun to be explored. We uncovered a multipolar nematic phase of matter in the metallic pyrochlore Cd<sub>2</sub>Re<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> using spatially resolved second-harmonic optical anisotropy measurements. Like previously discovered electronic nematic phases, this multipolar phase spontaneously breaks rotational symmetry while preserving translational invariance. However, it has the distinguishing property of being odd under spatial inversion, which is allowed only in the presence of spin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orbit</span></strong> coupling. By examining the critical behavior of the multipolar nematic order parameter, we show that it drives the thermal phase transition near 200 kelvin in Cd<sub>2</sub>Re<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> and induces a parity-breaking lattice distortion as a secondary order.</p>

iPTF16geu: A multiply imaged, gravitationally lensed type Ia supernova
<p>We report the discovery of a multiply imaged, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravit</span></strong>ationally lensed type Ia supernova, iPTF16geu (SN 2016geu), at redshift <i>z</i> = 0.409. This phenomenon was identified because the light from the stellar explosion was magnified more than 50 times by the curvature of space around matter in an intervening galaxy. We used high-spatial-resolution observations to resolve four images of the lensed supernova, approximately 0.3 arc seconds from the center of the foreground galaxy. The observations probe a physical scale of ~1 kiloparsec, smaller than is typical in other studies of extragalactic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravit</span></strong>ational lensing. The large magnification and symmetric image configuration imply close alignment between the lines of sight to the supernova and to the lens. The relative magnifications of the four images provide evidence for substructures in the lensing galaxy.</p>

Surface changes on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko suggest a more active past
<p>The Rosetta spacecraft spent ~2 years <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orbit</span></strong>ing comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, most of it at distances that allowed surface characterization and monitoring at submeter scales. From December 2014 to June 2016, numerous localized changes were observed, which we attribute to cometary-specific weathering, erosion, and transient events driven by exposure to sunlight and other processes. While the localized changes suggest compositional or physical heterogeneity, their scale has not resulted in substantial alterations to the comet’s landscape. This suggests that most of the major landforms were created early in the comet’s current <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orbit</span></strong>al configuration. They may even date from earlier if the comet had a larger volatile inventory, particularly of CO or CO<sub>2</sub> ices, or contained amorphous ice, which could have triggered activity at greater distances from the Sun.</p>

Spiral density waves in a young protoplanetary disk
<p>Gravitational forces are expected to excite spiral density waves in protoplanetary disks, disks of gas and dust <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orbit</span></strong>ing young stars. However, previous observations that showed spiral structure were not able to probe disk midplanes, where most of the mass is concentrated and where planet formation takes place. Using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, we detected a pair of trailing symmetric spiral arms in the protoplanetary disk surrounding the young star Elias 2-27. The arms extend to the disk outer regions and can be traced down to the midplane. These millimeter-wave observations also reveal an emission gap closer to the star than the spiral arms. We argue that the observed spirals trace shocks of spiral density waves in the midplane of this young disk.</p>

Lack of Concordance Between Empirical Scores and Physician Assessments of Stroke and Bleeding Risk in Atrial Fibrillation

Saturn’s magnetic field revealed by the Cassini Grand Finale
<p>During 2017, the Cassini fluxgate magnetometer made in situ measurements of Saturn’s magnetic field at distances ~2550 ± 1290 kilometers above the 1-bar surface during 22 highly inclined Grand Finale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orbit</span></strong>s. These observations refine the extreme axisymmetry of Saturn’s internal magnetic field and show displacement of the magnetic equator northward from the planet’s physical equator. Persistent small-scale magnetic structures, corresponding to high-degree (>3) axisymmetric magnetic moments, were observed. This suggests secondary shallow dynamo action in the semiconducting region of Saturn’s interior. Some high-degree magnetic moments could arise from strong high-latitude concentrations of magnetic flux within the planet’s deep dynamo. A strong field-aligned current (FAC) system is located between Saturn and the inner edge of its D-ring, with strength comparable to the high-latitude auroral FACs.</p>

Dust grains fall from Saturn’s D-ring into its equatorial upper atmosphere
<p>The sizes of Saturn’s ring particles range from meters (boulders) to nanometers (dust). Determination of the rings’ ages depends on loss processes, including the transport of dust into Saturn’s atmosphere. During the Grand Finale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orbit</span></strong>s of the Cassini spacecraft, its instruments measured tiny dust grains that compose the innermost D-ring of Saturn. The nanometer-sized dust experiences collisions with exospheric (upper atmosphere) hydrogen and molecular hydrogen, which forces it to fall from the ring into the ionosphere and lower atmosphere. We used the Magnetospheric Imaging Instrument to detect and characterize this dust transport and also found that diffusion dominates above and near the altitude of peak ionospheric density. This mechanism results in a mass deposition into the equatorial atmosphere of ~5 kilograms per second, constraining the age of the D-ring.</p>

The low-frequency source of Saturn’s kilometric radiation
<p>Understanding how auroral radio emissions are produced by magnetized bodies requires in situ measurements within their source region.

We present wave and plasma measurements from the Cassini spacecraft during its ring-grazing high-inclination <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orbit</span></strong>s, which passed three times through the high-altitude SKR emission region. Northern dawn-side, narrow-banded radio sources were encountered at frequencies of 10 to 20 kilohertz, within regions of upward currents mapping to the ultraviolet auroral oval. The kilometric waves were produced on the extraordinary mode by the cyclotron maser instability from 6– to 12–kilo–electron volt electron beams and radiated quasi-perpendicularly to the auroral magnetic field lines. The SKR low-frequency sources appear to be strongly controlled by time-variable magnetospheric electron densities.</p>

Quantum oscillations of electrical resistivity in an insulator
<p>In metals, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orbit</span></strong>al motions of conduction electrons on the Fermi surface are quantized in magnetic fields, which is manifested by quantum oscillations in electrical resistivity. This Landau quantization is generally absent in insulators. Here, we report a notable exception in an insulator—ytterbium dodecaboride (YbB<sub>12</sub>). The resistivity of YbB<sub>12</sub>, which is of a much larger magnitude than the resistivity in metals, exhibits distinct quantum oscillations. These unconventional oscillations arise from the insulating bulk, even though the temperature dependence of the oscillation amplitude follows the conventional Fermi liquid theory of metals with a large effective mass. Quantum oscillations in the magnetic torque are also observed, albeit with a lighter effective mass.</p>

A dust-enshrouded tidal disruption event with a resolved radio jet in a galaxy merger

We have observed a transient source in the western nucleus of the merging galaxy pair Arp 299 that radiated >1.5 × 10<sup>52</sup> erg at infrared and radio wavelengths but was not luminous at optical or x-ray wavelengths. We interpret this as a TDE with much of its emission reradiated at infrared wavelengths by dust. Efficient reprocessing by dense gas and dust may explain the difference between theoretical predictions and observed luminosities of TDEs. The radio observations resolve an expanding and decelerating jet, probing the jet formation and evolution around a SMBH.</p>

Imaging of pure spin-valley diffusion current in WS<sub>2</sub>-WSe<sub>2</sub> heterostructures
<p>Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) materials are promising for spintronic and valleytronic applications because valley-polarized excitations can be generated and manipulated with circularly polarized photons and the valley and spin degrees of freedom are locked by strong spin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orbit</span></strong>al interactions. In this study we demonstrate efficient generation of a pure and locked spin-valley diffusion current in tungsten disulfide (WS<sub>2</sub>)–tungsten diselenide (WSe<sub>2</sub>) heterostructures without any driving electric field. We imaged the propagation of valley current in real time and space by pump-probe spectroscopy. The valley current in the heterostructures can live for more than 20 microseconds and propagate over 20 micrometers; both the lifetime and the diffusion length can be controlled through electrostatic gating. The high-efficiency and electric-field–free generation of a locked spin-valley current in TMDC heterostructures holds promise for applications in spin and valley devices.</p>

This record is forced at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orbit</span></strong>al precession frequencies, with higher rainfall observed during Northern Hemisphere summer insolation maxima, although this response is damped during cold interstadials. The <sup>10</sup>Be monsoon rainfall proxy is also highly correlated with global ice-volume variations, which differs from Chinese cave δ<sup>18</sup>O, which is only weakly correlated. We argue that both EASM intensity and Chinese cave δ<sup>18</sup>O are not governed by high-northern-latitude insolation, as suggested by others, but rather by low-latitude interhemispheric insolation gradients, which may also strongly influence global ice volume via monsoon dynamics.</p>

The Radio and Plasma Wave Science instrument detected a cold, dense, and dynamic ionosphere at Saturn that interacts with the rings. Plasma densities reached up to 1000 cubic centimeters, and electron temperatures were below 1160 kelvin near closest approach. The density varied between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orbit</span></strong>s by up to two orders of magnitude.

A radio counterpart to a neutron star merger

The detection of electromagnetic radiation from the same source has shown that the merger occurred in the outskirts of the galaxy NGC 4993, at a distance of 40 megaparsecs from Earth. We report the detection of a counterpart radio source that appears 16 days after the event, allowing us to diagnose the energetics and environment of the merger. The observed radio emission can be explained by either a collimated ultrarelativistic jet, viewed off-axis, or a cocoon of mildly relativistic ejecta. Within 100 days of the merger, the radio light curves will enable observers to distinguish between these models, and the angular velocity and geometry of the debris will be directly measurable by very long baseline interferometry.</p>

Early spectra of the gravitational wave source GW170817: Evolution of a neutron star merger

We report time-series spectroscopy of SSS17a from 11.75 hours until 8.5 days after the merger. Over the first hour of observations, the ejecta rapidly expanded and cooled. Applying blackbody fits to the spectra, we measured the photosphere cooling from [Formula] to [Formula] kelvin, and determined a photospheric velocity of roughly 30% of the speed of light. The spectra of SSS17a began displaying broad features after 1.46 days and evolved qualitatively over each subsequent day, with distinct blue (early-time) and red (late-time) components. The late-time component is consistent with theoretical models of r-process–enriched neutron star ejecta, whereas the blue component requires high-velocity, lanthanide-free material.</p>

Light curves of the neutron star merger GW170817/SSS17a: Implications for r-process nucleosynthesis
<p>On 17 August 2017, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravit</span></strong>ational waves (GWs) were detected from a binary neutron star merger, GW170817, along with a coincident short gamma-ray burst, GRB 170817A. An optical transient source, Swope Supernova Survey 17a (SSS17a), was subsequently identified as the counterpart of this event. We present ultraviolet, optical, and infrared light curves of SSS17a extending from 10.9 hours to 18 days postmerger. We constrain the radioactively powered transient resulting from the ejection of neutron-rich material. The fast rise of the light curves, subsequent decay, and rapid color evolution are consistent with multiple ejecta components of differing lanthanide abundance. The late-time light curve indicates that SSS17a produced at least ~0.05 solar masses of heavy elements, demonstrating that neutron star mergers play a role in rapid neutron capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis in the universe.</p>

Illuminating gravitational waves: A concordant picture of photons from a neutron star merger
<p>Merging neutron stars offer an excellent laboratory for simultaneously studying strong-field <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravit</span></strong>y and matter in extreme environments. We establish the physical association of an electromagnetic counterpart (EM170817) with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravit</span></strong>ational waves (GW170817) detected from merging neutron stars. By synthesizing a panchromatic data set, we demonstrate that merging neutron stars are a long-sought production site forging heavy elements by r-process nucleosynthesis. The weak gamma rays seen in EM170817 are dissimilar to classical short gamma-ray bursts with ultrarelativistic jets. Instead, we suggest that breakout of a wide-angle, mildly relativistic cocoon engulfing the jet explains the low-luminosity gamma rays, the high-luminosity ultraviolet-optical-infrared, and the delayed radio and x-ray emission. We posit that all neutron star mergers may lead to a wide-angle cocoon breakout, sometimes accompanied by a successful jet and sometimes by a choked jet.</p>

Disorder-induced optical transition from spin Hall to random Rashba effect
<p>Disordered structures give rise to intriguing phenomena owing to the complex nature of their interaction with light. We report on photonic spin-symmetry breaking and unexpected spin-optical transport phenomena arising from subwavelength-scale disordered geometric phase structure. Weak disorder induces a photonic spin Hall effect, observed via quantum weak measurements, whereas strong disorder leads to spin-split modes in momentum space, a random optical Rashba effect. Study of the momentum space entropy reveals an optical transition upon reaching a critical point where the structure’s anisotropy axis vanishes. Incorporation of singular topology into the disordered structure demonstrates repulsive vortex interaction depending on the disorder strength. The photonic disordered geometric phase can serve as a platform for the study of different phenomena emerging from complex media involving spin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orbit</span></strong> coupling.</p>

Observations and modeling of the elastogravity signals preceding direct seismic waves
<p>After an earthquake, the earliest deformation signals are not expected to be carried by the fastest (<i>P</i>) elastic waves but by the speed-of-light changes of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravit</span></strong>ational field. However, these perturbations are weak and, so far, their detection has not been accurate enough to fully understand their origins and to use them for a highly valuable rapid estimate of the earthquake magnitude. We show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gravit</span></strong>y perturbations are particularly well observed with broadband seismometers at distances between 1000 and 2000 kilometers from the source of the 2011, moment magnitude 9.1, Tohoku earthquake.

Arbitrary spin-to–orbital angular momentum conversion of light
<p>Optical elements that convert the spin angular momentum (SAM) of light into vortex beams have found applications in classical and quantum optics. These elements—SAM-to–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orbit</span></strong>al angular momentum (OAM) converters—are based on the geometric phase and only permit the conversion of left- and right-circular polarizations (spin states) into states with opposite OAM. We present a method for converting arbitrary SAM states into total angular momentum states characterized by a superposition of independent OAM. We designed a metasurface that converts left- and right-circular polarizations into states with independent values of OAM and designed another device that performs this operation for elliptically polarized states. These results illustrate a general material-mediated connection between SAM and OAM of light and may find applications in producing complex structured light and in optical communication.</p>

Spaceborne detection of localized carbon dioxide sources
<p>Spaceborne measurements by NASA’s Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) at the kilometer scale reveal distinct structures of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) caused by known anthropogenic and natural point sources. OCO-2 transects across the Los Angeles megacity (USA) show that anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> enhancements peak over the urban core and decrease through suburban areas to rural background values more than ~100 kilometers away, varying seasonally from ~4.4 to 6.1 parts per million. A transect passing directly downwind of the persistent isolated natural CO<sub>2</sub> plume from Yasur volcano (Vanuatu) shows a narrow filament of enhanced CO<sub>2</sub> values (~3.4 parts per million), consistent with a CO<sub>2</sub> point source emitting 41.6 kilotons per day. These examples highlight the potential of the OCO-2 sensor, with its unprecedented resolution and sensitivity, to detect localized natural and anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> sources.</p>

Influence of El Niño on atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> over the tropical Pacific Ocean: Findings from NASA’s OCO-2 mission
<p>Spaceborne observations of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 are used to characterize the response of tropical atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations to the strong El Niñño event of 2015–2016. Although correlations between the growth rate of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations and the El Niññño–Southern Oscillation are well known, the magnitude of the correlation and the timing of the responses of oceanic and terrestrial carbon cycle remain poorly constrained in space and time. We used space-based CO<sub>2</sub> observations to confirm that the tropical Pacific Ocean does play an early and important role in modulating the changes in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations during El Niñññño events—a phenomenon inferred but not previously observed because of insufficient high-density, broad-scale CO<sub>2</sub> observations over the tropics.</p>

OCO-2 advances photosynthesis observation from space via solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence
<p>Quantifying gross primary production (GPP) remains a major challenge in global carbon cycle research. Spaceborne monitoring of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), an integrative photosynthetic signal of molecular origin, can assist in terrestrial GPP monitoring. However, the extent to which SIF tracks spatiotemporal variations in GPP remains unresolved. Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2)’s SIF data acquisition and fine spatial resolution permit direct validation against ground and airborne observations. Empirical orthogonal function analysis shows consistent spatiotemporal correspondence between OCO-2 SIF and GPP globally. A linear SIF-GPP relationship is also obtained at eddy-flux sites covering diverse biomes, setting the stage for future investigations of the robustness of such a relationship across more biomes. Our findings support the central importance of high-quality satellite SIF for studying terrestrial carbon cycle dynamics.</p>

The seasonal pattern of uptake by the terrestrial biosphere is recorded in fluorescence and the drawdown of [Formula] during summer. Launched just before one of the most intense El Niños of the past century, OCO-2 measurements of [Formula] and fluorescence record the impact of the large change in ocean temperature and rainfall on uptake and release of CO<sub>2</sub> by the oceans and biosphere.</p>

Supersonic gas streams enhance the formation of massive black holes in the early universe
<p>The origin of super-massive black holes in the early universe remains poorly understood. Gravitational collapse of a massive primordial gas cloud is a promising initial process, but theoretical studies have difficulty growing the black hole fast enough. We report numerical simulations of early black hole formation starting from realistic cosmological conditions. Supersonic gas motions left over from the Big Bang prevent early gas cloud formation until rapid gas condensation is triggered in a protogalactic halo. A protostar is formed in the dense, turbulent gas cloud, and it grows by sporadic mass accretion until it acquires 34,000 solar masses. The massive star ends its life with a catastrophic collapse to leave a black hole—a promising seed for the formation of a monstrous black hole.</p>

Bismuthene on a SiC substrate: A candidate for a high-temperature quantum spin Hall material
<p>Quantum spin Hall materials hold the promise of revolutionary devices with dissipationless spin currents but have required cryogenic temperatures owing to small energy gaps. Here we show theoretically that a room-temperature regime with a large energy gap may be achievable within a paradigm that exploits the atomic spin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orbit</span></strong> coupling. The concept is based on a substrate-supported monolayer of a high–atomic number element and is experimentally realized as a bismuth honeycomb lattice on top of the insulating silicon carbide substrate SiC(0001). Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we detect a gap of ~0.8 electron volt and conductive edge states consistent with theory. Our combined theoretical and experimental results demonstrate a concept for a quantum spin Hall wide-gap scenario, where the chemical potential resides in the global system gap, ensuring robust edge conductance.</p>

Relativistic deflection of background starlight measures the mass of a nearby white dwarf star
<p>Gravitational deflection of starlight around the Sun during the 1919 total solar eclipse provided measurements that confirmed Einstein’s general theory of relativity. We have used the Hubble Space Telescope to measure the analogous process of astrometric microlensing caused by a nearby star, the white dwarf Stein 2051 B. As Stein 2051 B passed closely in front of a background star, the background star’s position was deflected. Measurement of this deflection at multiple epochs allowed us to determine the mass of Stein 2051 B—the sixth-nearest white dwarf to the Sun—as 0.675 ± 0.051 solar masses. This mass determination provides confirmation of the physics of degenerate matter and lends support to white dwarf evolutionary theory.</p>

Femtosecond x-ray spectroscopy of an electrocyclic ring-opening reaction
<p>The ultrafast light-activated electrocyclic ring-opening reaction of 1,3-cyclohexadiene is a fundamental prototype of photochemical pericyclic reactions. Generally, these reactions are thought to proceed through an intermediate excited-state minimum (the so-called pericyclic minimum), which leads to isomerization via nonadiabatic relaxation to the ground state of the photoproduct. Here, we used femtosecond (fs) soft x-ray spectroscopy near the carbon K-edge (~284 electron volts) on a table-top apparatus to directly reveal the valence electronic structure of this transient intermediate state. The core-to-valence spectroscopic signature of the pericyclic minimum observed in the experiment was characterized, in combination with time-dependent density functional theory calculations, to reveal overlap and mixing of the frontier valence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orbit</span></strong>al energy levels. We show that this transient valence electronic structure arises within 60 ± 20 fs after ultraviolet photoexcitation and decays with a time constant of 110 ± 60 fs.</p>

Real-time spectral interferometry probes the internal dynamics of femtosecond soliton molecules
<p>Solitons, particle-like excitations ubiquitous in many fields of physics, have been shown to exhibit bound states akin to molecules. The formation of such temporal soliton bound states and their internal dynamics have escaped direct experimental observation. By means of an emerging time-stretch technique, we resolve the evolution of femtosecond soliton molecules in the cavity of a few-cycle mode-locked laser. We track two- and three-soliton bound states over hundreds of thousands of consecutive cavity roundtrips, identifying fixed points and periodic and aperiodic molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orbit</span></strong>s. A class of trajectories acquires a path-dependent geometrical phase, implying that its dynamics may be topologically protected. These findings highlight the importance of real-time detection in resolving interactions in complex nonlinear systems, including the dynamics of soliton bound states, breathers, and rogue waves.</p>

Revealing the subfemtosecond dynamics of orbital angular momentum in nanoplasmonic vortices
<p>The ability of light to carry and deliver <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orbit</span></strong>al angular momentum (OAM) in the form of optical vortices has attracted much interest. The physical properties of light with a helical wavefront can be confined onto two-dimensional surfaces with subwavelength dimensions in the form of plasmonic vortices, opening avenues for thus far unknown light-matter interactions. Because of their extreme rotational velocity, the ultrafast dynamics of such vortices remained unexplored. Here we show the detailed spatiotemporal evolution of nanovortices using time-resolved two-photon photoemission electron microscopy. We observe both long- and short-range plasmonic vortices confined to deep subwavelength dimensions on the scale of 100 nanometers with nanometer spatial resolution and subfemtosecond time-step resolution. Finally, by measuring the angular velocity of the vortex, we directly extract the OAM magnitude of light.</p>

Seasonal exposure of carbon dioxide ice on the nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is one of the most abundant species in cometary nuclei, but because of its high volatility, CO<sub>2</sub> ice is generally only found beneath the surface. We report the infrared spectroscopic identification of a CO<sub>2</sub> ice–rich surface area located in the Anhur region of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Spectral modeling shows that about 0.1% of the 80- by 60-meter area is CO<sub>2</sub> ice. This exposed ice was observed a short time after the comet exited local winter; following the increased illumination, the CO<sub>2</sub> ice completely disappeared over about 3 weeks. We estimate the mass of the sublimated CO<sub>2</sub> ice and the depth of the eroded surface layer. We interpret the presence of CO<sub>2</sub> ice as the result of the extreme seasonal changes induced by the rotation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orbit</span></strong> of the comet.</p>

We investigated the dynamics of electrons in moiré minibands by measuring ballistic transport between adjacent local contacts in a magnetic field, known as the transverse electron focusing effect. At low temperatures, we observed caustics of skipping <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orbit</span></strong>s extending over hundreds of superlattice periods, reversals of the cyclotron revolution for successive minibands, and breakdown of cyclotron motion near van Hove singularities.

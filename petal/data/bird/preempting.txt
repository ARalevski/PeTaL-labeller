Canagliflozin for Primary and Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular Events
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Canagliflozin is a sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor that significantly reduces the composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and elevated cardiovascular risk. The comparative effects among participants with and without a history of cardiovascular disease (secondary versus primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ion) were prespecified for evaluation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The CANVAS Program (Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study) randomly assigned 10 142 participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus to canagliflozin or placebo. The primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ion cohort comprised individuals ≥50 years of age with ≥2 risk factors for cardiovascular events but with no prior cardiovascular event, and the secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ion cohort comprised individuals ≥30 years of age with a prior cardiovascular event. The primary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. Secondary outcomes included heart failure hospitalization and a renal composite (40% reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate, renal replacement therapy, or renal death).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ion participants (N=3486; 34%) were younger (63 versus 64 years of age), were more often female (45% versus 31%), and had a longer duration of diabetes mellitus (14 versus 13 years) compared with secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ion participants (N=6656; 66%). The primary end point event rate was higher in the secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ion group compared with the primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ion group (36.9 versus 15.7/1000 patient-years, <i>P</i><0.001). In the total cohort, the primary end point was reduced with canagliflozin compared with placebo (26.9 versus 31.5/1000 patient-years; hazard ratio [HR], 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75–0.97; <i>P</i><0.001 for noninferiority, <i>P</i>=0.02 for superiority) with no statistical evidence of heterogeneity (interaction <i>P</i> value=0.18) between the primary (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.74–1.30) and secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ion (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72–0.95) cohorts.

Polygenic Risk Score Identifies Subgroup With Higher Burden of Atherosclerosis and Greater Relative Benefit From Statin Therapy in the Primary Prevention Setting
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Relative risk reduction with statin therapy has been consistent across nearly all subgroups studied to date. However, in analyses of 2 randomized controlled primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ion trials (ASCOT [Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial–Lipid-Lowering Arm] and JUPITER [Justification for the Use of Statins in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ion: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin]), statin therapy led to a greater relative risk reduction among a subgroup at high genetic risk. Here, we aimed to confirm this observation in a third primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ion randomized controlled trial. In addition, we assessed whether those at high genetic risk had a greater burden of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied participants from a randomized controlled trial of primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ion with statin therapy (WOSCOPS [West of Scotland Coronary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ion Study]; n=4910) and 2 observational cohort studies (CARDIA [Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults] and BioImage; n=1154 and 4392, respectively). For each participant, we calculated a polygenic risk score derived from up to 57 common DNA sequence variants previously associated with coronary heart disease. We compared the relative efficacy of statin therapy in those at high genetic risk (top quintile of polygenic risk score) versus all others (WOSCOPS), as well as the association between the polygenic risk score and coronary artery calcification (CARDIA) and carotid artery plaque burden (BioImage).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among WOSCOPS trial participants at high genetic risk, statin therapy was associated with a relative risk reduction of 44% (95% confidence interval [CI], 22–60; <i>P</i><0.001), whereas in all others, the relative risk reduction was 24% (95% CI, 8–37; <i>P</i>=0.004) despite similar low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering. In a study-level meta-analysis across the WOSCOPS, ASCOT, and JUPITER primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ion, relative risk reduction in those at high genetic risk was 46% versus 26% in all others (<i>P</i> for heterogeneity=0.05). Across all 3 studies, the absolute risk reduction with statin therapy was 3.6% (95% CI, 2.0–5.1) among those in the high genetic risk group and 1.3% (95% CI, 0.6–1.9) in all others. Each 1-SD increase in the polygenic risk score was associated with 1.32-fold (95% CI, 1.04–1.68) greater likelihood of having coronary artery calcification and 9.7% higher (95% CI, 2.2–17.8) burden of carotid plaque.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Those at high genetic risk have a greater burden of subclinical atherosclerosis and derive greater relative and absolute benefit from statin therapy to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong> a first coronary heart disease event.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Potential Deaths Averted and Serious Adverse Events Incurred From Adoption of the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) Intensive Blood Pressure Regimen in the United States
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) demonstrated a 27% reduction in all-cause mortality with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) goal of <120 versus <140 mm Hg among US adults at high cardiovascular disease risk but without diabetes mellitus, stroke, or heart failure. To quantify the potential benefits and risks of SPRINT intensive goal implementation, we estimated the deaths <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ed and excess serious adverse events incurred if the SPRINT intensive SBP treatment goal were implemented in all eligible US adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>SPRINT eligibility criteria were applied to the 1999 to 2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and linked with the National Death Index through December 2011. SPRINT eligibility included age ≥50 years, SBP of 130 to 180 mm Hg (depending on the number of antihypertensive medications being taken), and high cardiovascular disease risk. Exclusion criteria were diabetes mellitus, history of stroke, >1 g proteinuria, heart failure, estimated glomerular filtration rate <20 mL·min<sup>−1</sup>·1.73 m<sup>−2</sup>, or dialysis. Annual mortality rates were calculated by dividing the Kaplan-Meier 5-year mortality by 5. Hazard ratios for all-cause mortality and heart failure and absolute risks for serious adverse events in SPRINT were used to estimate the number of potential deaths and heart failure cases <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ed and serious adverse events incurred with intensive SBP treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean age was 68.6 years, and 83.2% and 7.4% were non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black, respectively. The annual mortality rate was 2.20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.91–2.48), and intensive SBP treatment was projected to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong> ≈107 500 deaths per year (95% CI, 93 300–121 200) and give rise to 56 100 (95% CI, 50 800–61 400) episodes of hypotension, 34 400 (95% CI, 31 200–37 600) episodes of syncope, 43 400 (95% CI, 39 400–47 500) serious electrolyte disorders, and 88 700 (95% CI, 80 400–97 000) cases of acute kidney injury per year.

Activation of CaMKIV by soluble amyloid-β<sub>1–42</sub> impedes trafficking of axonal vesicles and impairs activity-dependent synaptogenesis
<p>The prefibrillar form of soluble amyloid-β (sAβ<sub>1–42</sub>) impairs synaptic function and is associated with the early phase of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We investigated how sAβ<sub>1–42</sub> led to presynaptic defects using a quantum dot–based, single particle–tracking method to monitor synaptic vesicle (SV) trafficking along axons. We found that sAβ<sub>1–42</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ed new synapse formation induced by chemical long-term potentiation (cLTP). In cultured rat hippocampal neurons, nanomolar amounts of sAβ<sub>1–42</sub> impaired Ca<sup>2+</sup> clearance from presynaptic terminals and increased the basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration. This caused an increase in the phosphorylation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV) and its substrate synapsin, which markedly inhibited SV trafficking along axons between synapses. Neurons derived from a transgenic AD mouse model had similar defects, which were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ed by an inhibitor of CaMK kinase (CaMKK; which activates CaMKIV), by antibodies against Aβ<sub>1–42</sub>, or by expression a phosphodeficient synapsin mutant. The CaMKK inhibitor also abolished the defects in activity-dependent synaptogenesis caused by sAβ<sub>1–42</sub>. Our results suggest that by disrupting SV reallocation between synapses, sAβ<sub>1–42</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>s neurons from forming new synapses or adjusting strength and activity among neighboring synapses. Targeting this mechanism might <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong> synaptic dysfunction in AD patients.</p>

Frequency, Predictors, and Impact of Combined Antiplatelet Therapy on Venous Thromboembolism in Patients With Symptomatic Atherosclerosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Observational studies suggest that symptomatic atherosclerosis may be associated with risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Prior randomized studies have demonstrated a significant reduction in recurrent VTE with aspirin monotherapy. Whether VTE risk is associated with more severe symptomatic atherosclerosis and more intensive antiplatelet therapy reduces VTE risk beyond aspirin monotherapy is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>TRA2P-TIMI 50 (Thrombin Receptor Antagonist in Secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ion of Atherothrombotic Ischemic Events–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) (vorapaxar) and PEGASUS-TIMI 54 (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ion of Cardiovascular Events in Patients With Prior Heart Attack Using Ticagrelor Compared to Placebo on a Background of Aspirin–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 54) (ticagrelor) were blinded, randomized placebo-controlled trials of antiplatelet therapy for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ion of ischemic events in stable patients with symptomatic atherosclerosis.

The risk of VTE was independently associated with age, body mass index, polyvascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and malignancy. The burden of atherosclerosis manifested as an increasing number of symptomatic vascular territories was associated with a graded increase in the 3-year rates of VTE (0.76% for 1, 1.53% for 2, and 2.45% for 3 territories). More intensive antiplatelet therapy (vorapaxar and ticagrelor pooled) significantly reduced the risk of VTE by 29% compared with background antiplatelet therapy, from 0.93% to 0.64% at 3 years (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% confidence interval, 0.56–0.89; <i>P</i>=0.003).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The rate of VTE in patients with atherosclerosis is ≈0.3% per year while on treatment with ≥1 antiplatelet agent, with increased risk independently associated with the number of symptomatic vascular territories.

Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Lowering for the Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease Among Men With Primary Elevations of Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Levels of 190 mg/dL or Above
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients with primary elevations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) ≥190 mg/dL are at a higher risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease as a result of long-term exposure to markedly elevated LDL-C levels. Therefore, initiation of statin therapy is recommended for these individuals. However, there is a lack of randomized trial evidence supporting these recommendations in primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ion. In the present analysis, we provide hitherto unpublished data on the cardiovascular effects of LDL-C lowering among a primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ion population with LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We aimed to assess the benefits of LDL-C lowering on cardiovascular outcomes among individuals with primary elevations of LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL without preexisting vascular disease at baseline.

Inhibition of Aberrant MicroRNA-133a Expression in Endothelial Cells by Statin Prevents Endothelial Dysfunction by Targeting GTP Cyclohydrolase 1 in Vivo
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (GCH1) deficiency is critical for endothelial nitric oxide synthase uncoupling in endothelial dysfunction.

We investigated whether statins <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong> endothelial dysfunction via miR-dependent GCH1 upregulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Endothelial function was assessed by measuring acetylcholine-induced vasorelaxation in the organ chamber. MiR-133a expression was assessed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and fluorescence in situ hybridization.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We first demonstrated that GCH1 mRNA is a target of miR-133a. In endothelial cells, miR-133a was robustly induced by cytokines/oxidants and inhibited by lovastatin. Furthermore, lovastatin upregulated GCH1 and tetrahydrobiopterin, and recoupled endothelial nitric oxide synthase in stressed endothelial cells. These actions of lovastatin were abolished by enforced miR-133a expression and were mirrored by a miR-133a antagomir. In mice, hyperlipidemia- or hyperglycemia-induced ectopic miR-133a expression in the vascular endothelium, reduced GCH1 protein and tetrahydrobiopterin levels, and impaired endothelial function, which were reversed by lovastatin or miR-133a antagomir. These beneficial effects of lovastatin in mice were abrogated by in vivo miR-133a overexpression or GCH1 knockdown. In rats, multiple cardiovascular risk factors including hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and hyperhomocysteinemia resulted in increased miR-133a vascular expression, reduced GCH1 expression, uncoupled endothelial nitric oxide synthase function, and induced endothelial dysfunction, which were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ed by lovastatin.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Statin inhibits aberrant miR-133a expression in the vascular endothelium to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong> endothelial dysfunction by targeting GCH1.

TGF-β receptor I/II trafficking and signaling at primary cilia are inhibited by ceramide to attenuate cell migration and tumor metastasis
<p>Signaling by the transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) receptors I and II (TβRI/II) and the primary cilia-localized sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway promote cell migration and, consequently, tumor metastasis. In contrast, the sphingolipid ceramide inhibits cell proliferation and tumor metastasis. We investigated whether ceramide metabolism inhibited TβRI/II trafficking to primary cilia to attenuate cross-talk between TβRI/II and the Shh pathway. We found that ceramide synthase 4 (CerS4)–generated ceramide stabilized the association between TβRI and the inhibitory factor Smad7, which limited the trafficking of TβRI/II to primary cilia. Expression of a mutant TβRI that signals but does not interact with Smad7 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ed the CerS4-mediated inhibition of migration in various cancer cells. Genetic deletion or knockdown of CerS4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ed the formation of the Smad7-TβRI inhibitory complex and increased the association between TβRI and the transporter Arl6 through a previously unknown cilia-targeting signal (Ala<sup>31</sup>Thr<sup>32</sup>Ala<sup>33</sup>Leu<sup>34</sup>Gln<sup>35</sup>) in TβRI. Mutating the cilia-targeting signal abolished the trafficking of TβRI to the primary cilia. Localization of TβRI to primary cilia activated a key mediator of Shh signaling, Smoothened (Smo), which stimulated cellular migration and invasion. TβRI-Smo cross-talk at the cilia in CerS4-deficient 4T1 mammary cancer cells induced liver metastasis from orthotopic allografts in both wild-type and CerS4-deficient mice, which was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ed by overexpression of Smad7 or knockdown of intraflagellar transport protein 88 (IFT88). Overall, these data reveal a ceramide-dependent mechanism that suppresses cell migration and invasion by restricting TβRI/II-Shh signaling selectively at the plasma membrane of the primary cilium.</p>

B cells, CMV, and stem cell transplant
<p>Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a potentially curative therapy for various malignant and nonmalignant conditions but can be complicated by infections such as reactivation of cytomegalovirus (CMV). CMV is a ubiquitous DNA herpes virus comprising various distinct strains (<i>1</i>). Around 60 to 90% of healthy adults are seropositive, indicating past exposure to the virus, although infections in healthy people are often mild or asymptomatic. After initial acute infection, CMV enters a latent phase, similar to other herpes viruses. It has been suggested that CMV infection may confer an immunological benefit, perhaps explaining its prevalence, because comparison of seropositive and seronegative individuals has shown that CMV infection results in greater responses to the flu vaccine (<i>2</i>). The immune system is essential to control the initial infection and to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong> later CMV reactivation, as demonstrated by the high incidence of CMV reactivation in immunosuppressed patients such as HSCT recipients. Whereas the incidence and severity of CMV transcriptional reactivation and cell-to-cell dissemination after HSCT has substantially diminished since the adoption of prophylactic or preemptive antiviral therapies (<i>3</i>), CMV remains the most important viral infection after HSCT, especially in high-risk patients (such as seropositive recipients of seronegative donors), and can lead to life-threatening CMV disease in ∼10% of HSCT recipients (<i>4</i>). On page 288 of this issue, Martins <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) make the unexpected observation, in mice undergoing bone marrow transplantation (BMT) as a model of HSCT, that strain-specific CMV antibodies made by host B cells play a crucial role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ing CMV dissemination after BMT. They propose that passive transfer of antibodies that are matched to the latent CMV strain in HSCT recipients might constitute a powerful and easy therapeutic approach to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong> CMV disease.</p>

Lacteal junction zippering protects against diet-induced obesity
<p>Excess dietary lipid uptake causes obesity, a major global health problem. Enterocyte-absorbed lipids are packaged into chylomicrons, which enter the bloodstream through intestinal lymphatic vessels called lacteals. Here, we show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ing lacteal chylomicron uptake by inducible endothelial genetic deletion of <i>Neuropilin1</i> (<i>Nrp1</i>) and <i>Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1</i> (<i>Vegfr1</i>; also known as <i>Flt1</i>) renders mice resistant to diet-induced obesity. Absence of NRP1 and FLT1 receptors increased VEGF-A bioavailability and signaling through VEGFR2, inducing lacteal junction zippering and chylomicron malabsorption. Restoring permeable lacteal junctions by VEGFR2 and vascular endothelial (VE)–cadherin signaling inhibition rescued chylomicron transport in the mutant mice.

Critics assail paper claiming harm from cancer vaccine
<p>Vaccines for human papillomavirus (HPV), given to girls to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong> cervical cancer, have come under fire in several countries for allegedly causing such side effects as difficulty walking, headache, fatigue, poor concentration, and pain. Numerous studies have found no causal link between the vaccine and these symptoms. But concerns have caused vaccination rates to collapse in Japan and to sag in other countries. Vaccine advocates warn this trend exposes women—and men—to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>able cancers and other illnesses. The debate is heating up over a recent paper that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">claim</span></strong>s to show that the HPV vaccine affects the central nervous system in mice.

Phylogenetic Tools for Generalized HIV-1 Epidemics: Findings from the PANGEA-HIV Methods Comparison
<p>Viral phylogenetic methods contribute to understanding how HIV spreads in populations, and thereby help guide the design of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ion interventions. So far, most analyses have been applied to well-sampled concentrated HIV-1 epidemics in wealthy countries. To direct the use of phylogenetic tools to where the impact of HIV-1 is greatest, the Phylogenetics And Networks for Generalized HIV Epidemics in Africa (PANGEA-HIV) consortium generates full-genome viral sequences from across sub-Saharan Africa. Analyzing these data presents new challenges, since epidemics are principally driven by heterosexual transmission and a smaller fraction of cases is sampled. Here, we show that viral phylogenetic tools can be adapted and used to estimate epidemiological quantities of central importance to HIV-1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ion in sub-Saharan Africa. We used a community-wide methods comparison exercise on simulated data, where participants were blinded to the true dynamics they were inferring. Two distinct simulations captured generalized HIV-1 epidemics, before and after a large community-level intervention that reduced infection levels. Five research groups participated. Structured coalescent modeling approaches were most successful: phylogenetic estimates of HIV-1 incidence, incidence reductions, and the proportion of transmissions from individuals in their first 3 months of infection correlated with the true values (Pearson correlation > 90%), with small bias. However, on some simulations, true values were markedly outside reported confidence or credibility intervals. The blinded comparison revealed current limits and strengths in using HIV phylogenetics in challenging settings, provided benchmarks for future methods’ development, and supports using the latest generation of phylogenetic tools to advance HIV surveillance and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ion.</p>

CD301b/MGL2<sup>+</sup> Mononuclear Phagocytes Orchestrate Autoimmune Cardiac Valve Inflammation and Fibrosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Valvular heart disease is common and affects the mitral valve (MV) most frequently. Despite the prevalence of MV disease (MVD), the cellular and molecular pathways that initiate and perpetuate it are not well understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>K/B.g7 T-cell receptor transgenic mice spontaneously develop systemic autoantibody-associated autoimmunity, leading to fully penetrant fibroinflammatory MVD and arthritis. We used multiparameter flow cytometry, intracellular cytokine staining, and immunofluorescent staining to characterize the cells in inflamed K/B.g7 MVs. We used genetic approaches to study the contribution of mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) to MVD in this model. Specifically, we generated K/B.g7 mice in which either CX3CR1 or CD301b/macrophage galactose <i>N</i>-acetylgalactosamine–specific lectin 2 (MGL2)–expressing MNPs were ablated. Using K/B.g7 mice expressing <i>Cx3Cr1</i>-Cre, we conditionally deleted critical inflammatory molecules from MNPs, including the Fc-receptor signal-transducing tyrosine kinase Syk and the cell adhesion molecule very late antigen–4. We performed complementary studies using monoclonal antibodies to block key inflammatory molecules. We generated bone marrow chimeric mice to define the origin of the inflammatory cells present in the MV and to determine which valve cells respond to the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Finally, we examined specimens from patients with rheumatic heart disease to correlate our findings to human pathology.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>MNPs comprised the vast majority of MV-infiltrating cells; these MNPs expressed CX3CR1 and CD301b/MGL2. Analogous cells were present in human rheumatic heart disease valves. K/B.g7 mice lacking CX3CR1 or in which CD301b/MGL2-expressing MNPs were ablated were protected from MVD. The valve-infiltrating CD301b/MGL2<sup>+</sup> MNPs expressed tissue-reparative molecules including arginase-1 and resistin-like molecule α. These MNPs also expressed the proinflammatory cytokines TNF and interleukin-6, and antibody blockade of these cytokines <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ed MVD. Deleting Syk from CX3CR1-expressing MNPs reduced their TNF and interleukin-6 production and also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ed MVD. TNF acted through TNF receptor–1 expressed on valve-resident cells to increase the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule–1. Conditionally deleting the vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ligand very late antigen–4 from CX3CR1-expressing MNPs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ed MVD.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>CD301b/MGL2<sup>+</sup> MNPs are key drivers of autoimmune MVD in K/B.g7 mice and are also present in human rheumatic heart disease. We define key inflammatory molecules that drive MVD in this model, including Syk, TNF, interleukin-6, very late antigen–4, and vascular cell adhesion molecule–1.</p></sec>

Evaluating the Impact and Cost-Effectiveness of Statin Use Guidelines for Primary Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease and Stroke
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Statins are effective in the primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ion of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guideline expands recommended statin use, but its cost-effectiveness has not been compared with other guidelines.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used the Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the ACC/AHA guideline relative to current use, Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines, and universal statin use in all men 45 to 74 years of age and women 55 to 74 years of age over a 10-year horizon from 2016 to 2025. Sensitivity analyses varied costs, risks, and benefits. Main outcomes were incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and numbers needed to treat for 10 years per quality-adjusted life-year gained.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Each approach produces substantial benefits and net cost savings relative to the status quo. Full adherence to the Adult Treatment Panel III guideline would result in 8.8 million more statin users than the status quo, at a number needed to treat for 10 years per quality-adjusted life-year gained of 35. The ACC/AHA guideline would potentially result in up to 12.3 million more statin users than the Adult Treatment Panel III guideline, with a marginal number needed to treat for 10 years per quality-adjusted life-year gained of 68. Moderate-intensity statin use in all men 45 to 74 years of age and women 55 to 74 years of age would result in 28.9 million more statin users than the ACC/AHA guideline, with a marginal number needed to treat for 10 years per quality-adjusted life-year gained of 108. In all cases, benefits would be greater in men than women. Results vary moderately with different risk thresholds for instituting statins and statin toxicity estimates but depend greatly on the disutility caused by daily medication use (pill burden).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>At a population level, the ACC/AHA guideline for expanded statin use for primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ion is projected to treat more people, to save more lives, and to cost less compared with Adult Treatment Panel III in both men and women.

Patients were randomly allocated to receive aspirin (81 or 100 mg daily; aspirin group) or no aspirin (no-aspirin group) in the JPAD trial. After that trial ended in 2008, we followed up with the patients until 2015, with no attempt to change the previously assigned therapy. Primary end points were cardiovascular events, including sudden death, fatal or nonfatal coronary artery disease, fatal or nonfatal stroke, and peripheral vascular disease. For the safety analysis, hemorrhagic events, consisting of gastrointestinal bleeding, hemorrhagic stroke, and bleeding from any other sites, were also analyzed.

A Critical Appraisal of Aspirin in Secondary Prevention
<p>Aspirin represents the <i>sine qua non</i> for antiplatelet pharmacotherapy in patients with cardiovascular diseases because of its well-established role in secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ion and its widespread availability and affordability. Historical studies, conducted in an era that bears little resemblance to contemporary clinical practice, demonstrated large reductions in thrombotic risk when aspirin was compared with placebo, thus forming the evidence base promulgated in practice guidelines and recommendations. P2Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitors have mostly been studied in addition to aspirin; dual-antiplatelet therapy proved superiority compared with aspirin monotherapy for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ion of ischemic events, despite increased bleeding risks. An alternative approach currently under investigation includes evaluation of single-antiplatelet therapy with P2Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitors alone versus dual-antiplatelet therapy after acute coronary syndromes or coronary stent implantation. As the availability of more effective antiplatelet agents increases, it is time to revisit the existing and long-standing paradigm supporting aspirin use for secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ion of atherothrombotic events. Ongoing trials will provide new evidence whether the less-is-more strategy is justified.</p>

Aspirin for Primary Cardiovascular Risk Prevention and Beyond in Diabetes Mellitus
<p>Daily administration of low-dose aspirin has proved to be beneficial in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ing recurrent cardiovascular events. However, the role of aspirin for primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ion in patients with no overt cardiovascular disease is more controversial. In fact, in lower risk patients, the modest benefit in reducing serious vascular events can be offset by the increased risk of bleeding, including intracranial and gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Diabetes mellitus has been associated with a substantially increased risk of both first and recurrent atherothrombotic events, which makes aspirin therapy of potential value in these subjects. Moving from general aspects of aspirin pharmacology and specific issues in diabetes mellitus, this article reviews the literature on the topic of aspirin for primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ion in general, and in subjects with diabetes mellitus in particular, to culminate with arguments pro and con and a practical risk-based algorithm for aspirin initiation in daily practice.</p>

Poly(ADP-ribose) drives pathologic α-synuclein neurodegeneration in Parkinson’s disease
<p>The pathologic accumulation and aggregation of α-synuclein (α-syn) underlies Parkinson’s disease (PD). The molecular mechanisms by which pathologic α-syn causes neurodegeneration in PD are not known. Here, we found that pathologic α-syn activates poly(adenosine 5′-diphosphate–ribose) (PAR) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), and PAR generation accelerates the formation of pathologic α-syn, resulting in cell death via parthanatos. PARP inhibitors or genetic deletion of PARP-1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ed pathologic α-syn toxicity.

Neutrophil extracellular traps produced during inflammation awaken dormant cancer cells in mice
<p>Cancer cells from a primary tumor can disseminate to other tissues, remaining dormant and clinically undetectable for many years. Little is known about the cues that cause these dormant cells to awaken, resume proliferating, and develop into metastases. Studying mouse models, we found that sustained lung inflammation caused by tobacco smoke exposure or nasal instillation of lipopolysaccharide converted disseminated, dormant cancer cells to aggressively growing metastases. Sustained inflammation induced the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), and these were required for awakening dormant cancer. Mechanistic analysis revealed that two NET-associated proteases, neutrophil elastase and matrix metalloproteinase 9, sequentially cleaved laminin. The proteolytically remodeled laminin induced proliferation of dormant cancer cells by activating integrin α3β1 signaling. Antibodies against NET-remodeled laminin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ed awakening of dormant cells. Therapies aimed at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ing dormant cell awakening could potentially prolong the survival of cancer patients.</p>

Antibody-mediated inhibition of MICA and MICB shedding promotes NK cell–driven tumor immunity
<p>MICA and MICB are expressed by many human cancers as a result of cellular stress, and can tag cells for elimination by cytotoxic lymphocytes through natural killer group 2D (NKG2D) receptor activation. However, tumors evade this immune recognition pathway through proteolytic shedding of MICA and MICB proteins. We rationally designed antibodies targeting the MICA α3 domain, the site of proteolytic shedding, and found that these antibodies <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ed loss of cell surface MICA and MICB by human cancer cells. These antibodies inhibited tumor growth in multiple fully immunocompetent mouse models and reduced human melanoma metastases in a humanized mouse model.

This approach <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>s the loss of important immunostimulatory ligands by human cancers and reactivates antitumor immunity.</p>

Translocation of a gut pathobiont drives autoimmunity in mice and humans
<p>Despite multiple associations between the microbiota and immune diseases, their role in autoimmunity is poorly understood.

Antibiotic treatment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ed mortality in this model, suppressed growth of <i>E. gallinarum</i> in tissues, and eliminated pathogenic autoantibodies and T cells. Hepatocyte–<i>E. gallinarum</i> cocultures induced autoimmune-promoting factors.

Controlling learning and epilepsy together
<p>The dentate gyrus (DG) is a region in the hippocampus of the brain that is important for many cognitive functions, such as spatial learning and memory, and understanding our environment or context (<i>1</i>). The DG is also considered to be important in many diseases, some of which surprisingly do not appear to be related to memory, such as temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) (<i>2</i>). One explanation is based on the idea that the DG is an inhibitory filter or gate (<i>3</i>, <i>4</i>), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ing too much information from corrupting memory formation as well as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ing seizures. However, it is unclear exactly how and when the DG limits the influence of afferent input to the hippocampus, and when the DG is permissive, because the DG has powerful excitatory and inhibitory characteristics. For example, the DG contains mossy cells (MCs), which have both characteristics (<i>5</i>). On page 787 of this issue, Bui <i>et al.</i> (<i>6</i>) show that silencing MCs impairs a spatial memory task and also terminates seizures in an animal model of TLE, which could improve our understanding of TLE as well as cognitive comorbidities.</p>

That a panel appointed by the Cuban government dismisses the U.S. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">claim</span></strong>s may not be surprising, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation is still leading what State Department officials have described as a "vigorous" multiagency investigation. But the Cuban report summary, obtained by <i>Science</i>, reveals intriguing details. For instance, a high-frequency noise that some had identified as a possible "sonic weapon" may have been crickets chirping.</p>

Mutations in the promoter of the telomerase gene <i>TERT</i> contribute to tumorigenesis by a two-step mechanism
<p><i>TERT</i> promoter mutations (TPMs) are the most common noncoding mutations in cancer. The timing and consequences of TPMs have not been fully established. Here, we show that TPMs acquired at the transition from benign nevus to malignant melanoma do not support telomere maintenance. In vitro experiments revealed that TPMs do not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong> telomere attrition, resulting in cells with critically short and unprotected telomeres. Immortalization by TPMs requires a gradual up-regulation of telomerase, coinciding with telomere fusions. These data suggest that TPMs contribute to tumorigenesis by promoting immortalization and genomic instability in two phases. In an initial phase, TPMs do not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong> bulk telomere shortening but extend cellular life span by healing the shortest telomeres. In the second phase, the critically short telomeres lead to genome instability and telomerase is further up-regulated to sustain cell proliferation.</p>

Europe's top court alarms vaccine experts

Some media stories suggested that from now on, "vaccines can be blamed for illness without scientific proof," which alarmed vaccine advocates. But experts on liability law are divided on what the court's decision will mean for medical product liability in Europe. Some argue that rather than dealing a blow against science or vaccines, the court sought to balance individuals' rights against society's interest in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ing disease; others say the ruling leaves a worrying amount of room for judges in the European Union to ignore certain kinds of scientific evidence.</p>

Transient compartmentalization of RNA replicators prevents extinction due to parasites
<p>The appearance of molecular replicators (molecules that can be copied) was probably a critical step in the origin of life. However, parasitic replicators would take over and would have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ed life from taking off unless the replicators were compartmentalized in reproducing protocells. Paradoxically, control of protocell reproduction would seem to require evolved replicators. We show here that a simpler population structure, based on cycles of transient compartmentalization (TC) and mixing of RNA replicators, is sufficient to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong> takeover by parasitic mutants. TC tends to select for ensembles of replicators that replicate at a similar rate, including a diversity of parasites that could serve as a source of opportunistic functionality. Thus, TC in natural, abiological compartments could have allowed life to take hold.</p>

Rapid development of a DNA vaccine for Zika virus
<p>Zika virus (ZIKV) was identified as a cause of congenital disease during the explosive outbreak in the Americas and Caribbean that began in 2015. Because of the ongoing fetal risk from endemic disease and travel-related exposures, a vaccine to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong> viremia in women of childbearing age and their partners is imperative. We found that vaccination with DNA expressing the premembrane and envelope proteins of ZIKV was immunogenic in mice and nonhuman primates, and protection against viremia after ZIKV challenge correlated with serum neutralizing activity. These data not only indicate that DNA vaccination could be a successful approach to protect against ZIKV infection, but also suggest a protective threshold of vaccine-induced neutralizing activity that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>s viremia after acute infection.</p>

Structural Basis for Protein Antiaggregation Activity of the Trigger Factor Chaperone
<p>Molecular chaperones <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong> aggregation and misfolding of proteins, but scarcity of structural data has impeded an understanding of the recognition and antiaggregation mechanisms. We report the solution structure, dynamics, and energetics of three trigger factor (TF) chaperone molecules in complex with alkaline phosphatase (PhoA) captured in the unfolded state. Our data show that TF uses multiple sites to bind to several regions of the PhoA substrate protein primarily through hydrophobic contacts. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation experiments show that TF interacts with PhoA in a highly dynamic fashion, but as the number and length of the PhoA regions engaged by TF increase, a more stable complex gradually emerges. Multivalent binding keeps the substrate protein in an extended, unfolded conformation. The results show how molecular chaperones recognize unfolded polypeptides and, by acting as unfoldases and holdases, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong> the aggregation and premature (mis)folding of unfolded proteins.</p>

Synergistic Pectin Degradation and Guard Cell Pressurization Underlie Stomatal Pore Formation
<p>Stomatal pores are vital for the diffusion of gasses into and out of land plants and are, therefore, gatekeepers for photosynthesis and transpiration. Although much published literature has described the intercellular signaling and transcriptional regulators involved in early stomatal development, little is known about the cellular details of the local separation between sister guard cells that give rise to the stomatal pore or how formation of this pore is achieved. Using three-dimensional (3D) time-lapse imaging, we found that stomatal pore formation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) is a highly dynamic process involving pore initiation and enlargement and traverses a set of morphological milestones in 3D. Confocal imaging data revealed an enrichment of exocytic machinery, de-methyl-esterified pectic homogalacturonan (HG), and an HG-degrading enzyme at future pore sites, suggesting that both localized HG deposition and degradation might function in pore formation. By manipulating HG modification via enzymatic, chemical, and genetic perturbations in seedling cotyledons, we found that augmenting HG modification promotes pore formation, whereas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ing HG de-methyl-esterification delays pore initiation and inhibits pore enlargement. Through mechanical modeling and experimentation, we tested whether pore formation is an outcome of sister guard cells being pulled away from each other upon turgor increase. Osmotic treatment to reduce turgor pressure did not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong> pore initiation but did lessen pore enlargement. Together, these data provide evidence that HG delivery and modification, and guard cell pressurization, make functional contributions to stomatal pore initiation and enlargement.</p>

Each patient   was assigned an individualised baseline VTE risk score based on   a system using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample. Symptomatic VTE,   including pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT),   were identified in the first 90 days post-operatively. Statistical   analyses were performed with logistic regression accounting for   baseline VTE risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The adjusted incidence of PE following SBTKA was 1.0% (95% confidence   interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.2) with aspirin and 2.2% (95% CI 2.0 to   2.4) with warfarin. Similarly, the adjusted incidence of VTE following   SBTKA was 1.6% (95% CI 1.1 to 2.3) with aspirin and 2.5% (95% CI   1.9 to 3.3) with warfarin. The risk of PE and VTE were reduced by   66% (odds ratio (OR) 0.44, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.78) and 38% (OR 0.62,   95% CI 0.38 to 1.0), respectively, using aspirin. In addition, the risk   of PE was 204% higher for patients undergoing SBTKA relative to   those undergoing UTKA. For each ten-point increase in baseline VTE   risk, the risk of PE increased by 25.5% for patients undergoing   SBTKA compared with 10.5% for those undergoing UTKA. Patients with   a history of myocardial infarction or peripheral vascular disease had   the greatest increase in risk from undergoing SBTKA instead of UTKA.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Aspirin is more effective than warfarin for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ion of   VTE following SBTKA, and serves as the more appropriate agent for   VTE prophylaxis for patients in all risk categories. Furthermore,   patients undergoing SBTKA are at a substantially increased risk   of VTE, even more so for those with significant underlying risk   factors. Patients should be informed about the risks associated   with undergoing SBTKA.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B(1   Supple A):68–75.</p></sec>

Atrial Fibrillation and Ventricular Arrhythmias
<p>Sex-specific differences in the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, clinical treatment, and clinical outcomes of atrial fibrillation (AF), sustained ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death are recognized. Sex hormones cause differences in cardiac electrophysiological parameters between men and women that may affect the risk for arrhythmias. The incidence and prevalence of AF is lower in women than in men. However, because women live longer and AF prevalence increases with age, the absolute number of women with AF exceeds that of men. Women with AF are more symptomatic, present with more atypical symptoms, and report worse quality of life in comparison with men. Female sex is an independent risk factor for death or stroke attributable to AF. Oral anticoagulation therapy for stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ion has similar efficacy for men and women, but older women treated with warfarin have a higher residual risk of stroke in comparison with men. Women with AF are less likely to receive rhythm control antiarrhythmic drug therapy, electric cardioversion, or catheter ablation in comparison with men. The incidence and prevalence of sustained ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death are lower in women than in men. Women receiving implantable cardioverter defibrillators for primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ion of sudden cardiac death are less likely to experience sustained ventricular arrhythmias in comparison with men. In contrast, women receiving a cardiac resynchronization therapy implantable cardioverter defibrillator for the treatment of heart failure are more likely to benefit than men. Women are less likely to be referred for implantable cardioverter defibrillator therapy despite current guideline recommendations. Women are more likely to experience a significant complication related to implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation in comparison with men. Whether sex differences in treatment decisions reflect patient preferences or treatment biases requires further study.</p>

An Evidence-Based Medicine Approach to Antihyperglycemic Therapy in Diabetes Mellitus to Overcome Overtreatment
<p>Overtreatment is pervasive in medicine and leads to potential patient harms and excessive costs in health care. Although evidence-based medicine is often derided as practice by rote algorithmic medicine, the appropriate application of key evidence-based medicine principles in clinical decision making is fundamental to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ing overtreatment and promoting high-value, individualized patient-centered care. Specifically, this article discusses the importance of (1) using absolute rather than relative estimates of benefits to inform treatment decisions; (2) considering the time horizon to benefit of treatments; (3) balancing potential harms and benefits; and (4) using shared decision making by physicians to incorporate the patient’s values and preferences into treatment decisions. Here, we illustrate the application of these principles to considering the decision of whether or not to recommend intensive glycemic control to patients to minimize microvascular and cardiovascular complications in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Through this lens, this example will illustrate how an evidence-based medicine approach can be used to individualize glycemic goals and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong> overtreatment, and can serve as a template for applying evidence-based medicine to inform treatment decisions for other conditions to optimize health and individualize patient care.</p>

Cholesterol Efflux Capacity, High-Density Lipoprotein Particle Number, and Incident Cardiovascular Events
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Recent failures of drugs that raised high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels to reduce cardiovascular events in clinical trials have led to increased interest in alternative indices of HDL quality, such as cholesterol efflux capacity, and HDL quantity, such as HDL particle number. However, no studies have directly compared these metrics in a contemporary population that includes potent statin therapy and low low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>HDL cholesterol levels, apolipoprotein A-I, cholesterol efflux capacity, and HDL particle number were assessed at baseline and 12 months in a nested case-control study of the JUPITER trial (Justification for the Use of Statins in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ion: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin), a randomized primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ion trial that compared rosuvastatin treatment to placebo in individuals with normal low-density lipoprotein cholesterol but increased C-reactive protein levels. In total, 314 cases of incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) (myocardial infarction, unstable angina, arterial revascularization, stroke, or cardiovascular death) were compared to age- and gender-matched controls. Conditional logistic regression models adjusting for risk factors evaluated associations between HDL-related biomarkers and incident CVD.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Cholesterol efflux capacity was moderately correlated with HDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein A-I, and HDL particle number (Spearman <i>r</i>= 0.39, 0.48, and 0.39 respectively; <i>P</i><0.001). Baseline HDL particle number was inversely associated with incident CVD (adjusted odds ratio per SD increment [OR/SD], 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56–0.86; <i>P</i><0.001), whereas no significant association was found for baseline cholesterol efflux capacity (OR/SD, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.72–1.10; <i>P</i>=0.28), HDL cholesterol (OR/SD, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.66–1.02; <i>P</i>=0.08), or apolipoprotein A-I (OR/SD, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.67–1.03; <i>P</i>=0.08). Twelve months of rosuvastatin (20 mg/day) did not change cholesterol efflux capacity (average percentage change −1.5%, 95% CI, −13.3 to +10.2; <i>P</i>=0.80), but increased HDL cholesterol (+7.7%), apolipoprotein A-I (+4.3%), and HDL particle number (+5.2%). On-statin cholesterol efflux capacity was inversely associated with incident CVD (OR/SD, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.42–0.92; <i>P</i>=0.02), although HDL particle number again emerged as the strongest predictor (OR/SD, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.33–0.77; <i>P</i><0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In JUPITER, cholesterol efflux capacity was associated with incident CVD in individuals on potent statin therapy but not at baseline.

β<sub>2</sub>-Glycoprotein I/IgA Immune Complexes
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Antiphospholipid syndrome is characterized by recurrent thrombosis and gestational morbidity in patients with antiphospholipid autoantibodies (aPLs). Predictive value of the presence of aPLs is low, and new markers are necessary to identify aPL carriers at higher risk and take <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ive measures on them. The presence of circulating immune complexes of IgA bound to β<sub>2</sub>-glycoprotein I (B2A-CIC) has been associated with occurrence of acute thrombotic events. In this work we study its possible predictive value for the appearance of acute thrombotic events in patients who are going to undergo transplant surgery, a well-known trigger of acute thrombotic events in aPL carriers.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed a follow-up study based on the Magnum 12+12 Cohort of patients who received a kidney transplant (n=1339). Three groups were established: group 1 patients who were positive for IgA anti-β<sub>2</sub>-glycoprotein I (aB2GP1) and B2A-CIC (n=125); group 2 patients who were positive only for IgA aB2GP1 (n=240); and control group, patients who were negative for IgA aB2GP1 (n=974). Levels of autoantibodies and B2A-CIC were quantified immediately before the transplant surgery and patients were followed up for 6 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In group 1, 46.4% of patients experienced any type of thrombosis versus 10.4% in group 2 (<i>P</i><0.001) and 8.6% in the control group (<i>P</i><0.001). The incidence of graft thrombosis in group 1 (31.2%) was significantly higher than that observed in group 2 (3.3%, <i>P</i><0.001) and the control group (2.6%, <i>P</i><0.001). In a multivariate analysis, the presence of B2A-CIC was an independent variable to experience any type of posttransplant thrombosis (hazard ratio, 6.72; 95% confidence interval, 4.81–9.37) and, prominently, for graft thrombosis (hazard ratio, 14.75; 95% confidence interval, 9.11–23.89). No significant differences were found between B2A-CIC–negative and control group patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The presence of B2A-CIC is a predictor of acute thrombotic events. Patients who were positive for IgA aB2GP1 only are at risk of experiencing thrombosis if they are B2A-CIC positive. If they are B2A-CIC–negative patients, they have the same risk as the control group. Treatments to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong> acute thrombotic events should focus on B2A-CIC–positive patients.</p></sec>

The induction of PDE4D expression is mediated by an insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrate, and GRK2 and β-arrestin2-dependent transactivation of a β<sub>2</sub>AR-extracellular regulated protein kinase signaling cascade. Thus, pharmacological inhibition of β<sub>2</sub>AR or GRK2, or genetic deletion of β<sub>2</sub>AR or β-arrestin2, all significantly attenuate insulin-induced phosphorylation of extracellular regulated protein kinase and PDE4D induction to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong> DM-related contractile dysfunction.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These studies elucidate a novel mechanism by which hyperinsulinemia contributes to heart failure by increasing PDE4D expression and identify β<sub>2</sub>AR or GRK2 as plausible therapeutic targets for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ing or treating heart failure in subjects with type 2 DM.</p></sec>

High-Sensitive Cardiac Troponin T as an Early Biochemical Signature for Clinical and Subclinical Heart Failure

Evaluating the association of hs-cTnT with replacement fibrosis and progression of structural heart disease before symptoms is fundamental to understanding the potential of this biomarker in a HF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ion strategy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We measured hs-cTnT at baseline among 4986 participants in MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis), a cohort initially free of overt cardiovascular disease (CVD). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was performed at baseline. Repeat cardiac magnetic resonance was performed 10 years later among 2831 participants who remained free of interim CVD events; of these, 1723 received gadolinium-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance for characterization of replacement fibrosis by late gadolinium enhancement. Progression of subclinical CVD was defined by 10-year change in left ventricular structure and function. Associations of hs-cTnT with incident HF, CV-related mortality, and coronary heart disease were estimated using Cox regression models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Late gadolinium enhancement for replacement fibrosis was detectable in 6.3% participants without interim CVD events by follow-up cardiac magnetic resonance. A graded association was observed between higher baseline hs-cTnT categories and late gadolinium enhancement (≥7.42 ng/L versus <limit of detection [<3 ng/L]; adjusted odds ratio, 2.87; 95% confidence interval, 1.38–5.94). Higher hs-cTnT was also associated with a greater probability of an increase in LV mass >12% (highest category versus <limit of detection; odds ratio, 1.50; 95% confidence interval, 1.09–2.07), but not with decline in left ventricular ejection fraction. The risk of incident HF was greater for higher hs-cTnT (≥8.81 ng/L versus <limit of detection; adjusted hazards ratio, 5.59; 95% CI, 2.97–10.68).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>hs-cTnT levels are associated with replacement fibrosis and progressive changes in left ventricular structure in CVD-free adults, findings that may precede HF symptoms by years. Minor elevations of hs-cTnT may represent a biochemical signature of early subclinical cardiac disease, providing an opportunity for targeted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ive interventions.</p></sec>

Population-Based Long-Term Cardiac-Specific Mortality Among 34 489 Five-Year Survivors of Childhood Cancer in Great Britain
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Increased risks of cardiac morbidity and mortality among childhood cancer survivors have been described previously. However, little is known about the very long-term risks of cardiac mortality and whether the risk has decreased among those more recently diagnosed. We investigated the risk of long-term cardiac mortality among survivors within the recently extended British Childhood Cancer Survivor Study.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The British Childhood Cancer Survivor Study is a population-based cohort of 34 489 five-year survivors of childhood cancer diagnosed from 1940 to 2006 and followed up until February 28, 2014, and is the largest cohort to date to assess late cardiac mortality. Standardized mortality ratios and absolute excess risks were used to quantify cardiac mortality excess risk. Multivariable Poisson regression models were used to evaluate the simultaneous effect of risk factors. Likelihood ratio tests were used to test for heterogeneity and trends.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, 181 cardiac deaths were observed, which was 3.4 times that expected. Survivors were 2.5 times and 5.9 times more at risk of ischemic heart disease and cardiomyopathy/heart failure death, respectively, than expected. Among those >60 years of age, subsequent primary neoplasms, cardiac disease, and other circulatory conditions accounted for 31%, 22%, and 15% of all excess deaths, respectively, providing clear focus for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ive interventions. The risk of both overall cardiac and cardiomyopathy/heart failure mortality was greatest among those diagnosed from 1980 to 1989. Specifically, for cardiomyopathy/heart failure deaths, survivors diagnosed from 1980 to 1989 had 28.9 times the excess number of deaths observed for survivors diagnosed either before 1970 or from 1990 on.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Excess cardiac mortality among 5-year survivors of childhood cancer remains increased beyond 50 years of age and has clear messages in terms of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ion strategies. However, the fact that the risk was greatest in those diagnosed from 1980 to 1989 suggests that initiatives to reduce cardiotoxicity among those treated more recently may be having a measurable impact.</p></sec>

Altered DNA Methylation of Long Noncoding RNA <i>H19</i> in Calcific Aortic Valve Disease Promotes Mineralization by Silencing <i>NOTCH1</i>
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Calcific aortic valve disease is characterized by an abnormal mineralization of the aortic valve. Osteogenic activity in the aortic valve is under the control of <i>NOTCH1</i>, which regulates the expression of key pro-osteogenic genes such as <i>RUNX2</i> and <i>BMP2</i>. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) may reprogram cells by altering the gene expression pattern.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Multidimensional genomic profiling was performed in human aortic valves to document the expression of lncRNAs and the DNA methylation pattern in calcific aortic valve disease. In-depth functional assays were carried out to document the impact of lncRNA on the mineralization of the aortic valve.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We documented that lncRNA <i>H19 (H19</i>) was increased in calcific aortic valve disease. Hypomethylation of the promoter region was observed in mineralized aortic valves and was inversely associated with <i>H19</i> expression. Knockdown and overexpression experiments showed that <i>H19</i> induces a strong osteogenic phenotype by altering the NOTCH1 pathway. Gene promoter analyses showed that <i>H19</i> silenced <i>NOTCH1</i> by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ing the recruitment of p53 to its promoter. A knockdown of <i>H19</i> in valve interstitial cells (VICs) increased the expression of <i>NOTCH1</i> and decreased the level of <i>RUNX2</i> and <i>BMP2</i>, 2 downstream targets repressed by <i>NOTCH1</i>. In rescue experiments, the transfection of a vector encoding for the active Notch intracellular domain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ed <i>H19</i>-induced mineralization of valve interstitial cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These findings indicate that a dysregulation of DNA methylation in the promoter of <i>H19</i> during calcific aortic valve disease is associated with a higher expression of this lncRNA, which promotes an osteogenic program by interfering with the expression of <i>NOTCH1.</i></p></sec>

Predicting the 10-Year Risks of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease in Chinese Population
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The accurate assessment of individual risk can be of great value to guiding and facilitating the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ion of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). However, prediction models in common use were formulated primarily in white populations. The China-PAR project (Prediction for ASCVD Risk in China) is aimed at developing and validating 10-year risk prediction equations for ASCVD from 4 contemporary Chinese cohorts.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Two prospective studies followed up together with a unified protocol were used as the derivation cohort to develop 10-year ASCVD risk equations in 21 320 Chinese participants. The external validation was evaluated in 2 independent Chinese cohorts with 14 123 and 70 838 participants. Furthermore, model performance was compared with the Pooled Cohort Equations reported in the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Over 12 years of follow-up in the derivation cohort with 21 320 Chinese participants, 1048 subjects developed a first ASCVD event. Sex-specific equations had C statistics of 0.794 (95% confidence interval, 0.775–0.814) for men and 0.811 (95% confidence interval, 0.787–0.835) for women. The predicted rates were similar to the observed rates, as indicated by a calibration χ<sup>2</sup> of 13.1 for men (<i>P</i>=0.16) and 12.8 for women (<i>P</i>=0.17). Good internal and external validations of our equations were achieved in subsequent analyses. Compared with the Chinese equations, the Pooled Cohort Equations had lower C statistics and much higher calibration χ<sup>2</sup> values in men.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our project developed effective tools with good performance for 10-year ASCVD risk prediction among a Chinese population that will help to improve the primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ion and management of cardiovascular disease.</p></sec>

Distribution of Estimated 10-Year Risk of Recurrent Vascular Events and Residual Risk in a Secondary Prevention Population
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Among patients with clinically manifest vascular disease, the risk of recurrent vascular events is likely to vary. We assessed the distribution of estimated 10-year risk of recurrent vascular events in a secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ion population. We also estimated the potential risk reduction and residual risk that can be achieved if patients reach guideline-recommended risk factor targets.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The SMART score (Second Manifestations of Arterial Disease) for 10-year risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, or vascular death was applied to 6904 patients with vascular disease. The risk score was externally validated in 18 436 patients with various manifestations of vascular disease from the TNT (Treating to New Targets), IDEAL (Incremental Decrease in End Points Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering), SPARCL (Stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ion by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels), and CAPRIE (Clopidogrel Versus Aspirin in Patients at Risk of Ischemic Events) trials. The residual risk at guideline-recommended targets was estimated by applying relative risk reductions from meta-analyses to the estimated risk for targets for systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, physical activity, and use of antithrombotic agents.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The external performance of the SMART risk score was reasonable, apart from overestimation of risk in patients with 10-year risk >40%. In patients with various manifestations of vascular disease, median 10-year risk of a recurrent major vascular event was 17% (interquartile range, 11%–28%), varying from <10% in 18% to >30% in 22% of the patients. If risk factors were at guideline-recommended targets, the residual 10-year risk would be <10% in 47% and >30% in 9% of the patients (median, 11%; interquartile range, 7%–17%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among patients with vascular disease, there is very substantial variation in estimated 10-year risk of recurrent vascular events. If all modifiable risk factors were at guideline-recommended targets, half of the patients would have a 10-year risk <10%. These data suggest that even with optimal treatment, many patients with vascular disease will remain at >20% and even >30% 10-year risk, clearly delineating an area of substantial unmet medical need.</p></sec>

Prevention of Stroke with Ticagrelor in Patients with Prior Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In the PEGASUS-TIMI 54 trial (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ion of Cardiovascular Events in Patients With Prior Heart Attack Using Ticagrelor Compared to Placebo on a Background of Aspirin-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 54), ticagrelor reduced the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events when added to low-dose aspirin in stable patients with prior myocardial infarction, resulting in the approval of ticagrelor 60 mg twice daily for long-term secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ion. We investigated the incidence of stroke, outcomes after stroke, and the efficacy of ticagrelor focusing on the approved 60 mg twice daily dose for reducing stroke in this population.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients were followed for a median of 33 months. Stroke events were adjudicated by a central committee. Data from similar trials were combined using meta-analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 14 112 patients randomly assigned to placebo or ticagrelor 60 mg, 213 experienced a stroke; 85% of these strokes were ischemic. A total of 18% of strokes were fatal and another 15% led to either moderate or severe disability at 30 days. Ticagrelor significantly reduced the risk of stroke (hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.57–0.98; <i>P</i>=0.034), driven by a reduction in ischemic stroke (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.56–1.02). Hemorrhagic stroke occurred in 9 patients on placebo and 8 patients on ticagrelor. A meta-analysis across 4 placebo-controlled trials of more intensive antiplatelet therapy in 44 816 patients with coronary disease confirmed a marked reduction in ischemic stroke (hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.54–0.81; <i>P</i>=0.0001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>High-risk patients with prior myocardial infarction are at risk for stroke, approximately one-third of which are fatal or lead to moderate-to-severe disability. The addition of ticagrelor 60 mg twice daily significantly reduced this risk without an excess of hemorrhagic stroke but with more major bleeding. In high-risk patients with coronary disease, more intensive antiplatelet therapy should be considered not only to reduce the risk of coronary events, but also of stroke.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

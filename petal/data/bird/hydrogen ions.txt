Global Pulmonary Vascular Remodeling in Pulmonary Hypertension Associated With Heart Failure and Preserved or Reduced Ejection Fraction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>We hypothesized that pulmonary venous hypertens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in heart failure (HF) leads to predominate remodeling of pulmonary veins and that the severity of venous remodeling is associated with the severity of pulmonary hypertens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>) in HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients with HF (n=108; 53 preserved and 55 reduced eject<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> fract<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>) with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> (HF-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>; pulmonary artery systolic pressure [PASP] ≥40 mm Hg) were compared to normal controls (n=12) and patients with primary pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD; n=17). In lung specimens from autopsy (control, HF-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>, and 7 PVOD) or surgery (10 PVOD), quantitative histomor<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ometry was performed in all analyzable arteries (n=4949), veins (n=7630), and small indeterminate vessels (IV; n=2168) to define percent medial thickness (arteries) and percent intimal thickness (%IT) (arteries, veins, and IV) relative to external diameter.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The average arterial percent medial thickness (control, 6.9; HF-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>, 11.0; PVOD, 15.0), arterial %IT (control, 4.9; HF-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>, 14.9; PVOD, 31.1), venous %IT (control, 14.0; HF-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>, 24.9; PVOD, 43.9), and IV %IT (control, 10.6; HF-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>, 25.8; PVOD, 50.0) in HF-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> were higher than controls (<i>P</i><0.0001 for all) but lower than PVOD (<i>P</i>≤0.005 for all). PASP (mm Hg) was lower in HF-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> (median, 59 [interquartile range, 50–70]) than in PVOD (median, 91 [interquartile range, 82–103]). PASP correlated with arterial percent medial thickness (<i>r</i>=0.41) and arterial %IT (<i>r</i>=0.35) but more strongly with venous %IT (<i>r</i>=0.49) and IV %IT (<i>r</i>=0.55) (<i>P</i><0.0001 for all).

Metabolic and Proliferative State of Vascular Adventitial Fibroblasts in Pulmonary Hypertension Is Regulated Through a MicroRNA-124/PTBP1 (Polypyrimidine Tract Binding Protein 1)/Pyruvate Kinase Muscle Axis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>An emerging metabolic theory of pulmonary hypertens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>) suggests that cellular and mitochondrial metabolic dysfunct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> underlies the pathology of this disease. We and others have previously demonstrated the existence of hyperproliferative, apoptosis-resistant, proinflammatory adventitial fibroblasts from human and bovine hypertensive pulmonary arterial walls (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>-Fibs) that exhibit constitutive reprogramming of glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolism, accompanied by an increased ratio of glucose catabolism through glycolysis versus the tricarboxylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> cycle. However, the mechanisms responsible for these metabolic alterat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>-Fibs remain unknown. We hypothesized that in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>-Fibs microRNA-124 (miR-124) regulates PTBP1 (polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1) express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to control alternative splicing of pyruvate kinase muscle (PKM) isoforms 1 and 2, resulting in an increased PKM2/PKM1 ratio, which promotes glycolysis and proliferat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> even in aerobic environments.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Pulmonary adventitial fibroblasts were isolated from calves and humans with severe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>-Fibs) and from normal subjects.

Activation of master virulence regulator PhoP in acidic pH requires the <i>Salmonella</i>-specific protein UgtL
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>ic condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, such as those inside <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>agosomes, stimulate the intracellular pathogen <i>Salmonella enterica</i> to activate virulence genes. The sensor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oQ responds to a mildly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>os<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>orylating, and thereby activating, the virulence regulator <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oP. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oP/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oQ two-component system is conserved in a subset of Gram-negative bacteria. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oQ is thought to be sufficient to activate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oP in mildly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>. However, we found that the <i>Salmonella</i>-specific protein UgtL, which was horizontally acquired by <i>Salmonella</i> before the divergence of <i>S. enterica</i> and <i>Salmonella bongori</i>, was also necessary for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oQ to activate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oP under mildly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s but not for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oQ to activate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oP in response to low Mg<sup>2+</sup> or the antimicrobial peptide C18G. UgtL increased the abundance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>os<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>orylated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oP by stimulating auto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>os<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>orylat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oQ, thereby increasing the amount of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>os<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>odonor for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>oP.

Development Defects of Hydroxy-Fatty Acid-Accumulating Seeds Are Reduced by Castor Acyltransferases
<p>Researchers have long endeavored to produce modified fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s in easily managed crop plants where they are not natively found. An important step toward this goal has been the biosynthesis of these valuable products in model oilseeds. The successful product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of such fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s has revealed barriers to the broad applicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of this technology, including low seed oil and low proport<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the introduced fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> and reduced seed vigor. Here, we analyze the impact of producing hydroxy-fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s on seedling development. We show that germinating seeds of a hydroxy-fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>-accumulating Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) line produce chlorotic cotyledons and suffer reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>otosynthetic capacity. These seedlings retain hydroxy-fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s in polar lipids, including chloroplast lipids, and exhibit decreased fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthesis. Triacylglycerol mobilizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in seedling development also is reduced, especially for lipids that include hydroxy-fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> moieties. These developmental defects are ameliorated by increased flux of hydroxy-fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s into seed triacylglycerol created through the express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of either castor (<i>Ricinus communis</i>) acyltransferase enzyme ACYL-COA:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE2 or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>OS<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>OLIPID:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1A. Such express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> increases both the level of total stored triacylglycerol and the rate at which it is mobilized, fueling fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthesis and restoring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>otosynthetic capacity. Our results suggest that further improvements in seedling development may require the specific mobilizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of triacylglycerol-containing hydroxy-fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s. Understanding the defects in early development caused by the accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of modified fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s and providing mechanisms to circumvent these defects are vital steps in the development of tailored oil crops.</p>

An evolutionarily conserved gene family encodes proton-selective ion channels
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels form the basis for cellular electrical signaling. Despite the scores of genetically identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels selective for other monatomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, only one type of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>-selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel has been found in eukaryotic cells. By comparative transcriptome analysis of mouse taste receptor cells, we identified Otopetrin1 (OTOP1), a protein required for development of gravity-sensing otoconia in the vestibular system, as forming a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>-selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel. We found that murine OTOP1 is enriched in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>-detecting taste receptor cells and is required for their zinc-sensitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> conductance. Two related murine genes, <i>Otop2</i> and <i>Otop3</i>, and a <i>Droso<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ila</i> ortholog also encode <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> channels. Evolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ary conservat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the gene family and its widespread tissue distribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> suggest a broad role for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> channels in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ysiology and patho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ysiology.</p>

An Aromatic Farnesyltransferase Functions in Biosynthesis of the Anti-HIV Meroterpenoid Daurichromenic Acid
<p><i>Rhododendron dauricum</i> produces daurichromenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, an anti-HIV meroterpenoid, via oxidative cyclizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the farnesyl group of grifolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>. The prenyltransferase (PT) that synthesizes grifolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> is a farnesyltransferase in plant specialized metabolism. In this study, we demonstrated that the isoprenoid moiety of grifolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> is derived from the 2-<i>C</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-erythritol-4-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>os<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ate pathway that takes place in plastids. We explored candidate sequences of plastid-localized PT homologs and identified a cDNA for this PT, RdPT1, which shares moderate sequence similarity with known aromatic PTs. RdPT1 is expressed exclusively in the glandular scales, where daurichromenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> accumulates. In addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, the gene product was targeted to plastids in plant cells. The recombinant RdPT1 regiospecifically synthesized grifolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> from orsellinic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> and farnesyl di<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>os<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ate, demonstrating that RdPT1 is the farnesyltransferase involved in daurichromenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> biosynthesis. This enzyme strictly preferred orsellinic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> as a prenyl acceptor, whereas it had a relaxed specificity for prenyl donor structures, also accepting geranyl and geranylgeranyl di<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>os<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ates with modest efficiency to synthesize prenyl chain analogs of grifolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>. Such a broad specificity is a unique catalytic feature of RdPT1 that is not shared among secondary metabolic aromatic PTs in plants. We discuss the unusual substrate preference of RdPT1 using a molecular modeling approach. The biochemical properties as well as the localizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of RdPT1 suggest that this enzyme produces meroterpenoids in glandular scales cooperatively with previously identified daurichromenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthase, probably for chemical defense on the surface of <i>R. dauricum</i> plants.</p>

Carnosic Acid and Carnosol, Two Major Antioxidants of Rosemary, Act through Different Mechanisms
<p>Carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>enolic diterpene specific to the Lamiaceae family, is highly abundant in rosemary (<i>Rosmarinus officinalis</i>). Despite numerous industrial and medicinal/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>armaceutical applicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of its antioxidative features, this compound in planta and its antioxidant mechanism have received little attent<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, except a few studies of rosemary plants under natural condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. In vitro analyses, using high-performance liquid chromatogra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>y-ultraviolet and luminescence imaging, revealed that carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> and its major oxidized derivative, carnosol, protect lipids from oxidat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Both compounds preserved linolenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> and monogalactosyldiacylglycerol from singlet oxygen and from hydroxyl radical. When applied exogenously, they were both able to protect thylakoid membranes prepared from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves against lipid peroxidat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Different levels of carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> and carnosol in two contrasting rosemary varieties correlated with tolerance to lipid peroxidat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Upon reactive oxygen species (ROS) oxidat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of lipids, carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> was consumed and oxidized into various derivatives, including into carnosol, while carnosol resisted, suggesting that carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> is a chemical quencher of ROS. The antioxidative funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of carnosol relies on another mechanism, occurring directly in the lipid oxidat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> process. Under oxidative condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s that did not involve ROS generat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, carnosol inhibited lipid peroxidat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, contrary to carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>. Using spin probes and electron paramagnetic resonance detect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, we confirmed that carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, rather than carnosol, is a ROS quencher. Various oxidized derivatives of carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> were detected in rosemary leaves in low light, indicating chronic oxidat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of this compound, and accumulated in plants exposed to stress condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, in parallel with a loss of carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, confirming that chemical quenching of ROS by carnosic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> takes place in planta.</p>

Simultaneous high-resolution pH and spectrophotometric recordings of oxygen binding in blood microvolumes
<p>Oxygen equilibrium curves have been widely used to understand oxygen transport in numerous organisms. A major challenge has been to monitor oxygen binding characteristics and concomitant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> changes as they occur <i>in vivo</i>, in limited sample volumes. Here we report a technique allowing highly resolved and simultaneous monitoring of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> and blood pigment saturat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in minute blood volumes. We equipped a gas diffus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> chamber with a broad-range fibre-optic spectro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>otometer and a micro-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> optode and recorded changes of pigment oxygenat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> along oxygen partial pressure (<i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> gradients to test the setup. Oxygen binding parameters derived from measurements in only 15 μl of haemolym<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> from the ce<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>alopod <i>Octopus vulgaris</i> showed low instrumental error (0.93%) and good agreement with published data. Broad-range spectra, each resolving 2048 data points, provided detailed insight into the complex absorbance characteristics of diverse blood types. After considerat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>otobleaching and intrinsic fluorescence, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> optodes yielded accurate recordings and resolved a sigmoidal shift of 0.03 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> units in response to changing <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> from 0 to 21 kPa. Highly resolved continuous recordings along <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> gradients conformed to stepwise measurements at low rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> changes. In this study we showed that a diffus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> chamber upgraded with a broad-range spectro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>otometer and an optical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> sensor accurately characterizes oxygen binding with minimal sample consumpt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and manipulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>.

Intracellular pH and its response to CO<sub>2</sub>-driven seawater acidification in symbiotic <i>versus</i> non-symbiotic coral cells
<p>Regulating intracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong><sub>i</sub>) is critical for optimising the metabolic activity of corals, yet the mechanisms involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and the buffering capacity within coral cells are not well understood. Our study investigated how the presence of symbiotic dinoflagellates affects the response of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong><sub>i</sub> to <i>P</i><sub>CO2</sub>-driven seawater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>ificat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in cells isolated from <i>Pocillopora damicornis</i>. Using the fluorescent dye BCECF-AM, in conjunct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with confocal microscopy, we simultaneously characterised the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong><sub>i</sub> response in host coral cells and their dinoflagellate symb<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ts, in symbiotic and non-symbiotic states under saturating light, with and without the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>otosynthetic inhibitor DCMU. Each treatment was run under control (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> 7.8) and CO<sub>2</sub>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>ified seawater condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s (decreasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> from 7.8 to 6.8). After 105 min of CO<sub>2</sub> addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, by which time the external <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong><sub>e</sub>) had declined to 6.8, the dinoflagellate symb<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ts had increased their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong><sub>i</sub> by 0.5 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> units above control levels when in the absence of DCMU. In contrast, in both symbiotic and non-symbiotic host coral cells, 15 min of CO<sub>2</sub> addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (0.2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> unit drop in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong><sub>e</sub>) led to cytoplasmic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>osis equivalent to 0.3–0.4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> units irrespective of whether DCMU was present. Despite further seawater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>ificat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> over the durat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the experiment, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong><sub>i</sub> of non-symbiotic coral cells did not change, though in host cells containing a symb<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>t cell the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong><sub>i</sub> recovered to control levels when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>otsynthesis was not inhibited. This recovery was negated when cells were incubated with DCMU. Our results reveal that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>otosynthetic activity of the endosymb<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>t is tightly coupled with the ability of the host cell to recover from cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>osis after exposure to high CO<sub>2</sub>/low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>.</p>

Coexpression Analysis Identifies Two Oxidoreductases Involved in the Biosynthesis of the Monoterpene Acid Moiety of Natural Pyrethrin Insecticides in <i>Tanacetum cinerariifolium</i>
<p>Flowers of <i>Tanacetum cinerariifolium</i> produce a set of compounds known collectively as pyrethrins, which are commercially important pesticides that are strongly toxic to flying insects but not to most vertebrates. A pyrethrin molecule is an ester consisting of either trans-chrysanthemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> or its modified form, pyrethric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, and one of three alcohols, jasmolone, pyrethrolone, and cinerolone, that appear to be derived from jasmonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>. Chrysanthemyl di<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>os<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ate synthase (CDS), the first enzyme involved in the synthesis of trans-chrysanthemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, was characterized previously and its gene isolated. <i>TcCDS</i> produces free trans-chrysanthemol in addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to trans-chrysanthemyl di<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>os<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ate, but the enzymes responsible for the convers<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of trans-chrysanthemol to the corresponding aldehyde and then to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> have not been reported. We used an RNA sequencing-based approach and coexpress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> correlat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> analysis to identify several candidate genes encoding putative trans-chrysanthemol and trans-chrysanthemal de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong>ases. We funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ally characterized the proteins encoded by these genes using a combinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of in vitro biochemical assays and heterologous express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in planta to demonstrate that <i>TcADH2</i> encodes an enzyme that oxidizes trans-chrysanthemol to trans-chrysanthemal, while <i>TcALDH1</i> encodes an enzyme that oxidizes trans-chrysanthemal into trans-chrysanthemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>. Transient coexpress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <i>TcADH2</i> and <i>TcALDH1</i> together with <i>TcCDS</i> in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaves results in the product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of trans-chrysanthemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> as well as several other side products. The majority (58%) of trans-chrysanthemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> was glycosylated or otherwise modified. Overall, these data identify key steps in the biosynthesis of pyrethrins and demonstrate the feasibility of metabolic engineering to produce components of these defense compounds in a heterologous host.</p>

Stearoyl-Acyl Carrier Protein Desaturase Mutations Uncover an Impact of Stearic Acid in Leaf and Nodule Structure
<p>Stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturase (SACPD-C) has been reported to control the accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of seed stearic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>; however, no study has previously reported its involvement in leaf stearic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> content and impact on leaf structure and mor<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ology. A subset of an ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenized populat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) ‘Forrest’ was screened to identify mutants within the <i>GmSACPD-C</i> gene. Using a forward genetics approach, one nonsense and four missense <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutants were identified to have high levels of seed, nodule, and leaf stearic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> content. Homology modeling and in silico analysis of the GmSACPD-C enzyme revealed that most of these mutat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s were localized near or at conserved residues essential for diiron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> coordinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Soybeans carrying <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s at conserved residues showed the highest stearic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> content, and these mutat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s were found to have deleterious effects on nodule development and funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Interestingly, mutat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s at nonconserved residues show an increase in stearic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> content yet retain healthy nodules. Thus, random mutagenesis and mutat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al analysis allows for the achievement of high seed stearic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> content with no associated negative agronomic characteristics. Addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ally, express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> analysis demonstrates that nodule leghemoglobin transcripts were significantly more abundant in soybeans with deleterious mutat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s at conserved residues of GmSACPD-C. Finally, we report that <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s cause an increase in leaf stearic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> content and an alterat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of leaf structure and mor<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ology in addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to differences in nitrogen-fixing nodule structure.</p>

Constrained sialic acid donors enable selective synthesis of α-glycosides
<p>Sialic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> is a sugar residue present in many biologically significant glycans of mammals, commonly as a terminal α-glycoside. The chemical structure of sialic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, which features an anomeric center with carboxyl and methylene substituents, poses a challenge for synthesis of the α-glycoside, thus impeding biological and therapeutic studies on sialic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>–containing glycans.

Network Analysis Reveals a Role for Salicylic Acid Pathway Components in Shade Avoidance
<p>Plants have so<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>isticated mechanisms for sensing neighbor shade. To maximize their ability to compete for light, plants respond to shade through enhanced elongat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ysiological changes. The shade avoidance response affects many different organs and growth stages, yet the signaling pathways underlying this response have mostly been studied in seedlings. We assayed transcriptome changes in response to shade across a 2-d time course in the wild type and 12 Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants. The resulting temporal map of transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al responses to shade defines early and late responses in adult plants, enabling us to determine connect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s between key signaling genes and downstream responses. We found a pervasive and unexpectedly strong connect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> between shade avoidance and genes related to salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, suggesting salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> signaling to be an important shade avoidance growth regulator. We tested this connect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and found that several mutants disrupting salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> levels or signaling were defective in shade avoidance. The effect of these mutat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s on shade avoidance was specific to petiole elongat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>; neither hypocotyl nor flowering time responses were altered, thereby defining important stage-specific differences in the downstream shade avoidance signaling pathway. Shade treatment did not change salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> levels, indicating that the mediat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of shade avoidance by salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> is not dependent on the modulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> levels. These results demonstrate that salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> pathway genes also are key components of petiole shade avoidance.</p>

Starch Deficiency Enhances Lipid Biosynthesis and Turnover in Leaves
<p>Starch and lipids represent two major forms of carbon and energy storage in plants and play central roles in diverse cellular processes. However, whether and how starch and lipid metabolic pathways interact to regulate metabolism and growth are poorly understood. Here, we show that lipids can partially compensate for the lack of funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of transient starch during normal growth and development in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Disrupt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of starch synthesis resulted in a significant increase in fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthesis via posttranslat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the plastidic acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase and a concurrent increase in the synthesis and turnover of membrane lipids and triacylglycerol. Genetic analysis showed that blocking fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> peroxisomal β-oxidat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, the sole pathway for metabolic breakdown of fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s in plants, significantly compromised or stunted the growth and development of mutants defective in starch synthesis under long days or short days, respectively. We also found that the combined disrupt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of starch synthesis and fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> turnover resulted in increased accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of membrane lipids, triacylglycerol, and soluble sugars and altered fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> flux between the two lipid biosynthetic pathways compartmentalized in either the chloroplast or the endoplasmic reticulum. Collectively, our findings provide insight into the role of fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> β-oxidat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and the regulatory network controlling fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthesis, and they reveal the mechanistic basis by which starch and lipid metabolic pathways interact and undergo cross talk to modulate carbon allocat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, energy homeostasis, and plant growth.</p>

<p>Boron (B) alleviates aluminum (Al) toxicity in higher plants; however, the underlying mechanisms behind this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>enomenon remain unknown. Here, we used bromocresol green <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> indicator, noninvasive microtest, and microelectrode <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> flux estimat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> techniques to demonstrate that B promotes root surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> gradients in pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) roots, leading to alkalizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in the root transit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> zone and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>ificat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in the elongat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> zone, while Al inhibits these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> gradients. B significantly decreased Al accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in the transit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> zone (∼1.0–2.5 mm from the apex) of lateral roots, thereby alleviating Al-induced inhibit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of root elongat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Net indole acetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> (IAA) efflux detected by an IAA-sensitive platinum microelectrode showed that polar auxin transport, which peaked in the root transit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> zone, was inhibited by Al toxicity, while it was partially recovered by B. Electro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ysiological experiments using the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) auxin transporter mutants (<i>auxin resistant1-7</i>; <i>pin-formed2</i> [<i>pin2</i>]) and the specific polar auxin transporter inhibitor1-na<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>thyl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>thalamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> showed that PIN2-based polar auxin transport is involved in root surface alkalizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in the transit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> zone. Our results suggest that B promotes polar auxin transport driven by the auxin efflux transporter PIN2 and leads to the downstream regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the plasma membrane-H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, resulting in elevated root surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>, which is essential to decrease Al accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in this Al-targeted apical root zone. These findings provide a mechanistic explanat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> for the role of exogenous B in alleviat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of Al accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and toxicity in plants.</p>

A Central Role for Triacylglycerol in Membrane Lipid Breakdown, Fatty Acid <i>β</i>-Oxidation, and Plant Survival under Extended Darkness

Disrupt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of SDP1 increased TAG accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in cytosolic lipid droplets and markedly enhanced plant tolerance to extended darkness. We demonstrate that blocking TAG hydrolysis enhances plant tolerance to dark treatment via two distinct mechanisms. In <i>pxa1</i> mutants, in which free fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s accumulated rapidly under extended darkness, SDP1 disrupt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> resulted in a marked decrease in levels of cytotoxic lipid intermediates such as free fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>os<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>atidic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, suggesting a buffer funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of TAG accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> against lipotoxicity under fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> overload. In the wild type, in which free fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s remained low and unchanged under dark treatment, disrupt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of SDP1 caused a decrease in reactive oxygen species product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and hence the level of lipid peroxidat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, indicating a role of TAG in protect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> against oxidative damage. Overall, our findings reveal a crucial role for TAG metabolism in membrane lipid breakdown, fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> turnover, and plant survival under extended darkness.</p>

Network-Guided GWAS Improves Identification of Genes Affecting Free Amino Acids
<p>Amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s are essential for proper growth and development in plants. Amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s serve as building blocks for proteins but also are important for responses to stress and the biosynthesis of numerous essential compounds. In seed, the pool of free amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s (FAAs) also contributes to alternative energy, desiccat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, and seed vigor; thus, manipulating FAA levels can significantly impact a seed’s nutrit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al qualities. While genome-wide associat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> studies (GWAS) on branched-chain amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s have identified some regulatory genes controlling seed FAAs, the genetic regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of FAA levels, composit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, and homeostasis in seeds remains mostly unresolved. Hence, we performed GWAS on 18 FAAs from a 313-ecotype Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) associat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> panel. Specifically, GWAS was performed on 98 traits derived from known amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> metabolic pathways (approach 1) and then on 92 traits generated from an unbiased correlat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>-based metabolic network analysis (approach 2), and the results were compared. The latter approach facilitated the discovery of addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al novel metabolic interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and single-nucleotide polymor<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ism-trait associat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s not identified by the former approach. The most prominent network-guided GWAS signal was for a histidine (His)-related trait in a reg<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> containing two genes: a cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ic amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> transporter (CAT4) and a polynucleotide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>os<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>orylase resistant to inhibit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with fosmidomycin. A reverse genetics approach confirmed CAT4 to be responsible for the natural variat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of His-related traits across the associat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> panel. Given that His is a semiessential amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> and a potent metal chelator, CAT4 orthologs could be considered as candidate genes for seed quality biofortificat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in crop plants.</p>

Mid-term changes in blood metal ion levels after Articular Surface Replacement arthroplasty of the hip

These   patients all had one measurement of the level of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in the   blood before seven years had passed post-operatively (early evaluat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>)   and one after seven years had passed post-operatively (mid-term evaluat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>).   Changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> levels were tested using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test.   We identified subgroups at the highest risk of increase using a   multivariable linear logistic regress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were significant increases in the levels of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s   for patients who underwent both MoM HRA (Chromium (Cr): 0.5 parts   per bill<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (ppb); Cobalt (Co): 1.1 ppb) and MoM THA (Cr: 0.5 ppb;   Co: 0.7 ppb).

Mammalian pigmentation is regulated by a distinct cAMP-dependent mechanism that controls melanosome pH
<p>The product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of melanin increases skin pigmentat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and reduces the risk of skin cancer. Melanin product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> depends on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> of melanosomes, which are more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>ic in lighter-skinned than in darker-skinned people. We showed that inhibit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) controlled pigmentat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> by increasing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> of melanosomes both in cells and in vivo. Distinct from the canonical melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R)–dependent cAMP pathway that controls pigmentat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> by altering gene express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, we found that inhibit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of sAC increased pigmentat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> by increasing the activity of tyrosinase, the rate-limiting enzyme in melanin synthesis, which is more active at basic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>. We demonstrated that the effect of sAC activity on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> and melanin product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in human melanocytes depended on the skin color of the donor.

De novo design of tunable, pH-driven conformational changes
<p>The ability of naturally occurring proteins to change conformat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in response to environmental changes is critical to biological funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Although there have been advances in the de novo design of stable proteins with a single, deep free-energy minimum, the design of conformat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al switches remains challenging. We present a general strategy to design <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>-responsive protein conformat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al changes by precisely preorganizing histidine residues in buried <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong>-bond networks. We design homotrimers and heterodimers that are stable above <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> 6.5 but undergo cooperative, large-scale conformat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al changes when the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> is lowered and electrostatic and steric repuls<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> builds up as the network histidine residues become <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>ated. The transit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> and cooperativity can be controlled through the number of histidine-containing networks and the strength of the surrounding hydro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>obic interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. Upon disassembly, the designed proteins disrupt lipid membranes both in vitro and after being endocytosed in mammalian cells. Our results demonstrate that environmentally triggered conformat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al changes can now be programmed by de novo protein design.</p>

Room-temperature cycling of metal fluoride electrodes: Liquid electrolytes for high-energy fluoride ion cells
<p>Fluoride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> batteries are potential “next-generat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>” electrochemical storage devices that offer high energy density. At present, such batteries are limited to operat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> at high temperatures because suitable fluoride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>–conducting electrolytes are known only in the solid state.

Cassini finds molecular hydrogen in the Enceladus plume: Evidence for hydrothermal processes
<p>Saturn’s moon Enceladus has an ice-covered ocean; a plume of material erupts from cracks in the ice. The plume contains chemical signatures of water-rock interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> between the ocean and a rocky core. We used the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> Neutral Mass Spectrometer onboard the Cassini spacecraft to detect molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> in the plume. By using the instrument’s open-source mode, background processes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in the instrument were minimized and quantified, enabling the identificat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of a statistically significant signal of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> native to Enceladus. We find that the most plausible source of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> is ongoing hydrothermal react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of rock containing reduced minerals and organic materials. The relatively high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> abundance in the plume signals thermodynamic disequilibrium that favors the format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of methane from CO<sub>2</sub> in Enceladus’ ocean.</p>

K<sup>+</sup> Efflux Antiporters 4, 5, and 6 Mediate pH and K<sup>+</sup> Homeostasis in Endomembrane Compartments
<p>KEA4, KEA5, and KEA6 are members of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) K<sup>+</sup> efflux antiporter (KEA) family that share high sequence similarity but whose funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> remains unknown. Here, we show their gene express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> pattern, subcellular localizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ysiological funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in Arabidopsis. <i>KEA4</i>, <i>KEA5</i>, and <i>KEA6</i> had similar tissue express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> patterns, and the three KEA proteins localized to the Golgi, the trans-Golgi network, and the prevacuolar compartment/multivesicular bodies, suggesting overlapping roles of these proteins in the endomembrane system. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>enotypic analyses of single, double, and triple mutants confirmed funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al redundancy. The triple mutant <i>kea4 kea5 kea6</i> had small rosettes, short seedlings, and was sensitive to low K<sup>+</sup> availability and to the sodicity imposed by high salinity. Also, the <i>kea4 kea5 kea6</i> mutant plants had a reduced luminal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> in the Golgi, trans-Golgi network, prevacuolar compartment, and vacuole, in accordance with the K/H exchange activity of KEA proteins. Genetic analysis indicated that KEA4, KEA5, and KEA6 as well as endosomal Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup>exchanger5 (NHX5) and NHX6 acted coordinately to facilitate endosomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> homeostasis and salt tolerance. Neither cancelling nor overexpressing the vacuolar antiporters <i>NHX1</i> and <i>NHX2</i> in the <i>kea4 kea5 kea6</i> mutant background altered the salt-sensitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>enotype. The NHX1 and NHX2 proteins in the <i>kea4 kea5 kea6</i> mutant background could not suppress the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>ity of the endomembrane system but brought the vacuolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> close to wild-type values.

Chloroplast Damage Induced by the Inhibition of Fatty Acid Synthesis Triggers Autophagy in Chlamydomonas
<p>Fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s are synthesized in the stroma of plant and algal chloroplasts by the fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthase complex. Newly synthesized fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s are then used to generate plastidial lipids that are essential for chloroplast structure and funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Here, we show that inhibit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthesis in the model alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> activates auto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>agy, a highly conserved catabolic process by which cells degrade intracellular material under adverse condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s to maintain cell homeostasis. Treatment of <i>Chlamydomonas</i> cells with cerulenin, a specific fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthase inhibitor, stimulated lipidat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the auto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>agosome protein ATG8 and enhanced auto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>agic flux. We found that inhibit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthesis decreased monogalactosyldiacylglycerol abundance, increased lutein content, down-regulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>otosynthesis, and increased the product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of reactive oxygen species. Electron microscopy revealed a high degree of thylakoid membrane stacking in cerulenin-treated cells. Moreover, global transcriptomic analysis of these cells showed an up-regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of genes encoding chloroplast proteins involved in protein folding and oxidative stress and the induct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of major catabolic processes, including auto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>agy and proteasome pathways. Thus, our results uncovered a link between lipid metabolism, chloroplast integrity, and auto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>agy through a mechanism that involves the activat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of a chloroplast quality control system.</p>

Alternative Oxidase Isoforms Are Differentially Activated by Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle Intermediates

Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) possesses five AOX isoforms (AOX1A–AOX1D and AOX2). AOX1D express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is increased in <i>aox1a</i> knockout mutants from Arabidopsis (especially after restrict<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the cytochrome <i>c</i> pathway) but cannot compensate for the lack of AOX1A, suggesting a difference in the regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of these isoforms. Therefore, we analyzed the different AOX isoenzymes with the aim to identify differences in their posttranslat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Seven tricarboxylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> cycle intermediates (citrate, isocitrate, 2-oxoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, malate, and oxaloacetate) were tested for their influence on AOX1A, AOX1C, and AOX1D wild-type protein activity using a refined in vitro system. AOX1C is insensitive to all seven organic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s, AOX1A and AOX1D are both activated by 2-oxoglutarate, but only AOX1A is addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ally activated by oxaloacetate. Furthermore, AOX isoforms cannot be transformed to mimic one another by substituting the variable cysteine residues at posit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> III in the protein. In summary, we show that AOX isoforms from Arabidopsis are differentially fine-regulated by tricarboxylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> cycle metabolites (most likely depending on the amino-terminal reg<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> around the highly conserved cysteine residues known to be involved in regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> by the 2-oxo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s pyruvate and glyoxylate) and propose that this is the main reason why they cannot funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ally compensate for each other.</p>

A systems approach for discovering linoleic acid derivatives that potentially mediate pain and itch
<p>Chronic pain and itch are common hypersensitivity syndromes that are affected by endogenous mediators. We applied a systems-based, translat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al approach to predict, discover, and characterize mediators of pain and itch that are regulated by diet and inflammat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Profiling of tissue-specific precursor abundance and biosynthetic gene express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> predicted that inflamed skin would be abundant in four previously unknown 11-hydroxy-epoxy- or 11-keto-epoxy-octadecenoate linoleic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> derivatives and four previously identified 9- or 13-hydroxy-epoxy- or 9- or 13-keto-epoxy-octadecenoate linoleic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> derivatives. All of these mediators were confirmed to be abundant in rat and human skin by mass spectrometry. However, only the two 11-hydroxy-epoxy-octadecenoates sensitized rat dorsal root gangl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> neurons to release more calcitonin gene–related peptide (CGRP), which is involved in pain transmiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, in response to low pH (which mimics an inflammatory state) or capsaicin (which activates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels involved in nocicept<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>).

Activation of olefins via asymmetric Brønsted acid catalysis
<p>The activat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of olefins for asymmetric chemical synthesis tradit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ally relies on transit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> metal catalysts. In contrast, biological enzymes with Brønsted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>ic sites of appropriate strength can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>ate olefins and thereby generate carbocat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s that ultimately react to form natural products. Although chemists have recently designed chiral Brønsted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> catalysts to activate imines and carbonyl compounds, mimicking these enzymes to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>ate simple olefins that then engage in asymmetric catalytic react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s has remained a substantial synthetic challenge. Here, we show that a class of confined and strong chiral Brønsted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s enables the catalytic asymmetric intramolecular hydroalkoxylat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of unbiased olefins. The methodology gives rapid access to biologically active 1,1-disubstituted tetrahydrofurans, including (–)-Boivinianin A.</p>

Natural noncanonical protein splicing yields products with diverse β-amino acid residues
<p>Current textbook knowledge holds that the structural scope of ribosomal biosynthesis is based exclusively on α-amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> backbone topology. Here we report the genome-guided discovery of bacterial pathways that posttranslat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ally create β-amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>–containing products. The transformat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is widespread in bacteria and is catalyzed by an enzyme belonging to a previously uncharacterized radical <i>S</i>-adenosylmeth<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ine family. We show that the β-amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s result from an unusual protein splicing process involving backbone carbon-carbon bond cleavage and net excis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of tyramine. The react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> can be used to incorporate diverse and multiple β-amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s into genetically encoded precursors in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. In addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to enlarging the set of basic amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> components, the excis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> generates keto funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s that are useful as orthogonal react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> sites for chemical diversificat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>.</p>

Lysosomal metabolomics reveals V-ATPase- and mTOR-dependent regulation of amino acid efflux from lysosomes
<p>The lysosome degrades and recycles macromolecules, signals to the cytosol and nucleus, and is implicated in many diseases. Here, we describe a method for the rapid isolat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of mammalian lysosomes and use it to quantitatively profile lysosomal metabolites under various cell states. Under nutrient-replete condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, many lysosomal amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s are in rapid exchange with those in the cytosol. Loss of lysosomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>ificat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> through inhibit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>–adenosine tri<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>os<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>atase (V-ATPase) increased the luminal concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of most metabolites but had no effect on those of the majority of essential amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s. Instead, nutrient starvat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> regulates the lysosomal concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of these amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s, an effect we traced to regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Inhibit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of mTOR strongly reduced the lysosomal efflux of most essential amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s, converting the lysosome into a cellular depot for them. These results reveal the dynamic nature of lysosomal metabolites and that V-ATPase- and mTOR-dependent mechanisms exist for controlling lysosomal amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> efflux.</p>

Dynamic multinuclear sites formed by mobilized copper ions in NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> selective catalytic reduction
<p>Copper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s exchanged into zeolites are active for the selective catalytic reduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (SCR) of nitrogen oxides (NO<i><sub>x</sub></i>) with ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), but the low-temperature rate dependence on copper (Cu) volumetric density is inconsistent with react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> at single sites. We combine steady-state and transient kinetic measurements, x-ray absorpt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> spectroscopy, and first-principles calculat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s to demonstrate that under react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, mobilized Cu <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s can travel through zeolite windows and form transient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> pairs that participate in an oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>)–mediated Cu<sup>I</sup>→Cu<sup>II</sup> redox step integral to SCR. Electrostatic tethering to framework aluminum centers limits the volume that each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> can explore and thus its capacity to form an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> pair.

Decarboxylative borylation

Observation of the Wigner-Huntington transition to metallic hydrogen
<p>Producing metallic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> has been a great challenge in condensed matter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ysics. Metallic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> may be a room-temperature superconductor and metastable when the pressure is released and could have an important impact on energy and rocketry. We have studied solid molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> under pressure at low temperatures. At a pressure of 495 gigapascals, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> becomes metallic, with reflectivity as high as 0.91. We fit the reflectance using a Drude free-electron model to determine the plasma frequency of 32.5 ± 2.1 electron volts at a temperature of 5.5 kelvin, with a corresponding electron carrier density of 7.7 ± 1.1 × 10<sup>23</sup> particles per cubic centimeter, which is consistent with theoretical estimates of the atomic density. The properties are those of an atomic metal. We have produced the Wigner-Huntington dissociative transit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to atomic metallic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> in the laboratory.</p>

Global atmospheric particle formation from CERN CLOUD measurements
<p>Fundamental quest<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s remain about the origin of newly formed atmos<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>eric aerosol particles because data from laboratory measurements have been insufficient to build global models. In contrast, gas-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ase chemistry models have been based on laboratory kinetics measurements for decades.

Coordination-induced weakening of ammonia, water, and hydrazine X–H bonds in a molybdenum complex

Cation Specificity of Vacuolar NHX-Type Cation/H<sup>+</sup> Antiporters

In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), four distinct NHX isoforms, named AtNHX1 to AtNHX4, locate to the tonoplast. To determine the concerted roles of all tonoplast NHXs on vacuolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> homeostasis, we examined multiple knockout mutants lacking all but one of the four vacuolar isoforms and quadruple knockout plants lacking any vacuolar NHX activity. The <i>nhx</i> triple and quadruple knockouts displayed reduced growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>enotypes. Exposure to sodium chloride improved growth while potassium chloride was deleterious to some knockouts. Kinetic analysis of K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> transport indicated that AtNHX1 and AtNHX2 are the main contributors to both vacuolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> and K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> uptake, while AtNHX3 and AtNHX4 differ in Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> selectivity. The lack of any vacuolar NHX activity resulted in no K<sup>+</sup> uptake, highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>ic vacuoles, and reduced but not abolished vacuolar Na<sup>+</sup> uptake. Addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al K<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange activity assays in the quadruple knockout indicated Na<sup>+</sup> uptake that was not H<sup>+</sup> coupled, suggesting the existence of an alternative, cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>/H<sup>+</sup>-independent, Na<sup>+</sup> conductive pathway in vacuoles.

Identification of Genes Encoding Enzymes Catalyzing the Early Steps of Carrot Polyacetylene Biosynthesis
<p>Polyacetylenic lipids accumulate in various Apiaceae species after pathogen attack, suggesting that these compounds are naturally occurring pesticides and potentially valuable resources for crop improvement. These compounds also promote human health and slow tumor growth. Even though polyacetylenic lipids were discovered decades ago, the biosynthetic pathway underlying their product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is largely unknown. To begin filling this gap and ultimately enable polyacetylene engineering, we studied polyacetylenes and their biosynthesis in the major Apiaceae crop carrot (<i>Daucus carota</i> subsp. <i>sativus</i>). Using gas chromatogra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>y and mass spectrometry, we identified three known polyacetylenes and assigned provis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al structures to two novel polyacetylenes. We also quantified these compounds in carrot leaf, petiole, root xylem, root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>loem, and root periderm extracts. Falcarindiol and falcarinol predominated and accumulated primarily in the root periderm. Since the multiple double and triple carbon-carbon bonds that distinguish polyacetylenes from ubiquitous fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s are often introduced by Δ12 oleic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> desaturase (FAD2)-type enzymes, we mined the carrot genome for <i>FAD2</i> genes. We identified a <i>FAD2</i> family with an unprecedented 24 members and analyzed public, tissue-specific carrot RNA-Seq data to identify coexpressed members with root periderm-enhanced express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Six candidate genes were heterologously expressed individually and in combinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in yeast and Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), resulting in the identificat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of one canonical FAD2 that converts oleic to linoleic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, three divergent FAD2-like acetylenases that convert linoleic into crepenynic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, and two bifunct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al FAD2s with Δ12 and Δ14 desaturase activity that convert crepenynic into the further desaturated dehydrocrepenynic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, a polyacetylene pathway intermediate. These genes can now be used as a basis for discovering other steps of falcarin-type polyacetylene biosynthesis, to modulate polyacetylene levels in plants, and to test the in planta funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of these molecules.</p>

Nodulin Intrinsic Protein 7;1 Is a Tapetal Boric Acid Channel Involved in Pollen Cell Wall Formation
<p>Boron is an essential plant micronutrient that plays a structural role in the rhamnogalacturonan II component of the pectic cell wall. To prevent boron deficiency under limiting condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, its uptake, distribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, and homeostasis are mediated by boric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> transporters and channel proteins. Among the membrane channels that facilitate boric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> uptake are the type II nodulin intrinsic protein (NIP) subfamily of aquaporin-like proteins. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) possesses three NIP II genes (<i>NIP5;1</i>, <i>NIP6;1</i>, and <i>NIP7;1</i>) that show distinct tissue express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> profiles (predominantly expressed in roots, stem nodes, and developing flowers, respectively). Orthologs of each are represented in all dicots. Here, we show that purified and reconstituted NIP7;1 is a boric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> facilitator. By using native promoter-reporter fus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, we show that NIP7;1 is expressed predominantly in anthers of young flowers in a narrow developmental window, floral stages 9 and 10, with protein accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> solely within tapetum cells, where it is localized to the plasma membrane. Under limiting boric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, loss-of-funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> T-DNA mutants (<i>nip7;1-1</i> and <i>nip7;1-2</i>) show reduced fertility, including shorter siliques and an increase in aborted seeds, compared with the wild type. Under these condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, <i>nip7;1</i> mutant pollen grains show mor<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ological defects, increased aggregat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, defective exine cell wall format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, reduced germinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> frequency, and decreased viability. During stages 9 and 10, the tapetum is essential for supplying materials to the pollen microspore cell wall. We propose that NIP7;1 serves as a gated boric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> channel in developing anthers that aids in the uptake of this critical micronutrient by tapetal cells.</p>

Screening for Biologically Annotated Drugs That Trigger Triacylglycerol Accumulation in the Diatom <i>Phaeodactylum</i>

However, obtaining high TAG yields is challenging. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>enotypic assay for the accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of oil droplets was developed to screen a library of 1,200 drugs, annotated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>armacology informat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, to select compounds that trigger TAG accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in the diatom <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>aeodactylum tricornutum</i>. Using this screen, we identified 34 molecules acting in a dose-dependent manner. Previously characterized targets of these compounds include cell divis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and cell signaling effectors, membrane receptors and transporters, and sterol metabolism. Among the five compounds possibly acting on sterol metabolism, we focused our study on ethynylestradiol, a synthetic form of estrogen that is used in contraceptive pills and known for its ecological impact as an endocrine disruptor. Ethynylestradiol impaired the product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s, destabilized the galactolipid versus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>os<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>olipid balance, and triggered the recycling of fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s from membrane lipids to TAG. The <i>P. tricornutum</i> transcriptomic response to treatment with ethynylestradiol was consistent with the reallocat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of carbon from sterols to acetyl-coenzyme A and TAG. The mode of act<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and catabolism of ethynylestradiol are unknown but might involve several up-regulated cytochrome P450 proteins. A fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> elongase, Δ6-ELO-B1, might be involved in the impairment of very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s and fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> turnover. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>enotypic screen opens new perspectives for the explorat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of novel bioactive molecules, potential target genes, and pathways controlling TAG biosynthesis. It also unraveled the sensitivity of diatoms to endocrine disruptors, highlighting an impact of anthropogenic pollut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ytoplankton.</p>

Biotin Attachment Domain-Containing Proteins Irreversibly Inhibit Acetyl CoA Carboxylase
<p>The first committed step in fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> synthesis is mediated by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase), a biotin-dependent enzyme that carboxylates acetyl-CoA to produce malonyl-CoA. ACCase can be feedback regulated by short-term or long-term exposure to fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s in the form of Tween 80 (predominantly containing oleic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>), which results in reversible or irreversible ACCase inhibit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, respectively. Biotin attachment domain-containing (BADC) proteins are inactive analogs of biotin carboxyl transfer proteins that lack biotin, and their incorporat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> into ACCase down-regulates its activity by displacing active (biotin-containing) biotin carboxyltransferase protein subunits. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) lines containing T-DNA insert<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in <i>BADC1</i>, <i>BADC2</i>, and <i>BADC3</i> were used to generate <i>badc1 badc2</i> and <i>badc1 badc3</i> double mutants. The <i>badc1 badc3</i> mutant exhibited normal growth and development; however, ACCase activity was 26% higher in <i>badc1 badc3</i> and its seeds contained 30.1% more fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s and 32.6% more triacylgycerol relative to wild-type plants. To assess whether BADC contributes to the irreversible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ase of ACCase inhibit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, cell suspens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> cultures were generated from the leaves of <i>badc1 badc3</i> and wild-type plants and treated with 10 m<sc>m</sc> Tween 80. Reversible ACCase inhibit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> was similar in <i>badc1 badc3</i> and wild-type cultures after 2 d of Tween 80 treatment, but irreversible inhibit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> was reduced by 50% in <i>badc1 badc3</i> relative to wild-type plants following 4 d of Tween 80 treatment. In this study, we present evidence for two important homeostatic roles for BADC proteins in down-regulating ACCase activity: by acting during normal growth and development and by contributing to its long-term irreversible feedback inhibit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> resulting from the oversupply of fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s.</p>

Hydrogen Sulfide Increases Production of NADPH Oxidase-Dependent Hydrogen Peroxide and Phospholipase D-Derived Phosphatidic Acid in Guard Cell Signaling<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) is an important gaseous signaling molecule in plants that participates in stress responses and development. <sc>l</sc>-Cys desulfhydrase 1, one of the enzymatic sources of H<sub>2</sub>S in plants, participates in abscisic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>-induced stomatal closure. We combined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>armacological and genetic approaches to elucidate the involvement of H<sub>2</sub>S in stomatal closure and the interplay between H<sub>2</sub>S and other second messengers of the guard cell signaling network, such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>os<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>olipase D (PLD)-derived <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>os<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>atidic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Both NAD<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> oxidase isoforms, respiratory burst oxidase homolog (RBOH)D and RBOHF, were required for H<sub>2</sub>S-induced stomatal closure. In vivo imaging using the cytosolic ratiometric fluorescent biosensor roGFP2-Orp1 revealed that H<sub>2</sub>S stimulates H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in Arabidopsis guard cells. Addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ally, we observed an interplay between H<sub>2</sub>S and PLD activity in the regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of reactive oxygen species product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and stomatal movement. The PLDα1 and PLDδ isoforms were required for H<sub>2</sub>S-induced stomatal closure, and most of the H<sub>2</sub>S-dependent H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> required the activity of PLDα1. Finally, we showed that H<sub>2</sub>S induced increases in the PLDδ-derived <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>os<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>atidic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> levels in guard cells. Our results revealed the involvement of H<sub>2</sub>S in the signaling network that controls stomatal closure, and suggest that H<sub>2</sub>S regulates NAD<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong> oxidase and PLD activity in guard cells.</p>

<i>S5H/DMR6</i> Encodes a Salicylic Acid 5-Hydroxylase That Fine-Tunes Salicylic Acid Homeostasis
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ytohormone salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> (SA) plays essential roles in biotic and abiotic responses, plant development, and leaf senescence. 2,5-Dihydroxybenzoic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> (2,5-DHBA or gentisic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>) is one of the most commonly occurring aromatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s in green plants and is assumed to be generated from SA, but the enzymes involved in its product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> remain obscure. DMR6 (Downy Mildew Resistant6; At5g24530) has been proven essential in plant immunity of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), but its biochemical properties are not well understood. Here, we report the discovery and funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al characterizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of DMR6 as a salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> 5-hydroxylase (S5H) that catalyzes the format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of 2,5-DHBA by hydroxylating SA at the C5 posit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>enyl ring in Arabidopsis. S5H/DMR6 specifically converts SA to 2,5-DHBA in vitro and displays higher catalytic efficiency (<i>K</i><sub>cat</sub>/<i>K</i><sub>m</sub> = 4.96 × 10<sup>4</sup> <sc>m</sc><sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) than the previously reported S3H (<i>K</i><sub>cat</sub>/<i>K</i><sub>m</sub> = 6.09 × 10<sup>3</sup> <sc>m</sc><sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) for SA. Interestingly, S5H/DMR6 displays a substrate inhibit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> property that may enable automatic control of its enzyme activities. The <i>s5h</i> mutant and <i>s5hs3h</i> double mutant overaccumulate SA and display <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>enotypes such as a smaller growth size, early senescence, and a loss of susceptibility to <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> DC3000. <i>S5H</i>/<i>DMR6</i> is sensitively induced by SA/pathogen treatment and is expressed widely from young seedlings to senescing plants, whereas <i>S3H</i> is more specifically expressed at the mature and senescing stages. Collectively, our results disclose the identity of the enzyme required for 2,5-DHBA format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and reveal a mechanism by which plants fine-tune SA homeostasis by mediating SA 5-hydroxylat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>.</p>

Autophagy Deficiency Compromises Alternative Pathways of Respiration following Energy Deprivation in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>Under heterotro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ic condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, carbohydrate oxidat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> inside the mitochondr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is the primary energy source for cellular metabolism. However, during energy-limited condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, alternative substrates are required to support respirat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> oxidat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in plant cells plays a key role in this by generating electrons that can be transferred to the mitochondrial electron transport chain via the electron transfer flavoprotein/ubiquinone oxidoreductase system. Auto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>agy, a catabolic mechanism for macromolecule and protein recycling, allows the maintenance of amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> pools and nutrient remobilizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Although the associat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> between auto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>agy and alternative respiratory substrates has been suggested, the extent to which auto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>agy and primary metabolism interact to support plant respirat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> remains unclear. To investigate the metabolic importance of auto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>agy during development and under extended darkness, Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants with disrupt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of auto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>agy (<i>atg</i> mutants) were used. Under normal growth condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, <i>atg</i> mutants showed lower growth and seed product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with no impact on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>otosynthesis. Following extended darkness, <i>atg</i> mutants were characterized by signatures of early senescence, including decreased chloro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>yll content and maximum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>otochemical efficiency of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>otosystem II coupled with increases in dark respirat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Transcript levels of genes involved in alternative pathways of respirat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> catabolism were up-regulated in <i>atg</i> mutants. The metabolite profiles of dark-treated leaves revealed an extensive metabolic reprogramming in which increases in amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> levels were partially compromised in <i>atg</i> mutants. Although an enhanced respirat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in <i>atg</i> mutants was observed during extended darkness, auto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>agy deficiency compromises protein degradat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and the generat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of amino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s used as alternative substrates to the respirat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>.</p>

An R2R3-MYB Transcription Factor Regulates Capsaicinoid Biosynthesis
<p>Capsaicinoids are responsible for the hot taste of chili peppers. They are restricted to the genus <i>Capsicum</i> and are synthesized by the acylat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the aromatic compound vanillylamine (derived from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>enylpropanoid pathway) with a branched-chain fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> by the catalysis of the putative enzyme capsaicinoid synthase. R2R3-MYB transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> factors have been reported in different species of plants as regulators of structural genes of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>enylpropanoid pathway; therefore, we hypothesized that MYB genes might be involved in the regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the biosynthesis of pungent compounds. In this study, an <i>R2R3-MYB</i> transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> factor gene, designated <i>CaMYB31</i>, was isolated and characterized in <i>Capsicum annuum</i> ‘Tampiqueíííéóéííóéíño 74’. Bioinformatic analysis suggested that <i>CaMYB31</i> could be involved in secondary metabolism, stress and plant hormone responses, and development. <i>CaMYB31</i> express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> analysis from placental tissue of pungent and nonpungent chili pepper fruits showed a positive correlat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with the structural genes <i>Ca4H</i>, <i>Comt</i>, <i>Kas</i>, <i>pAmt</i>, and <i>AT3</i> express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and also with the content of capsaicin and dihydrocapsacin during fruit development. However, <i>CaMYB31</i> also was expressed in vegetative tissues (leaves, roots, and stems). Moreover, <i>CaMYB31</i> silencing significantly reduced the express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of capsaicinoid biosynthetic genes and the capsaicinoid content. Addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ally, <i>CaMYB31</i> express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> was affected by the plant hormones indoleacetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, jasmonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, salicylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>, and gibberellic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> or by wounding, temperature, and light, factors known to affect the product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of capsaicinoids. These findings indicate that <i>CaMYB31</i> is indeed involved in the regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of structural genes of the capsaicinoid biosynthetic pathway.</p>

A Specialized Diacylglycerol Acyltransferase Contributes to the Extreme Medium-Chain Fatty Acid Content of <i>Cuphea</i> Seed Oil
<p>Seed oils of many <i>Cu<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ea</i> sp. contain >90% of medium-chain fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s, such as decanoic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> (10:0). These seed oils, which are among the most composit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ally variant in the plant kingdom, arise from specialized fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> biosynthetic enzymes and specialized acyltransferases. These include lyso<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>os<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>atidic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> acyltransferases (LPAT) and diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGAT) that are required for successive acylat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of medium-chain fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s in the <i>sn</i>-2 and <i>sn</i>-3 posit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of seed triacylglycerols (TAGs). Here we report the identificat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of a cDNA for a DGAT1-type enzyme, designated CpuDGAT1, from the transcriptome of <i>C. avigera</i> var <i>pulcherrima</i> developing seeds. Microsomes of camelina (<i>Camelina sativa</i>) seeds engineered for CpuDGAT1 express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> displayed DGAT activity with 10:0-CoA and the diacylglycerol didecanoyl, that was approximately 4-fold higher than that in camelina seed microsomes lacking CpuDGAT1. In addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, coexpress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in camelina seeds of CpuDGAT1 with a <i>C. viscosissima</i> FatB thioesterase (CvFatB1) that generates 10:0 resulted in TAGs with nearly 15 mol % of 10:0. More strikingly, express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of CpuDGAT1 and CvFatB1 with the previously described CvLPAT2, a 10:0-CoA-specific <i>Cu<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>ea</i> LPAT, increased 10:0 amounts to 25 mol % in camelina seed TAG. These TAGs contained up to 40 mol % 10:0 in the <i>sn</i>-2 posit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, nearly double the amounts obtained from coexpress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of CvFatB1 and CvLPAT2 alone. Although enriched in diacylglycerol, 10:0 was not detected in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>os<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>atidylcholine in these seeds. These findings are consistent with channeling of 10:0 into TAG through the combined activities of specialized LPAT and DGAT activities and demonstrate the biotechnological use of these enzymes to generate 10:0-rich seed oils.</p>

A Palmitic Acid Elongase Affects Eicosapentaenoic Acid and Plastidial Monogalactosyldiacylglycerol Levels in Nannochloropsis
<p><i>Nannochloropsis</i> species are oleaginous eukaryotes containing a plastid limited by four membranes, deriving from a secondary endosymbiosis. In <i>Nannochloropsis</i>, thylakoid lipids, including monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG), are enriched in eicosapentaenoic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> (EPA). The need for EPA in MGDG is not understood. Fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s are de novo synthesized in the stroma, then converted into very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>s (FAs) at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of MGDG relies therefore on an EPA supply from the ER to the plastid, following an unknown process. We identified seven elongases and five desaturases possibly involved in EPA product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in <i>Nannochloropsis gaditana</i>. Among the six heterokont-specific saturated FA elongases possibly acting upstream in this pathway, we characterized the highly expressed isoform <i>Δ0-ELO1</i>. Heterologous express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) showed that NgΔ0-ELO1 could elongate palmitic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong>. <i>Nannochloropsis</i> Δ0-elo1 mutants exhibited a reduced EPA level and a specific decrease in MGDG. In NgΔ0-elo1 lines, the impairment of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>otosynthesis is consistent with a role of EPA-rich MGDG in non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>otochemical quenching control, possibly providing an appropriate MGDG platform for the xantho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ph</span></strong>yll cycle. Concomitantly with MGDG decrease, the level of triacylglycerol (TAG) containing medium chain FAs increased. In <i>Nannochloropsis</i>, part of EPA used for MGDG product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is therefore biosynthesized by a channeled process initiated at the elongat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> step of palmitic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acid</span></strong> by Δ0-ELO1, thus acting as a committing enzyme for galactolipid product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Based on the MGDG/TAG balance controlled by Δ0-ELO1, this study also provides novel prospects for the engineering of oleaginous microalgae for biotechnological applicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s.</p>

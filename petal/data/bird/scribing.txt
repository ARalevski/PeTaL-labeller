Genetic Risk Prediction of Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) has a substantial genetic basis. Identification of individuals at greatest AF risk could minimize the incidence of cardioembolic stroke.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To determine whether genetic data can stratify risk for development of AF, we examined associations between AF genetic risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s and incident AF in 5 prospective studies comprising 18 919 individuals of European ancestry. We examined associations between AF genetic risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s and ischemic stroke in a separate study of 509 ischemic stroke cases (202 cardioembolic [40%]) and 3028 referents. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s were based on 11 to 719 common variants (≥5%) associated with AF at <i>P</i> values ranging from <1×10<sup>−3</sup> to <1×10<sup>−8</sup> in a prior independent genetic association study.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Incident AF occurred in 1032 individuals (5.5%). AF genetic risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s were associated with new-onset AF after adjustment for clinical risk factors. The pooled hazard ratio for incident AF for the highest versus lowest quartile of genetic risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s ranged from 1.28 (719 variants; 95% confidence interval, 1.13–1.46; <i>P</i>=1.5×10<sup>−4</sup>) to 1.67 (25 variants; 95% confidence interval, 1.47–1.90; <i>P</i>=9.3×10<sup>−15</sup>). Discrimination of combined clinical and genetic risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s varied across studies and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s (maximum C statistic, 0.629–0.811; maximum ΔC statistic from clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> alone, 0.009–0.017). AF genetic risk was associated with stroke in age- and sex-adjusted models. For example, individuals in the highest versus lowest quartile of a 127-variant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> had a 2.49-fold increased odds of cardioembolic stroke (95% confidence interval, 1.39–4.58; <i>P</i>=2.7×10<sup>−3</sup>). The effect persisted after the exclusion of individuals (n=70) with known AF (odds ratio, 2.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.20–4.40; <i>P</i>=0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Comprehensive AF genetic risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s were associated with incident AF beyond associations for clinical AF risk factors but offered small improvements in discrimination. AF genetic risk was also associated with cardioembolic stroke in age- and sex-adjusted analyses. Efforts are warranted to determine whether AF genetic risk may improve identification of subclinical AF or help distinguish between stroke mechanisms.</p></sec>

Performance and Validation of a Novel Biomarker-Based Stroke Risk Score for Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Atrial fibrillation is associated with increased but variable risk of stroke. Our aim was to validate the recently developed biomarker-based ABC (age, biomarkers [high-sensitivity troponin and N-terminal fragment B-type natriuretic peptide], and clinical history of prior stroke/transient ischemic attack)-stroke risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> and compare its performance with the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>VASc and ATRIA (Anticoagulation and Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation) risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The ABC-stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> includes age, biomarkers (N-terminal fragment B-type natriuretic peptide and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin), and clinical history (prior stroke). This validation was based on 8356 patients, 16 137 person-years of follow-up, and 219 adjudicated stroke or systemic embolic events in anticoagulated patients with atrial fibrillation in the RE-LY study (Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy). Levels of N-terminal fragment B-type natriuretic peptide, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT), and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) were determined in plasma samples obtained at study entry.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The ABC-stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> was well calibrated with 0.76 stroke/systemic embolic events per 100 person-years in the predefined low (<1%/y) risk group, 1.48 in the medium (1%–2%/y) risk group, and 2.60 in the high (>2%/y) risk group for the ABC-stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> with hs-cTnT. Hazard ratios for stroke/systemic embolic events were 1.95 for medium- versus low-risk groups, and 3.44 for high- versus low-risk groups.

Female Sex Is a Risk Modifier Rather Than a Risk Factor for Stroke in Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Stroke risk in atrial fibrillation is assessed by using the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>. Sex category (Sc, ie, female sex) confers 1 point on CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc. We hypothesized that female sex is a stroke risk modifier, rather than an overall risk factor, when added to a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA (sex-independent thromboembolism risk) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> scale.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using 3 nationwide registries, we identified patients with incident nonvalvular atrial fibrillation from January 1, 1997, through December 31, 2015. Patients receiving oral anticoagulant treatment at baseline were excluded, and person-time was censored at the time of treatment initiation (if any). CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s were calculated for men and women, and were followed for up to 1 year in the Danish National Patient Registry. The primary outcome was a primary hospital code for ischemic stroke or systemic embolism (thromboembolism). We calculated crude event rates for risk strata as events per 100 person-years. For quantifying absolute risk of stroke, we calculated risks based on the pseudovalue method. Female sex as a prognostic factor was investigated by inclusion as an interaction term on the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> to calculate the thromboembolic risk ratio for different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> points.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 239 671 patients with atrial fibrillation (48.7% women) contributed to the analyses. The mean ages for women and men were 76.6 years and 70.3 years, respectively; the mean CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s were 2.7 for women and 2.3 for men. The overall 1-year thromboembolic rate per 100 person-years for women was 7.3 and 5.7 for men. The 1-year absolute risk of thromboembolism was 0.5% among men and women with a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> of 0 and increased up to >7% among very comorbid patients (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> >5). The risk ratio (male as reference) across points >1 indicated that women exhibit a higher stroke risk. The interaction was statistically significant (<i>P</i><0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Female sex is a risk modifier for stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Initial decisions on oral anticoagulant treatment could be guided by a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> (ie, excluding the sex category criterion), but the Sc risk component modifies and accentuates stroke risk in women who would have been eligible for oral anticoagulant treatment on the basis of ≥2 additional stroke risk factors.</p></sec>

Wide Variation in Reported Rates of Stroke Across Cohorts of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Oral anticoagulants decrease ischemic stroke rates in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) but increase the risk of bleeding. For the average patient with AF, the threshold of annual ischemic stroke rate where the benefit of anticoagulation outweighs the bleeding risk (net clinical benefit) has been shown to be ≈1% to 2%. Guideline recommendations for oral anticoagulants in AF are based on the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc stroke risk point <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s, assuming that those <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s translate to fixed stroke rates. However, the relationship between stroke point <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s and annual stroke rates may vary substantially across populations. We sought to comprehensively assess the reported rates of stroke in patients with AF and the relationship of stroke rates to stroke risk point <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A systematic review of cohort studies and randomized controlled trials enrolled patients with nonvalvular AF not treated with oral anticoagulants.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of the 3552 studies screened, we identified 34 studies eligible for analysis. Overall stroke rates in cohort studies were highly heterogeneous (Q=5706.54, <i>P</i><0.001; I<sup>2</sup> = 99.6%) and ranged from 0.45% to 9.28% per year, despite being of similar objective study quality. The mean North American stroke rate was less than one-third that of the mean European stroke rate (<i>P</i><0.0001). However, a random effects regression indicated that between-study variability was not significantly accounted for by cohort region, prospective versus retrospective design, calendar year of study, or outcome event cluster. At a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> of 1, 76% of cohorts reported ischemic stroke rates <1% per year and only 18% of cohorts reported a stroke rate >2% per year. At a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> of 2, 27% of cohorts reported stroke rates below 1% per year, 40% reported stroke rates between 1 and 2% per year, and 33% reported stroke rates >2% per year.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Substantial variation exists across cohorts in overall stroke rates and rates corresponding to CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc point <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s. These variations can affect the point <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> threshold for recommending oral anticoagulants in AF. The majority of cohorts did not observe stroke rates that would indicate a clear expected net clinical benefit for anticoagulating AF patients with CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s of 1 or 2.</p></sec>

Radiographic scoring system for the evaluation of stability of cementless acetabular components in the presence of osteolysis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The stability of cementless acetabular components is an important   factor for surgical planning in the treatment of patients with pelvic   osteolysis after total hip arthroplasty (THA). However, the methods   for determining the stability of the acetabular component from pre-operative   radiographs remain controversial. Our aim was to develop a scoring   system to help in the assessment of the stability of the acetabular   component under these circumstances.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The new scoring system is based on the mechanism of failure of   these components and the location of the osteolytic lesion, according   to the DeLee and Charnley classification. Each zone is evaluated   and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>d separately. The sum of the individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s from the   three zones is reported as a total <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> with a maximum of 10 points.   The study involved 96 revision procedures which were undertaken   for wear or osteolysis in 91 patients between July 2002 and December   2012. Pre-operative anteroposterior pelvic radiographs and Judet   views were reviewed. The stability of the acetabular component was   confirmed intra-operatively.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Intra-operatively, it was found that 64 components were well-fixed   and 32 were loose. Mean total <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s in the well-fixed and loose   components were 2.9 (0 to 7) and 7.2 (1 to 10), respectively (p   < 0.001). In hips with a low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> (0 to 2), the component was   only loose in one of 33 hips (3%). The incidence of loosening increased   with increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s: in those with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s of 3 and 4, two of   19 components (10.5%) were loose; in hips with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s of 5 and 6, eight   of 19 components (44.5%) were loose; in hips with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s of 7 or   8, 13 of 17 components (70.6%) were loose; and for hips with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s   of 9 and 10, nine of nine components (100%) were loose. Receiver-operating-characteristic curve   analysis demonstrated very good accuracy (area under the curve =   0.90, p < 0.001). The optimal cutoff point was a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> of ≥ 5   with a sensitivity of 0.79, and a specificity of 0.87.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>There was a strong correlation between the scoring system and   the probability of loosening of a cementless acetabular component.   This scoring system provides a clinically useful tool for pre-operative   planning, and the evaluation of the outcome of revision surgery   for patients with loosening of a cementless acetabular component   in the presence of osteolysis.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:601–6.</p></sec>

Identifying Patients at Risk for Prehospital Sudden Cardiac Arrest at the Early Phase of Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In-hospital mortality of ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) has decreased drastically. In contrast, prehospital mortality from sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) remains high and difficult to reduce. Identification of the patients with STEMI at higher risk for prehospital SCA could facilitate rapid triage and intervention in the field.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using a prospective, population-based study evaluating all patients with STEMI managed by emergency medical services in the greater Paris area (11.7 million inhabitants) between 2006 and 2010, we identified characteristics associated with an increased risk of prehospital SCA and used these variables to build an SCA prediction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>, which we validated internally and externally.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In the overall STEMI population (n=8112; median age, 60 years; 78% male), SCA occurred in 452 patients (5.6%). In multivariate analysis, younger age, absence of obesity, absence of diabetes mellitus, shortness of breath, and a short delay between pain onset and call to emergency medical services were the main predictors of SCA. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> built from these variables predicted SCA, with the risk increasing 2-fold in patients with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> between 10 and 19, 4-fold in those with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> between 20 and 29, and >18-fold in patients with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> ≥30 compared with those with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s <10. The SCA rate was 28.9% in patients with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> ≥30 compared with 1.6% in patients with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> ≤9 (<i>P</i> for trend <0.001). The area under the curve values were 0.7033 in the internal validation sample and 0.6031 in the external validation sample. Sensitivity and specificity varied between 96.9% and 10.5% for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s ≥10 and between 18.0% and 97.6% for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s ≥30, with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s between 20 and 29 achieving the best sensitivity and specificity (65.4% and 62.6%, respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>At the early phase of STEMI, the risk of prehospital SCA can be determined through a simple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> of 5 routinely assessed predictors. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> might help optimize the dispatching and management of patients with STEMI by emergency medical services.</p></sec>

Congenital Heart Defects and Indices of Placental and Fetal Growth in a Nationwide Study of 924 422 Liveborn Infants
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Congenital heart defects (CHDs) have been associated with placental anomalies. The nature and the consequences of this association remain poorly understood.

Activity levels and return to work following total knee arthroplasty in patients under 65 years of age
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Little is known about employment following total knee arthroplasty   (TKA). This study aims to identify factors which predict return   to work following TKA in patients of working age in the United Kingdom.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients & Methods</title><p>We prospectively assessed 289 patients (289 TKAs) aged ≤ 65 years   who underwent TKA between 2010 and 2013. There were 148 women. The   following were recorded pre-operatively: age, gender, body mass   index, social deprivation, comorbidities, indication for surgery,   work status and nature of employment, activity level as assessed by   the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) activity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>   and Oxford Knee <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> (OKS). The intention of patients to return   to work or to retire was not assessed pre-operatively. At a mean   of 3.4 years (2 to 4) post-operatively, the return to work status,   OKS, the EuroQol-5 dimensions (EQ-5D) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>, UCLA activity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>   and Work, Osteoarthritis and joint-Replacement (WORQ) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> were   obtained. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of 261 patients (90%) who were working before TKA, 105 (40%)   returned to any job, including 89 (34%) who returned to the same   job at a mean of 13.5 weeks (2 to 104) post-operatively. A total   of 108 (41%) retired following TKA and 18 remained on welfare. Patients   not working before the operation did not return to work. Median   UCLA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s improved in 125 patients (58%) from 4 (mild activity)   to 6 (moderate activity) (p < 0.001). Significant    (p < 0.05) factors which were predictive of return to any work   included age, heavy or moderate manual work, better post-operative   UCLA, OKS and EQ-5D general health <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s. Significant predictive   factors of return to the same work included age, heavy or moderate   manual work and post-operative OKS. Multivariate analysis confirmed   heavy or moderate manual work and age to independently predict a   return to either any or the same work. All patients aged < 50   years who were working pre-operatively returned to any work as did   60% of those aged between 50 and 54 years, 50% of those aged between   55 and 59 years and 24% those aged between 60 and 65 years. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>If working pre-operatively, patients aged < 50 years invariably   returned to work following TKA, but only half of those aged between   50 to 60 years returned.

Satisfaction, function and repair integrity after arthroscopic <i>versus</i> mini-open rotator cuff repair
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Advances in arthroscopic techniques for rotator cuff repair have   made the mini-open approach less popular. However, the mini-open   approach remains an important technique for repair for many surgeons.

Clinical, functional and radiological outcomes of extracorporeal irradiation in limb salvage surgery for bone tumours
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We present a retrospective review of patients treated with extracorporeally   irradiated allografts for primary and secondary bone tumours with   the mid- and long-term survivorship and the functional and radiographic   outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 113 of 116 (97.4%) patients who were treated with   extracorporeally irradiated allografts between 1996 and 2014 were   followed up. Forms of treatment included reconstructions, prostheses   and composite reconstructions, both with and without vascularised   grafts. Survivorship was determined by the Kaplan-Meier method.   Clinical outcomes were assessed using the Musculoskeletal Tumor   Society (MSTS) scoring system, the Toronto Extremity Salvage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>   (TESS) and Quality of Life-C30 (QLQ-30) measures. Radiographic outcomes   were assessed using the International Society of Limb Salvage (ISOLS)   radiographic scoring system.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were 61 (54%) men with a mean age of 22 years (6 to 70)   and 52 (46%) women with a mean age of 26 years (3 to 85). There   were 23 deaths. The five-year patient survivorship was 82.3% and   the ten-year patient survivorship was 79.6%. The mean follow-up   of the 90 surviving patients was 80.3 months (2 to 207). At the   last follow-up, 105 allografts (92.9%) were still in place or had   been at the time of death; eight (7%) had failed due to infection,   local recurrence or fracture. Outcome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s were comparable with   or superior to those in previous studies. The mean outcome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s   were: MSTS 79% (<sc>sd</sc> 8); TESS 83% (<sc>sd</sc> 19); QLQ 82%   (<sc>sd</sc> 16); ISOLS 80.5% (<sc>sd</sc> 19). </p><p>Pearson correlation analysis showed a strong relationship between   the MSTS and ISOLS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s (r = 0.71, p < 0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study shows that extracorporeal irradiation is a versatile   reconstructive technique for dealing with large defects after the   resection of bone tumours with good functional and radiographic   outcomes.

The challenge of Monteggia-like lesions of the elbow
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this retrospective multicentre study was to evaluate   mid-term results of the operative treatment of Monteggia-like lesions   and to determine the prognostic factors that influence the clinical   and radiological outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 46 patients (27 women and 19 men), with a mean age   of 57.7 years (18 to 84) who had sustained a Monteggia-like lesion   were followed up clinically and radiologically after surgical treatment.   The Mayo Modified Wrist <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> (MMWS), Mayo Elbow Performance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>   (MEPS), Broberg and Morrey <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>, and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder   and Hand (DASH) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> were used for evaluation at a mean of 65 months   (27 to 111) postoperatively. All ulnar fractures were stabilized   using a proximally contoured or precontoured locking compression   plate. Mason type I fractures of the radial head were treated conservatively, type   II fractures were treated with reconstruction, and type III fractures   with arthroplasty. All Morrey type II and III fractures of the coronoid   process was stabilized using lag screws.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Good results were found for the MMWS, with a mean of 88.4 (40 to   100). There were 29 excellent results (63%), nine good (20%), seven   satisfactory (15%), and one poor (2%). Excellent results were obtained   for the MEPS, with a mean of 90.7 (70 to 100): 31 excellent results   (68%), 13 good (28%), and two fair (4%). Good results were also   found for the functional rating index of Broberg and Morrey, with   a mean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> of 86.6 (57 to 100). There were 16 excellent results   (35%), 22 good (48%), six fair (13%), and two poor (4%). The mean DASH   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> was 15.1 (0 to 55.8). Two patients had delayed wound healing;   four patients had nonunion requiring bone grafting. One patient   had asymptomatic loosening of the radial head prosthesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Monteggia-like lesions are rare. With correct identification,   classification, and understanding using CT scans followed by appropriate   surgical treatment that addresses all components of the injury,   good to excellent mid-term results can be achieved.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:212–18.</p></sec>

Derivation and Validation of a Novel Right-Sided Heart Failure Model After Implantation of Continuous Flow Left Ventricular Assist Devices
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The aim of the study was to derive and validate a novel risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> for early right-sided heart failure (RHF) after left ventricular assist device implantation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The EUROMACS (European Registry for Patients with Mechanical Circulatory Support) was used to identify adult patients undergoing continuous-flow left ventricular assist device implantation with mainstream devices. Eligible patients (n=2988) were randomly divided into derivation (n=2000) and validation (n=988) cohorts. The primary outcome was early (<30 days) severe postoperative RHF, defined as receiving short- or long-term right-sided circulatory support, continuous inotropic support for ≥14 days, or nitric oxide ventilation for ≥48 hours. The secondary outcome was all-cause mortality and length of stay in the intensive care unit. Covariates found to be associated with RHF (exploratory univariate <i>P</i><0.10) were entered into a multivariable logistic regression model. A risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> was then generated using the relative magnitude of the exponential regression model coefficients of independent predictors at the last step after checking for collinearity, likelihood ratio test, c index, and clinical weight at each step.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A 9.5-point risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> incorporating 5 variables (Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support class, use of multiple inotropes, severe right ventricular dysfunction on echocardiography, ratio of right atrial/pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, hemoglobin) was created. The mean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s in the derivation and validation cohorts were 2.7±1.9 and 2.6±2.0, respectively (<i>P</i>=0.32). RHF in the derivation cohort occurred in 433 patients (21.7%) after left ventricular assist device implantation and was associated with a lower 1-year (53% versus 71%; <i>P</i><0.001) and 2-year (45% versus 58%; <i>P</i><0.001) survival compared with patients without RHF. RHF risk ranged from 11% (low risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> 0–2) to 43.1% (high risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> >4; <i>P</i><0.0001). Median intensive care unit stay was 7 days (interquartile range, 4–15 days) versus 24 days (interquartile range, 14–38 days) in patients without versus with RHF, respectively (<i>P</i><0.001). The c index of the composite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> was 0.70 in the derivation and 0.67 in the validation cohort. The EUROMACS-RHF risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> outperformed (<i>P</i><0.0001) previously published <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s and known individual echocardiographic and hemodynamic markers of RHF.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This novel EUROMACS-RHF risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> outperformed currently known risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s and clinical predictors of early postoperative RHF. This novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> may be useful for tailored risk-based clinical assessment and management of patients with advanced HF evaluated for ventricular assist device therapy.</p></sec>

Validating Utility of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy Score in a Large Pooled Cohort From 3 Japanese Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Studies
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> was developed to estimate ischemic and bleeding risks from the DAPT study. However, few studies validated its utility externally. We sought to validate the utility of the DAPT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> in the Japanese population.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a pooled cohort of 3 studies conducted in Japan (the CREDO-Kyoto [Coronary Revascularization Demonstrating Outcome Study in Kyoto] Registry Cohort-2, RESET [Randomized Evaluation of Sirolimus-Eluting Versus Everolimus-Eluting Stent Trial], and NEXT [NOBORI Biolimus-Eluting Versus XIENCE/PROMUS Everolimus-Eluting Stent Trial]), we compared risks for ischemic and bleeding events from 13 to 36 months after percutaneous coronary intervention among patients with a DAPT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> ≥2 (high DS) and a DAPT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> <2 (low DS).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 12 223 patients receiving drug-eluting stents who were free from ischemic or bleeding events at 13 months after percutaneous coronary intervention, 3944 patients had high DS and 8279 had low DS. The cumulative incidence of primary ischemic end point (myocardial infarction/stent thrombosis) was significantly higher in high DS than in low DS (1.5% versus 0.9%, <i>P</i>=0.002), whereas the cumulative incidence of primary bleeding end point (GUSTO moderate/severe) tended to be lower in high DS than in low DS (2.1% versus 2.7%, <i>P</i>=0.07). The cumulative incidences of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and stent thrombosis were also significantly higher in high DS than in low DS (2.0% versus 1.4%, <i>P</i>=0.03; 1.5% versus 0.8%, <i>P</i>=0.002; 0.7% versus 0.3%, <i>P</i><0.001, respectively), whereas the cumulative incidences of noncardiac death and GUSTO severe bleeding were significantly lower in high DS than in low DS (2.4% versus 3.9%, <i>P</i><0.001; 1.0% versus 1.6%, <i>P</i>=0.03, respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In the current population, the DAPT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> successfully stratified ischemic and bleeding risks, although the ischemic event rate was remarkably low even in high DS.

Risk Factors for Coarctation of the Aorta on Prenatal Ultrasound
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Prenatal diagnosis of coarctation of the aorta (CoA) is still challenging and affected by high rates of false-positive diagnoses. The aim of this study was to ascertain the strength of association and to quantify the diagnostic accuracy of different ultrasound signs in predicting CoA prenatally.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases were searched. Random-effects and hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic model meta-analyses were used to analyze the data.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Seven hundred ninety-four articles were identified, and 12 (922 fetuses at risk for CoA) articles were included. Mean mitral valve diameter <i>z</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> was lower (<i>P</i><0.001) and the mean tricuspid valve diameter <i>z</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> was higher in fetuses with CoA than in those without CoA (<i>P</i>=0.01). Mean aortic valve diameter <i>z</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> was lower in fetuses with CoA than in healthy fetuses (<i>P</i>≤0.001), but the ascending aorta diameter, expressed as <i>z</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> or millimeters, was similar between groups (<i>P</i>=0.07 and 0.47, respectively). Mean aortic isthmus diameter <i>z</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s measured either in sagittal (<i>P</i>=0.02) or in 3-vessel trachea view (<i>P</i><0.001) were lower in fetuses with CoA. Conversely, the mean pulmonary artery diameter <i>z</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>, the right/left ventricular and pulmonary artery/ascending aorta diameter ratios were higher (<i>P</i><0.001, <i>P</i>=0.02, and <i>P</i>=0.02, respectively) in fetuses with CoA in comparison with controls, although aortic isthmus/arterial duct diameter ratio was lower in fetuses with CoA than in those without CoA (<i>P</i><0.001). The presence of coarctation shelf and aortic arch hypoplasia were more common in fetuses with CoA than in controls (odds ratio, 26.0; 95% confidence interval, 4.42–153; <i>P</i><0.001 and odds ratio, 38.2; 95% confidence interval, 3.01–486; <i>P</i>=0.005), whereas persistent left superior vena cava (<i>P</i>=0.85), ventricular septal defect (<i>P</i>=0.12), and bicuspid aortic valve (<i>P</i>=0.14) did not carry an increased risk for this anomaly. Multiparametric diagnostic models integrating different ultrasound signs for the detection of CoA were associated with an increased detection rate.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The detection rate of CoA may improve when a multiple-criteria prediction model is adopted. Further large multicenter studies sharing the same imaging protocols are needed to develop objective models for risk assessment in these fetuses.</p></sec>

Genetic Predisposition to High Blood Pressure and Lifestyle Factors
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>High blood pressure (BP) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Both heritable and lifestyle risk factors contribute to elevated BP levels. We aimed to investigate the extent to which lifestyle factors could offset the effect of an adverse BP genetic profile and its effect on CVD risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We constructed a genetic risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> for high BP by using 314 published BP loci in 277 005 individuals without previous CVD from the UK Biobank study, a prospective cohort of individuals aged 40 to 69 years, with a median of 6.11 years of follow-up. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>d participants according to their lifestyle factors including body mass index, healthy diet, sedentary lifestyle, alcohol consumption, smoking, and urinary sodium excretion levels measured at recruitment. We examined the association between tertiles of genetic risk and tertiles of lifestyle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> with BP levels and incident CVD by using linear regression and Cox regression models, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Healthy lifestyle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> was strongly associated with BP (<i>P</i><10<sup>–320</sup>) for systolic and diastolic BP and CVD events regardless of the underlying BP genetic risk. Participants with a favorable in comparison with an unfavorable lifestyle (bottom versus top tertile lifestyle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>) had 3.6, 3.5, and 3.6 mm Hg lower systolic BP in low, middle, and high genetic risk groups, respectively (<i>P</i> for interaction=0.0006). Similarly, favorable in comparison with unfavorable lifestyle showed 30%, 31%, and 33% lower risk of CVD among participants in low, middle, and high genetic risk groups, respectively (<i>P</i> for interaction=0.99).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our data further support population-wide efforts to lower BP in the population via lifestyle modification.

Few studies have assessed the prevalence of coronary artery disease in masters athletes with a low atherosclerotic risk profile.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We assessed 152 masters athletes 54.4±8.5 years of age (70% male) and 92 controls of similar age, sex, and low Framingham 10-year coronary artery disease risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s with an echocardiogram, exercise stress test, computerized tomographic coronary angiogram, and cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging with late gadolinium enhancement and a 24-hour Holter. Athletes had participated in endurance exercise for an average of 31±12.6 years. The majority (77%) were runners, with a median of 13 marathon runs per athlete.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Most athletes (60%) and controls (63%) had a normal CAC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>. Male athletes had a higher prevalence of atherosclerotic plaques of any luminal irregularity (44.3% versus 22.2%; <i>P</i>=0.009) compared with sedentary males, and only male athletes showed a CAC ≥300 Agatston units (11.3%) and a luminal stenosis ≥50% (7.5%). Male athletes demonstrated predominantly calcific plaques (72.7%), whereas sedentary males showed predominantly mixed morphology plaques (61.5%). The number of years of training was the only independent variable associated with increased risk of CAC >70th percentile for age or luminal stenosis ≥50% in male athletes (odds ratio, 1.08; 95% confidence interval, 1.01–1.15; <i>P</i>=0.016); 15 (14%) male athletes but none of the controls revealed late gadolinium enhancement on cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging. Of these athletes, 7 had a pattern consistent with previous myocardial infarction, including 3(42%) with a luminal stenosis ≥50% in the corresponding artery.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Most lifelong masters endurance athletes with a low atherosclerotic risk profile have normal CAC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s. Male athletes are more likely to have a CAC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> >300 Agatston units or coronary plaques compared with sedentary males with a similar risk profile. The significance of these observations is uncertain, but the predominantly calcific morphology of the plaques in athletes indicates potentially different pathophysiological mechanisms for plaque formation in athletic versus sedentary men. Coronary plaques are more abundant in athletes, whereas their stable nature could mitigate the risk of plaque rupture and acute myocardial infarction.</p></sec>

Common Genetic Variant Risk Score Is Associated With Drug-Induced QT Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes Risk
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Drug-induced QT interval prolongation, a risk factor for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, is a potential side effect of many marketed and withdrawn medications. The contribution of common genetic variants previously associated with baseline QT interval to drug-induced QT prolongation and arrhythmias is not known.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We tested the hypothesis that a weighted combination of common genetic variants contributing to QT interval at baseline, identified through genome-wide association studies, can predict individual response to multiple QT-prolonging drugs. Genetic analysis of 22 subjects was performed in a secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of 3 QT-prolonging drugs with 15 time-matched QT and plasma drug concentration measurements. Subjects received single doses of dofetilide, quinidine, ranolazine, and placebo. The outcome was the correlation between a genetic QT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> comprising 61 common genetic variants and the slope of an individual subject’s drug-induced increase in heart rate–corrected QT (QTc) versus drug concentration.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The genetic QT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> was correlated with drug-induced QTc prolongation. Among white subjects, genetic QT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> explained 30% of the variability in response to dofetilide (<i>r</i>=0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.09–0.81; <i>P</i>=0.02), 23% in response to quinidine (<i>r</i>=0.48; 95% confidence interval, −0.03 to 0.79; <i>P</i>=0.06), and 27% in response to ranolazine (<i>r</i>=0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.05–0.80; <i>P</i>=0.03). Furthermore, the genetic QT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> was a significant predictor of drug-induced torsade de pointes in an independent sample of 216 cases compared with 771 controls (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>=12%, <i>P</i>=1×10<sup>−7</sup>).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We demonstrate that a genetic QT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> comprising 61 common genetic variants explains a significant proportion of the variability in drug-induced QT prolongation and is a significant predictor of drug-induced torsade de pointes.

The nature of nurture: Effects of parental genotypes
<p>Sequence variants in the parental genomes that are not transmitted to a child (the proband) are often ignored in genetic studies. Here we show that nontransmitted alleles can affect a child through their impacts on the parents and other relatives, a phenomenon we call “genetic nurture.” Using results from a meta-analysis of educational attainment, we find that the polygenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> computed for the nontransmitted alleles of 21,637 probands with at least one parent genotyped has an estimated effect on the educational attainment of the proband that is 29.9% (<i>P</i> = 1.6 × 10<sup>−14</sup>) of that of the transmitted polygenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>. Genetic nurturing effects of this polygenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> extend to other traits. Paternal and maternal polygenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s have similar effects on educational attainment, but mothers contribute more than fathers to nutrition- and heath-related traits.</p>

Effect of pre-operative expectations on the outcomes following total shoulder arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims </title><p>Few studies have evaluated the relationship between patients’   pre-operative expectations and the outcome of orthopaedic procedures.   Our aim was to determine the effect of expectations on the outcome   after primary anatomical total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA). We hypothesised   that patients with greater expectations would have better outcomes. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Patients undergoing primary anatomical TSA completed the Hospital   for Special Surgery’s Shoulder Expectations Survey pre-operatively.   The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES), Shoulder Activity   Scale (SAS), Short-Form-36 (SF-36), and visual analogue scale (VAS)   for pain, fatigue, and general health <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s were also collected   pre-operatively and two years post-operatively. Pearson correlations   were used to assess the relationship between the number of expectations   and the outcomes. Differences in outcomes between those with higher   and lower levels of expectations for each expectation were assessed   by independent samples <i>t</i>-test. Multivariable linear   regression analysis was used to control for potential confounding   factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 67 patients were evaluated two years post-operatively.   Most parameters of outcome improved significantly from baseline   and most patients were satisfied. A greater number of expectations   was associated with a significantly greater improvement in the ASES   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> (p = 0.02). In the multivariable analysis, a greater number   of expectations was an independent predictor of better ASES, VAS   and SF-36 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s, as well as improvements in ASES and VAS pain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s   (p < 0.05). Greater expectations for many specific expectation   questions were significantly associated with better outcomes (p   < 0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>TSA is a successful procedure with significant improvements in   outcome, and greater    pre-operative expectations are associated with better outcomes. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1190–6.</p></sec>

The direct anterior approach in total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The most effective surgical approach for total hip arthroplasty   (THA) remains controversial. The direct anterior approach may be   associated with a reduced risk of dislocation, faster recovery,   reduced pain and fewer surgical complications. This systematic review   aims to evaluate the current evidence for the use of this approach   in THA.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Following the Cochrane collaboration, an extensive literature   search of PubMed, Medline, Embase and OvidSP was conducted. Randomised   controlled trials, comparative studies, and cohort studies were   included. Outcomes included the length of the incision, blood loss,   operating time, length of stay, complications, and gait analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 42 studies met the inclusion criteria. Most were of   medium to low quality. There was no difference between the direct   anterior, anterolateral or posterior approaches with regards to   length of stay and gait analysis.</p><p>Papers comparing the length of the incision found similar lengths   compared with the lateral approach, and conflicting results when   comparing the direct anterior and posterior approaches. </p><p>Most studies found the mean operating time to be significantly   longer when the direct anterior approach was used, with a steep   learning curve reported by many.</p><p>Many authors used validated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s including the Harris hip <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>,   and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index.   These mean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s were better following the use of the direct anterior   approach for the first six weeks post-operatively. Subsequently   there was no difference between these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s and those for the posterior   approach.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion </title><p>There is little evidence for improved kinematics or better long-term   outcomes following the use of the direct anterior approach for THA.   There is a steep learning curve with similar rates of complications,   length of stay and outcomes. </p><p>Well-designed, multi-centre, prospective randomised controlled   trials are required to provide evidence as to whether the direct   anterior approach is better than the lateral or posterior approaches   when undertaking THA.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone JointJ</i> 2017;99-B:732–40.</p></sec>

Early performance-based and patient-reported outcomes of a contemporary taper fit bone-conserving short stem femoral component in total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to compare early functional and health   related quality of life outcomes (HRQoL) in patients who have undergone   total hip arthroplasty (THA) using a bone conserving short stem   femoral component and those in whom a conventional length uncemented   component was used. Outcome was assessed using a validated performance   based outcome instrument as well as patient reported outcome measures   (PROMs).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We prospectively analysed 33 patients whose THA involved a contemporary   proximally porous coated tapered short stem femoral component and   53 patients with a standard conventional femoral component, at a   minimum follow-up of two years. The mean follow-up was 31.4 months   (24 to 39). Patients with poor proximal femoral bone quality were   excluded. The mean age of the patients was 66.6 years (59 to 77)   and the mean body mass index was 30.2 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (24.1 to   41.0). Outcome was assessed using the Oxford Hip <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> (OHS) and   the University College Hospital (UCH) hip <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> which is a validated   performance based instrument.

Validation of the English language Forgotten Joint Score-12 as an outcome measure for total hip and knee arthroplasty in a British population
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To validate the English language Forgotten Joint <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>-12 (FJS-12)   as a tool to evaluate the outcome of hip and knee arthroplasty in   a United Kingdom population.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>All patients undergoing surgery between January and August 2014   were eligible for inclusion. Prospective data were collected from   205 patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA) and 231 patients   undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Outcomes were assessed   with the FJS-12 and the Oxford Hip and Knee <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s (OHS, OKS) pre-operatively,   then at six and 12 months post-operatively.

Ageing, deep vein thrombosis and male gender predict poor outcome after acute Achilles tendon rupture
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Patients with an acute Achilles tendon rupture (ATR) take a long   time to heal, have a high incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)   and widely variable functional outcomes. This variation in outcome   may be explained by a lack of knowledge of adverse factors, and   a subsequent shortage of appropriate interventions. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 111 patients (95 men, 16 women; mean age 40.3, standard   deviation 8.4) with an acute total ATR were prospectively assessed.   At one year post-operatively a uniform outcome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>, Achilles Combined   Outcome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> (ACOS), was obtained by combining three validated,   independent, outcome measures: Achilles tendon Total Rupture <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>,   heel-rise height test, and limb symmetry heel-rise height.

A case–control study of surgical site infection following operative fixation of fractures of the ankle in a large UK trauma unit
<p>Most of the literature on surgical site infections   following the surgical treatment of fractures of the ankle is based   on small series of patients, focusing on diabetics or the elderly.   None have described post-operative functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s in those patients   who develop an infection. We performed an age- and gender-matched   case–control study to identify patient- and surgery-related risk   factors for surgical site infection following open reduction and   internal fixation of a fracture of the ankle. Logistic regression   analysis was used to identify significant risk factors for infection   and to calculate odds ratios (OR). Function was assessed using the   Olerud and Molander Ankle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>. The incidence of infection was   4% (29/717) and 1.1% (8/717) were deep infections. The median ankle   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> was significantly lower in the infection group compared with   the control group (60 <i>vs</i> 90, Mann–Whitney test   p < 0.0001). Multivariate regression analysis showed that diabetes   (OR = 15, p = 0.031), nursing home residence (OR = 12, p = 0.018)   and Weber C fractures (OR = 4, p = 0.048) were significant risk   factors for infection.</p><p>A low incidence of infection following open reduction and internal   fixation of fractures of the ankle was observed.

Assessing treatment outcomes using a single question
<p>Satisfaction with care is important to both patients   and to those who pay for it. The Net Promoter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> (NPS), widely   used in the service industries, has been introduced into the NHS   as the ‘friends and family test’; an overarching measure of patient   satisfaction. It assesses the likelihood of the patient recommending   the healthcare received to another, and is seen as a discriminator   of healthcare performance. We prospectively assessed 6186 individuals   undergoing primary lower limb joint replacement at a single university   hospital to determine the Net Promoter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> for joint replacements   and to evaluate which factors contributed to the response. </p><p>Achieving pain relief (odds ratio (OR) 2.13, confidence interval   (CI) 1.83 to 2.49), the meeting of pre-operative expectation (OR   2.57, CI 2.24 to 2.97), and the hospital experience (OR 2.33, CI   2.03 to 2.68) are the domains that explain whether a patient would   recommend joint replacement services. These three factors, combined   with the type of surgery undertaken (OR 2.31, CI 1.68 to 3.17),   drove a predictive model that was able to explain 95% of the variation   in the patient’s recommendation response. Though intuitively similar,   this ‘recommendation’ metric was found to be materially different   to satisfaction responses. The difference between THR (NPS 71) and   TKR (NPS 49) suggests that no overarching <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> for a department   should be used without an adjustment for case mix. However, the   Net Promoter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> does measure a further important dimension to   our existing metrics: the patient experience of healthcare delivery.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014;96-B:622–8.</p>

Wound irrigation does not affect health-related quality of life after open fractures: results of a randomized controlled trial
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The Fluid Lavage in Open Fracture Wounds (FLOW) trial was a multicentre,   blinded, randomized controlled trial that used a 2 × 3 factorial   design to evaluate the effect of irrigation solution (soap <i>versus</i> normal   saline) and irrigation pressure (very low <i>versus</i> low <i>versus</i> high)   on health-related quality of life (HRQL) in patients with open fractures.   In this study, we used this dataset to ascertain whether these factors   affect whether HRQL returns to pre-injury levels at 12-months post-injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Participants completed the Short Form-12 (SF-12) and the EuroQol-5   Dimensions (EQ-5D) at baseline (pre-injury recall), at two and six   weeks, and at three, six, nine and 12-months post-fracture. We calculated   the Physical Component <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> (PCS) and the Mental Component <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>   (MCS) of the SF-12 and the EQ-5D utility <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>, conducted an analysis   using a multi-level generalized linear model, and compared differences   between the baseline and 12-month <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We found no clinically important differences between irrigating   solutions or pressures for the SF-12 PCS, SF-12 MCS and EQ-5D.

The effectiveness of anterior cervical decompression and fusion for the relief of dizziness in patients with cervical spondylosis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Cervical spondylosis is often accompanied by dizziness. It has   recently been shown that the ingrowth of Ruffini corpuscles into   diseased cervical discs may be related to cervicogenic dizziness.   In order to evaluate whether cervicogenic dizziness stems from the   diseased cervical disc, we performed a prospective cohort study   to assess the effectiveness of anterior cervical discectomy and   fusion on the relief of dizziness.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Of 145 patients with cervical spondylosis and dizziness, 116   underwent anterior cervical decompression and fusion and 29 underwent   conservative treatment.

A pilot randomized trial of meniscal allograft transplantation versus personalized physiotherapy for patients with a symptomatic meniscal deficient knee compartment
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Meniscal allograft transplantation is undertaken to improve pain   and function in patients with a symptomatic meniscal deficient knee   compartment. While case series have shown improvements in patient   reported outcome measures (PROMs), its efficacy has not been rigorously   evaluated. This study aimed to compare PROMs in patients having   meniscal transplantation with those having personalized physiotherapy   at 12 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A single-centre assessor-blinded, comprehensive cohort study,   incorporating a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) was performed   on patients with a symptomatic compartment of the knee in which   a (sub)total meniscectomy had previously been performed. They were   randomized to be treated either with a meniscal allograft transplantation   or personalized physiotherapy, and stratified for malalignment of   the limb. They entered the preference groups if they were not willing   to be randomized. The Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> (KOOS),   International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> and Lysholm   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> and complications were collected at baseline and at four,   eight and 12 months following the interventions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 36 patients entered the study; 21 were randomized   and 15 chose their treatments. Their mean age was 28 years (range   17 to 46). The outcomes were similar in the randomized and preference   groups, allowing pooling of data. At 12 months, the KOOS<sub>4</sub> composite   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> (mean difference 12, p = 0.03) and KOOS subscales of pain   (mean difference 15, p = 0.02) and activities of daily living (mean   difference 18, p = 0.005) were significantly superior in the meniscal   transplantation group. Other PROMs also favoured this group without   reaching statistical significance. There were five complications   in the meniscal transplantation and one in the physiotherapy groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This is the first study to compare meniscal allograft transplantation   to non-operative treatment. The results provide the best quality   evidence to date of the symptomatic benefits of meniscal allograft   transplantation in the short term, but a multicentre RCT is required   to investigate this question further.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:56–63.</p></sec>

An entirely automated method to score DSS-induced colitis in mice by digital image analysis of pathology slides
<p>The DSS (dextran sulfate sodium) model of colitis is a mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease. Microscopic symptoms include loss of crypt cells from the gut lining and infiltration of inflammatory cells into the colon. An experienced pathologist requires several hours per study to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> histological changes in selected regions of the mouse gut. In order to increase the efficiency of scoring, Definiens Developer software was used to devise an entirely automated method to quantify histological changes in the whole H&E slide. When the algorithm was applied to slides from historical drug-discovery studies, automated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s classified 88% of drug candidates in the same way as pathologists’ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s. In addition, another automated image analysis method was developed to quantify colon-infiltrating macrophages, neutrophils, B cells and T cells in immunohistochemical stains of serial sections of the H&E slides. The timing of neutrophil and macrophage infiltration had the highest correlation to pathological changes, whereas T and B cell infiltration occurred later. Thus, automated image analysis enables quantitative comparisons between tissue morphology changes and cell-infiltration dynamics.</p>

Relationship Between Lifelong Exercise Volume and Coronary Atherosclerosis in Athletes
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Higher levels of physical activity are associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular events. Nevertheless, there is debate on the dose-response relationship of exercise and cardiovascular disease outcomes and whether high volumes of exercise may accelerate coronary atherosclerosis. We aimed to determine the relationship between lifelong exercise volumes and coronary atherosclerosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Middle-aged men engaged in competitive or recreational leisure sports underwent a noncontrast and contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan to assess coronary artery calcification (CAC) and plaque characteristics. Participants reported lifelong exercise history patterns. Exercise volumes were multiplied by metabolic equivalent of task (MET) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s to calculate MET-minutes per week. Participants’ activity was categorized as <1000, 1000 to 2000, or >2000 MET-min/wk.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 284 men (age, 55±7 years) were included. CAC was present in 150 of 284 participants (53%) with a median CAC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> of 35.8 (interquartile range, 9.3–145.8). Athletes with a lifelong exercise volume >2000 MET-min/wk (n=75) had a significantly higher CAC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> (9.4 [interquartile range, 0–60.9] versus 0 [interquartile range, 0–43.5]; <i>P</i>=0.02) and prevalence of CAC (68%; adjusted odds ratio [OR<sub>adjusted</sub>]=3.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6–6.6) and plaque (77%; OR<sub>adjusted</sub>=3.3; 95% CI, 1.6–7.1) compared with <1000 MET-min/wk (n=88; 43% and 56%, respectively). Very vigorous intensity exercise (≥9 MET) was associated with CAC (OR<sub>adjusted</sub>=1.47; 95% CI, 1.14–1.91) and plaque (OR<sub>adjusted</sub>=1.56; 95% CI, 1.17–2.08). Among participants with CAC>0, there was no difference in CAC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> (<i>P</i>=0.20), area (<i>P</i>=0.21), density (<i>P</i>=0.25), and regions of interest (<i>P</i>=0.20) across exercise volume groups. Among participants with plaque, the most active group (>2000 MET-min/wk) had a lower prevalence of mixed plaques (48% versus 69%; OR<sub>adjusted</sub>=0.35; 95% CI, 0.15–0.85) and more often had only calcified plaques (38% versus 16%; OR<sub>adjusted</sub>=3.57; 95% CI, 1.28–9.97) compared with the least active group (<1000 MET-min/wk).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Participants in the >2000 MET-min/wk group had a higher prevalence of CAC and atherosclerotic plaques. The most active group, however, had a more benign composition of plaques, with fewer mixed plaques and more often only calcified plaques. These observations may explain the increased longevity typical of endurance athletes despite the presence of more coronary atherosclerotic plaque in the most active participants.</p></sec>

Impact of Computed Tomography Perfusion Imaging on the Response to Tenecteplase in Ischemic Stroke
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>We pooled 2 clinical trials of tenecteplase compared with alteplase for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke, 1 that demonstrated superiority of tenecteplase and the other that showed no difference between the treatments in patient clinical outcomes. We tested the hypotheses that reperfusion therapy with tenecteplase would be superior to alteplase in improving functional outcomes in the group of patients with target mismatch as identified with advanced imaging.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We investigated whether tenecteplase-treated patients had a different 24-hour reduction in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and a favorable odds ratio of a modified Rankin scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> of 0 to 1 versus 2 to 6 compared with alteplase-treated patients using linear regression to generate odds ratios. Imaging outcomes included rates of vessel recanalization and infarct growth at 24 hours and occurrence of large parenchymal hematoma. Baseline computed tomography perfusion was analyzed to assess whether patients met the target mismatch criteria (absolute mismatch volume >15 mL, mismatch ratio >1.8, baseline ischemic core <70 mL, and volume of severely hypoperfused tissue <100 mL). Patients meeting target mismatch criteria were analyzed as a subgroup to identify whether they had different treatment responses from the pooled group.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 146 pooled patients, 71 received alteplase and 75 received tenecteplase. Tenecteplase-treated patients had greater early clinical improvement (median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> change: tenecteplase, 7; alteplase, 2; <i>P</i>=0.018) and less parenchymal hematoma (2 of 75 versus 10 of 71; <i>P</i>=0.02). The pooled group did not show improved patient outcomes when treated with tenecteplase (modified Rankin scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> 0–1: odds ratio, 1.77; 95% confidence interval, 0.89–3.51; <i>P</i>=0.102) compared with alteplase therapy. However, in patients with target mismatch (33 tenecteplase, 35 alteplase), treatment with tenecteplase was associated with greater early clinical improvement (median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> change: tenecteplase, 6; alteplase, 1; <i>P</i><0.001) and better late independent recovery (modified Rankin scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> 0–1: odds ratio, 2.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.13–5.94; <i>P</i>=0.032) than those treated with alteplase.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Tenecteplase may offer an improved efficacy and safety profile compared with alteplase, benefits possibly exaggerated in patients with baseline computed tomography perfusion–defined target mismatch.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Polygenic Risk Score Identifies Subgroup With Higher Burden of Atherosclerosis and Greater Relative Benefit From Statin Therapy in the Primary Prevention Setting
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Relative risk reduction with statin therapy has been consistent across nearly all subgroups studied to date. However, in analyses of 2 randomized controlled primary prevention trials (ASCOT [Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial–Lipid-Lowering Arm] and JUPITER [Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin]), statin therapy led to a greater relative risk reduction among a subgroup at high genetic risk. Here, we aimed to confirm this observation in a third primary prevention randomized controlled trial. In addition, we assessed whether those at high genetic risk had a greater burden of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied participants from a randomized controlled trial of primary prevention with statin therapy (WOSCOPS [West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study]; n=4910) and 2 observational cohort studies (CARDIA [Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults] and BioImage; n=1154 and 4392, respectively). For each participant, we calculated a polygenic risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> derived from up to 57 common DNA sequence variants previously associated with coronary heart disease. We compared the relative efficacy of statin therapy in those at high genetic risk (top quintile of polygenic risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>) versus all others (WOSCOPS), as well as the association between the polygenic risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> and coronary artery calcification (CARDIA) and carotid artery plaque burden (BioImage).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among WOSCOPS trial participants at high genetic risk, statin therapy was associated with a relative risk reduction of 44% (95% confidence interval [CI], 22–60; <i>P</i><0.001), whereas in all others, the relative risk reduction was 24% (95% CI, 8–37; <i>P</i>=0.004) despite similar low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering. In a study-level meta-analysis across the WOSCOPS, ASCOT, and JUPITER primary prevention, relative risk reduction in those at high genetic risk was 46% versus 26% in all others (<i>P</i> for heterogeneity=0.05). Across all 3 studies, the absolute risk reduction with statin therapy was 3.6% (95% CI, 2.0–5.1) among those in the high genetic risk group and 1.3% (95% CI, 0.6–1.9) in all others. Each 1-SD increase in the polygenic risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> was associated with 1.32-fold (95% CI, 1.04–1.68) greater likelihood of having coronary artery calcification and 9.7% higher (95% CI, 2.2–17.8) burden of carotid plaque.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Those at high genetic risk have a greater burden of subclinical atherosclerosis and derive greater relative and absolute benefit from statin therapy to prevent a first coronary heart disease event.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Plasma Ceramides, Mediterranean Diet, and Incident Cardiovascular Disease in the PREDIMED Trial (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although in vitro studies and investigations in animal models and small clinical populations have suggested that ceramides may represent an intermediate link between overnutrition and certain pathological mechanisms underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD), no prospective studies have investigated the association between plasma ceramides and risk of CVD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The study population consisted of 980 participants from the PREDIMED trial (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea), including 230 incident cases of CVD and 787 randomly selected participants at baseline (including 37 overlapping cases) followed for ≤7.4 years. Participants were randomized to a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra virgin olive oil, a Mediterranean diet supplemented with nuts, or a control diet. Plasma ceramide concentrations were measured on a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry metabolomics platform. The primary outcome was a composite of nonfatal acute myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death. Hazard ratios were estimated with weighted Cox regression models using Barlow weights to account for the case-cohort design.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The multivariable hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) comparing the extreme quartiles of plasma concentrations of C16:0, C22:0, C24:0, and C24:1 ceramides were 2.39 (1.49–3.83, <i>P</i><sub>trend</sub><0.001), 1.91 (1.21–3.01, <i>P</i><sub>trend</sub>=0.003), 1.97 (1.21–3.20, <i>P</i><sub>trend</sub>=0.004), and 1.73 (1.09–2.74, <i>P</i><sub>trend</sub>=0.011), respectively. The ceramide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>, calculated as a weighted sum of concentrations of four ceramides, was associated with a 2.18-fold higher risk of CVD across extreme quartiles (HR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.36–3.49; <i>P</i><sub>trend</sub><0.001). The association between baseline ceramide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> and incident CVD varied significantly by treatment groups (<i>P</i><sub>interaction</sub>=0.010).

Hemocompatibility-Related Outcomes in the MOMENTUM 3 Trial at 6 Months
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The HeartMate 3 (HM3) Left Ventricular Assist System (LVAS) (Abbott) is a centrifugal, fully magnetically levitated, continuous-flow blood pump engineered to enhance hemocompatibility and reduce shear stress on blood components. The MOMENTUM 3 trial (Multicenter Study of MagLev Technology in Patients Undergoing Mechanical Circulatory Support Therapy With HeartMate 3) compares the HM3 LVAS with the HeartMate II (HMII) LVAS (Abbott) in advanced heart failure refractory to medical management, irrespective of therapeutic intention (bridge to transplant versus destination therapy). This investigation reported its primary outcome in the short-term cohort (n=294; 6-month follow-up), demonstrating superiority of the HM3 for the trial primary end point (survival free of a disabling stroke or reoperation to replace the pump for malfunction), driven by a reduced need for reoperations. The aim of this analysis was to evaluate the aggregate of hemocompatibility-related clinical adverse events (HRAEs) between the 2 LVAS.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a secondary end point evaluation of HRAE (survival free of any nonsurgical bleeding, thromboembolic event, pump thrombosis, or neurological event) in the short-term cohort (as-treated cohort n=289) at 6 months.

Myocardial Infarction Risk After Discontinuation of Thienopyridine Therapy in the Randomized DAPT Study (Dual Antiplatelet Therapy)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Thienopyridine plus aspirin beyond 1 year after coronary stenting reduces myocardial infarction (MI) risk and increases bleeding risk in comparison with aspirin alone. The hazard associated with late thienopyridine discontinuation and risk factors for MI after discontinuation are poorly defined.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In the DAPT Study (Dual Antiplatelet Therapy), after percutaneous coronary intervention and 12 months of thienopyridine (clopidogrel or prasugrel) plus aspirin, eligible patients remained on aspirin and were randomly assigned to continued thienopyridine versus placebo for 18 months. At 30 months, patients stopped the study drug and were observed for 3 months. Cumulative incidence of MI was assessed over 3 months after randomization (months 12–15) and 3 months after study drug discontinuation (months 30–33). The MI hazard for each of these periods was assessed across randomized treatment arms and by DAPT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> values <2 or ≥2.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among the 11 648 randomly assigned patients, the monthly cumulative incidence of MI was lower with continued thienopyridine versus placebo at 12 to 15 months (0.12% versus 0.37%, <i>P</i><0.001, in all patients; 0.13% versus 0.27%, <i>P</i>=0.02, in patients not treated with paclitaxel-eluting stents), and higher at 30 to 33 months (0.30% versus 0.15%, <i>P</i>=0.013, in all patients; in patients without paclitaxel-eluting stents, 0.18% versus 0.17%, <i>P</i>=0.91). The majority of MIs in both time periods (74% and 76%) were not related to stent thrombosis. After multivariable adjustment, treatment arm independently predicted MI at months 12 to 15 (<i>P</i><0.001) and 30 to 33 (<i>P</i>=0.011). During months 12 to 15, patients with DAPT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s <2 or ≥2 both had lower rates of MI with continued thienopyridine (MI monthly incidence 0.16% versus 0.51%, <i>P</i><0.001, for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s ≥2; 0.08% versus 0.24%, <i>P</i>=0.012, for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s<2, interaction <i>P</i>=0.064).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Discontinuing thienopyridine after either 12 or 30 months is associated with an early increase in MI risk, mainly unrelated to stent thrombosis; the magnitude of risk is highest in the earlier time frame, and lower in patients not treated with paclitaxel-eluting stents.

Three Arterial Grafts Improve Late Survival
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Little evidence shows whether a third arterial graft provides superior outcomes compared with the use of 2 arterial grafts in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. A meta-analysis of all the propensity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>-matched observational studies comparing the long-term outcomes of coronary artery bypass grafting with the use of 2-arterial versus 3-arterial grafts was performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science to identify relevant articles. Long-term mortality in the propensity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>-matched populations was the primary end point. Secondary end points were in-hospital/30-day mortality for the propensity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>-matched populations and long-term mortality for the unmatched populations. In the matched population, time-to-event outcome for long-term mortality was extracted as hazard ratios, along with their variance. Statistical pooling of survival (time-to-event) was performed according to a random effect model, computing risk estimates with 95% confidence intervals.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Eight propensity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>-matched studies reporting on 10 287 matched patients (2-arterial graft: 5346; 3-arterial graft: 4941) were selected for final comparison. The mean follow-up time ranged from 37.2 to 196.8 months. The use of 3 arterial grafts was not statistically associated with early mortality (hazard ratio, 0.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.71–1.22; <i>P</i>=0.62). The use of 3 arterial grafts was associated with statistically significantly lower hazard for late death (hazard ratio, 0.8; 95% confidence interval, 0.75–0.87; <i>P</i><0.001), irrespective of sex and diabetic mellitus status. This result was qualitatively similar in the unmatched population (hazard ratio, 0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.33–0.98; <i>P</i>=0.04).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The use of a third arterial conduit in patients with coronary artery bypass grafting is not associated with higher operative risk and is associated with superior long-term survival, irrespective of sex and diabetic mellitus status.</p></sec>

Association Between Duration of Resuscitation and Favorable Outcome After Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Little evidence guides the appropriate duration of resuscitation in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, and case features justifying longer or shorter durations are ill defined. We estimated the impact of resuscitation duration on the probability of favorable functional outcome in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest using a large, multicenter cohort.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This was a secondary analysis of a North American, single-blind, multicenter, cluster-randomized, clinical trial (ROC-PRIMED [Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium Prehospital Resuscitation Using an Impedance Valve and Early Versus Delayed]) of consecutive adults with nontraumatic, emergency medical services–treated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Primary exposure was duration of resuscitation in minutes (onset of professional resuscitation to return of spontaneous circulation [ROSC] or termination of resuscitation). Primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge with favorable outcome (modified Rankin scale [mRS] <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> of 0–3). Subjects were additionally classified as survival with unfavorable outcome (mRS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> of 4–5), ROSC without survival (mRS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> of 6), or without ROSC. Subject accrual was plotted as a function of resuscitation duration, and the dynamic probability of favorable outcome at discharge was estimated for the whole cohort and subgroups. Adjusted logistic regression models tested the association between resuscitation duration and survival with favorable outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The primary cohort included 11 368 subjects (median age, 69 years [interquartile range, 56–81 years]; 7121 men [62.6%]). Of these, 4023 (35.4%) achieved ROSC, 1232 (10.8%) survived to hospital discharge, and 905 (8.0%) had an mRS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> of 0 to 3 at discharge. Distribution of cardiopulmonary resuscitation duration differed by outcome (<i>P</i><0.00001). For cardiopulmonary resuscitation duration up to 37.0 minutes (95% confidence interval, 34.9–40.9 minutes), 99% with an eventual mRS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> of 0 to 3 at discharge achieved ROSC. The dynamic probability of an mRS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> of 0 to 3 at discharge declined over elapsed resuscitation duration, but subjects with initial shockable cardiac rhythm, witnessed cardiac arrest, and bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation were more likely to survive with favorable outcome after prolonged efforts (30–40 minutes). After adjustment for prehospital (odds ratio, 0.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.92–0.95) and inpatient (odds ratio, 0.97; 95% confidence interval, 0.95–0.99) covariates, resuscitation duration was associated with survival to discharge with an mRS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> of 0 to 3.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Shorter resuscitation duration was associated with likelihood of favorable outcome at hospital discharge. Subjects with favorable case features were more likely to survive prolonged resuscitation up to 47 minutes.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Lack of Concordance Between Empirical Scores and Physician Assessments of Stroke and Bleeding Risk in Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Physicians treating patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) must weigh the benefits of anticoagulation in preventing stroke versus the risk of bleeding. Although empirical models have been developed to predict such risks, the degree to which these coincide with clinicians’ estimates is unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We examined 10 094 AF patients enrolled in the Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of AF (ORBIT-AF) registry between June 2010 and August 2011. Empirical stroke and bleeding risks were assessed by using the congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥75 years, diabetes mellitus, and previous stroke or transient ischemic attack (CHADS<sub>2</sub>) and Anticoagulation and Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation (ATRIA) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s, respectively. Separately, physicians were asked to categorize their patients’ stroke and bleeding risks: low risk (<3%); intermediate risk (3%–6%); and high risk (>6%). Overall, 72% (n=7251) in ORBIT-AF had high-risk CHADS<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s (≥2). However, only 16% were assessed as high stroke risk by physicians. Although 17% (n=1749) had high ATRIA bleeding risk (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> ≥5), only 7% (n=719) were considered so by physicians. The associations between empirical and physician-estimated stroke and bleeding risks were low (weighted Kappa 0.1 and 0.11, respectively). Physicians weighed hypertension, heart failure, and diabetes mellitus less significantly than empirical models in estimating stroke risk; physicians weighted anemia and dialysis less significantly than empirical models when estimating bleeding risks. Anticoagulation use was highest among patients with high stroke risk, assessed by either empirical model or physician estimates. In contrast, physician and empirical estimates of bleeding had limited impact on treatment choice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>There is little agreement between provider-assessed risk and empirical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s in AF. These differences may explain, in part, the current divergence of anticoagulation treatment decisions from guideline recommendations.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration—</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Ten-year follow-up study of three alternative bearing surfaces used in total hip arthroplasty in young patients
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We present the ten-year data of a cohort of patients, aged between   18 and 65 years (mean age 52.7 years; 19 to 64), who underwent total   hip arthroplasty. Patients were randomised to be treated with a   cobalt-chrome (CoCr) femoral head with an ultra-high molecular weight   polyethylene (UHMWPE), highly cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) or   ceramic-on-ceramic (CoC) bearing surface.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 102 hips (91 patients) were randomised into the three   groups. At ten years, 97 hips were available for radiological and   functional follow-up. Two hips (two patients) had been revised (one   with deep infection and one for periprosthetic fracture) and three   were lost to follow-up. Radiological analysis was performed using   a validated digital assessment programme to give linear, directional   and volumetric wear of the two polyethylene groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was a significantly reduced rate of steady-state linear   wear with XLPE (0.07 mm/yr) compared with UHMWPE (0.37 mm/yr) (p   = 0.001). Volumetric wear was also significantly reduced in the   XLPE group (29.29 mm<sup>3</sup>/yr) compared with the UHMWPE group   (100.75mm<sup>3</sup>/yr) (p = 0.0001). There were six patients   with UHMWPE who had non-progressive osteolysis and none in the XLPE   group. All three bearing groups had significant improvements in   12-item short form health survey <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s, Western Ontario and McMaster   Universities Osteoarthritis Index <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong> and Harris Hip <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>. However,   the improvement in HSS was significantly less in the UHMWPE group   (p = 0.0188) than in the other two groups.</p><p>At ten years, the rates of volumetric and linear wear in the   XLPE group remain low and predominantly below the estimated threshold   for osteolysis (1 mm/yr). The rate of linear wear in the XLPE group   was three times less than in the UHMWPE group at five-year follow-up   and five times less at ten years. The rate of volumetric wear was also   three times less in the XLPE group at ten years.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>While CoC also performs well, XLPE at ten years remains a safe   and excellent bearing option in young patients, with low rates of   wear and no evidence of osteolysis.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1590–5.</p></sec>

The Rim Cutter does not show an advantage over modern cementing techniques
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We report the incidence of radiolucent lines (RLLs) using two   flanged acetabular components at total hip arthroplasty (THA) and   the effect of the Rim Cutter.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We performed a retrospective review of 300 hips in 292 patients   who underwent primary cemented THA. A contemporary flanged acetabular   component was used with (group 1) and without (group 2) the use   of the Rim Cutter and the Rimfit acetabular component was used with   the Rim Cutter (group 3). RLLs and clinical outcomes were evaluated   immediately post-operatively and at five years post-operatively.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was no significant difference in the incidence of RLLs   on the immediate post-operative radiographs (p = 0.241) or at five   years post-operatively (p = 0.463). RLLs were seen on the immediate   post-operative radiograph in 2% of hips in group 1, in 5% in group   2 and in 7% in group 3. Five years post-operatively, there were   RLLs in 42% of hips in group 1, 41% in group 2 and in 49% in group   3. In the vast majority of hips, in each group, the RLL was present   in DeLee and Charnley zone 1 only (86%, 83%, 67% respectively).   Oxford and Harris Hip <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>s improved significantly in all groups.

Long-term outcome of carpal tunnel release surgery in patients with severe carpal tunnel syndrome
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Few studies have examined the long-term outcome of carpal tunnel   release (CTR). The aim of this study was to evaluate the patient-reported   long-term outcome of CTR for electrophysiologically severe carpal   tunnel syndrome (CTS).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We reviewed the long-term outcome of 40 patients with bilateral   severe CTS who underwent 80 CTRs (46 open, 34 endoscopic) between   2002 and 2012.

Revision total knee arthroplasty for failed high tibial osteotomy and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty have similar patient-reported outcome measures in a two-year follow-up study
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Little is known about the relative outcomes of revision of unicompartmental   knee arthroplasty (UKA) and high tibial osteotomy (HTO) to total   knee arthroplasty (TKA). The aim of this study is to compare the   outcomes of revision surgery for the two procedures in terms of   complications, re-revision and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs)   at a minimum of two years follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This study was a retrospective review of data from an institutional   arthroplasty registry for cases performed between 2001 and 2014.   A total of 292 patients were identified, of which 217 had a revision   of HTO to TKA, and 75 had revision of UKA to TKA. While mean follow-up   was longer for the HTO group compared with the UKA group, patient   demographics (age, body mass index and Charlson co-morbidity index)   and PROMs (Short Form-36, Oxford Knee <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>, Knee Society <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">score</span></strong>,   both objective and functional) were similar in the two groups prior   to revision surgery.

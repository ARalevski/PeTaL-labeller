Conventional Versus Compression-Only Versus No-Bystander Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation for Pediatric Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) (chest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">com<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong></span></strong>ion and rescue breathing) has been recommended for pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) because of the asphyxial nature of the majority of pediatric cardiac arrest events. However, the clinical effectiveness of additional rescue breathing (conventional CPR) compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">com<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong></span></strong>ion-only CPR in children is uncertain.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This nationwide population-based study of pediatric OHCA patients was based on data from the All-Japan Utstein Registry. We included all pediatric patients who experienced OHCA in Japan from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2012. The primary outcome was a favorable neurological state 1 month after OHCA defined as a Glasgow-Pittsburgh Cerebral Performance Category score of 1 to 2 (corresponding to a Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category score of 1–3). Outcomes were compared with logistic regression with uni- and multivariable modeling in the overall cohort and for a propensity-matched subset of patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 2157 patients were included; 417 received conventional CPR, 733 received <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">com<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong></span></strong>ion-only CPR, and 1007 did not receive any bystander CPR. Among these patients, 213 (9.9%) survived with a favorable neurological status 1 month after OHCA, including 108/417 (25.9%) for conventional, 68/733 (9.3%) for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">com<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong></span></strong>ion-only, and 37/1007 (3.7%) for no-bystander CPR. In unadjusted analyses, conventional CPR was superior to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">com<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong></span></strong>ion-only CPR in neurologically favorable survival (odds ratio [OR] 3.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.45–4.76; <i>P</i><0.0001), with a trend favoring conventional CPR that was no longer statistically significant after multivariable adjustment (OR<sub>adjusted</sub> 1.52, 95% CI 0.93–2.49), and with further attenuation of the difference in a propensity-matched subset (OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.81–1.77). Both conventional and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">com<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong></span></strong>ion-only CPR were associated with higher odds for neurologically favorable survival compared with no-bystander CPR (OR<sub>adjusted</sub> 5.01, 95% CI 2.98–8.57, and OR<sub>adjusted</sub> 3.29, 95% CI 1.93–5.71), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In this population-based study of pediatric OHCA in Japan, both conventional and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">com<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong></span></strong>ion-only CPR were associated with superior outcomes compared with no-bystander CPR. Unadjusted outcomes with conventional CPR were superior to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">com<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong></span></strong>ion-only CPR, with the magnitude of difference attenuated and no longer statistically significant after statistical adjustments. These findings support randomized clinical trials comparing conventional versus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">com<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong></span></strong>ion-only CPR in children, with conventional CPR preferred until such controlled comparative data are available, and either method preferred over no-bystander CPR.</p></sec>

Duration of Ventilations During Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation by Lay Rescuers and First Responders
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>The 2010 guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation allow 5 seconds to give 2 breaths to deliver sufficient chest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">com<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong></span></strong>ions and to keep perfusion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong>ure high. This study aims to determine whether the recommended short interruption for ventilations by trained lay rescuers and first responders can be achieved and to evaluate its consequence for chest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">com<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong></span></strong>ions and survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>From a prospective data collection of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, we used automatic external defibrillator recordings of cardiopulmonary resuscitation by rescuers who had received a standard European Resuscitation Council basic life support and automatic external defibrillator course. Ventilation periods and total <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">com<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong></span></strong>ions delivered per minute during each 2 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation cycle were measured, and the chest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">com<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong></span></strong>ion fraction was calculated. Neurological intact survival to discharge was studied in relation to these factors and covariates. We included 199 automatic external defibrillator recordings. The median interruption time for 2 ventilations was 7 seconds (25th–75th percentile, 6–9 seconds). Of all rescuers, 21% took <5 seconds and 83% took <10 seconds for a ventilation period; 97%, 88%, and 63% of rescuers were able to deliver >60, >70, and >80 chest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">com<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong></span></strong>ions per minute, respectively. The median chest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">com<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong></span></strong>ion fraction was 65% (25th–75th percentile, 59%–71%).

Cold acclimation alters the connective tissue content of the zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) heart
<p>Thermal acclimation can alter cardiac function and morphology in a number of fish species, but little is known about the regulation of these changes. The purpose of the present study was to determine how cold acclimation affects zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) cardiac morphology, collagen composition and connective tissue regulation. Heart volume, the thickness of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong> myocardium, collagen content and collagen fiber composition were compared between control (27°C) and cold-acclimated (20°C) zebrafish using serially sectioned hearts stained with Picrosirius Red. Collagen content and fiber composition of the pericardial membrane were also examined. Cold acclimation did not affect the volume of the contracted heart; however, there was a significant decrease in the thickness of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong> myocardium. There was also a decrease in the collagen content of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong> myocardium and in the amount of thick collagen fibers throughout the heart. Cold-acclimated zebrafish also increased ex<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong>ion of the gene transcript for matrix metalloproteinase 2, matrix metalloproteinase 9, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 and collagen Type I α1. We propose that the reduction in the thickness of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong> myocardium as well as the change in collagen content may help to maintain the compliance of the ventricle as temperatures decrease. Together, these results clearly demonstrate that the zebrafish heart undergoes significant remodeling in response to cold acclimation.</p>

H3K9me3-heterochromatin loss at protein-coding genes enables developmental lineage specification
<p>Gene silencing by chromatin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong>ion is integral to establishing and maintaining cell fates. Trimethylated histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9me3)–marked heterochromatin is reduced in embryonic stem cells compared to differentiated cells. However, the establishment and dynamics of closed regions of chromatin at protein-coding genes, in embryologic development, remain elusive. We developed an antibody-independent method to isolate and map <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong>ed heterochromatin from low–cell number samples. We discovered high levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong>ed heterochromatin, H3K9me3-decorated, at protein-coding genes in early, uncommitted cells at the germ-layer stage, undergoing profound rearrangements and reduction upon differentiation, concomitant with cell type–specific gene ex<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong>ion. Perturbation of the three H3K9me3-related methyltransferases revealed a pivotal role for H3K9me3 heterochromatin during lineage commitment at the onset of organogenesis and for lineage fidelity maintenance.</p>

Ghost cytometry
<p>Ghost imaging is a technique used to produce an object’s image without using a spatially resolving detector. Here we develop a technique we term “ghost cytometry,” an image-free ultrafast fluorescence “imaging” cytometry based on a single-pixel detector. Spatial information obtained from the motion of cells relative to a static randomly patterned optical structure is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">com<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong></span></strong>ively converted into signals that arrive sequentially at a single-pixel detector. Combinatorial use of the temporal waveform with the intensity distribution of the random pattern allows us to computationally reconstruct cell morphology. More importantly, we show that applying machine-learning methods directly on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">com<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong></span></strong>ed waveforms without image reconstruction enables efficient image-free morphology-based cytometry. Despite a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong> and inexpensive instrumentation, image-free ghost cytometry achieves accurate and high-throughput cell classification and selective sorting on the basis of cell morphology without a specific biomarker, both of which have been challenging to accomplish using conventional flow cytometers.</p>

Mutation of a nucleosome compaction region disrupts Polycomb-mediated axial patterning
<p>Nucleosomes play important structural and regulatory roles by tightly wrapping the DNA that constitutes the metazoan genome. The Polycomb group (PcG) proteins modulate nucleosomes to maintain re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong>ion of key developmental genes, including <i>Hox</i> genes whose temporal and spatial ex<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong>ion is tightly regulated to guide patterning of the anterior-posterior body axis. CBX2, a component of the mammalian Polycomb re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong>ive complex 1 (PRC1), contains a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong>ion region that has the biochemically defined activity of bridging adjacent nucleosomes. Here, we demonstrate that a functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong>ion region is necessary for proper body patterning, because mutating this region leads to homeotic transformations similar to those observed with PcG loss-of-function mutations. We propose that CBX2-driven nucleosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong>ion is a key mechanism by which PcG proteins maintain gene silencing during mouse development.</p>

Direct and continuous strain control of catalysts with tunable battery electrode materials
<p>We report a method for using battery electrode materials to directly and continuously control the lattice strain of platinum (Pt) catalyst and thus tune its catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Whereas the common approach of using metal overlayers introduces ligand effects in addition to strain, by electrochemically switching between the charging and discharging status of battery electrodes the change in volume can be precisely controlled to induce either <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">com<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong></span></strong>ive or tensile strain on supported catalysts. Lattice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">com<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong></span></strong>ion and tension induced by the lithium cobalt oxide substrate of ~5% were directly observed in individual Pt nanoparticles with aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy.

Post-operative neuropathy after total hip arthroplasty
<p>Nerve palsy is a well-described complication   following total hip arthroplasty, but is highly distressing and   disabling. A nerve palsy may cause difficulty with the post-operative   rehabilitation, and overall mobility of the patient. Nerve palsy   may result from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">com<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong></span></strong>ion and tension to the affected nerve(s)   during the course of the operation via surgical manipulation and   retractor placement, tension from limb lengthening or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">com<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong></span></strong>ion   from post-operative hematoma. In the literature, hip dysplasia,   lengthening of the leg, the use of an uncemented femoral component, and   female gender are associated with a greater risk of nerve palsy.   We examined our experience at a high-volume, tertiary care referral   centre, and found an overall incidence of 0.3% out of 39 056 primary   hip arthroplasties. Risk factors found to be associated with the   incidence of nerve palsy at our institution included the presence   of spinal stenosis or lumbar disc disease, age younger than 50,   and smoking. If a nerve palsy is diagnosed, imaging is mandatory   and surgical evacuation or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">com<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong></span></strong>ive haematomas may be beneficial.   As palsies are slow to recover, supportive care such as bracing,   therapy, and reassurance are the mainstays of treatment.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B(1 Supple   A):46–9.</p>

Fkbp1a controls ventricular myocardium trabeculation and compaction by regulating endocardial Notch1 activity
<p>Trabeculation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong>ion of the embryonic myocardium are morphogenetic events crucial for the formation and function of the ventricular walls. Fkbp1a (FKBP12) is a ubiquitously ex<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong>ed <i>cis</i>-<i>trans</i> peptidyl-prolyl isomerase. <i>Fkbp1a</i>-deficient mice develop ventricular hypertrabeculation and non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong>ion. To determine the physiological function of Fkbp1a in regulating the intercellular and intracellular signaling pathways involved in ventricular trabeculation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong>ion, we generated a series of <i>Fkbp1a</i> conditional knockouts. Surprisingly, cardiomyocyte-restricted ablation of <i>Fkbp1a</i> did not give rise to the ventricular developmental defect, whereas endothelial cell-restricted ablation of <i>Fkbp1a</i> recapitulated the ventricular hypertrabeculation and non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong>ion observed in <i>Fkbp1a</i> systemically deficient mice, suggesting an important contribution of Fkbp1a within the developing endocardia in regulating the morphogenesis of ventricular trabeculation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong>ion. Further analysis demonstrated that Fkbp1a is a novel negative modulator of activated Notch1. Activated Notch1 (N1ICD) was significantly upregulated in <i>Fkbp1a</i>-ablated endothelial cells <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>. Overex<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong>ion of Fkbp1a significantly reduced the stability of N1ICD and direct inhibition of Notch signaling significantly reduced hypertrabeculation in <i>Fkbp1a</i>-deficient mice. Our findings suggest that Fkbp1a-mediated regulation of Notch1 plays an important role in intercellular communication between endocardium and myocardium, which is crucial in controlling the formation of the ventricular walls.</p>

Electrified methane reforming: A compact approach to greener industrial hydrogen production
<p>Electrification of conventionally fired chemical reactors has the potential to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and provide flexible and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong> heat generation. Here, we describe a disruptive approach to a fundamental process by integrating an electrically heated catalytic structure directly into a steam-methane–reforming (SMR) reactor for hydrogen production. Intimate contact between the electric heat source and the reaction site drives the reaction close to thermal equilibrium, increases catalyst utilization, and limits unwanted byproduct formation. The integrated design with small characteristic length scales allows <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong> reactor designs, potentially 100 times smaller than current reformer platforms. Electrification of SMR offers a strong platform for new reactor design, scale, and implementation opportunities. Implemented on a global scale, this could correspond to a reduction of nearly 1% of all CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>

Ultrafast optical ranging using microresonator soliton frequency combs
<p>Light detection and ranging is widely used in science and industry. Over the past decade, optical frequency combs were shown to offer advantages in optical ranging, enabling fast distance acquisition with high accuracy. Driven by emerging high-volume applications such as industrial sensing, drone navigation, or autonomous driving, there is now a growing demand for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong> ranging systems. Here, we show that soliton Kerr comb generation in integrated silicon nitride microresonators provides a route to high-performance chip-scale ranging systems. We demonstrate dual-comb distance measurements with Allan deviations down to 12 nanometers at averaging times of 13 microseconds along with ultrafast ranging at acquisition rates of 100 megahertz, allowing for in-flight sampling of gun projectiles moving at 150 meters per second. Combining integrated soliton-comb ranging systems with chip-scale nanophotonic phased arrays could enable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong> ultrafast ranging systems for emerging mass applications.</p>

Maxima in the thermodynamic response and correlation functions of deeply supercooled water
<p>Femtosecond x-ray laser pulses were used to probe micrometer-sized water droplets that were cooled down to 227 kelvin in vacuum. Isothermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">com<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong></span></strong>ibility and correlation length were extracted from x-ray scattering at the low–momentum transfer region. The temperature dependence of these thermodynamic response and correlation functions shows maxima at 229 kelvin for water and 233 kelvin for heavy water. In addition, we observed that the liquids undergo the fastest growth of tetrahedral structures at similar temperatures. These observations point to the existence of a Widom line, defined as the locus of maximum correlation length emanating from a critical point at positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong>ures in the deeply supercooled regime. The difference in the maximum value of the isothermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">com<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong></span></strong>ibility between the two isotopes shows the importance of nuclear quantum effects.</p>

Compacted dimensions and singular plasmonic surfaces

An extra dimension of the grating is hidden, and the surface plasmon excitations, though localized at the surface, are characterized by three wave vectors rather than the two of typical two-dimensional metal grating.

Thirst-associated preoptic neurons encode an aversive motivational drive
<p>Water deprivation produces a drive to seek and consume water. How neural activity creates this motivation remains poorly understood. We used activity-dependent genetic labeling to characterize neurons activated by water deprivation in the hypothalamic median preoptic nucleus (MnPO). Single-cell transcriptional profiling revealed that dehydration-activated MnPO neurons consist of a single excitatory cell type. After optogenetic activation of these neurons, mice drank water and performed an operant lever-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong>ing task for water reward with rates that scaled with stimulation frequency. This stimulation was aversive, and instrumentally pausing stimulation could reinforce lever-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong>ing. Activity of these neurons gradually decreased over the course of an operant session. Thus, the activity of dehydration-activated MnPO neurons establishes a scalable, persistent, and aversive internal state that dynamically controls thirst-motivated behavior.</p>

ChromEMT: Visualizing 3D chromatin structure and compaction in interphase and mitotic cells
<p>The chromatin structure of DNA determines genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong>ion and activity in the nucleus. On the basis of in vitro structures and electron microscopy (EM) studies, the hierarchical model is that 11-nanometer DNA-nucleosome polymers fold into 30- and subsequently into 120- and 300- to 700-nanometer fibers and mitotic chromosomes. To visualize chromatin in situ, we identified a fluorescent dye that stains DNA with an osmiophilic polymer and selectively enhances its contrast in EM. Using ChromEMT (ChromEM tomography), we reveal the ultrastructure and three-dimensional (3D) organization of individual chromatin polymers, megabase domains, and mitotic chromosomes. We show that chromatin is a disordered 5- to 24-nanometer-diameter curvilinear chain that is packed together at different 3D concentration distributions in interphase and mitosis. Chromatin chains have many different particle arrangements and bend at various lengths to achieve structural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong>ion and high packing densities.</p>

Microtubules acquire resistance from mechanical breakage through intralumenal acetylation
<p>Eukaryotic cells rely on long-lived microtubules for intracellular transport and as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">com<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong></span></strong>ion-bearing elements. We considered that long-lived microtubules are acetylated inside their lumen and that microtubule acetylation may modify microtubule mechanics. Here, we found that tubulin acetylation is required for the mechanical stabilization of long-lived microtubules in cells. Depletion of the tubulin acetyltransferase TAT1 led to a significant increase in the frequency of microtubule breakage. Nocodazole-resistant microtubules lost upon removal of acetylation were largely restored by either pharmacological or physical removal of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">com<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong></span></strong>ive forces. In in vitro reconstitution experiments, acetylation was sufficient to protect microtubules from mechanical breakage. Thus, acetylation increases mechanical resilience to ensure the persistence of long-lived microtubules.</p>

<i>De novo</i> formation of nucleoli in developing mouse embryos originating from enucleolated zygotes
<p>The large, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong> oocyte nucleoli, sometimes referred to as nucleolus precursor bodies (NPBs), are essential for embryonic development in mammals; in their absence, the oocytes complete maturation and can be fertilized, but no nucleoli are formed in the zygote or embryo, leading to developmental failure. It has been convincingly documented that zygotes inherit the oocyte nucleolar material and form NPBs again in pronuclei. It is commonly accepted that during early embryonic development, the original <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong> zygote NPBs gradually transform into reticulated nucleoli of somatic cells. Here, we show that zygote NPBs are not required for embryonic and full-term development in the mouse. When NPBs were removed from late-stage zygotes by micromanipulation, the enucleolated zygotes developed to the blastocyst stage and, after transfer to recipients, live pups were obtained. We also describe <i>de novo</i> formation of nucleoli in developing embryos. After removal of NPBs from zygotes, they formed new nucleoli after several divisions. These results indicate that the zygote NPBs are not used in embryonic development and that the nucleoli in developing embryos originate from <i>de novo</i> synthesized materials.</p>

Basal aurora kinase B activity is sufficient for histone H3 phosphorylation in prophase
<p>Histone H3 phosphorylation is the hallmark of mitosis deposited by aurora kinase B. Benzo[e]pyridoindoles are a family of potent, broad, ATP-competitive aurora kinase inhibitors. However, benzo[e]pyridoindole C4 only inhibits histone H3 phosphorylation in prophase but not in metaphase. Under the C4 treatment, the cells enter into mitosis with dephosphorylated histone H3, assemble chromosomes normally and progress to metaphase, and then to anaphase. C4 also induces lagging chromosome in anaphase but we demonstrated that these chromosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong>ion defects are not related to the absence of H3 phosphorylation in prophase. As a result of C4 action, mitosis lasts longer and the cell cycle is slowed down.</p><p>We reproduced the mitotic defects with reduced concentrations of potent pan aurora kinase as well as with a specific aurora B ATP-competitive inhibitor; we therefore propose that histone H3 phosphorylation and anaphase chromosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong>ion involve the basal activity of aurora kinase B. Our data suggest that aurora kinase B is progressively activated at mitosis entry and at anaphase onset. The full activation of aurora kinase B by its partners, in prometaphase, induces a shift in the catalytic domain of aurora B that modifies its affinity for ATP. These waves of activation/deactivation of aurora B correspond to different conformations of the chromosomal complex revealed by FRAP.</p><p>The presence of lagging chromosomes may have deleterious consequences on the daughter cells and, unfortunately, the situation may be encountered in patients receiving treatment with aurora kinase inhibitors.</p>

Coherently aligned nanoparticles within a biogenic single crystal: A biological prestressing strategy
<p>In contrast to synthetic materials, materials produced by organisms are formed in ambient conditions and with a limited selection of elements. Nevertheless, living organisms reveal elegant strategies for achieving specific functions, ranging from skeletal support to mastication, from sensors and defensive tools to optical function. Using state-of-the-art characterization techniques, we present a biostrategy for strengthening and toughening the otherwise brittle calcite optical lenses found in the brittlestar <i>Ophiocoma wendtii</i>. This intriguing process uses coherent nanoprecipitates to induce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">com<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong></span></strong>ive stresses on the host matrix, functionally resembling the Guinier–Preston zones known in classical metallurgy. We believe that these calcitic nanoparticles, being rich in magnesium, segregate during or just after transformation from amorphous to crystalline phase, similarly to segregation behavior from a supersaturated quenched alloy.</p>

Giant nonlinear response at a plasmonic nanofocus drives efficient four-wave mixing
<p>Efficient optical frequency mixing typically must accumulate over large interaction lengths because nonlinear responses in natural materials are inherently weak. This limits the efficiency of mixing processes owing to the requirement of phase matching. Here, we report efficient four-wave mixing (FWM) over micrometer-scale interaction lengths at telecommunications wavelengths on silicon. We used an integrated plasmonic gap waveguide that strongly confines light within a nonlinear organic polymer. The gap waveguide intensifies light by nanofocusing it to a mode cross-section of a few tens of nanometers, thus generating a nonlinear response so strong that efficient FWM accumulates over wavelength-scale distances. This technique opens up nonlinear optics to a regime of relaxed phase matching, with the possibility of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong>, broadband, and efficient frequency mixing integrated with silicon photonics.</p>

Stripe order in the underdoped region of the two-dimensional Hubbard model
<p>Competing inhomogeneous orders are a central feature of correlated electron materials, including the high-temperature superconductors. The two-dimensional Hubbard model serves as the canonical microscopic physical model for such systems. Multiple orders have been proposed in the underdoped part of the phase diagram, which corresponds to a regime of maximum numerical difficulty. By combining the latest numerical methods in exhaustive simulations, we uncover the ordering in the underdoped ground state. We find a stripe order that has a highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">com<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong></span></strong>ible wavelength on an energy scale of a few kelvin, with wavelength fluctuations coupled to pairing order. The favored filled stripe order is different from that seen in real materials. Our results demonstrate the power of modern numerical methods to solve microscopic models, even in challenging settings.</p>

Creation of a Bose-condensed gas of <sup>87</sup>Rb by laser cooling
<p>Protocols for attaining quantum degeneracy in atomic gases almost exclusively rely on evaporative cooling, a time-consuming final step associated with substantial atom loss. We demonstrate direct laser cooling of a gas of rubidium-87 (<sup>87</sup>Rb) atoms to quantum degeneracy. The method is fast and induces little atom loss. The atoms are trapped in a two-dimensional optical lattice that enables cycles of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">com<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong></span></strong>ion to increase the density, followed by Raman sideband cooling to decrease the temperature. From a starting number of 2000 atoms, 1400 atoms reach quantum degeneracy in 300 milliseconds, as confirmed by a bimodal velocity distribution. The method should be broadly applicable to many bosonic and fermionic species and to systems where evaporative cooling is not possible.</p>

The fundamental advantages of temporal networks
<p>Most networked systems of scientific interest are characterized by temporal links, meaning the network’s structure changes over time. Link temporality has been shown to hinder many dynamical processes, from information spreading to accessibility, by disrupting network paths. Considering the ubiquity of temporal networks in nature, we ask: Are there any advantages of the networks’ temporality? We use an analytical framework to show that temporal networks can, compared to their static counterparts, reach controllability faster, demand orders of magnitude less control energy, and have control trajectories, that are considerably more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong> than those characterizing static networks. Thus, temporality ensures a degree of flexibility that would be unattainable in static networks, enhancing our ability to control them.</p>

Perovskite solar cells with CuSCN hole extraction layers yield stabilized efficiencies greater than 20%
<p>Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with efficiencies greater than 20% have been realized only with expensive organic hole-transporting materials. We demonstrate PSCs that achieve stabilized efficiencies exceeding 20% with copper(I) thiocyanate (CuSCN) as the hole extraction layer. A fast solvent removal method enabled the creation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong>, highly conformal CuSCN layers that facilitate rapid carrier extraction and collection. The PSCs showed high thermal stability under long-term heating, although their operational stability was poor. This instability originated from potential-induced degradation of the CuSCN/Au contact. The addition of a conductive reduced graphene oxide spacer layer between CuSCN and gold allowed PSCs to retain >95% of their initial efficiency after aging at a maximum power point for 1000 hours under full solar intensity at 60°C. Under both continuous full-sun illumination and thermal stress, CuSCN-based devices surpassed the stability of spiro-OMeTAD–based PSCs.</p>

The condensin complex is a mechanochemical motor that translocates along DNA
<p>Condensin plays crucial roles in chromosome organization and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong>ion, but the mechanistic basis for its functions remains obscure. We used single-molecule imaging to demonstrate that <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> condensin is a molecular motor capable of adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis–dependent translocation along double-stranded DNA. Condensin’s translocation activity is rapid and highly processive, with individual complexes traveling an average distance of ≥10 kilobases at a velocity of ~60 base pairs per second. Our results suggest that condensin may take steps comparable in length to its ~50-nanometer coiled-coil subunits, indicative of a translocation mechanism that is distinct from any reported for a DNA motor protein. The finding that condensin is a mechanochemical motor has important implications for understanding the mechanisms of chromosome organization and condensation.</p>

Reversible electrostatic forces reduce parasitic power consumption and allow efficient heat transfer through good thermal contacts with the heat source or heat sink.

Structure of histone-based chromatin in Archaea

DNA wraps around an extended polymer, formed by archaeal histone homodimers, in a quasi-continuous superhelix with the same geometry as DNA in the eukaryotic nucleosome. Substitutions of a conserved glycine at the interface of adjacent protein layers destabilize archaeal chromatin, reduce growth rate, and impair transcription regulation, confirming the biological importance of the polymeric structure.

Complete measurement of helicity and its dynamics in vortex tubes
<p>Helicity, a topological measure of the intertwining of vortices in a fluid flow, is a conserved quantity in inviscid fluids but can be dissipated by viscosity in real flows.

We measured the total helicity of thin-core vortex tubes in water. For helical vortices that are stretched or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">com<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong></span></strong>ed by a second vortex, we found conservation of total helicity.

<i>Bacillus subtilis</i> SMC complexes juxtapose chromosome arms as they travel from origin to terminus
<p>Structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) complexes play critical roles in chromosome dynamics in virtually all organisms, but how they function remains poorly understood. In the bacterium <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, SMC-condensin complexes are topologically loaded at centromeric sites adjacent to the replication origin. Here we provide evidence that these ring-shaped assemblies tether the left and right chromosome arms together while traveling from the origin to the terminus (>2 megabases) at rates >50 kilobases per minute. Condensin movement scales linearly with time, providing evidence for an active transport mechanism. These data support a model in which SMC complexes function by processively enlarging DNA loops. Loop formation followed by processive enlargement provides a mechanism by which condensin complexes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong> and resolve sister chromatids in mitosis and by which cohesin generates topologically associating domains during interphase.</p>

Translational termination without a stop codon
<p>Ribosomes stall when they encounter the end of messenger RNA (mRNA) without an in-frame stop codon. In bacteria, these “nonstop” complexes can be rescued by alternative ribosome-rescue factor A (ArfA). We used electron cryomicroscopy to determine structures of ArfA bound to the ribosome with 3′-truncated mRNA, at resolutions ranging from 3.0 to 3.4 angstroms. ArfA binds within the ribosomal mRNA channel and substitutes for the absent stop codon in the A site by specifically recruiting release factor 2 (RF2), initially in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong> preaccommodated state. A similar conformation of RF2 may occur on stop codons, suggesting a general mechanism for release-factor–mediated translational termination in which a conformational switch leads to peptide release only when the appropriate signal is present in the A site.</p>

The stable Pt (110) facets of the nanoplates have high ORR specific and mass activities that reach 7.8 milliampere (mA) per centimeter squared and 4.3 ampere per milligram of platinum at 0.9 volts versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), respectively. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the edge-Pt and top (bottom)–Pt (110) facets undergo large tensile strains that help optimize the Pt-O bond strength.

Independent Regulation of Symbiotic Nodulation by the SUNN Negative and CRA2 Positive Systemic Pathways
<p>Plant systemic signaling pathways allow the integration and coordination of shoot and root organ metabolism and development at the whole-plant level depending on nutrient availability. In legumes, two systemic pathways have been reported in the <i>Medicago truncatula</i> model to regulate root nitrogen-fixing symbiotic nodulation. Both pathways involve leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases acting in shoots and proposed to perceive signaling peptides produced in roots depending on soil nutrient availability. In this study, we characterized in the <i>M. truncatula</i> Jemalong A17 genotype a mutant allelic series affecting the Compact Root Architecture2 (CRA2) receptor. These analyses revealed that this pathway acts systemically from shoots to positively regulate nodulation and is required for the activity of carboxyl-terminally encoded peptides (CEPs). In addition, we generated a double mutant to test genetic interactions of the CRA2 systemic pathway with the CLAVATA3/EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION peptide (CLE)/Super Numeric Nodule (SUNN) receptor systemic pathway negatively regulating nodule number from shoots, which revealed an intermediate nodule number phenotype close to the wild type. Finally, we showed that the nitrate inhibition of nodule numbers was observed in <i>cra2</i> mutants but not in <i>sunn</i> and <i>cra2 sunn</i> mutants. Overall, these results suggest that CEP/CRA2 and CLE/SUNN systemic pathways act independently from shoots to regulate nodule numbers.</p>

Pausing of Chloroplast Ribosomes Is Induced by Multiple Features and Is Linked to the Assembly of Photosynthetic Complexes<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Many mRNAs contain pause sites that briefly interrupt the progress of translation. Specific features that induce ribosome pausing have been described; however, their individual contributions to pause-site formation, and the overall biological significance of ribosome pausing, remain largely unclear. We have taken advantage of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong> genome of chloroplasts to carry out a plastid genome-wide survey of pause sites, as a basis for studying the impact of pausing on posttranslational processes. Based on ribosomal profiling of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) chloroplast mRNAs, we demonstrate that a combination of factors—mRNA secondary structure, internal Shine-Dalgarno sequences, and positively charged amino acids in the nascent peptide chain—explains 95% of the major pause sites on plastid mRNAs, whereas codon usage has little impact. The distribution of the pause sites is nonrandom and conforms to distinct patterns in the vicinity of sequences coding for transmembrane domains, which depend on their orientation within the membrane as well as being next to sequences coding for cofactor binding sites. We found strong indications that the mechanisms causing ribosomal pausing and at least some of the ribosomes pause sites are conserved between distantly related plant species. In addition, the positions of features that cause pausing are well conserved in photoautotrophic plants, but less so in their nonphotosynthetic, parasitic relatives, implying that the synthesis and assembly of photosynthetic multiprotein complexes requires localized ribosome pausing.</p>

A uORF Represses the Transcription Factor AtHB1 in Aerial Tissues to Avoid a Deleterious Phenotype
<p>AtHB1 is an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) homeodomain-leucine zipper transcription factor that participates in hypocotyl elongation under short-day conditions. Here, we show that its ex<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong>ion is posttranscriptionally regulated by an upstream open reading frame (uORF) located in its 5′ untranslated region. This uORF encodes a highly conserved peptide (CPuORF) that is present in varied monocot and dicot species. The Arabidopsis uORF and its maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) homolog re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong>ed the translation of the main open reading frame in cis, independent of the sequence of the latter. Published ribosome footprinting results and the analysis of a frame-shifted uORF, in which the re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong>ion capability was lost, indicated that the uORF causes ribosome stalling. The regulation exerted by the CPuORF was tissue specific and did not act in the absence of light. Moreover, a photosynthetic signal is needed for the CPuORF action, since plants with uncoupled chloroplasts did not show uORF-dependent re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong>ion. Plants transformed with the native <i>AtHB1</i> promoter driving <i>AtHB1</i> ex<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong>ion did not show differential phenotypes, whereas those transformed with a construct in which the uORF was mutated exhibited serrated leaves, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong> rosettes, and, most significantly, short nondehiscent anthers and siliques containing fewer or no seeds. Thus, we propose that the uncontrolled ex<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong>ion of <i>AtHB1</i> is deleterious for the plant and, hence, finely re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong>ed by a translational mechanism.</p>

Root Tip Shape Governs Root Elongation Rate under Increased Soil Strength
<p>Increased soil strength due to soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compact</span></strong>ion or soil drying is a major limitation to root growth and crop productivity. Roots need to exert higher penetration force, resulting in increased penetration stress when elongating in soils of greater strength. This study aimed to quantify how the genotypic diversity of root tip geometry and root diameter influences root elongation under different levels of soil strength and to determine the extent to which roots adjust to increased soil strength. Fourteen wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) varieties were grown in soil columns packed to three bulk densities representing low, moderate, and high soil strength. Under moderate and high soil strength, smaller root tip radius-to-length ratio was correlated with higher genotypic root elongation rate, whereas root diameter was not related to genotypic root elongation. Based on cavity expansion theory, it was found that smaller root tip radius-to-length ratio reduced penetration stress, thus enabling higher root elongation rates in soils with greater strength. Furthermore, it was observed that roots could only partially adjust to increased soil strength. Root thickening was bounded by a maximum diameter, and root tips did not become more acute in response to increased soil strength. The obtained results demonstrated that root tip geometry is a pivotal trait governing root penetration stress and root elongation rate in soils of greater strength. Hence, root tip shape needs to be taken into account when selecting for crop varieties that may tolerate high soil strength.</p>

Mid-term outcomes of 77 modular radial head prostheses
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Radial head arthroplasty (RHA) may be used in the treatment of   non-reconstructable radial head fractures. The aim of this study   was to evaluate the mid-term clinical and radiographic results of   RHA.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 2002 and 2014, 77 RHAs were implanted in 54 men and 23   women with either acute injuries (54) or with traumatic sequelae   (23) of a fracture of the radial head. Four designs of RHA were   used, including the Guepar (Small Bone Innovations (SBi)/Stryker;   36), Evolutive (Aston Medical; 24), rHead RECON (SBi/Stryker; ten)   or rHead STANDARD (SBi/Stryker; 7) prostheses. The mean follow-up   was 74.0 months (standard deviation (<sc>sd</sc>) 38.6; 24 to 141).   The indication for further surgery, range of movement, mean Mayo   Elbow Performance (MEP) score, quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder   and Hand (quickDASH) score, osteolysis and positioning of the implant   were also assessed according to the design, and acute or delayed   use.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean MEP and quickDASH scores were 90.2 (<sc>sd</sc> 14;   45 to 100), and 14.0 points (<sc>sd</sc> 12; 1.2 to 52.5), respectively. There   were no significant differences between RHA performed in acute or   delayed fashion. There were 30 re-operations (19 with, and 11 without   removal of the implant) during the first three post-operative years.   Painful loosening was the primary indication for removal in 14 patients.   Short-stemmed prostheses (16 mm to 22 mm in length) were also associated   with an increased risk of painful loosening (odds ratio 3.54 (1.02   to 12.2), p = 0.045). Radiocapitellar instability was the primary   indication for re-operation with retention of the implant (5). The   overall survival of the RHA, free from re-operation, was 60.8% (<sc>sd</sc> 5.7%)   at ten years.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Bipolar and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong>-fit RHA gives unsatisfactory mid-term outcomes   in the treatment of acute fractures of the radial head or their   sequelae. The outcome may vary according to the design of the implant.   The rate of re-operation during the first three years is predictive   of the long-term survival in tight-fitting RHAs.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B1197–1203.</p></sec>

Local bisphosphonate reduces migration and formation of radiolucent lines adjacent to cemented acetabular components
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Post-operative migration of cemented acetabular components as   measured by radiostereometric analysis (RSA) has a strong predictive   power for late, aseptic loosening. Also, radiolucent lines predict   late loosening. Migration has been reduced by systemic bisphosphonate   treatment in randomised trials of hip and knee arthroplasty. Used   as a local treatment, a higher local dose of bisphosphonate can   be achieved without systemic exposure. We wished to see if this   principle could be applied usefully in total hip arthroplasty (THA).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>In this randomised placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial with   60 participants, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">com<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong></span></strong>ed gauze soaked in bisphosphonate solution   (ibandronate) or saline against the acetabular bone bed immediately   before cementing the acetabular component. RSA, classification of   radiolucent lines, the Harris Hip Score (HHS) and the Western Ontario McMasters   Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) were carried out at three-,   six-, 12-, and 24-month follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Migration of the cemented acetabular component relative to the   pelvis was reduced by movement almost half in the ibandronate group,   when measured as maximum total point or as movement of the femoral   head (p = 0.001 and 0.004, respectively). Radiolucent lines after   one year were classified as absent, partial or complete, and correlated with   treatment (rho 0.37; p = 0.004). Only three of 30 patients in the   ibandronate group had complete lines, compared with 13 of 28 in   the placebo group (p = 0.002). There were no significant effects   on HHS or WOMAC score.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Considering the power of RSA to predict loosening of cemented   acetabular components, and the likelihood that radiolucent lines   indicate risk of loosening, these data suggest that local treatment   with a bisphosphonate can reduce the risk of late aseptic loosening.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:317–24.</p></sec>

The challenge of Monteggia-like lesions of the elbow
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this retrospective multicentre study was to evaluate   mid-term results of the operative treatment of Monteggia-like lesions   and to determine the prognostic factors that influence the clinical   and radiological outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 46 patients (27 women and 19 men), with a mean age   of 57.7 years (18 to 84) who had sustained a Monteggia-like lesion   were followed up clinically and radiologically after surgical treatment.   The Mayo Modified Wrist Score (MMWS), Mayo Elbow Performance Score   (MEPS), Broberg and Morrey Score, and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder   and Hand (DASH) score were used for evaluation at a mean of 65 months   (27 to 111) postoperatively. All ulnar fractures were stabilized   using a proximally contoured or precontoured locking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">com<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">press</span></strong></span></strong>ion   plate. Mason type I fractures of the radial head were treated conservatively, type   II fractures were treated with reconstruction, and type III fractures   with arthroplasty. All Morrey type II and III fractures of the coronoid   process was stabilized using lag screws.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Good results were found for the MMWS, with a mean of 88.4 (40 to   100). There were 29 excellent results (63%), nine good (20%), seven   satisfactory (15%), and one poor (2%). Excellent results were obtained   for the MEPS, with a mean of 90.7 (70 to 100): 31 excellent results   (68%), 13 good (28%), and two fair (4%). Good results were also   found for the functional rating index of Broberg and Morrey, with   a mean score of 86.6 (57 to 100). There were 16 excellent results   (35%), 22 good (48%), six fair (13%), and two poor (4%). The mean DASH   score was 15.1 (0 to 55.8). Two patients had delayed wound healing;   four patients had nonunion requiring bone grafting. One patient   had asymptomatic loosening of the radial head prosthesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Monteggia-like lesions are rare. With correct identification,   classification, and understanding using CT scans followed by appropriate   surgical treatment that addresses all components of the injury,   good to excellent mid-term results can be achieved.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:212–18.</p></sec>

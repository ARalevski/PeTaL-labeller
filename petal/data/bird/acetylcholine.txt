Plasticity in the Neurotransmitter Repertoire
<p>In the earliest days of neuroscience, it was thought that a neuron made and released only a single chemical, known as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>er, to send a signal across a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e to an adjacent neuron (<i>1</i>). At the same time, it was deeply mysterious why so many signaling molecules were used in nervous systems. Subsequently, it became clear that many, if not most, neurons (including those in mammals) make and release two or more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>ers including small-molecules and neuropeptides (<i>2</i>–<i>4</i>). As the list of these potential cotransmitters and their receptors has increased, we are faced with understanding the functional relevance of this embarrassment of riches for neural circuits and behavior. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>ers and neuromodulators (substances often released with small-molecule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>ers) can elicit a variety of different actions on their neuron targets, including directly opening ion channels or acting through signal transduction pathways to alter neuronal excitability or synaptic transmission. Thus, characterizing the mixture of cotransmitters released by a neuron is important for understanding how neuronal circuits operate. The mechanisms that change the profile of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>er release provide opportunities for plastic changes in circuit function, and consequently in organism behavior. On page 449 of this issue, Dulcis <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) report changes in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>er profile of neurons that underlie photoperiod-triggered changes in animal behavior. The findings argue that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>er switching is a new mechanism for neuroplasticity (<i>6</i>) in adult nervous systems.</p>

Astrocyte-derived interleukin-33 promotes microglial synapse engulfment and neural circuit development
<p>Neuronal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e formation and remodeling are essential to central nervous system (CNS) development and are dysfunctional in neurodevelopmental diseases. Innate immune signals regulate tissue remodeling in the periphery, but how this affects CNS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es is largely unknown. Here, we show that the interleukin-1 family cytokine interleukin-33 (IL-33) is produced by developing astrocytes and is developmentally required for normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e numbers and neural circuit function in the spinal cord and thalamus. We find that IL-33 signals primarily to microglia under physiologic conditions, that it promotes microglial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e engulfment, and that it can drive microglial-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e depletion in vivo. These data reveal a cytokine-mediated mechanism required to maintain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e homeostasis during CNS development.</p>

A general catalytic β-C–H carbonylation of aliphatic amines to β-lactams
<p>Methods for the synthesis and functionalization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>es are intrinsically important to a variety of chemical applications. We present a general carbon-hydrogen bond activation process that combines readily available aliphatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>es and the feedstock gas carbon monoxide to form synthetically versatile value-added amide products. The operationally straightforward palladium-catalyzed process exploits a distinct reaction pathway, wherein a sterically hindered carboxylate ligand orchestrates an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>e attack on a palladium anhydride to transform aliphatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>es into β-lactams. The reaction is successful with a wide range of secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>es and can be used as a late-stage functionalization tactic to deliver advanced, highly functionalized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>e products of utility for pharmaceutical research and other areas.</p>

Activation of CaMKIV by soluble amyloid-β<sub>1–42</sub> impedes trafficking of axonal vesicles and impairs activity-dependent synaptogenesis
<p>The prefibrillar form of soluble amyloid-β (sAβ<sub>1–42</sub>) impairs synaptic function and is associated with the early phase of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We investigated how sAβ<sub>1–42</sub> led to presynaptic defects using a quantum dot–based, single particle–tracking method to monitor synaptic vesicle (SV) trafficking along axons. We found that sAβ<sub>1–42</sub> prevented new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e formation induced by chemical long-term potentiation (cLTP). In cultured rat hippocampal neurons, nanomolar amounts of sAβ<sub>1–42</sub> impaired Ca<sup>2+</sup> clearance from presynaptic terminals and increased the basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration. This caused an increase in the phosphorylation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV) and its substrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>in, which markedly inhibited SV trafficking along axons between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es. Neurons derived from a transgenic AD mouse model had similar defects, which were prevented by an inhibitor of CaMK kinase (CaMKK; which activates CaMKIV), by antibodies against Aβ<sub>1–42</sub>, or by expression a phosphodeficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>in mutant. The CaMKK inhibitor also abolished the defects in activity-dependent synaptogenesis caused by sAβ<sub>1–42</sub>. Our results suggest that by disrupting SV reallocation between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es, sAβ<sub>1–42</sub> prevents neurons from forming new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es or adjusting strength and activity among neighboring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es. Targeting this mechanism might prevent synaptic dysfunction in AD patients.</p>

Branch-restricted localization of phosphatase Prl-1 specifies axonal synaptogenesis domains
<p>Central nervous system (CNS) circuit development requires subcellular control of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e formation and patterning of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e abundance. We identified the <i>Drosophila</i> membrane-anchored phosphatase of regenerating liver (Prl-1) as an axon-intrinsic factor that promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e formation in a spatially restricted fashion. The loss of Prl-1 in mechanosensory neurons reduced the number of CNS pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es localized on a single axon collateral and organized as a terminal arbor. Flies lacking all Prl-1 protein had locomotor defects. The overexpression of Prl-1 induced ectopic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es. In mechanosensory neurons, Prl-1 modulates the insulin receptor (InR) signaling pathway within a single contralateral axon compartment, thereby affecting the number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es. The axon branch–specific localization and function of Prl-1 depend on untranslated regions of the <i>prl-1</i> messenger RNA (mRNA). Therefore, compartmentalized restriction of Prl-1 serves as a specificity factor for the subcellular control of axonal synaptogenesis.</p>

Catalytic intermolecular hydroaminations of unactivated olefins with secondary alkyl amines
<p>The intermolecular hydro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>ation of unactivated alkenes with simple dialkyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>es remains an unsolved problem in organic synthesis. We report a catalytic protocol for efficient additions of cyclic and acyclic secondary alkyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>es to a wide range of alkyl olefins with complete anti-Markovnikov regioselectivity. In this process, carbon-nitrogen bond formation proceeds through a key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>ium radical cation intermediate that is generated via electron transfer between an excited-state iridium photocatalyst and an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>e substrate. These reactions are redox-neutral and completely atom-economical, exhibit broad functional group tolerance, and occur readily at room temperature under visible light irradiation. Certain tertiary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>e products generated through this method are formally endergonic relative to their constituent olefin and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>e starting materials and thus are not accessible via direct coupling with conventional ground-state catalysts.</p>

Chemical synapses without synaptic vesicles: Purinergic neurotransmission through a CALHM1 channel-mitochondrial signaling complex
<p>Conventional chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es in the nervous system involve a presynaptic accumulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>er-containing vesicles, which fuse with the plasma membrane to release <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>ers that activate postsynaptic receptors. In taste buds, type II receptor cells do not have conventional synaptic features but nonetheless show regulated release of their afferent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>er, ATP, through a large-pore, voltage-gated channel, CALHM1. Immunohistochemistry revealed that CALHM1 was localized to points of contact between the receptor cells and sensory nerve fibers. Ultrastructural and super-resolution light microscopy showed that the CALHM1 channels were consistently associated with distinctive, large (1- to 2-μm) mitochondria spaced 20 to 40 nm from the presynaptic membrane. Pharmacological disruption of the mitochondrial respiratory chain limited the ability of taste cells to release ATP, suggesting that the immediate source of released ATP was the mitochondrion rather than a cytoplasmic pool of ATP. These large mitochondria may serve as both a reservoir of releasable ATP and the site of synthesis. The juxtaposition of the large mitochondria to areas of membrane displaying CALHM1 also defines a restricted compartment that limits the influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> upon opening of the nonselective CALHM1 channels. These findings reveal a distinctive organelle signature and functional organization for regulated, focal release of purinergic signals in the absence of synaptic vesicles.</p>

Neuronal activity drives FMRP- and HSPG-dependent matrix metalloproteinase function required for rapid synaptogenesis
<p>Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) functions modulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e formation and activity-dependent plasticity. Aberrant MMP activity is implicated in fragile X syndrome (FXS), a disease caused by the loss of the RNA-binding protein FMRP and characterized by neurological dysfunction and intellectual disability. Gene expression studies in <i>Drosophila</i> suggest that Mmps cooperate with the heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) glypican co-receptor Dally-like protein (Dlp) to restrict trans-synaptic Wnt signaling and that synaptogenic defects in the fly model of FXS are alleviated by either inhibition of Mmp or genetic reduction of Dlp. We used the <i>Drosophila</i> neuromuscular junction (NMJ) glutamatergic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e to test activity-dependent Dlp and Mmp intersections in the context of FXS. We found that rapid, activity-dependent synaptic bouton formation depended on secreted Mmp1. Acute neuronal stimulation reduced the abundance of Mmp2 but increased that of both Mmp1 and Dlp, as well as enhanced the colocalization of Dlp and Mmp1 at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e. Dlp function promoted Mmp1 abundance, localization, and proteolytic activity around <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es. Dlp glycos<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>oglycan (GAG) chains mediated this functional interaction with Mmp1. In the FXS fly model, activity-dependent increases in Mmp1 abundance and activity were lost but were restored by reducing the amount of synaptic Dlp. The data suggest that neuronal activity-induced, HSPG-dependent Mmp regulation drives activity-dependent synaptogenesis and that this is impaired in FXS. Thus, exploring this mechanism further may reveal therapeutic targets that have the potential to restore synaptogenesis in FXS patients.</p>

A gut-brain neural circuit for nutrient sensory transduction
<p>The brain is thought to sense gut stimuli only via the passive release of hormones.

Homer1a drives homeostatic scaling-down of excitatory synapses during sleep
<p>Sleep is an essential process that supports learning and memory by acting on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es through poorly understood molecular mechanisms. Using biochemistry, proteomics, and imaging in mice, we find that during sleep, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es undergo widespread alterations in composition and signaling, including weakening of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es through removal and dephosphorylation of synaptic AMPA-type glutamate receptors. These changes are driven by the immediate early gene Homer1a and signaling from group I metabotropic glutamate receptors mGluR1/5. Homer1a serves as a molecular integrator of arousal and sleep need via the wake- and sleep-promoting neuromodulators, noradrenaline and adenosine, respectively. Our data suggest that homeostatic scaling-down, a global form of synaptic plasticity, is active during sleep to remodel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es and participates in the consolidation of contextual memory.</p>

Ultrastructural evidence for synaptic scaling across the wake/sleep cycle
<p>It is assumed that synaptic strengthening and weakening balance throughout learning to avoid runaway potentiation and memory interference. However, energetic and informational considerations suggest that potentiation should occur primarily during wake, when animals learn, and depression should occur during sleep. We measured 6920 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es in mouse motor and sensory cortices using three-dimensional electron microscopy. The axon-spine interface (ASI) decreased ~18% after sleep compared with wake. This decrease was proportional to ASI size, which is indicative of scaling. Scaling was selective, sparing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es that were large and lacked recycling endosomes. Similar scaling occurred for spine head volume, suggesting a distinction between weaker, more plastic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es (~80%) and stronger, more stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es. These results support the hypothesis that a core function of sleep is to renormalize overall synaptic strength increased by wake.</p>

The tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 promotes T cell adhesion by activating the adaptor protein CrkII in the immunological synapse
<p>The adaptor protein CrkII regulates T cell adhesion by recruiting the guanine nucleotide exchange factor C3G, an activator of Rap1. Subsequently, Rap1 stimulates the integrin LFA-1, which leads to T cell adhesion and interaction with antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The adhesion of T cells to APCs is critical for their proper function and education. The interface between the T cell and the APC is known as the immunological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e. It is characterized by the specific organization of proteins that can be divided into central supramolecular activation clusters (c-SMACs) and peripheral SMACs (p-SMACs). Through total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy and experiments with supported lipid bilayers, we determined that activated Rap1 was recruited to the immunological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e and localized to the p-SMAC. C3G and the active (dephosphorylated) form of CrkII also localized to the same compartment. In contrast, inactive (phosphorylated) CrkII was confined to the c-SMAC. Activation of CrkII and its subsequent movement from the c-SMAC to the p-SMAC depended on the phosphatase SHP-1, which acted downstream of the T cell receptor. In the p-SMAC, CrkII recruited C3G, which led to Rap1 activation and LFA-1–mediated adhesion of T cells to APCs. Functionally, SHP-1 was necessary for both the adhesion and migration of T cells. Together, these data highlight a signaling pathway in which SHP-1 acts through CrkII to reshape the pattern of Rap1 activation in the immunological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e.</p>

A gut feeling
<p>The anatomist Friedrich S. Merkel predicted in 1880 that sensory systems are composed of epithelial cells and sensory nerves, which together transform environmental cues into neural signals that trigger our rich sensory experiences (<i>1</i>). We now know that this hypothesis mostly holds true for the canonical senses of vision, hearing, taste, and touch. Perhaps surprisingly, the peripheral outposts of these classical sensory systems (eyes, ears, tongue, and skin) are dwarfed by the human body's largest sensory organ—the gut. Enteroendocrine cells, which are rare epithelial cells that decorate the gut lining, have long been suspected to be sensory receptor cells that inform the brain about ingested nutrients (<i>2</i>). Since their description, these cells were assumed to play a role in metabolism and gut physiology by releasing slow-acting peptide hormones that stimulate neurons throughout the gut and in the brain. On page 1219 of this issue, Kaelberer <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) challenge this view by demonstrating that gut enteroendocrine cells locally excite sensory nerves through release of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>er glutamate. A recent study of enterochromaffin cells, a subset of enteroendocrine cells, also found that gut signals are transmitted at epithelial-neural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es through release of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>er serotonin (<i>4</i>). Together, these findings overturn a decades-old dogma that enteroendocrine cells signal exclusively through hormones.</p>

A liquid phase of synapsin and lipid vesicles
<p>Neurotransmitter-containing synaptic vesicles (SVs) form tight clusters at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es.

Several components associated with SVs that are likely to help form such clusters have been reported, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>in. Here we found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>in can form a distinct liquid phase in an aqueous environment. Other scaffolding proteins could coassemble into this condensate but were not necessary for its formation. Importantly, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>in phase could capture small lipid vesicles. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>in phase rapidly disassembled upon phosphorylation by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, mimicking the dispersion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>in 1 that occurs at presynaptic sites upon stimulation.

Locally coordinated synaptic plasticity of visual cortex neurons in vivo

This is accompanied by a decrease in the strength of adjacent spines on a slower time scale. The locally coordinated potentiation and depression of spines involves prominent AMPA receptor redistribution via targeted expression of the immediate early gene product Arc. Hebbian strengthening of activated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es and heterosynaptic weakening of adjacent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es thus cooperatively orchestrate cell-wide plasticity of functional neuronal responses.</p>

Neurohormonal changes associated with ritualized combat and the formation of a reproductive hierarchy in the ant <i>Harpegnathos saltator</i>
<p>Dominance rank in animal societies is correlated with changes in both reproductive physiology and behavior. In some social insects, dominance status is used to determine a reproductive division of labor, where a few colony members reproduce while most remain functionally sterile. Changes in reproduction and behavior in this context must be coordinated through crosstalk between the brain and the reproductive system. We investigated a role for biogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>es in forming this connection in the ant <i>Harpegnathos saltator</i>. In this species, workers engage in an elaborate dominance tournament to establish a group of reproductive workers termed gamergates. We analyzed biogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>e content in the brains of gamergates, inside-workers and foragers under stable colony conditions and found that gamergates had the highest levels of dop<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>e. Dop<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>e levels were also positively correlated with increased ovarian activity among gamergates. Next, we experimentally induced workers to compete in a reproductive tournament to determine how dop<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>e may be involved in the establishment of a new hierarchy. Dop<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>e levels rose in aggressive workers at the start of a tournament, while workers that were policed by their nestmates (a behavior that inhibits ovarian activity) showed a rapid decline in dop<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>e. In addition to dop<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>e, levels of serotonin and tyr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>e differed among castes, and these changes could contribute to differences in caste-specific behavioral patterns observed among non-reproductive workers. Overall, these results provide support that biogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>es link changes in behavior and dominance with reproductive activity in <i>H. saltator</i> as well as drive differences in worker task performance.</p>

TCR-stimulated changes in cell surface CD46 expression generate type 1 regulatory T cells
<p>A lack of regulatory T cell function is a critical factor in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Ligation of the complement regulatory protein CD46 facilitates the differentiation of T helper 1 (T<sub>H</sub>1) effector cells into interleukin-10 (IL-10)–secreting type 1 regulatory T cells (Tr1 cells), and this pathway is defective in MS patients. Cleavage of the ectodomain of CD46, which contains three N-glycosylation sites and multiple O-glycosylation sites, enables CD46 to activate T cells. We found that stimulation of the T cell receptor (TCR)–CD3 complex was associated with a reduction in the apparent molecular mass of CD46 in a manner that depended on O-glycosylation. CD3-stimulated changes in CD46 O-glycosylation status reduced CD46 processing and subsequent T cell signaling. During T cell activation, CD46 was recruited to the immune <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e in a manner that required its serine-, threonine-, and proline-rich (STP) region, which is rich in O-glycosylation sites. Recruitment of CD46 to the immune <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e switched T cells from producing the inflammatory cytokine interferon-γ (IFN-γ) to producing IL-10. Furthermore, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells isolated from MS patients did not exhibit a CD3-stimulated reduction in the mass of CD46 and thus showed increased amounts of cell surface CD46. Together, these data suggest a possible mechanism underlying the regulatory function of CD46 on T cells. Our findings may explain why this pathway is defective in patients with MS and provide insights into MS pathogenesis that could help to design future immunotherapies.</p>

Cytoskeletal adaptivity regulates T cell receptor signaling
<p>The factors that govern T cell activation control the initiation and progression of adaptive immune responses. T cells recognize their cognate antigen on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) through the T cell receptor, which results in the formation of a contact region (immune <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e) between the two cells and the activation of the T cells. Activated T cells proliferate and differentiate into effector T cells that secrete cytokines, provide help to B cells, and kill target cells. We asked whether the actin cytoskeleton governs differences in signaling in effector T cells versus naive (unstimulated) T cells. Using atomic force microscopy and quantitative confocal microscopy, we found that naive T cells had a mechanically stiffer cortical cytoskeleton than that of effector cells, which resulted in naive cells forming smaller immune <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es with APCs. This suggests that the cytoskeletal stiffness of the T cell before it undergoes antigen stimulation predicts its subsequent dynamic engagement with APCs and its activation potential. Cytoskeletal rigidity depended on the activity of the actin-severing enzyme cofilin through a pathway requiring the small guanosine triphosphatase RhoA and the kinases ROCK (Rho-activated kinase) and LIMK. These findings suggest that the baseline cytoskeletal state controls T cell responses and that the underlying pathway could be a therapeutic target for modulating adaptive immunity.</p>

Architects of neuronal wiring
<p>Nervous system function relies on precise connectivity of a multitude of distinct neuronal cell types. Each class of neuron exhibits a characteristic morphology where synaptic connections are patterned across the cell surface. Thus, individual types of neurons establish <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es on specific domains of target neurons, such as the cell body (soma) or a distal branch (dendrite). Moreover, functionally related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es are often clustered on a dendrite or on one branch of an axon. This compartmentalized organization of synaptic connections affects the integration of synaptic inputs and increases the computational power of neural circuits (<i>1</i>). Studies by Urwyler <i>et al.</i> on page 454 of this issue (<i>2</i>) and by Favuzzi <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) report in a fruit fly and mouse model, respectively, mechanisms of how spatial distribution of synaptic connections is achieved.</p>

Architecture and subunit arrangement of native AMPA receptors elucidated by cryo-EM
<p>Glutamate-gated AMPA receptors mediate the fast component of excitatory signal transduction at chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es throughout all regions of the mammalian brain. AMPA receptors are tetrameric assemblies composed of four subunits, GluA1–GluA4. Despite decades of study, the subunit composition, subunit arrangement, and molecular structure of native AMPA receptors remain unknown. Here we elucidate the structures of 10 distinct native AMPA receptor complexes by single-particle cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM). We find that receptor subunits are arranged nonstochastically, with the GluA2 subunit preferentially occupying the B and D positions of the tetramer and with triheteromeric assemblies comprising a major population of native AMPA receptors. Cryo-EM maps define the structure for S2-M4 linkers between the ligand-binding and transmembrane domains, suggesting how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>er binding is coupled to ion channel gating.</p>

Delayed catalyst function enables direct enantioselective conversion of nitriles to NH<sub>2</sub>-amines
<p>Accessing enantiomerically enriched <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>es often demands oxidation-state adjustments, protection and deprotection processes, and purification procedures that increase cost and waste, limiting applicability. When diastereomers can be formed, one isomer is attainable. Here, we show that nitriles, largely viewed as insufficiently reactive, can be transformed directly to multifunctional unprotected homoallylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>es by enantioselective addition of a carbon-based nucleophile and diastereodivergent reduction of the resulting ketimine. Successful implementation requires that competing copper-based catalysts be present simultaneously and that the slower-forming and less reactive one engages first. This challenge was addressed by incorporation of a nonproductive side cycle, fueled selectively by inexpensive additives, to delay the function of the more active catalyst. The utility of this approach is highlighted by its application to the efficient preparation of the anticancer agent (+)-tangutorine.</p>

Glutamate signaling at cytoneme synapses
<p>We investigated the roles of components of neuronal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es for development of the <i>Drosophila</i> air sac primordium (ASP). The ASP, an epithelial tube, extends specialized signaling filopodia called cytonemes that take up signals such as Dpp (Decapentaplegic, a homolog of the vertebrate bone morphogenetic protein) from the wing imaginal disc. Dpp signaling in the ASP was compromised if disc cells lacked Synaptobrevin and Synaptotagmin-1 (which function in vesicle transport at neuronal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es), the glutamate transporter, and a voltage-gated calcium channel, or if ASP cells lacked Synaptotagmin-4 or the glutamate receptor GluRII. Transient elevations of intracellular calcium in ASP cytonemes correlate with signaling activity. Calcium transients in ASP cells depend on GluRII, are activated by <sc>l</sc>-glutamate and by stimulation of an optogenetic ion channel expressed in the wing disc, and are inhibited by EGTA and by the GluR inhibitor NASPM (1-naphthylacetyl spermine trihydrochloride). Activation of GluRII is essential but not sufficient for signaling. Cytoneme-mediated signaling is glutamatergic.</p>

Phase changes in neurotransmission

Carbonyl catalysis enables a biomimetic asymmetric Mannich reaction
<p>Chiral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>es are widely used as catalysts in asymmetric synthesis to activate carbonyl groups for α-functionalization. Carbonyl catalysis reverses that strategy by using a carbonyl group to activate a primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>e. Inspired by biological carbonyl catalysis, which is exemplified by reactions of pyridoxal-dependent enzymes, we developed an N-quaternized pyridoxal catalyst for the asymmetric Mannich reaction of glycinate with aryl <i>N</i>-diphenylphosphinyl imines. The catalyst exhibits high activity and stereoselectivity, likely enabled by enzyme-like cooperative bifunctional activation of the substrates. Our work demonstrates the catalytic utility of the pyridoxal moiety in asymmetric catalysis.</p>

Synapse-specific representation of the identity of overlapping memory engrams
<p>Memories are integrated into interconnected networks; nevertheless, each memory has its own identity. How the brain defines specific memory identity out of intermingled memories stored in a shared cell ensemble has remained elusive. We found that after complete retrograde amnesia of auditory fear conditioning in mice, optogenetic stimulation of the auditory inputs to the lateral amygdala failed to induce memory recall, implying that the memory engram no longer existed in that circuit. Complete amnesia of a given fear memory did not affect another linked fear memory encoded in the shared ensemble. Optogenetic potentiation or depotentiation of the plasticity at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es specific to one memory affected the recall of only that memory. Thus, the sharing of engram cells underlies the linkage between memories, whereas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e-specific plasticity guarantees the identity and storage of individual memories.</p>

Crystallizing a memory
<p>What is the physical basis of memory? What does it take to retrieve a memory in the brain? What would it take to activate or erase memories? In the early 20th century, the German zoologist Richard Semon coined the term “engram” to denote the physical manifestation of a memory in the brain (<i>1</i>). Two decades later, Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb posited a physiological correlate for learning and recollection: The process of learning strengthens the connections, or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es, between neurons, which leads to the development of brain-wide cell assemblies that undergo changes in their structural and functional connectivity (<i>2</i>). The coordinated activity of these assemblies—called ensembles, traces, or engrams—that occurs during learning (memory formation) is thought to be reengaged during recall and thereby forms a stable neuronal correlate of memory (<i>2</i>). As subsequent memories are formed, the dynamics of these assemblies evolve and provide preexisting scaffolds to influence how the brain processes the variety of memories an organism forms. Studies by Abdou <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) on page 1227 of this issue and by Choi <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) develop new technologies to visualize discrete engrams in the brain and modulate them in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e-specific manner to understand memory strength and memory restoration from an amnestic state. This improved understanding could eventually be translated to modulate memories to alleviate maladaptive memory states.</p>

Synaptic transmission from subplate neurons controls radial migration of neocortical neurons
<p>The neocortex exhibits a six-layered structure that is formed by radial migration of excitatory neurons, for which the multipolar-to-bipolar transition of immature migrating multipolar neurons is required. Here, we report that subplate neurons, one of the first neuron types born in the neocortex, manage the multipolar-to-bipolar transition of migrating neurons. By histochemical, imaging, and microarray analyses on the mouse embryonic cortex, we found that subplate neurons extend neurites toward the ventricular side of the subplate and form transient glutamatergic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es on the multipolar neurons just below the subplate. NMDAR (<i>N</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate receptor)–mediated synaptic transmission from subplate neurons to multipolar neurons induces the multipolar-to-bipolar transition, leading to a change in migration mode from slow multipolar migration to faster radial glial-guided locomotion. Our data suggested that transient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es formed on early immature neurons regulate radial migration.</p>

Gliogenic LTP spreads widely in nociceptive pathways
<p>Learning and memory formation involve long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic strength.

This restricts LTP expression to activated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es only (homosynaptic LTP) and leads to its input specificity. In the spinal cord, we discovered a fundamentally different form of LTP that is induced by glial cell activation and mediated by diffusible, extracellular messengers, including <sc>d</sc>-serine and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and that travel long distances via the cerebrospinal fluid, thereby affecting susceptible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es at remote sites.

Selective functionalization of methane, ethane, and higher alkanes by cerium photocatalysis

High catalytic efficiency (turnover numbers up to 2900 for methane and 9700 for ethane) and selectivity were achieved using abundant, inexpensive cerium salts as photocatalysts. Ligand-to-metal charge transfer excitation generated alkoxy radicals from simple alcohols that in turn acted as hydrogen atom transfer catalysts. The mixed-phase gas/liquid reaction was adapted to continuous flow, enabling the efficient use of gaseous feedstocks in scalable photocatalytic transformations.</p>

Pulmonary neuroendocrine cells amplify allergic asthma responses
<p>Pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs) are rare airway epithelial cells whose function is poorly understood. Here we show that <i>Ascl1</i>-mutant mice that have no PNECs exhibit severely blunted mucosal type 2 response in models of allergic asthma. PNECs reside in close proximity to group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) near airway branch points. PNECs act through calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) to stimulate ILC2s and elicit downstream immune responses. In addition, PNECs act through the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurotransmitt</span></strong>er γ-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>obutyric acid (GABA) to induce goblet cell hyperplasia. The instillation of a mixture of CGRP and GABA in <i>Ascl1</i>-mutant airways restores both immune and goblet cell responses. In accordance, lungs from human asthmatics show increased PNECs. These findings demonstrate that the PNEC-ILC2 neuroimmunological modules function at airway branch points to amplify allergic asthma responses.</p>

Biomimetic hierarchical structures can detect movement of an object, combine simultaneous pressure inputs, and distinguish braille characters. Furthermore, we connected our artificial afferent nerve to motor nerves to construct a hybrid bioelectronic reflex arc to actuate muscles.

Interregional synaptic maps among engram cells underlie memory formation

We found an increased number and size of spines on CA1 engram cells receiving input from CA3 engram cells. In contextual fear conditioning, this enhanced connectivity between engram cells encoded memory strength. CA3 engram to CA1 engram projections strongly occluded long-term potentiation. These results indicate that enhanced structural and functional connectivity between engram cells across two directly connected brain regions forms the synaptic correlate for memory formation.</p>

Metabolic recycling of ammonia via glutamate dehydrogenase supports breast cancer biomass

In our experiments, human breast cancer cells primarily assimilated ammonia through reductive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>ation catalyzed by glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH); secondary reactions enabled other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>o acids, such as proline and aspartate, to directly acquire this nitrogen. Metabolic recycling of ammonia accelerated proliferation of breast cancer.

These data show that ammonia is not only a secreted waste product but also a fundamental nitrogen source that can support tumor biomass.</p>

Activity-dependent spatially localized miRNA maturation in neuronal dendrites
<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression by binding to target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and preventing their translation. In general, the number of potential mRNA targets in a cell is much greater than the miRNA copy number, complicating high-fidelity miRNA-target interactions. We developed an inducible fluorescent probe to explore whether the maturation of a miRNA could be regulated in space and time in neurons. A precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) probe exhibited an activity-dependent increase in fluorescence, suggesting the stimulation of miRNA maturation. Single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e stimulation resulted in a local maturation of miRNA that was associated with a spatially restricted reduction in the protein synthesis of a target mRNA. Thus, the spatially and temporally regulated maturation of pre-miRNAs can be used to increase the precision and robustness of miRNA-mediated translational repression.</p>

Energy pulses reveal possible new state of memory
<p>Memory researchers have shone light into a cognitive limbo. A new memory—the name of someone you've just met, for example—is held for seconds in so-called working memory, as your brain's neurons continue to fire. If the person is important to you, the name will over a few days enter your long-term memory, preserved by permanently altered neural connections. But where does it go during the in-between hours, when it has left your standard working memory and is not yet embedded in long-term memory? To figure this out, a research team resurrects memories from this limbo. Their observations point to a new form of working memory, which they dub prioritized long-term memory, that exists without elevated neural activity. Consistent with other recent work, the study suggests that information can somehow be held among the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es that connect neurons, even after conventional working memory has faded. This new memory state could have a range of practical implications, from helping college students learn more efficiently to assisting people with memory-related neurological conditions such as amnesia, epilepsy, and schizophrenia.</p>

How the body learns to hurt
<p>After 50 years, the neuroscience of pain has a new player. In 1966, researchers traced how the brain learns from repeated stimulation. They found that triggering neurons in one part of the hippocampus—a sliver of brain tissue key to memory—can make linked, distant neurons more likely to fire for many hours afterward, a phenomenon now known as long-term potentiation (LTP). LTP leaves its mark by strengthening some connections between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es–the connections between brain cells—and not others. Now, researchers have found a new type of LTP that may explain how pain itself "teaches" the brain. The pain-related LTP is driven not by neuronal activity, but by glia—nonneuronal cells that protect neurons from injury, among other duties.</p>

Glutathione Transferase U13 Functions in Pathogen-Triggered Glucosinolate Metabolism<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Glutathione (GSH) and indole glucosinolates (IGs) exert key functions in the immune system of the model plant Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Appropriate GSH levels are important for execution of both pre- and postinvasive disease resistance mechanisms to invasive pathogens, whereas an intact PENETRATION2 (PEN2)-pathway for IG metabolism is essential for preinvasive resistance in this species. Earlier indirect evidence suggested that the latter pathway involves conjugation of GSH with unstable products of IG metabolism and further processing of the resulting adducts to biologically active molecules. Here we describe the identification of Glutathione-<i>S</i>-Transferase class-tau member 13 (GSTU13) as an indispensable component of the PEN2 immune pathway for IG metabolism. <i>gstu13</i> mutant plants are defective in the pathogen-triggered biosynthesis of end products of the PEN2 pathway, including 4-O-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosyl-indol-3-yl formamide, indole-3-ylmethyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>e, and raphanusamic acid. In line with this metabolic defect, lack of functional GSTU13 results in enhanced disease susceptibility toward several fungal pathogens including <i>Erysiphe pisi</i>, <i>Colletotrichum gloeosporioides</i>, and <i>Plectosphaerella cucumerina</i>. Seedlings of <i>gstu13</i> plants fail also to deposit the (1,3)-β-glucan cell wall polymer, callose, after recognition of the bacterial flg22 epitope. We show that GSTU13 mediates specifically the role of GSH in IG metabolism without noticeable impact on other immune functions of this tripeptide. We postulate that GSTU13 connects GSH with the pathogen-triggered PEN2 pathway for IG metabolism to deliver metabolites that may have numerous functions in the innate immune system of Arabidopsis.</p>

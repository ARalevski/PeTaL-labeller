Microtubule Array Patterns Have a Common Underlying Architecture in Hypocotyl Cells
<p>Microtubules at the plant cell cortex influence cell shape by patterning the deposition of cell wall materials. The elongated cells of the hypocotyl create a variety of microtubule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong> patterns with differing degrees of polymer coalignment and orientation to the cell’s growth axis. To gain insight into the mechanisms driving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong> organization, we investigated the underlying microtubule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong> architecture in light-grown epidermal cells with explicit reference to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong> pattern. We discovered that all nontransverse patterns share a common underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong> architecture, having a core unimodal peak of coaligned microtubules in a split bipolarized arrangement. The growing microtubule plus ends extend toward the cell’s apex and base with a region of antiparallel microtubule overlap at the cell’s midzone. This core coalignment continuously shifts between ±30° from the cell’s longitudinal growth axis, forming a continuum of longitudinal and oblique <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong>s. Transverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong>s exhibit the same unimodal core coalignment but form local domains of microtubules polymerizing in the same direction rather than a split bipolarized architecture. Quantitative imaging experiments and analysis of <i>katanin</i> mutants showed that the longitudinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong>s are created from microtubules originating on the outer periclinal cell face, pointing to a cell-directed, rather than self-organizing, mechanism for specifying the major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong> pattern classes in the hypocotyl cell.</p>

CLASP Facilitates Transitions between Cortical Microtubule Array Patterns
<p>Acentrosomal plant microtubule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong>s form patterns at the cell cortex that influence cellular morphogenesis by templating the deposition of cell wall materials, but the molecular basis by which the microtubules form the cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong> patterns remains largely unknown. Loss of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) microtubule-associated protein, CYTOPLASMIC LINKER ASSOCIATED PROTEIN (AtCLASP), results in cellular growth anisotropy defects in hypocotyl cells. We examined the microtubule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong> patterning in <i>atclasp-1</i> null mutants and discovered a significant defect in the timing of transitions between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong> patterns but no substantive defect in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong> patterns per se. Detailed analysis and computational modeling of the microtubule dynamics in two <i>atclasp-1</i> fluorescent tubulin marker lines revealed marker-dependent effects on depolymerization and catastrophe frequency predicted to alter the steady-state microtubule population. Quantitative in vivo analysis of the underlying microtubule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong> architecture showed that AtCLASP is required to maintain the number of growing microtubule plus ends during transitions between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong> patterns. We propose that AtCLASP plays a critical role in cellular morphogenesis through actions on new microtubules that facilitate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong> transitions.</p>

A Cycloheximide-Sensitive Step in Transverse Microtubule Array Patterning
<p>The growth properties of individual cells within a tissue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>e plant morphology, and the organization of the cytoskeleton, particularly the microtubule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong>s, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>es cellular growth properties. We investigated the mechanisms governing the formation of transverse microtubule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong> patterns in axially growing Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) epidermal hypocotyl cells. Using quantitative imaging approaches, we mapped the transition of the cortical microtubule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong>s into a transverse coaligned pattern after induction with auxin and gibberellic acid. Hormone induction led to an early loss of microtubule plus end density and a rotation toward oblique patterns. Beginning 30 min after induction, transverse microtubules appeared at the cell’s midzone concurrently with the loss of longitudinal polymers, eventually progressing apically and basally to remodel the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong> pattern. Based on the timing and known hormone-signaling pathways, we tested the hypothesis that the later events require de novo gene expression and, thus, constitute a level of genetic control over transverse patterning. We found that the presence of the translation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) resulted in a selective and reversible loss of transverse patterns that were replaced with radial-like pinwheel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong>s exhibiting a split bipolar architecture centered at the cell’s midzone. Experiments using hormone induction and CHX revealed that pinwheel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong>s occur when transverse microtubules increase at the midzone but longitudinal microtubules in the split bipolar architecture are not suppressed. We propose that a key regulatory mechanism for creating the transverse microtubule coalignment in axially growing hypocotyls involves the expression of a CHX-sensitive factor that acts to suppress the nucleation of the longitudinally oriented polymers.</p>

Reconfiguration of DNA molecular arrays driven by information relay
<p>Information relay at the molecular level is an essential phenomenon in numerous chemical and biological processes, such as intricate signaling cascades. One key challenge in synthetic molecular self-assembly is to construct artificial structures that imitate these complex behaviors in controllable systems. We demonstrated prescribed, long-range information relay in an artificial molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong> assembled from modular DNA structural units. The dynamic DNA molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong> exhibits transformations with programmable initiation, propagation, and regulation. The transformation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong> can be initiated at selected units and then propagated, without addition of extra triggers, to neighboring units and eventually the entire <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong>. The specific information pathways by which this transformation occurs can be controlled by altering the design of individual units and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong>s.</p>

Male sex in houseflies is determined by <i>Mdmd</i>, a paralog of the generic splice factor gene <i>CWC22</i>
<p>Across species, animals have diverse sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>ation pathways, each consisting of a hierarchical cascade of genes and its associated regulatory mechanism. Houseflies have a distinctive polymorphic sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>ation system in which a dominant male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>er, the M-factor, can reside on any of the chromosomes. We identified a gene, <i>Musca domestica</i> <i>male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>er</i> (<i>Mdmd</i>), as the M-factor. <i>Mdmd</i> originated from a duplication of the spliceosomal factor gene <i>CWC22</i> (<i>nucampholin</i>). Targeted <i>Mdmd</i> disruption results in complete sex reversal to fertile females because of a shift from male to female expression of the downstream genes <i>transformer</i> and <i>doublesex</i>. The presence of <i>Mdmd</i> on different chromosomes indicates that <i>Mdmd</i> translocated to different genomic sites. Thus, an instructive signal in sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>ation can arise by duplication and neofunctionalization of an essential splicing regulator.</p>

An atom-by-atom assembler of defect-free arbitrary two-dimensional atomic arrays
<p>Large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong>s of individually controlled atoms trapped in optical tweezers are a very promising platform for quantum engineering applications. However, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>istic loading of the traps is experimentally challenging. We demonstrate the preparation of fully loaded two-dimensional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong>s of up to ~50 microtraps, each containing a single atom and arranged in arbitrary geometries. Starting from initially larger, half-filled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">matric</span></strong>es of randomly loaded traps, we obtain user-defined target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong>s at unit filling. This is achieved with a real-time control system and a moving optical tweezers, which together enable a sequence of rapid atom moves depending on the initial distribution of the atoms in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong>s. These results open exciting prospects for quantum engineering with neutral atoms in tunable two-dimensional geometries.</p>

Rice Morphology Determinant-Mediated Actin Filament Organization Contributes to Pollen Tube Growth
<p>For successful fertilization in angiosperms, rapid tip growth in pollen tubes delivers the male gamete into the ovules. The actin-binding protein-mediated organization of the actin cytoskeleton within the pollen tube plays a crucial role in this polarized process. However, the mechanism underlying the polarity of the actin filament (F-actin) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong> and behaviors in pollen tube growth remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that an actin-organizing protein, Rice Morphology Determinant (RMD), a type II formin from rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), controls pollen tube growth by modulating the polarity and distribution of the F-actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong>. The rice <i>rmd</i> mutant exhibits abnormal pollen tube growth and a decreased germination rate of the pollen grain in vitro and in vivo. The <i>rmd</i> pollen tubes display a disorganized F-actin pattern with disrupted apical actin density and shank longitudinal cable direction/arrangement, indicating the novel role of RMD in F-actin polarity during tip growth. Consistent with this role, RMD localizes at the tip of the rice pollen tube, which is essential for pollen tube growth and polarity as well as F-actin organization. Furthermore, the direction and characteristics of the RMD-guided F-actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong> positively regulate the deposition of cell wall components and the pattern and velocity of cytoplasmic streaming during rice pollen tube growth. Collectively, our results suggest that RMD is essential for the spatial regulation of pollen tube growth via modulating F-actin organization and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong> orientation in rice. This work provides insights into tip-focused cell growth and polarity.</p>

Cell-Fate Specification in Arabidopsis Roots Requires Coordinative Action of Lineage Instruction and Positional Reprogramming
<p>Tissue organization and pattern formation within a multicellular organism rely on coordinated cell division and cell-fate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>ation. In animals, cell fates are mainly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>ed by a cell lineage-dependent mechanism, whereas in plants, positional information is thought to be the primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>ant of cell fates. However, our understanding of cell-fate regulation in plants mostly relies on the histological and anatomical studies on Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) roots, which contain a single layer of each cell type in nonvascular tissues. Here, we investigate the dynamic cell-fate acquisition in modified Arabidopsis roots with additional cell layers that are artificially generated by the misexpression of <i>SHORT-ROOT</i> (<i>SHR</i>). We found that cell-fate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>ation in Arabidopsis roots is a dimorphic cascade with lineage inheritance dominant in the early stage of pattern formation. The inherited cell identity can subsequently be removed or modified by positional information. The instruction of cell-fate conversion is not a fast readout during root development. The final identity of a cell type is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>ed by the synergistic contribution from multiple layers of regulation, including symplastic communication across tissues. Our findings underline the collaborative inputs during cell-fate instruction.</p>

Effect of Losartan on Right Ventricular Dysfunction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The effect of angiotensin II receptor blockers on right ventricular (RV) function is still unknown.

The joint influence of photoperiod and temperature during growth cessation and development of dormancy in white spruce (<i>Picea glauca</i>)
<p>Timely responses to environmental cues enable the synchronization of phenological life-history transitions essential for the health and survival of north-temperate and boreal tree species. While photoperiodic cues will remain persistent under climate change, temperature cues may vary, contributing to possible asynchrony in signals influencing developmental and physiological transitions essential to forest health. Understanding the relative contribution of photoperiod and temperature as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>ants of the transition from active growth to dormancy is important for informing adaptive forest management decisions that consider future climates. Using a combination of photoperiod (long = 20 h or short = 8 h day lengths) and temperature (warm = 22 °C/16 °C and cool = 8 °C/4 °C day/night, respectively) treatments, we used microscopy, physiology and modeling to comprehensively examine hallmark traits of the growth–dormancy transition—including bud formation, growth cessation, cold hardiness and gas exchange—within two provenances of white spruce [<i>Picea glauca</i> (Moench) Voss] spanning a broad latitude in Alberta, Canada. Following exposure to experimental treatments, seedlings were transferred to favorable conditions, and the depth of dormancy was assessed by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>ing the timing and ability of spruce seedlings to resume growth. Short photoperiods promoted bud development and growth cessation, whereas longer photoperiods extended the growing season through the induction of lammas growth. In contrast, cool temperatures under both photoperiodic conditions delayed bud development. Photoperiod strongly predicted the development of cold hardiness, whereas temperature predicted photosynthetic rates associated with active growth. White spruce was capable of attaining endodormancy, but its release was environmentally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>ed. Dormancy depth varied substantially across experimental treatments suggesting that environmental cues experienced within one season could affect growth in the following season, which is particularly important for a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>ate species such as white spruce. The joint influence of these environmental cues points toward the importance of including local constant photoperiod and shifting temperature cues into predictive models that consider how climate change may affect northern forests.</p>

The histone demethylase KDM6B regulates temperature-dependent sex determination in a turtle species
<p>Temperature-dependent sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>ation is a notable model of phenotypic plasticity. In many reptiles, including the red-eared slider turtle <i>Trachemys scripta elegans</i> (<i>T. scripta</i>), the individual’s sex is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>ed by the ambient temperature during egg incubation. In this study, we show that the histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylase KDM6B exhibits temperature-dependent sexually dimorphic expression in early <i>T. scripta</i> embryos before the gonad is distinct. Knockdown of <i>Kdm6b</i> at 26°C (a temperature at which all offspring develop into males) triggers male-to-female sex reversal in >80% of surviving embryos. KDM6B directly promotes the transcription of the male sex-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>ing gene <i>Dmrt1</i> by eliminating the trimethylation of H3K27 near its promoter. Additionally, overexpression of <i>Dmrt1</i> is sufficient to rescue the sex reversal induced by disruption of <i>Kdm6b</i>.

Transcription Factor OsTGA10 Is a Target of the MADS Protein OsMADS8 and Is Required for Tapetum Development
<p>This study aimed at elucidating regulatory components behind floral organ identity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>ation and tissue development. It remains unclear how organ identity proteins facilitate development of organ primordia into tissues with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>ed identity, even though it has long been accepted that floral organ identity is genetically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>ed by interaction of identity genes according to the ABC model. Using the chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing technique, we identified <i>OsTGA10</i>, encoding a bZIP transcription factor, as a target of the MADS box protein OsMADS8, which is annotated as an E-class organ identity protein. We characterized the function of OsTGA10 using genetic and molecular analyses. <i>OsTGA10</i> was preferentially expressed during stamen development, and mutation of <i>OsTGA10</i> resulted in male sterility. OsTGA10 was required for tapetum development and functioned by interacting with known tapetum genes. In addition, in <i>ostga10</i> stamens, the hallmark cell wall thickening of the endothecium was defective. Our findings suggest that OsTGA10 plays a mediator role between organ identity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>ation and tapetum development in rice stamen development, between tapetum development and microspore development, and between various regulatory components required for tapetum development. Furthermore, the defective endothecium in <i>ostga10</i> implies that cell wall thickening of endothecium is dependent on tapetum development.</p>

Temperate tree species show identical response in tree water deficit but different sensitivities in sap flow to summer soil drying
<p>Temperate forests are expected to be particularly vulnerable to drought and soil drying because they are not adapted to such conditions and perform best in mesic environments. Here we ask (i) how sensitively four common temperate tree species (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i>, <i>Picea abies</i>, <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> and <i>Fraxinus excelsior</i>) respond in their water relations to summer soil drying and seek to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>e (ii) if species-specific responses to summer soil drying are related to the onset of declining water status across the four species. Throughout 2012 and 2013 we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>ed tree water deficit (TWD) as a proxy for tree water status from recorded stem radius changes and monitored sap flow rates with sensors on 16 mature trees studied in the field at Lageren, Switzerland. All tree species responded equally in their relative maximum TWD to the onset of declining soil moisture. This implies that the water supply of all tree species was affected by declining soil moisture and that none of the four species was able to fully maintain its water status, e.g., by access to alternative water sources in the soil. In contrast we found strong and highly species-specific responses of sap flow to declining soil moisture with the strongest decline in <i>P. abies</i> (92%), followed by <i>F. sylvatica</i> (53%) and <i>A. pseudoplatanus</i> (48%). <i>F. excelsior</i> did not significantly reduce sap flow. We hypothesize the species-specific responses in sap flow to declining soil moisture that occur despite a simultaneous increase in relative TWD in all species reflect how fast these species approach critical levels of their water status, which is most likely influenced by species-specific traits <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>ing the hydraulic properties of the species tree.</p>

Coordinating the overall stomatal response of plants: Rapid leaf-to-leaf communication during light stress
<p>The plant canopy functions as an aerial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong> of light-harvesting antennas. To achieve maximal yield, each leaf within this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong> and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong> as a whole need to rapidly adjust to naturally occurring fluctuations in light intensity and quality. Excessive light stress triggers the closing of pores in leaves called stomata to minimize moisture loss. We found that different leaves within the canopy of an <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> plant, including leaves not directly exposed to light, coordinated stomatal closure in response to light stress by sending and receiving rapid systemic signals. This response required the plant hormones abscisic acid and jasmonic acid and was mediated by a rapid autopropagating wave of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Furthermore, this response depended on the function of genes encoding the ROS-generating NADPH oxidase RBOHD and various stomatal regulators, such as the anion channel SLAC1, GHR1 (guard cell hydrogen peroxide resistant 1), and lipoxygenase 1 (LOX1). Our findings reveal that plants function as highly dynamic and coordinated organisms, optimizing the overall response of their canopies to fluctuating light intensities.</p>

Building two-dimensional materials one row at a time: Avoiding the nucleation barrier
<p>Assembly of two-dimensional (2D) molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong>s on surfaces produces a wide range of architectural motifs exhibiting unique properties, but little attention has been given to the mechanism by which they nucleate. Using peptides selected for their binding affinity to molybdenum disulfide, we investigated nucleation of 2D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong>s by molecularly resolved in situ atomic force microscopy and compared our results to molecular dynamics simulations. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong>s assembled one row at a time, and the nuclei were ordered from the earliest stages and formed without a free energy barrier or a critical size. The results verify long-standing but unproven predictions of classical nucleation theory in one dimension while revealing key interactions underlying 2D assembly.</p>

Templated nanofiber synthesis via chemical vapor polymerization into liquid crystalline films
<p>Extrusion, electrospinning, and microdrawing are widely used to create fibrous polymer mats, but these approaches offer limited access to oriented <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong>s of nanometer-scale fibers with controlled size, shape, and lateral organization. We show that chemical vapor polymerization can be performed on surfaces coated with thin films of liquid crystals to synthesize organized assemblies of end-attached polymer nanofibers. The process uses low concentrations of radical monomers formed initially in the vapor phase and then diffused into the liquid-crystal template. This minimizes monomer-induced changes to the liquid-crystal phase and enables access to nanofiber <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong>s with complex yet precisely defined structures and compositions. The nanofiber <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong>s permit tailoring of a wide range of functional properties, including adhesion that depends on nanofiber chirality.</p>

A pathway for mitotic chromosome formation
<p>Mitotic chromosomes fold as compact <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong>s of chromatin loops. To identify the pathway of mitotic chromosome formation, we combined imaging and Hi-C analysis of synchronous DT40 cell cultures with polymer simulations. Here we show that in prophase, the interphase organization is rapidly lost in a condensin-dependent manner, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong>s of consecutive 60-kilobase (kb) loops are formed. During prometaphase, ~80-kb inner loops are nested within ~400-kb outer loops. The loop <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong> acquires a helical arrangement with consecutive loops emanating from a central “spiral staircase” condensin scaffold. The size of helical turns progressively increases to ~12 megabases during prometaphase. Acute depletion of condensin I or II shows that nested loops form by differential action of the two condensins, whereas condensin II is required for helical winding.</p>

Ductal sex determination
<p>How the physical differences between the sexes develop is an intriguing process. In mammals, the first important stage in sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>ation occurs during fetal life, when the male-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>ing Y chromosome expresses a gene called <i>sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>ing region Y</i> (<i>SRY</i>), which acts on the bipotential gonad to initiate testis (instead of ovary) formation (<i>1</i>). Landmark experiments by Jost in the 1950s showed that the development of male-specific structures is established by factors produced from the emerging testis, namely androgens and anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) (<i>2</i>). This suggested that the formation of male characteristics is an active process, whereas female-specific differentiation is passive. On page 717 of this issue, Zhao <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) show that female development is also an active process.</p>

Predicting Dynamic Metabolic Demands in the Photosynthetic Eukaryote <i>Chlorella vulgaris</i>
<p>Phototrophic organisms exhibit a highly dynamic proteome, adapting their biomass composition in response to diurnal light/dark cycles and nutrient availability. Here, we used experimentally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>ed biomass compositions over the course of growth to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>e and constrain the biomass objective function (BOF) in a genome-scale metabolic model of <i>Chlorella vulgaris</i> UTEX 395 over time. Changes in the BOF, which encompasses all metabolites necessary to produce biomass, influence the state of the metabolic network thus directly affecting predictions. Simulations using dynamic BOFs predicted distinct proteome demands during heterotrophic or photoautotrophic growth. Model-driven analysis of extracellular nitrogen concentrations and predicted nitrogen uptake rates revealed an intracellular nitrogen pool, which contains 38% of the total nitrogen provided in the medium for photoautotrophic and 13% for heterotrophic growth. Agreement between flux and gene expression trends was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>ed by statistical comparison. Accordance between predicted flux trends and gene expression trends was found for 65% of multisubunit enzymes and 75% of allosteric reactions. Reactions with the highest agreement between simulations and experimental data were associated with energy metabolism, terpenoid biosynthesis, fatty acids, nucleotides, and amino acid metabolism. Furthermore, predicted flux distributions at each time point were compared with gene expression data to gain new insights into intracellular compartmentalization, specifically for transporters. A total of 103 genes related to internal transport reactions were identified and added to the updated model of <i>C. vulgaris</i>, <i>i</i>CZ946, thus increasing our knowledgebase by 10% for this model green alga.</p>

Functional Analysis of Cellulose Synthase (CESA) Protein Class Specificity
<p>The cellulose synthase complex (CSC) exhibits a 6-fold symmetry and is known as a “rosette.” Each CSC is believed to contain between 18 and 24 CESA proteins that each synthesize an individual glucan chain. These chains form the microfibrils that confer the remarkable structural properties of cellulose. At least three different classes of CESA proteins are essential to form the CSC. However, while organization of the CSC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>es microfibril structure, how individual CESA proteins are organized within the CSC remains unclear. Parts of the plant CESA proteins map sufficiently well onto the bacterial CESA (BcsA) structure, indicating that they are likely to share a common catalytic mechanism. However, plant CESA proteins are much larger than the bacterial BcsA protein, prompting the suggestion that these plant-specific regions are important for interactions between CESA proteins and for conferring CESA class specificity. In this study, we have undertaken a comprehensive analysis of well-defined regions of secondary cell wall CESA proteins, with the aim of defining what distinguishes different CESA proteins and hence what <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>es the specificity of each CESA class. Our results demonstrate that CESA class specificity extends throughout the protein and not just in the highly variable regions. Furthermore, we find that different CESA isoforms vary greatly in their levels of site specificity and this is likely to be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>ed by the constraints imposed by their position within the CSC rather than their primary structure.</p>

Production of all female progeny: evidence for the presence of the male sex determination factor on the Y chromosome
<p>The red flour beetle, <i>Tribolium castaneum</i>, follows an XX (female) and XY (male) sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>ation system. Maternal supply of the protein Transformer (Tra) is required for XX insects to follow the female pathway. The nature and source of the signal that regulates male sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>ation in XY beetles are not known. Parental RNAi-aided knockdown in expression of <i>tra</i> masculinizes genetic females (XX) that are fertile. The virgin females mated with these masculinized genetic females produced all female progeny. We present the genetic evidence to show that the factor responsible for male sex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>ation is present on the Y chromosome. These data also suggest that the Y chromosome in <i>T. castaneum</i> is not required for male fertility.</p>

Association of Statin Dose With Amputation and Survival in Patients With Peripheral Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Statin dose guidelines for patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) are largely based on coronary artery disease and stroke data. The aim of this study is to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>e the effect of statin intensity on PAD outcomes of amputation and mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using an observational cohort study design and a validated algorithm, we identified patients with incident PAD (2003–2014) in the national Veterans Affairs data. Highest statin intensity exposure (high-intensity versus low-to-moderate–intensity versus antiplatelet therapy but no statin use) was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>ed within 1 year of diagnosis of PAD. Outcomes of interest were lower extremity amputations and death. The association of statin intensity with incident amputation and mortality was assessed with Kaplan-Meier plots, Cox proportional hazards modeling, propensity score–matched analysis, and sensitivity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subgroup</span></strong> analyses, as well, to reduce confounding.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In 155 647 patients with incident PAD, more than a quarter (28%) were not on statins. Use of high-intensity statins was lowest in patients with PAD only (6.4%) in comparison with comorbid coronary/carotid disease (18.4%). Incident amputation and mortality risk declined significantly with any statin use in comparison with the antiplatelet therapy–only group. In adjusted Cox models, the high-intensity statin users were associated with lower amputation risk and mortality in comparison with antiplatelet therapy–only users (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.61–0.74 and hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.70–0.77, respectively). Low-to-moderate–intensity statins also had significant reductions in the risk of amputation and mortality (hazard ratio amputation, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.75– 0.86; hazard ratio death, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.81–0.86) in comparison with no statins (antiplatelet therapy only), but effect size was significantly weaker than the high-intensity statins (<i>P</i><0.001). The association of high-intensity statins with lower amputation and death risk remained significant and robust in propensity score–matched, sensitivity, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subgroup</span></strong> analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Statins, especially high-intensity formulations, are underused in patients with PAD. This is the first population-based study to show that high-intensity statin use at the time of PAD diagnosis is associated with a significant reduction in limb loss and mortality in comparison with low-to-moderate–intensity statin users, and patients treated only with antiplatelet medications but not with statins, as well.</p></sec>

Long-term outcomes of cemented <i>versus</i> cementless humeral components in arthroplasty of the shoulder
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>In the initial development of total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA),   the humeral component was usually fixed with cement. Cementless   components were subsequently introduced. The aim of this study was   to compare the long-term outcome of cemented and cementless humeral   components in arthroplasty of the shoulder.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>All patients who underwent primary arthroplasty of the shoulder   at our institution between 1970 and 2012 were included in the study.   There were 4636 patients with 1167 cemented humeral components and   3469 cementless components. Patients with the two types of fixation   were matched for nine different covariates using a propensity score   analysis. A total of 551 well-balanced pairs of patients with cemented   and cementless components were available after matching for comparison   of the outcomes. The clinical outcomes which were analysed included loosening   of the humeral component <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>ed at revision surgery, periprosthetic   fractures, post-operative infection and operating time.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The overall five-, ten-, 15- and 20-year rates of survival were   98.9%, 97.2%, 95.5%, and 94.4%, respectively. Survival without loosening   at 20 years was 98% for cemented components and 92.4% for cementless   components. After propensity score matching including fixation as   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>ed by the design of the component, humeral loosening was   also found to be significantly higher in the cementless group. Survival   without humeral loosening at 20 years was 98.7% for cemented components   and 91.0% for cementless components. There was no significant difference   in the risk of intra- or post-operative fracture. The rate of survival   without deep infection and the mean operating time were significantly   higher in the cemented group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Both types of fixation give rates of long-term survival of >   90%. Cemented components have better rates of survival without loosening   but this should be weighed against increased operating time and   the risk of bony destruction of the proximal humerus at the time   of revision of a cemented humeral component.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:666–73.</p></sec>

Mid-term changes in blood metal ion levels after Articular Surface Replacement arthroplasty of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Our first aim was to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>e whether there are significant   changes in the level of metal ions in the blood at mid-term follow-up,   in patients with an Articular Surface Replacement (ASR) arthroplasty.   Secondly, we sought to identify risk factors for any increases.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The study involved 435 patients who underwent unilateral, metal-on-metal   (MoM) hip resurfacing (HRA) or total hip arthroplasty (THA). These   patients all had one measurement of the level of metal ions in the   blood before seven years had passed post-operatively (early evaluation)   and one after seven years had passed post-operatively (mid-term evaluation).   Changes in ion levels were tested using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test.   We identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">subgroup</span></strong>s at the highest risk of increase using a   multivariable linear logistic regression model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were significant increases in the levels of metal ions   for patients who underwent both MoM HRA (Chromium (Cr): 0.5 parts   per billion (ppb); Cobalt (Co): 1.1 ppb) and MoM THA (Cr: 0.5 ppb;   Co: 0.7 ppb). In a multivariable model considering MoM HRAs, the   change in the levels of metal ions was influenced by female gender   (Co: Odds Ratio (OR) 1.42; p = 0.002 and Cr: OR 1.08; p = 0.006).   The change was found to be irrespective of the initial level for   the MoM HRAs, whereas there was a negative relationship between   the initial level and the change in the level for those with a MoM   THA (Co: OR -0.43; p < 0.001 and Cr: OR -0.14; p = 0.033).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The levels of metal ions in the blood increase significantly   over the period until mid-term follow-up in patients with both a   MoM HRA and those with a MoM THA. We recommend that the levels of   metal ions be measured most frequently for women with a MoM HRA.   While those with a MoM THA appear to stabilise at a certain level,   the accuracy of this trend is not yet clear. Vigilant follow-up   is still recommended. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B(4   Supple B):33–40.</p></sec>

Epidermal growth factor receptor mutations should be considered as a prognostic factor for survival of patients with pathological fractures or painful bone metastases from non-small cell lung cancer
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>This study aims to assess first, whether mutations in the epidermal   growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Kirsten rat sarcoma (kRAS) genes   are associated with overall survival (OS) in patients who present   with symptomatic bone metastases from non-small cell lung cancer   (NSCLC) and secondly, whether mutation status should be incorporated into   prognostic models that are used when deciding on the appropriate   palliative treatment for symptomatic bone metastases.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We studied 139 patients with NSCLC treated between 2007 and 2014   for symptomatic bone metastases and whose mutation status was known.   The association between mutation status and overall survival was   analysed and the results applied to a recently published prognostic   model to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>e whether including the mutation status would improve   its discriminatory power.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The median OS was 3.9 months (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1   to 5.7). Patients with EGFR (15%) or kRAS mutations (34%) had a   median OS of 17.3 months (95% CI 12.7 to 22.0) and 1.8 months (95%   CI 1.0 to 2.7), respectively. Compared with EGFR-positive patients,   EGFR-negative patients had a 2.5 times higher risk of death (95%   CI 1.5 to 4.2). Incorporating EGFR mutation status in the prognostic   model improved its discriminatory power.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Survival prediction models for patients with symptomatic bone   metastases are used to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>e the most appropriate (surgical)   treatment for painful or fractured lesions.

Functional outcomes of conservatively managed acute ruptures of the Achilles tendon
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>This prospective cohort study aims to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>e if the size of   the tendon gap following acute rupture of the Achilles tendon shows   an association with the functional outcome following non-operative   treatment. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>All patients presenting within two weeks of an acute unilateral   rupture of the Achilles tendon between July 2012 and July 2015 were   considered for the study. In total, 38 patients (nine female, 29   male, mean age 52 years; 29 to 78) completed the study. Dynamic   ultrasound examination was performed to confirm the diagnosis and   measure the gap between ruptured tendon ends. Outcome was assessed   using dynamometric testing of plantarflexion and the Achilles tendon   Total Rupture score (ATRS) six months after the completion of a   rehabilitation programme.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Patients with a gap ≥ 10 mm with the ankle in the neutral position   had significantly greater peak torque deficit than those with gaps   < 10 mm (mean 23.3%; 7% to 52% <i>vs </i>14.3%; 0% to   47%, p = 0.023). However, there was no difference   in ATRS between the two groups (mean score 87.2; 74 to 100 <i>vs</i> 87.4;   68 to 97, p = 0.467). There was no significant correlation between   gap size and torque deficit (τ = 0.103), suggesting a non-linear relationship.   There was also no significant correlation between ATRS and peak   torque deficit (τ = -0.305). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion </title><p>This is the first study to identify an association between tendon   gap and functional outcome in acute rupture of the Achilles tendon.   We have identified 10 mm as a gap size at which deficits in plantarflexion   strength become significantly greater, however, the precise relationship   between gap size and plantarflexion strength remains unclear.

Assessment of resuscitation as measured by markers of metabolic acidosis and features of injury
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The best time for definitive orthopaedic care is often unclear   in patients with multiple injuries. The objective of this study   was make a prospective assessment of the safety of our early appropriate   care (EAC) strategy and to evaluate the potential benefit of additional   laboratory data to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>e readiness for surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A cohort of 335 patients with fractures of the pelvis, acetabulum,   femur, or spine were included. Patients underwent definitive fixation   within 36 hours if one of the following three parameters were met:   lactate < 4.0 mmol/L; pH ≥ 7.25; or base excess (BE) ≥ -5.5 mmol/L.   If all three parameters were met, resuscitation was designated full   protocol resuscitation (FPR). If less than all three parameters   were met, it was designated an incomplete protocol resuscitation   (IPR). Complications were assessed by an independent adjudication   committee and included infection; sepsis; PE/DVT; organ failure;   pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In total, 66 patients (19.7%) developed 90 complications. An   historical cohort of 1441 patients had a complication rate of 22.1%.   The complication rate for patients with only one EAC parameter at   the point of protocol was 34.3%, which was higher than other groups   (p = 0.041). Patients who had IPR did not have significantly more   complications (31.8%) than those who had FPR (22.6%; p = 0.078).   Regression analysis showed male gender and injury severity score   to be independent predictors of complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study highlights important trends in the IPR and FPR groups,   suggesting that differences in resuscitation parameters may guide   care in certain patients; further study is, however, required.

Practice patterns in the care of acute Achilles tendon ruptures
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>e whether the findings from a landmark Canadian trial   assessing the optimal management of acute rupture of the Achilles   tendon influenced the practice patterns of orthopaedic surgeons   in Ontario, Canada.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Health administrative databases were used to identify Ontario   residents ≥ 18 years of age with an Achilles tendon rupture from   April 2002 to March 2014. The rate of surgical repair (per 100 cases)   was calculated for each calendar quarter. A time-series analysis   was used to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>e whether changes in the rate were chronologically   related to the dissemination of results from a landmark trial published   in February 2009. Non-linear spline regression was then used independently   to identify critical time-points of change in the surgical repair   rate to confirm the findings.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 29 531 patients sustained an Achilles tendon rupture   during the study period. Consistently, around 21 out of every 100   cases underwent surgical repair up to the first quarter of 2010.   However, by the first quarter of 2014, only 6.5 cases per 100 had   surgery. A statistically significant decrease in the rate of surgical   repair was observed within one year of the presentation of landmark   trial results in 2009 (p < 0.001). July 2009 was independently identified   as a critical time at which the surgical repair rate began to significantly   decline (p < 0.001).

Measurements of the alignment of the knee   and the components included the tibiofemoral angle (TFA), tibial   component angle (TCA) and femoral component angle (FCA). Alignment was   measured on post-operative, non-weight-bearing anteroposterior (AP)   scanograms and categorised as varus or valgus outlier or in-range   in relation to mechanically aligned criteria.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The proportion of patients with outlier varus or valgus alignment   was 16%/24% for the HKA angle, 55%/0% for the PMTA, 0%/57% for the   DLFA, 25%/12% for the TFA, 100%/0% for the TCA, and 0%/64% for the   FCA. In general, the forces in the medial and lateral compartments   of those with outlier alignment were not different from those with   in-range alignment except for the TFA, in which patients with outlier   varus alignment had a mean paradoxical force which was 6 lb higher   in the lateral compartment than those with in-range alignment.

Is limb salvage surgery safe for bone sarcomas identified after a previous surgical procedure?
<p>Bone sarcomas are rare cancers and orthopaedic   surgeons come across them infrequently, sometimes unexpectedly during   surgical procedures. We investigated the outcomes of patients who   underwent a surgical procedure where sarcomas were found unexpectedly   and were subsequently referred to our unit for treatment. We identified   95 patients (44 intra-lesional excisions, 35 fracture fixations,   16 joint replacements) with mean age of 48 years (11 to 83); 60%   were males (n = 57). Local recurrence arose in 40% who underwent   limb salvage surgery <i>versus</i> 12% who had an amputation.   Despite achieving local control, overall survival was worse for   patients treated with amputation rather than limb salvage (54% <i>vs</i> 75%   five-year survival). Factors that negatively influenced survival   were invasive primary surgery (fracture fixation, joint replacement),   a delay of greater than two months until referral to our oncology   service, and high-grade tumours. Survival in these circumstances   depends mostly on factors that are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>ed prior to definitive   treatment by a tertiary orthopaedic oncology unit. Limb salvage   in this group of patients is associated with a higher rate of inadequate   marginal surgery and, consequently, higher local recurrence rates   than amputation, but should still be attempted whenever possible,   as local control is not the primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>ant of survival. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014;96-B:665–72.</p>

Limited predictive value of blastomere angle of division in trophectoderm and inner cell mass specification
<p>The formation of trophectoderm (TE) and pluripotent inner cell mass (ICM) is one of the earliest events during mammalian embryogenesis. It is believed that the orientation of division of polarised blastomeres in the 8- and 16-cell stage embryo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>es the fate of daughter cells, based on how asymmetrically distributed lineage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>ants are segregated. To investigate the relationship between angle of division and subsequent fate in unperturbed embryos, we constructed cellular resolution digital representations of the development of mouse embryos from the morula to early blastocyst stage, based on 4D confocal image volumes. We find that at the 16-cell stage, very few inside cells are initially produced as a result of cell division, but that the number increases due to cell movement. Contrary to expectations, outside cells at the 16-cell stage represent a heterogeneous population, with some fated to contributing exclusively to the TE and others capable of contributing to both the TE and ICM. Our data support the view that factors other than the angle of division, such as the position of a blastomere, play a major role in the specification of TE and ICM.</p>

A dynamic cell adhesion surface regulates tissue architecture in growth plate cartilage
<p>The architecture and morphogenetic properties of tissues are founded in the tissue-specific regulation of cell behaviors. In endochondral bones, the growth plate cartilage promotes bone elongation via regulated chondrocyte maturation within an ordered, three-dimensional cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong>. A key event in the process that generates this cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">array</span></strong> is the transformation of disordered resting chondrocytes into clonal columns of discoid proliferative cells aligned with the primary growth vector. Previous analysis showed that column-forming chondrocytes display planar cell divisions, and the resulting daughter cells rearrange by ∼90° to align with the lengthening column. However, these previous studies provided limited information about the mechanisms underlying this dynamic process. Here we present new mechanistic insights generated by application of a novel time-lapse confocal microscopy method along with immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. We show that, during cell division, daughter chondrocytes establish a cell-cell adhesion surface enriched in cadherins and β-catenin. Rearrangement into columns occurs concomitant with expansion of this adhesion surface in a process more similar to cell spreading than to migration. Column formation requires cell-cell adhesion, as reducing cadherin binding via chelation of extracellular calcium inhibits chondrocyte rearrangement. Importantly, physical indicators of cell polarity, such as cell body alignment, are not prerequisites for oriented cell behavior. Our results support a model in which regulation of adhesive surface dynamics and cortical tension by extrinsic signaling modifies the thermodynamic landscape to promote organization of daughter cells in the context of the three-dimensional growth plate tissue.</p>

Prospective Countywide Surveillance and Autopsy Characterization of Sudden Cardiac Death
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Studies of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death (SCD) use emergency medical services records, death certificates, or definitions that infer cause of death; thus, the true incidence of SCD is unknown. Over 90% of SCDs occur out-of-hospital; nonforensic autopsies are rarely performed, and therefore causes of death are presumed. We conducted a medical examiner–based investigation to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>e the precise incidence and autopsy-defined causes of all SCDs in an entire metropolitan area. We hypothesized that postmortem investigation would identify actual sudden arrhythmic deaths among presumed SCDs.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Between February 1, 2011, and March 1, 2014, we prospectively identified all incident deaths attributed to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (emergency medical services primary impression, cardiac arrest) between 18 to 90 years of age in San Francisco County for autopsy, toxicology, and histology via medical examiner surveillance of consecutive out-of-hospital deaths, all reported by law. We obtained comprehensive records to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">determin</span></strong>e whether out-of-hospital cardiac arrest deaths met World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for SCD. We reviewed death certificates filed quarterly for missed SCDs. Autopsy-defined sudden arrhythmic deaths had no extracardiac cause of death or acute heart failure. A multidisciplinary committee adjudicated final cause.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>All 20 440 deaths were reviewed; 12 671 were unattended and reported to the medical examiner. From these, we identified 912 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest deaths; 541 (59%) met WHO SCD criteria (mean 62.8 years, 69% male) and 525 (97%) were autopsied. Eighty-nine additional WHO-defined SCDs occurred within 3 weeks of active medical care with the death certificate signed by the attending physician, ineligible for autopsy but included in the countywide WHO-defined SCD incidence of 29.6/100 000 person-years, highest in black men (<i>P</i><0.0001). Of 525 WHO-defined SCDs, 301 (57%) had no cardiac history. Leading causes of death were coronary disease (32%), occult overdose (13.5%), cardiomyopathy (10%), cardiac hypertrophy (8%), and neurological (5.5%). Autopsy-defined sudden arrhythmic deaths were 55.8% (293/525) of overall, 65% (78/120) of witnessed, and 53% (215/405) of unwitnessed WHO-defined SCDs (<i>P</i>=0.024); 286 of 293 (98%) had structural cardiac disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Forty percent of deaths attributed to stated cardiac arrest were not sudden or unexpected, and nearly half of presumed SCDs were not arrhythmic. These findings have implications for the accuracy of SCDs as defined by WHO criteria or emergency medical services records in aggregate mortality data, clinical trials, and cohort studies.</p></sec>

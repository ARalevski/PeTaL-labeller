Correlation between genome reduction and bacterial growth
<p>Genome reduction by removing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispens</span></strong>able genomic sequences in bacteria is commonly used in both fundamental and applied studies to determine the minimal genetic requirements for a living system or to develop highly efficient bioreactors. Nevertheless, whether and how the accumulative loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispens</span></strong>able genomic sequences disturbs bacterial growth remains unclear. To investigate the relationship between genome reduction and growth, a series of <i>Escherichia coli</i> strains carrying genomes reduced in a stepwise manner were used. Intensive growth analyses revealed that the accumulation of multiple genomic deletions caused decreases in the exponential growth rate and the saturated cell density in a deletion-length-dependent manner as well as gradual changes in the patterns of growth dynamics, regardless of the growth media. Accordingly, a perspective growth model linking genome evolution to genome engineering was proposed. This study provides the first demonstration of a quantitative connection between genomic sequence and bacterial growth, indicating that growth rate is potentially associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispens</span></strong>able genomic sequences.</p>

Stroma provides an intestinal stem cell niche in the absence of epithelial Wnts
<p>Wnt/β-catenin signaling supports intestinal homeostasis by regulating proliferation in the crypt. Multiple Wnts are expressed in Paneth cells as well as other intestinal epithelial and stromal cells. <i>Ex vivo</i>, Wnts secreted by Paneth cells can support intestinal stem cells when Wnt signaling is enhanced with supplemental R-Spondin 1 (RSPO1). However, <i>in vivo</i>, the source of Wnts in the stem cell niche is less clear. Genetic ablation of <i>Porcn</i>, an endoplasmic reticulum resident O-acyltransferase that is essential for the secretion and activity of all vertebrate Wnts, confirmed the role of intestinal epithelial Wnts in <i>ex vivo</i> culture. Unexpectedly, mice lacking epithelial Wnt activity (<i>Porcn<sup>Del</sup>/Villin-Cre</i> mice) had normal intestinal proliferation and differentiation, as well as successful regeneration after radiation injury, indicating that epithelial Wnts are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispens</span></strong>able for these processes. Consistent with a key role for stroma in the crypt niche, intestinal stromal cells endogenously expressing Wnts and <i>Rspo3</i> support the growth of <i>Porcn<sup>Del</sup></i> organoids <i>ex vivo</i> without RSPO1 supplementation. Conversely, increasing pharmacologic PORCN inhibition, affecting both stroma and epithelium, reduced <i>Lgr5</i> intestinal stem cells, inhibited recovery from radiation injury, and at the highest dose fully blocked intestinal proliferation. We conclude that epithelial Wnts are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispens</span></strong>able and that stromal production of Wnts can fully support normal murine intestinal homeostasis.</p>

NF-κB signaling dynamics is controlled by a dose-sensing autoregulatory loop
<p>Over the last decade, multiple studies have shown that signaling proteins activated in different temporal patterns, such as oscillatory, transient, and sustained, can result in distinct gene expression patterns or cell fates. However, the molecular events that ensure appropriate stimulus- and dose-dependent dynamics are not often understood and are difficult to investigate. Here, we used single-cell analysis to dissect the mechanisms underlying the stimulus- and dose-encoding patterns in the innate immune signaling network. We found that Toll-like receptor (TLR) and interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling dynamics relied on a dose-dependent, autoinhibitory loop that rendered cells refractory to further stimulation. Using inducible gene expression and optogenetics to perturb the network at different levels, we identified IL-1R–associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) as the dose-sensing node responsible for limiting signal flow during the innate immune response. Although the kinase activity of IRAK1 was not required for signal propagation, it played a critical role in inhibiting the nucleocytoplasmic oscillations of the transcription factor NF-κB. Thus, protein activities that may be “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispens</span></strong>able” from a topological perspective can nevertheless be essential in shaping the dynamic response to the external environment.</p>

The transcription factor Lef1 switches partners from β-catenin to Smad3 during muscle stem cell quiescence
<p>Skeletal muscle stem cells (MuSCs), also known as satellite cells, persist in adult mammals by entering a state of quiescence (G<sub>0</sub>) during the early postnatal period. Quiescence is reversed during damage-induced regeneration and re-established after regeneration. Entry of cultured myoblasts into G<sub>0</sub> is associated with a specific, reversible induction of Wnt target genes, thus implicating members of the Tcf and Lef1 (Tcf/Lef) transcription factor family, which mediate transcriptional responses to Wnt signaling, in the initiation of quiescence. We found that the canonical Wnt effector β-catenin, which cooperates with Tcf/Lef, was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispens</span></strong>able for myoblasts to enter quiescence. Using pharmacological and genetic approaches in cultured C2C12 myoblasts and in MuSCs, we demonstrated that Tcf/Lef activity during quiescence depended not on β-catenin but on the transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) effector and transcriptional coactivator Smad3, which colocalized with Lef1 at canonical Wnt-responsive elements and directly interacted with Lef1 specifically in G<sub>0</sub>. Depletion of Smad3, but not β-catenin, reduced Lef1 occupancy at target promoters, Tcf/Lef target gene expression, and self-renewal of myoblasts. In vivo, MuSCs underwent a switch from β-catenin–Lef1 to Smad3-Lef1 interactions during the postnatal switch from proliferation to quiescence, with β-catenin–Lef1 interactions recurring during damage-induced reactivation. Our findings suggest that the interplay of Wnt-Tcf/Lef and TGF-β–Smad3 signaling activates canonical Wnt target promoters in a manner that depends on β-catenin during myoblast proliferation but is independent of β-catenin during MuSC quiescence.</p>

Mitophagy controls beige adipocyte maintenance through a Parkin-dependent and UCP1-independent mechanism
<p>Beige adipocytes are an inducible form of mitochondria-enriched thermogenic adipocytes that emerge in response to external stimuli, such as chronic cold exposure. We have previously shown that after the withdrawal of external stimuli, beige adipocytes directly acquire a white fat–like phenotype through autophagy-mediated mitochondrial degradation. We investigated the upstream pathway that mediates mitochondrial clearance and report that Parkin-mediated mitophagy plays a key role in the beige-to-white adipocyte transition. Mice genetically deficient in <i>Park2</i> showed reduced mitochondrial degradation and retained thermogenic beige adipocytes even after the withdrawal of external stimuli. Norepinephrine signaling through the PKA pathway inhibited the recruitment of Parkin protein to mitochondria in beige adipocytes. However, mitochondrial proton uncoupling by uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispens</span></strong>able for Parkin recruitment and beige adipocyte maintenance. These results suggest a physiological mechanism by which external cues control mitochondrial homeostasis in thermogenic fat cells through mitophagy.</p>

ATP promotes the fast migration of dendritic cells through the activity of pannexin 1 channels and P2X<sub>7</sub> receptors
<p>Upon its release from injured cells, such as infected, transformed, inflamed, or necrotic cells, extracellular adenosine-5′-triphosphate (ATP) acts as a danger signal that recruits phagocytes, such as neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs), to the site of injury. The sensing of extracellular ATP occurs through purinergic (P2) receptors. We investigated the cellular mechanisms linking purinergic signaling to DC motility. We found that ATP stimulated fast DC motility through an autocrine signaling loop, which was initiated by the activation of P2X<sub>7</sub> receptors and further amplified by pannexin 1 (Panx1) channels. Upon stimulation of the P2X<sub>7</sub> receptor by ATP, Panx1 contributed to fast DC motility by increasing the permeability of the plasma membrane, which resulted in supplementary ATP release. In the absence of Panx1, DCs failed to increase their speed of migration in response to ATP, despite exhibiting a normal P2X<sub>7</sub> receptor–mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> response. In addition to DC migration, Panx1 channel– and P2X<sub>7</sub> receptor–dependent signaling was further required to stimulate the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. In vivo, functional Panx1 channels were required for the homing of DCs to lymph nodes, although they were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispens</span></strong>able for DC maturation. These data suggest that P2X<sub>7</sub> receptors and Panx1 channels are crucial players in the regulation of DC migration to endogenous danger signals.</p>

Genetic evidence that β-arrestins are dispensable for the initiation of β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor signaling to ERK
<p>The β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor (β<sub>2</sub>AR) has provided a paradigm to elucidate how G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) control intracellular signaling, including the discovery that β-arrestins, which bind to ligand-activated GPCRs, are central for GPCR function. We used genome editing, conditional gene deletion, and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to determine the roles of β-arrestin 1 (β-arr1) and β-arr2 in β<sub>2</sub>AR internalization, trafficking, and signaling to ERK. We found that only β-arr2 was essential for β<sub>2</sub>AR internalization. Unexpectedly, β-arr1 and β-arr2 and receptor internalization were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispens</span></strong>able for ERK activation. Instead, β<sub>2</sub>AR signaled through Gα<sub>s</sub> and Gβγ subunits through a pathway that involved the tyrosine kinase SRC, the adaptor protein SHC, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor SOS, the small GTPase RAS, and the kinases RAF and MEK, which led to ERK activation. These findings provide a molecular framework for β<sub>2</sub>AR signaling through β-arrestin–independent pathways in key physiological functions and under pathological conditions.</p>

Lipopolysaccharide is transported to the cell surface by a membrane-to-membrane protein bridge
<p>Gram-negative bacteria have an outer membrane that serves as a barrier to noxious agents in the environment. This protective function is dependent on lipopolysaccharide, a large glycolipid located in the outer leaflet of the outer membrane. Lipopolysaccharide is synthesized at the cytoplasmic membrane and must be transported to the cell surface. To understand this transport process, we reconstituted membrane-to-membrane movement of lipopolysaccharide by incorporating purified inner and outer membrane transport complexes into separate proteoliposomes. Transport involved stable association between the inner and outer membrane proteoliposomes. Our results support a model in which lipopolysaccharide molecules are pushed one after the other in a PEZ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispens</span></strong>er–like manner across a protein bridge that connects the inner and outer membranes.</p>

Recent natural selection causes adaptive evolution of an avian polygenic trait

We found that genomic regions under differential selection contained candidate genes for bill morphology and used genetic architecture analyses to confirm that these genes, especially the collagen gene <i>COL4A5</i>, explained variation in bill length. <i>COL4A5</i> variation was associated with reproductive success, which, combined with spatiotemporal patterns of bill length, suggested ongoing selection for longer bills in the United Kingdom. Last, bill length and <i>COL4A5</i> variation were associated with usage of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">feeder</span></strong>s, suggesting that longer bills may have evolved in the United Kingdom as a response to supplementary feeding.</p>

mTOR regulates metabolic adaptation of APCs in the lung and controls the outcome of allergic inflammation
<p>Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) occupy diverse anatomical tissues, but their tissue-restricted homeostasis remains poorly understood. Here, working with mouse models of inflammation, we found that mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)–dependent metabolic adaptation was required at discrete locations. mTOR was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispens</span></strong>able for dendritic cell (DC) homeostasis in secondary lymphoid tissues but necessary to regulate cellular metabolism and accumulation of CD103<sup>+</sup> DCs and alveolar macrophages in lung. Moreover, while numbers of mTOR-deficient lung CD11b<sup>+</sup> DCs were not changed, they were metabolically reprogrammed to skew allergic inflammation from eosinophilic T helper cell 2 (T<sub>H</sub>2) to neutrophilic T<sub>H</sub>17 polarity. The mechanism for this change was independent of translational control but dependent on inflammatory DCs, which produced interleukin-23 and increased fatty acid oxidation. mTOR therefore mediates metabolic adaptation of APCs in distinct tissues, influencing the immunological character of allergic inflammation.</p>

Macrophage function in tissue repair and remodeling requires IL-4 or IL-13 with apoptotic cells
<p>Tissue repair is a subset of a broad repertoire of interleukin-4 (IL-4)– and IL-13–dependent host responses during helminth infection. Here we show that IL-4 or IL-13 alone was not sufficient, but IL-4 or IL-13 together with apoptotic cells induced the tissue repair program in macrophages. Genetic ablation of sensors of apoptotic cells impaired the proliferation of tissue-resident macrophages and the induction of anti-inflammatory and tissue repair genes in the lungs after helminth infection or in the gut after induction of colitis. By contrast, the recognition of apoptotic cells was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispens</span></strong>able for cytokine-dependent induction of pattern recognition receptor, cell adhesion, or chemotaxis genes in macrophages. Detection of apoptotic cells can therefore spatially compartmentalize or prevent premature or ectopic activity of pleiotropic, soluble cytokines such as IL-4 or IL-13.</p>

Control of meiotic pairing and recombination by chromosomally tethered 26<i>S</i> proteasome
<p>During meiosis, paired homologous chromosomes (homologs) become linked via the synaptonemal complex (SC) and crossovers. Crossovers mediate homolog segregation and arise from self-inflicted double-strand breaks (DSBs). Here, we identified a role for the proteasome, the multisubunit protease that degrades proteins in the nucleus and cytoplasm, in homolog juxtaposition and crossing over. Without proteasome function, homologs failed to pair and instead remained associated with nonhomologous chromosomes. Although <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispens</span></strong>able for noncrossover formation, a functional proteasome was required for a coordinated transition that entails SC assembly between longitudinally organized chromosome axes and stable strand exchange of crossover-designated DSBs. Notably, proteolytic core and regulatory proteasome particles were recruited to chromosomes by Zip3, the ortholog of mammalian E3 ligase RNF212, and SC protein Zip1 . We conclude that proteasome functions along meiotic chromosomes are evolutionarily conserved.</p>

Identification of a New Host Factor Required for Antiviral RNAi and Amplification of Viral siRNAs
<p>Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are processed from virus-specific dsRNA to direct antiviral RNA interference (RNAi) in diverse eukaryotic hosts. We have recently performed a sensitized genetic screen in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and identified two related phospholipid flippases required for antiviral RNAi and the amplification of virus-derived siRNAs by plant RNA-dependent RNA polymerase1 (RDR1) and RDR6. Here we report the identification and cloning of <i>ANTIVIRAL RNAI</i>-<i>DEFECTIVE2</i> (<i>AVI2</i>) from the same genetic screen. <i>AVI2</i> encodes a multispan transmembrane protein broadly conserved in plants and animals with two homologous human proteins known as magnesium transporters. We show that <i>avi2</i> mutant plants display no developmental defects and develop severe disease symptoms after infection with a mutant <i>Cucumber mosaic virus</i> (CMV) defective in RNAi suppression. <i>AVI2</i> is induced by CMV infection, particularly in veins, and is required for antiviral RNAi and RDR6-dependent biogenesis of viral siRNAs. AVI2 is also necessary for Dicer-like2-mediated amplification of 22-nucleotide viral siRNAs induced in <i>dcl4</i> mutant plants by infection, but <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispens</span></strong>able for RDR6-dependent biogenesis of endogenous transacting siRNAs. Further genetic studies illustrate that AVI2 plays a partially redundant role with AVI2H, the most closely related member in the <i>AVI2</i> gene family, in RDR1-dependent biogenesis of viral siRNAs and the endogenous virus-activated siRNAs (vasi-RNAs). Interestingly, we discovered a specific genetic interaction of AVI2 with AVI1 flippase that is critical for plant development. We propose that AVI1 and AVI2 participate in the virus-induced formation of the RDR1/RDR6-specific, membrane-bound RNA synthesis compartment, essential for the biogenesis of highly abundant viral siRNAs and vasi-RNAs.</p>

Vacuolar Trafficking Protein VPS38 Is Dispensable for Autophagy
<p>Phosphatidylinositol 3-P (PI3P) is a signaling molecule that controls a variety of processes in endosomal, autophagic, and vacuolar/lysosomal trafficking in yeasts and mammals. Vacuolar protein sorting 34 (Vps34) is a conserved PI3K present in multiple complexes with specific functions and regulation. In yeast, the PI3K complex II consists of Vps34p, Vps15p, Vps30p/Atg6p, and Vps38p, and is essential for vacuolar protein sorting. Here, we describe the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) homolog of yeast Vps38p and human UV radiation resistance-associated gene protein. Arabidopsis VPS38 interacts with VPS30/ATG6 both in yeast and in planta. Although the level of PI3P in Arabidopsis <i>vps38</i> mutants is similar to that in wild type, <i>vps38</i> cells contain enlarged multivesicular endosomes and fewer organelles enriched in PI3P than the wild type. The <i>vps38</i> mutants are defective in the trafficking of vacuolar cargo and its receptor VACUOLAR SORTING RECEPTOR2;1. The mutants also exhibit abnormal cytoplasmic distributions of endocytic cargo, such as auxin efflux carriers PINFORMED1 (PIN1) and PIN2. Constitutive autophagy is normal in the mutants but starvation-induced autophagy was slightly inhibited. We conclude that Arabidopsis VPS38 is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispens</span></strong>able for autophagy but essential for efficient targeting of biosynthetic and endocytic cargo to the vacuole.</p>

Abscisic Acid Induces Resistance against <i>Bamboo Mosaic Virus</i> through <i>Argonaute</i> <i>2</i> and <i>3</i>
<p>Plant resistance to pathogens is tuned by defense-related hormones. Of these, abscisic acid (ABA) is well documented to moderate resistance against fungi and bacteria. However, ABA’s contribution to resistance against viruses is pleiotropic. ABA affects callose deposition at plasmodesmata (therefore hindering the viral cell-to-cell movement), but here, we show that when callose synthase is down-regulated, ABA still induces resistance against infection with <i>Bamboo mosaic virus</i> (BaMV). By examining the potential connections between the ABA and RNA-silencing pathways in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), we showed that ABA regulates the expression of almost the whole ARGONAUTE (AGO) gene family, of which some are required for plant resistance against BaMV. Our data show that BaMV infection and ABA treatment regulate the same set of AGOs, with positive effects on <i>AGO1</i>, <i>AGO2</i>, and <i>AGO3</i>, no effect on <i>AGO7</i>, and negative effects on <i>AGO4</i> and <i>AGO10</i>. The BaMV-mediated regulation of <i>AGO1</i>, <i>AGO2</i>, and <i>AGO3</i> is ABA dependent, because the accumulation of these <i>AGOs</i> in BaMV-infected ABA mutants did not reach the levels observed in infected wild-type plants. In addition, the <i>AGO1</i>-<i>miR168a</i> complex is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispens</span></strong>able for BaMV resistance, while <i>AGO2</i> and <i>AGO3</i> were important for ABA-mediated resistance. While most <i>ago</i> mutants showed increased susceptibility to BaMV infection (except <i>ago10</i>), <i>ago1-27</i> showed reduced BaMV titers, which was attributed to the up-regulated levels of <i>AGO2</i>, <i>AGO3</i>, and <i>AGO4</i>. We have established that ABA regulates the expression of several members of the AGO family, and this regulation partially contributes to ABA-mediated resistance against BaMV. These findings reveal another role for ABA in plants.</p>
